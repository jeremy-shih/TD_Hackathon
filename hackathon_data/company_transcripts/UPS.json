At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. And after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Scott Childress, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Good morning, and welcome to the UPS second quarter 2017 earnings call. Joining me today are David Abney, our CEO; Richard Peretz, our CFO; along with International President, Jim Barber; President of U.S. Operations, Myron Gray; and Chief Commercial Officer, Alan Gershenhorn.","Before we begin, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements, and address our expectation for the future performance or results of operation of our company. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2016 Form 10-K and 2017 10-Qs. These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The webcast of today's call, along with a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website.","Webcast users can submit live questions during today's call. We will attempt to answer questions of a long-term and strategic nature. Callers are asked to submit only one question so that we may allow as many as possible to participate.","Now I will turn the call over to David.","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Earlier this year we stepped up our pace of investment to accelerate the most sweeping transformation of our network in decades. We are investing heavily in new capacity and connected technology to capture the tremendous e-commerce and international growth opportunities we see. We are creating the next generation UPS smart, global, logistics network, to fuel long-term, profitable growth and enhanced share-owner value. Our performance in the first half of the year strengthens our confidence that we are on the right track. UPS delivered good results in the second quarter, driven by strong revenue and high margins in all three of our reporting segments. We are pleased with this progress.","Our U.S. segment delivered more than 13% operating profit growth as daily shipments accelerated and package yields improved. The International segment continues to produce outstanding results, including robust growth and high margins, even in the face of currency headwinds. And the Supply Chain & Freight group is producing more favorable results as they reposition the business to achieve greater profitability as market conditions improve. As we look forward to the rest of this year, growth in the global economy is expected to increase moderately as the year progresses and UPS is well positioned to reap the benefits.","The latest U.S. GDP forecast for the balance of the year remains unchanged. Industrial production in retail are still growing, although at a slower pace than originally projected. Online purchases, as a percent of retail, grew once again in the latest forecast. Growth rates in Europe are expected to continue to be resilient, with most economies rising. And in Asia, the outlook for China has improved, with growth in that market now exceeding the previous forecast.","The export market remains solid and we are aggressively positioning UPS products and network capability to take full advantage of cross-border expansion. I was recently in Detroit to deliver a keynote address at Gateway 2017, a conference hosted by Alibaba. The event drew about 3,000 participants, mostly from small- and mid-sized American companies interested in exporting to China.","China represents a great market opportunity for U.S. businesses. We are creating special cross-border services to support customers who want to sell to Chinese consumers via e-commerce. These services, along with our recently announced joint venture with SF Express, will enable us to leverage the vast reach of both companies. We have plans to add competitive shipping products in more international lanes as we expand the SF partnership.","In addition to providing trade-enabling solutions, UPS also supports government efforts to further expand trade. We applaud the recent agreement in principle to create the EU and Japan Free Trade Agreement. This is an important step towards developing the kind of open, rules-based trade system our customers need to conduct business across global markets.","UPS will continue to advocate around the globe for trade legislation that enables businesses and consumers alike to shop the world with ease. This also enables businesses to compete on a level playing field.","In addition, we continued to expand our capabilities and presence in international markets in the second quarter. We announced our acquisition of Nightline, the leading small-package company in Ireland, while in May, UPS was proud to be selected as the official logistics partner for Expo 2020 in Dubai. In fact, we've already started to leverage this exclusive partnership to accelerate our growth in the Middle East. These announcements bring the number of partnerships and acquisitions we've entered to 13 over the last few years. Going forward, we will continue to look for creative ways to expand our capabilities, our market presence, and the reach of our network in ways that build long-term value.","This quarter, we also announced significant hub modernization and expansion projects in Arizona and Kansas, and we broke ground on our fourth new regional hub, located in Indiana. The regional hub projects will add more than 4 million square feet of highly-automated capacity, while also creating high-quality jobs for thousands of part-time and full-time UPSers. This new capacity is critical for us to support our customers' growth and deliver the UPS services they demand. Once underway, these new facilities will improve our performance throughout the year and help us to deliver efficiently during peak demand periods.","At the same time, we are also working to ensure that we align our pricing with our cost to serve. Last month, we announced peak-season surcharges and we are addressing the impact with customers as we develop peak shipping forecasts for later this year. These surcharges are necessary to ensure UPS continues to provide customers with the best-in-class value and highly reliable service they've come to expect.","Before I turn it over to Richard, I want to mention that next month UPS will celebrate our 110th year in business. It's incredible how far we've come, from a small bicycle messenger service to the leading global logistics provider. Let me express my thanks for the hard work and dedication of those who came before us, as well as the 434,000 UPSers today whose efforts are contributing to our success.","In summary, we just finished another strong quarter for UPS. And we are moving quickly to build our smart, global logistics network, ensuring continued success into the future.","Now Richard will take you through the details of our results. Richard?","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. Earlier this year, we laid out our 2017 full year plans, as well as our three-year target. At the midpoint of the year, the business is performing as we expected and we are pleased with our progress. Looking closely at the second quarter, total revenue increased 7.7%. Adjusting for currency, top line growth was nearly 9%. The revenue was balanced across all segments with shipment growth throughout the product portfolio. Earnings per share were $1.58, up almost 11% over last year with good, core performance within the segments. In addition, there were several items that positively contributed to the quarter. Most of these were expected.","First, net fuel year-over-year was a benefit. In 2016, fuel prices accelerated through the quarter from April through June. At the time, we had a two-month fuel surcharge revenue delay and were unable to offset the increase in fuel prices. In early February, we adopted a two-week revenue lag. In addition, there were other fuel policy changes that increased the overall revenue-to-expense coverage ratio.","Another positive contribution occurs as a result of lower workers' compensation cost in the second quarter. We've gone to quarterly, rather than semi-annual, outside independent studies to refine our estimates of our workers' compensation liability. Finally, it was a one-time benefit that the Supply Chain & Freight segment received this quarter. Together these three contributed approximately $0.10 per share. The majority of the benefit came from fuel and workers' compensation that we had anticipated.","Now, let's turn to the details of each segment. In the U.S., revenue increased more than 8% due to several factors; volume growth, Easter in the second quarter, and higher fuel surcharges, which added about 120 basis points. Total shipments increased almost 5% with growth accelerating across the products. Deferred Air led the way, up 11%, and Next Day Air was up more than 6%. Ground shipments also increased more than 4%, driven by SurePost and residential deliveries. Strong B2C expansion continued with growth in the low teens. And despite the acceleration of brick-and-mortar store closings, B2B has sequentially improved and moved into positive territory.","Yield management initiatives contributed to revenue-per-package growth of 3% during the quarter. Strong base rates and higher fuel surcharges offset product mix changes. Operating costs were pressured by higher fuel prices. In addition, the cost penalties associated with 20 projects under construction and the deployment of Saturday operations continued in the second quarter, but were offset by the workers' compensation benefits I mentioned earlier.","Operating profit increased 13% to $1.4 billion and margin expanded 60 basis points to 14.3%. The strong shipment growth, combined with the UPS initiatives, contributed to the gains.","Now turning to the International segment, which delivered another quarter of good top line growth, combined with positive operating leverage on a currency-neutral basis. International revenue increased 2.8%. Adjusted for currency, growth was 8.3%. Demand for our unmatched export solutions remained high as shipments were up 12%. Europe continues to lead the way, with mid-teens growth to key trade lanes and intra-Europe. The Asia-to-U.S. trade lane remained strong with double-digit growth again this quarter. Reported operating profit was $583 million down 4.9%. After adjusting for currency, operating profit expanded almost 14% to $697 million. As a reminder, you can review our currency-neutral results on the web schedules.","Now, looking at Supply Chain & Freight, the segment produced another solid quarter of financial results. Revenue was up 12% and reported operating profit improved by 24%. Year-over-year gains in operating profit included a benefit from a legal settlement. When removing the impact of this $20 million one-time item, profit growth was still very strong. All the major supply chain business units contributed to the improvements this quarter. In forwarding, tonnage increased across all three products with International airfreight growth in the mid-teens, and North American air and ocean freight up mid-single digits.","Distribution revenue increased at a low-single-digit pace, as strong growth in retail, aerospace and mail services were mostly offset by declines in the high-tech sector. Operating profit and margin improved over 2016. UPS freight revenue was up 9% on strong LTL tonnage gains of more than 8% as market conditions in U.S. trucking industry continue to recover. Operating profit and margins improved as the business continued to focus on growth from middle-market customers. Through the first two quarters of 2017, we are encouraged by the gains all the business units are making within the Supply Chain & Freight segment.","Now, let's turn to cash flow. UPS ended the quarter with $4.6 billion in cash and marketable securities as the business continued to generate strong returns. We are focusing our capital on building the smart logistics network, creating flexibility through a strong balance sheet and distributing returns to our shareholders. On a year-to-date basis, capital expenditures are $2 billion, putting us on track to lead our CapEx guidance range of 6% to 7% of revenue. In late June, we announced changes to our non-union U.S. pension. This change stabilizes our risk obligation and lowers the liability on our balance sheet. We are moving to a pay-as-you-go, enhanced 401(k)-style plan starting in January 2023. The new plan will be more predictable and sustainable.","Moving to shareholder returns, at this point in the year, we have distributed about $2.3 billion. We have repurchased more than 8.4 million shares for just over $900 million and paid out nearly $1.4 billion in dividends up over 6% per share over the last year.","Now I want to discuss our guidance. Through the first two quarters we've had good performance as we expected. My earlier comments outlined favorable items from the second quarter, including fuel, the change in workers' compensation, and the one-time benefit in Supply Chain & Freight. We expect minimal impact from these items in the second half of the year. Looking forward, our plans are influenced by the previously announced currency headwinds and a few other moving parts.","In the third quarter, considering the combination of currently known and anticipated factors, including one less operating day, earnings per share should be relatively flat when compared to last year. In the second half of the year, our tax rate will be about 35%. Keep in mind, in the fourth quarter of 2016 we had tax benefits of approximately $0.05 per share. This benefit is not expected to repeat in the fourth quarter of 2017, which will weigh on the comparison. In addition to the quarterly items, we continue to monitor both the economic and business trends that impact our business. Externally, we've looked at all the currently available data and our internal plans, and we're confident in reaffirming our 2017 guidance for earnings per share in the range of $5.80 to $6.10, which includes about $400 million in unfavorable currency impact.","At this point in the year, we are right where we expected to be and we are encouraged by the progress across all three segments. The entire enterprise is responding well and making the necessary adjustments to generate solid performance as we execute on our revenue and strategic initiatives. At the same time, we are investing aggressively, implementing Saturday operations, acquiring new capabilities, and buildings partnerships to grow the business. Through the first six months of the year, our proven strategy and operational flexibility has provided the targeted financial results we expected and the company is on track to achieve the goals we laid out earlier this year.","Before I turn it over to the operator, I want to remind you that the webcast users can submit live questions during today's call.","Thank you for your time, and now I'll ask the operator to open the line. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, please ask only one question so that we may accommodate more callers. Feel free to get back into the queue and we will take a second question, time permitting. We will now take our first question from the line of Mr. Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Please go ahead.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. Great. Thank you, and good morning. I wanted to ask on the \u2013 you showed strength, I guess, across the board in volumes; in particular, international export was very good. I wanted to see if you could comment on the drivers of that, and also perhaps the competitive environment. It appears there's some issues with TNT and the cyberattack and so forth. And I guess that didn't affect you in the quarter, but is that something that could potentially be a meaningful opportunity that would boost your export even further? Thank you.","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for the question. This is David. And I'm going to start with the first part about the cyberattack and how it may have affected volume, and \u2013 because there were a lot of parts to that question. But on that, first thing I wanted to say is we obviously don't wish cyberattacks on any company. I mean, these things are criminal acts and I know that we all take them seriously. And from a UPS standpoint, we are regularly investing in updating our technologies to protect, not only our customers, but our employee and company data and also, of course, our service levels because we know how important that can be. So, as far as how that or other things have affected our volume, Jim, I'll turn it over to you.","James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, David. Tom, I guess it's a pretty wide question, but I guess I'll come back to openly the growth drivers as we talked about last quarter. It's very balanced, but this last quarter Europe did have our highest growth rate underpinning the 12% export you referenced. On the back of David's comments, straight up, yes, we are seeing more business recently in Europe, but I also would point you to a couple of key factors here.","First of all, no matter what's going on in any marketplace, customers have choice. And the choices they have in Europe, because of this unfortunate situation, are between us and many other competitors. I think the way we're looking at this is that through the last couple years we've talked about our investments in the network and new products, like our recently announced dangerous goods capabilities, continued expansion of the network, and in those cases, those seem to certainly be resonating and we \u2013 they are choosing UPS. Our job is to serve them going forward and continue to invest in the network as we go. So \u2013 and, certainly, I do want to reinforce what David said. This is not a situation that we would certainly wish on anyone and we know we have a job to do and serve whatever customers are on our network. So appreciate that.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of David Vernon, Bernstein. Please go ahead.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. Richard, can you help us understand where the $0.10 benefit you guys called out sits across the operating segments? And I just want to make sure \u2013 or help there \u2013 if you could even maybe help me understand, if the underlying profit growth in the domestic segment has kind of come back into the positive territory, if you were to adjust for some of this noise, whether it's the $35 million or whatever portion of the $0.10 you want to put into the domestic segment?","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Sure. Actually, a large portion of it is in domestic and there also is in international. If you look back to 2016, David, what you would have seen is that the fuel prices were increasing between 35% and 40% during the quarter. You recall we were still a two-month lag. So, for example, while fuel price per barrel was somewhere in the mid-$40s on average for the second quarter, we were still using February's revenue to create surcharge, and that was $31 a barrel at the time. So it's really about a year-over-year and, actually, I went back and looked and we talked about last year on this same second quarter call that we had some headwinds because of that fuel change. Fortunately, we'd made that adjustment and what happened last year, cost actually kind of got pretty tight the rest of the year. And so, we expected in our plans that we would see a benefit because of the drag last year on that.","On the workers' comp, what's really happened is because we're now doing quarterly studies instead of just twice a year, we've moved some of the benefit that we traditionally see in the third quarter into second quarter. And so, generally speaking, what we're trying to do is marry up with our actual experience in a more meaningful way on a quarter-by-quarter basis. And so we made that method up, that change, because we thought that was more prudent and also to understand how the business was really going.","When you look at the second half of the year, we expect to have a strong second half of the year, good results. We talked about a few of the items that you have to take into consideration, but we feel like when you look at all the data that we've seen, we feel confident that the range that we've given you is something that we're going to deliver when you get to the second half. Thank you.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","But if you think about that $0.10, is it like 70\/30 domestic\/international, like is there any kind of rough line on that?","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","I would say between 70\/30 and 80\/20, somewhere in that range.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Somewhere in that range. Thanks very much.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","We're going to take an international or an online question. And this question comes from Jack Atkins. Jack asks, you know that the double-digit revenue growth at Coyote, is Coyote continuing to hit your expectations for $200 million of increment EBITDA by the end of this year?","Alan Gershenhorn - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Hey. This is Alan. I'm going to take that question. As you know, we were continuing to see strong year-over-year growth. We are growing market share with the service offering that we have in place. The service levels remain consistently high and we're continuing to innovate with technological solutions. The GL market is tightening, but the asset-light model is providing flexibility in the up-and-down cycles. We do have pressure on the contractual committed freight, but we also see opportunities and upside with the backup in spot markets.","The key here is that the connectivity remains a real strength for us, both from a customer value creation and a synergy perspective. Our synergies are on track. We expect to get about $100 million for 2017 and that's coming in the form of procurement, back haul, asset utilization, cross-selling, and organizational synergies. And then, last, I'll just say that the cross selling is really producing several great wins this year and we are targeting the rich opportunities in the UPS customer base, specifically on the small\/medium business side for greater yields. Thanks for the question.","Operator","We have a question from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. It sounds like, clearly, a lot of momentum in B2C domestically. I'm curious with regard to B2B, what kind of trends did you see second quarter, first half? And do you anticipate, assuming that that's been picking up, that perpetuating into the second half and any color you can provide particularly with regard to the retail? Thanks.","Alan Gershenhorn - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Yes. So, this is Alan. I'll take that question. As we noted, the B2B in the second quarter expanded slightly versus last year. So we saw low-single digit growth there and we saw improvement across many industry segments. From a quarter-over-quarter basis, we are back in positive territory so we did see a good sequential jump off the negative results the last couple of quarters.","Our e-commerce customers are driving both B2C and B2B shipments higher. Returns growth continues to be strong. And then on the Air side, you saw our Air growth was really the story this quarter with Next Day Air growing at 6.4% and Deferred growing at 11%. So we are seeing good growth there also. Thanks for the question.","Operator","Chris Wetherbee, Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey. Great. Thanks for taking the call. I guess I want to talk a little about the second half of the year. So, as I'm listening to sort of the outlook and guidance that you have there, the third quarter is flat I think on an EPS basis. Midpoint suggests a little bit down in the fourth quarter but, I know you have tax dynamics playing out there but with the peak season surcharges and some of the momentum from a top-line perspective, I guess, I just would have thought it would have been a little bit higher than that. So I was just wondering if you could help us a little bit to sort of understand maybe top line dynamics as well as some of the cost assumptions embedded particularly around the peak season in that second half outlook?","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Sure, this is Richard and I think that to start with, Chris, what you said is right. When you look at the first half of the year, we're right on plan. The U.S. business is adapting well. International continues to, as Jim mentioned, to have good growth, and supply chain is recovering. As we looked, though, at the current data, what we also noticed is although we are seeing some positive trends in many of the different industry types in B2B, we're a little challenged because the number of stores that are closing is having an impact on growth in the B2B. And so the forecast for B2B, if you go back earlier in the year to today, is not quite as strong because of retail sales and also because industrial production forecasts were higher even three months ago to where they are today.","So we took that information and we looked at that against also some of the items that we called out that won't repeat in the second half of the year and we put it all together and we just didn't see enough new data that would suggest at this time we should adjust guidance. Obviously, as in the past, if more information comes in and it's appropriate to suggest a change, we would communicate it appropriately. But, at this point, based on \u2013 we're adjusting to how the volume and the customer demand is changing and we feel comfortable with where we're at.","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Richard did a good job explaining the puts and takes for the fourth quarter. And I just want to make it very clear, as Richard and our team knows, we expect to have a very good fourth-quarter from a service standpoint and we expect to have good financial results. And we have been working on that throughout the year. So a lot of confidence there. Okay. Next question, please.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","We're going to take an online question. We've got a few questions regarding one of the joint ventures that we're recently forming. So the question is, can you speak about the recent announcement, the joint venture with SF and when do you expect the transaction to close?","James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.","So, this is Jim. I'll pick it up. A couple of things to note here. I start with some comments David made in his opening talk about this term of partnerships. When we announced our emerging market strategy a couple of years ago, we firmly founded pieces of that on expanded partnerships across the globe. This relationship with SF Express in China really does fit firmly into that. If you know much about the company, its headquarters are founded in the same province that we have our Air hub in Southern China in Guangdong. They have been in business since 1993. Arguably, they're the domestic leader in the B2B and B2C space. They combine with our brand and our International export capabilities in China and it was one of those markets that we all have to evaluate and make strategic moves.","We're super excited about it. We are waiting for the final regulatory approvals to come through but when it does, we believe it opens up segments of the market that we are better off to partner with SF and the leadership than go it alone and hence the JV announcement and we look forward to the regulatory approval and then talking more about that in the quarters and years to come.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Ken Hoexter, Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch (US)","Great. Good morning. Richard, that was great insight on the outlook for the volume side. Maybe you could talk a little bit more about pricing. We saw a big ramp in the ground pricing and maybe you could talk a bit about the surcharges coming up for peak season. Is that kind of automatic for every customer? Are there still contract customers you have to go renegotiate with? Maybe you can just talk about that given the ramp up we're seeing on the pricing as we head into the back half of the year.","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","As bad as Richard wants to answer that question, I think we're going to let Alan do it because that's really more Alan's focus area. So, Alan?","Alan Gershenhorn - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Thanks, David. Yes, as you noted, the base pricing did come in at the higher end of our 2% to 3% range. That both happened in U.S. and International, when you look at International currency neutral.","So certainly the GRI, the Dim weight, the additional handling and then our ongoing focus on contract management is paying off. Specifically, to peak, as you know, the peak season surcharge is really designed to compensate for the additional cost that we incur during peak with the volume increases, the temporary capacity enhancements that we need to meet the service levels that David talked about a bit earlier.","And while these rate increases, even for a short time, are rarely welcome, our customers really understand and appreciate the value of our network, what we do to provide the service and the capacity for them at peak and year around as well as the cost of doubling of the network. The peak surcharge just \u2013 a few details here. The surcharge is designed to hit the most impacted weeks where we surge in both residential and large packages. And so, for Ground, it's three weeks of the five weeks of peak and for Air, it's only one week, the last week, and then for large package it's five. And our expectations are to have high compliance with the peak season surcharge.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch (US)","Great. Thank you. Just on the last question, is it on \u2013 do you have to renegotiate with each contract or is this something you're allowed to by contract add-ins?","Alan Gershenhorn - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Yeah. This is a published surcharge that affects the tariff. Thanks.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch (US)","Thank you very much.","Operator","Ben Hartford, Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, good morning, guys. A question for Jim. Jim, you touched on this earlier sort of the International Air Freight capacity dynamics. I'm curious where you think the industry is in kind of in the context of the broader cycle. We've had several years of excess capacity in that globally on the Air Freight side. It seems as though it's tightened up. Load factors have improved. There are some anecdotes of some forwarders putting charter capacity into the market as well. So where do you think we are cyclically as it relates to industry Air Freight supply\/demand? Has that helped International parcel yields at all and what are your second half peak expectations from an Air Freight point of view? Thanks.","James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Let me focus on the first question, I guess, on the capacity because there were a couple of them in there certainly. I think we're in a very unique position right now. It started about three quarters ago when some of the air capacity was taken out of the network. A lot of it came out of Shanghai, but certainly it moved south into Southern China and into Hong Kong.","Usually, at this time of the year, you see a slack time in the Air Freight market. In fact, we haven't seen a slack. We've seen demand continue to roar. That's being affected in the buy-sell spreads and we're managing through that like everyone is in the market. The capacity issues as well are over on the express side of the business. The demand is high.","David referenced some of that as well with the economy. So the Chinese engine over there is certainly going. You know, we've got some 747-8s on order. They're coming soon. They can't get here soon enough because our customers continue to choose the products and services.","But back to the Air Freight, it is very unique. I think the next couple quarters leading up to peak will be very different from potentially some of the past. We're here very early and we've got to manage through that and then, of course, you've got the other options below in the ocean freight situation as well. So it is unique market and I believe we are managing through it very well. You can see that in some of the results and we look forward to continuing the ability to adapt to conditions as they come at us. So thanks for the question.","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Jim mentioned those additional 747-8s and they will be on the truck routes, especially going from Asia into the U.S. And then next year, of course, we have additional aircraft 76s and some more Dash 8s and, again, our timing couldn't have been any better. So it's going to fit right into the needs of our customers. Okay?","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","We're going to online question. This question comes in. Can you please tell us how the news of the pension changes that you've announced will affect your go-forward long-term basis and how it changes your view of retirement benefits?","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Sir, and I'll take that. This is Richard. I think the first thing that I want to say is that we spent a lot of time, actually several years, evaluating different options to look at how do we manage the liability, remain competitive in the market from a benefit standpoint, and as we announced just over a month ago, we're moving to a pay-as-you-go 401k plan effective January of 2023. It will change our risk profile. It will allow us to have more predictable and sustainable costs. It does reduce our future liabilities on the current balance sheet. And we'll also lower our exposure to the discount rates. As discount rates change, we see both expense change on pension as well as the liability side, as well as the change that PBGC has made with increasing costs that we're having to put into the plan, but it doesn't go to the employees.","For 2017, there is no change to the guidance because we have spent a few years on this and we knew we were making this announcement in June. There is no additional discretionary contributions to pension, and the reason there isn't is because we made them in the first quarter, as I talked about on the last call. That was because of the PBGC premiums and taking advantage. Now, upon announcement, we did have to remeasure the liabilities, and what we saw was discount rates were down about 32 basis points from the end of the year to the end of June. At the same time, because the equity markets have been stronger, we did see some offset from the higher return.","Finally, when I put all of this together, it's really hard to talk about what it's going to do in future years because until you know what discount rates are doing, you don't really have an impact on your financials five years out. But what I can tell you is we spent a lot of time trying to balance what is right for our employees \u2013 most of them spend their careers at UPS, as well as managing the risk profile and the liabilities for UPS as a whole. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will be from Brian Ossenbeck of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. So, as you mentioned, since November of last year, the company has announced a lot of facility expansions totaling over $1.5 billion in the U.S., additions and expansions rather. So if you could just give us a sense what the total investment required for the hub modernization program is? And how that fits into the context of your Capital Expenditure run rate this year and perhaps into next year?","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","So, actually, a lot of these buildings are over multiple periods. And what we talked about in the investor conference is over the next three to five years, there would be somewhere around \u2013 between 28 million square feet that and 35 million square feet that would go in over the three to five-year period. And then talk David had this morning, he talked about we've announced almost 4.5 million square feet in 2017. Over the last year and a half, we've actually announced about 7.5 million square feet that's currently under construction, and just about 5.5 million square feet will open in 2018.","Overall, it is in the guidance of the increase to 6% to 7% per CapEx of revenue, and that's really because you saw now for the last four quarters in the U.S., we've been having close to 5% or greater revenue growth. We need these buildings in order to continue to grow. These growth rates are higher than our historical average and we talked in the investor conference about the importance of growth and, at the same time, with our high return on invested capital, these assets will continue to allow us to nurture not only the ROIC, but also grow the top line and bottom line. So we're on a path for the next three to five years. It's something we laid out at the investor conference and we are looking forward to that 5.5 million square feet opening next year.","Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey. Thanks. Morning, guys. So, Richard, wanted to just ask you on currency, how come no change in the currency headwinds just given the recent move in the dollar? And then, if there is no impact or no change this year, maybe, I know it is early, but can you give a preliminary view on what kind of potential tailwind we could see from currency next year? Thank you.","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Sure. So actually, just to step back for a moment, in 2017, we went to a \u2013 we were, historically, before 2017, used a collar approach and it was a stock market transaction. What we did in 2017 is to do a transition because starting in 2018 we'll go to a dollar cost averaging where we're spreading it over a 36-month period. What that means is the year-over-year comparisons won't have big variations. But what it means for 2017 is that we do have a collar. The increase over the last, probably few weeks, where the dollar has lost between 6% and 8% of the value is inside the collar. So for the hedge currencies, what that means is it's going to be right where we expected it to be, and for the unhedged, you'll have a slight difference in the overall.","Now, if you recall, we called out during the first quarter, we had about $119 million drag from currency. This quarter, $114 million. Until the quarter closes, and each month closes, I won't know what the drag is and how much it changes because the most recent changes will impact July, and then whatever happens is going into August and September. But because we give you that new schedule in our web schedules, that will allow you to see. And as it comes down, we'll obviously communicate that, but right now, we're sitting at about $117 million this morning. And that's right in the collar range that we had already set out. But with the new program, the most important part is we won't see this year after year starting in 2018. And it's also important to remember when you look at the International business, we have an 18.4% margin even with the drag from currency, so we continue to have industry-leading margins because all the work Jim and his team is doing in growing the business and growing exports.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","So just so I'm clear, don't count on a currency tailwind next year?","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","That's correct. And when we evolve to this new weighted average, we actually had explained that by doing that we would remove \u2013 that because what happens is for basically two-thirds of the comparison period, it's the same currency year-over-year. It's only the head and the tail that will be different from the timing standpoint.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Kevin Sterling, Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.","Kevin Sterling - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. I noticed there's been a lot of talk about the International Air export market, but maybe I could drill down a little bit in your Next Day Air growth. That was very nice at 6.4%, and we've not seen that type of growth for the past couple of years in Next Day Air because I can remember seeing the shift past couple of years from premium products to Deferred products. But now it appears that Next Day Air is back in vogue. Why is this? Is it the Amazon effect, with supply chains just speeding up and everybody looking to catch up? And do you think we will continue to see is this growth in Next Day Air?","Alan Gershenhorn - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Yes. So, this is Alan. I'll take that. Yes, so as you know, we saw premium Next Day Air revenue grew at over 7% and Deferred grew at about 13.5%. There's a couple of things going on there. First, our customers are really responding and enjoying our continual expansion of the Next Day Air and Next Day Air's early service to more postal codes to anybody else out there in the market. And so our market leadership in Express and premium Next Day Air supports our healthcare, high-tech, and professional services segment customers, and strategies.","In fact, now, and for the last few quarters, UPS is the air market volume leader.","On the other hand, the Next Day Saver, the UPS Ground, Deferred Air are focused to support our e-commerce and retail customers, and so when you look at our air products and how we have them positioned, along with the integrated portfolio with the ground, we have the industry segments that need that premium service identified and we are making some real gains there. And then we're also addressing the opportunity for the Next Day and Deferred Air opportunities for the e-commerce type of customers. So thanks for the question.","Kevin Sterling - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Thank you.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","We're going to take an online question. This comes from Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley. Can you talk about how Marken has evolved within UPS? How do you see the opportunity to grow supply chain and fulfillment with the growth of e-commerce and omni-channel?","Alan Gershenhorn - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Yes. This is Alan. I'll take the first part on Marken and this really kind of falls back in with the last question in terms of the premium air service, because Marken is the premium service when it comes to being able to handle clinical trials. If you folks remember back in February at the last investor conference, we discussed healthcare being one of the three growth verticals that we're targeting and it represents about $70 billion in global opportunity. And certainly, the acquisition of Marken plays right into that. They're the market leader in clinical trials and we couldn't be happier.","They are enabling our healthcare vertical to immediately deepen and expand our global clinical trials logistics footprint. They're retaining independent operating status. We're seeing excellent growth in connectivity already. UPS and Marken together now are the only clinical trial logistics provider with the hybrid model that's leveraging UPS's world-class Express services and the other valuable parts to the UPS network like brokerage along with Marken's outstanding high service network. We see significant opportunities with cross-selling. Also some bridging over to the commercial side with hospital, labs, and CRO opportunities. So it's really working. And I'll pass it over to Jim for the second part of the question on distribution.","James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. So on the distribution piece, I'd say, open with, I think we definitely keep \u2013 continue to lean into healthcare distribution. Certainly, it still is our largest segment now. Continuing in distribution, we are up to 78 facilities across the globe. We opened two new facilities in the previous quarter. So certainly that continues to be a very targeted vertical for us. Marken continues to align to that. Certainly there is a piece of their business that is inside the box as we say, but it also aligns very nicely to our emerging market strategies. It moves across the world. And the clinical trials model synergizes with many of the initiatives that we have. And of course, we also brought on some key leadership in Wes and his team. So, we like the Marken acquisition inside UPS as well as distribution.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. Thanks so much for taking my question. Appreciate it. So, I had a quick one just on how changes in lease accounting rules will impact the P&L and then on the CapEx just a follow-up, the current increase in investment, just trying to understand what that assumes for growth in B2C volumes. I'm not sure if you look at it this way, but just given e-commerce growth is accelerating and really accelerating off a higher base, the key question for me is, whether you think the current run rate of investment is appropriately sized for that growth or just how you think about the relationship between the two. Thanks very much.","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Sure. So, I'll start with the lease accounting and tell you that we are in the process, it's a 2019 implementation of preparing all of the leases that will have to be put on to the balance sheet according to the new accounting standard. Step back for a moment though and those kind of leases for UPS, while they'll be large because we are a large company, aren't large categories. For example, we're an integrator that owns our aircraft and we own an aircraft within our company. So when you see deposits, for example, we put those into the CapEx early because that's \u2013 we are putting in the deposits before we take ownership. There are other companies around the world that don't always own their planes or they're off balance sheet so they have a different preparation than we would have.","That being said, it's a tremendous effort that we are going through and at the appropriate time when it's all put together, but like I said, we have more than a year-and-a-half till we get there. In terms of the capital, if you go back to our investor conference presentations, we did talk about the growth rate and as I mentioned, the last four quarters in the U.S. have grown almost 5% or more, which is above our historical norm on revenue.","And you'll see that we continue to believe that what we're doing from an investment side is helping to support a flexible network ability to do more capacity and it's all part of the smart logistics network that we're creating and so we feel very comfortable with the 7.5 million square feet that we have under construction and the announcement that somewhere between 28 million and 35 million square feet will be completed, that we're building this really for the tremendous opportunity of e-commerce and how that's moving, shopping, from physical stores to online.","Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's it. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.","Operator","Allison Landry, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Thanks for getting my question in. I guess sort of piggybacking on the last question, you've obviously talked about what you're currently seeing in B2B in relation to the brick-and-mortar closures, but if you really think longer-term about this trend and there's expectations out there for at least another 25% of retail locations to close over the next decade or possibly sooner. So, I wanted to ask how much of your B2B business is still replenishment? What do you think the impacts will be on your network as this trend accelerates and whether it might necessitate any incremental capital spending over the next few years? Thanks.","Alan Gershenhorn - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Yeah. So we are the B2B market leader in the U.S. and our B2B customer base is spread across many, many industries. The industrial manufacturing, automotive, healthcare, high-tech, professional services and then also retail. Now the \u2013 now while retail stores closing is also a drag, we're also seeing with some of our more successful retailers ship to store where they're blending through an Omnichannel way their B2B and their B2C and encouraging their customers in fact, incenting them to pick their goods up in the stores which is driving actually more small package to those particular stores than in the past as compared to other shipments like truckload and LTL. And with that I'll pass the second part of the question over to Rich.","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Sure. So, if you \u2013 Allison, if you think about some of the things we laid out at the investor conference around the faster growth but also the solutions, things like that network planning tool, is really about the ability to adjust because one of the challenges in this online environment is understanding distribution patterns because they're not based on historical. Some years you have heavier buyers in one part of the country than another. So the network planning tool allows us to make the adjustments in real time. You think about what we're doing with Orion and the automation in the buildings, but when you look across the entire portfolio of CapEx, we're really building a network that's going to allow us to grow in a substantial way over the next three years to five years.","And then on top of that, between synthetic density, Access Points, My Choice, all of those are about helping the transaction to be completed for the end user in a way that's convenient and gives them some choice in how they receive their package. So we feel like we've laid out a good roadmap. We feel like we're taking into account the structural shift from physical stores and we're going through the process, as I said, a moment ago, and building those buildings that we need to make this all work as online continues to grow faster. We're going to take...","Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Take it.","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Sorry, Allison.","Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","No, go ahead.","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","We're going to take an online question real quick. It's going from Brian Ossenbeck from JPMorgan. How has the initial roll out of Saturday delivery been received by shippers and UPS drivers?","Myron A. Gray - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Good morning. This is Myron. While we're early in our deployment, the response from our customers had been very positive. As you will recall, our Saturday operations are both pickup and delivery, which has helped to speed up time in transit and is giving our customers a great opportunity to have Saturday pickups that are delivered on Monday and has proven to be a tremendous market advantage. We deployed over 35 major metros in the quarter on the way to implementing over 4,700 cities in 2017. So, results are positive. The implementations have gone well and our employees are responding very well to this offering.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Jeff Kaufman with Aegis Capital. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Kaufman - Aegis Capital Corp.","Thank you very much. Hi, guys. Lot of my questions have been answered at this point, so let me ask more of a detailed one. You're on track to spend almost $2 billion in share repurchase this year, yet shares outstanding haven't really moved in the last six months. Should I think of $1.8 billion to $2 billion as just an anti-dilutive share repurchase level required? Or is there something else going on that's inflating the share count, so that's why I'm not optically seeing shares decline?","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Yeah, so Jeff, this is Richard. And, very specifically, shares do decline. You have different periods when you're increasing your shares for their compensation plans versus the even buying back. But there is a decline this year in shares of 4 million to 5 million shares. And remember, it's an average that you use in your calculations, not where you are at the spot when it occurs.","Jeffrey Kaufman - Aegis Capital Corp.","Okay. Very good. That's my question.

Joining me today are David Abney, our CEO; Richard Peretz, our CFO along with International President, Jim Barber; President of U.S. Operations, Myron Gray; and Chief Commercial Officer, Alan Gershenhorn. Also joining us today is Kate Gutmann, our Chief Sales and Solutions Officer.","Before we begin, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we\u2019ll make today are forward-looking statements and address our expectation for the future performance or results of operation of our Company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2016 Form 10-K and 2017 10-Qs. These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the Securities and Exchange Commission.","During the quarter, UPS recorded a non-cash after-tax mark-to-market pension charge of $607 million. The charge resulted from lower discount rates and was partially offset by higher asset returns. Also, in the quarter as a result of tax legislation in 2017, we recorded a one-time income tax benefit of $258 million.","In the prior year period, UPS recorded a non-cash after-tax mark-to-market pension charge of $1.7 billion. The charge resulted from lower discount rates somewhat offset by asset returns. More details on the mark-to-market accounting are available in a presentation on the UPS Investor Relations website.","GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter 2017 was $1.27. Excluding the impact of mark-to-market pension charges and the one-time tax benefit, adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $1.67, while fourth quarter 2016 GAAP diluted earnings per share was a loss of $0.27 and adjusted earnings per share was $1.63.","Unless stated otherwise, discussions today will refer to adjusted results.

Callers are asked to submit only one question, so that we may allow as many as possible to participate.","Now, I will turn the call over to David.","David Abney","Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone.","In 2017, UPS made significant progress on our strategic initiatives, expanding our capabilities, implementing new technology, and further penetrating high-growth markets. The successful execution of our growth strategies was apparent in the strong revenue gains made across all segments of the business.","In the fourth quarter, we produced one of the highest revenue growth rates of the last decade. Revenue grew by more than 11% to nearly $19 billion and we generated healthy returns on capital investments. The International and Supply Chain and Freight segments exceeded our expectations. They\u2019re well-positioned, as favorable market conditions and strong execution, are driving their results.","The International segment generated their 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in operating profit. The Supply Chain and Freight business delivered over 20% revenue growth and expanded operating profit more than 50%. Demand in our U.S. segment reached record levels with revenue up more than 8% during the quarter. However, headwinds from capacity constraints due to cyber-period volume surges weighed on our results. Following my remarks, U.S. Operations President, Myron Gray and International President, Jim Barber will provide additional comments.","I just returned from the World Economic Forum in Davos. I left more optimistic about the global economy and the opportunities that exist. Given the favorable economic outlook and the momentum we\u2019ve carried over from 2017, we expect demand for our services to be robust throughout 2018. To support this growth, we\u2019re bringing our largest network expansion in recent history, online this year.","Another reason for optimism is the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which is already producing economic growth and improving U.S. competitiveness around the world. We applaud Congress and the President for taking bold action to boost the U.S. economy. The savings we\u2019re realizing from tax reform will enable us to unlock significant resources across the organization.","UPS will increase investments in our people, technology, fleets, facilities, and our portfolio. This will generate more value for our customers, more opportunities for our people, and greater returns for our shareowners. The growth in ecommerce, cross-border trade, and the needs of our customers for specialized services are creating unprecedented demand for our domestic and international air services.","Given the benefits from the tax act and our tremendous growth opportunities, we\u2019re announcing the purchase of 14 additional 747-8 aircraft and four new Boeing 767 Freighters. While we are investing and transforming our global network, we have also expanded the scope of transformation at UPS. Our team is rapidly moving through the evaluation stage and identifying additional multiyear, value-creating opportunities. We look forward to sharing more information with you later this year.","Looking at global market conditions, the healthy mixture of consumer spending, manufacturing activity, and business investment should lead to a strong 2018. In the U.S., economists have raised their views of 2018 GDP growth by 50 basis points above last year and now expect industrial production growth above 3%. Outside the U.S., growth is expected to remain elevated in 2018, driven by the increased pace of global trade. I am encouraged by the progress we are making on our strategic initiatives and by the direction of the global economy.","Before I turn it over to Myron, I\u2019d like to recognize two management changes. First, I want to welcome Scott Price to the UPS team. He is leading our new enterprise-wide transformation initiatives and heads our corporate strategy team. He brings broad experience in international trade, retail and the logistics industry. I also want to wish Alan Gershenhorn the very best in retirement. Alan has made an enduring impact on UPS for the past 38 years. He helped us grow from a $3 billion small package business to a more than $65 billion global leader. Alan, thanks for your many contributions. I also want to personally thank the 435,000 UPSers around the world, for their extraordinary determination, efforts and achievements throughout 2017.","Myron?","Myron Gray","Thanks and good morning.","UPS had record volume levels during peak, demonstrating continued strong demand for our services. We made 762 million deliveries worldwide, which was 7% more than last year and 12 million more than our initial plan. In fact, we delivered more than 30 million packages on 90% of the days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. By comparison, just two years ago, only 20% of peak days were over 30 million.","While growth was strong, variability of digital demand created challenges during the peak period, as volume accelerated above our projections. In fact, in the U.S. online orders created during the record settings Cyber Weekend resulted in nearly 20% more package volume than last year. Coming out of the weekend, volume growth continued to be strong. The early surge pushed our U.S. network above its maximum capacity. The added cost increased operating expense by about $125 million. We recovered well after managing this initial surge with improvements in a broad range of measures including cost per unit and on-time service.","Our strategies and investments are focused on operating our network with the higher degree of real-time flexibility. Using the latest technology, we\u2019re optimistic about the future. As we move quickly to bring new capabilities online and adapt UPS operations. Our actions will strengthen the operational leverage that generates long-term value for investors.","This year, you will see a significant shift in technology-enabled volume processing with the phase-in of much more highly automated capacity. Worldwide, we expect to open 18 new retrofit faculties in 2018. This includes three major U.S. ground hubs, the first major ground hubs we\u2019ve added in more than two decades. The overwhelming majority of these facilities will be here in the U.S. and key geographies that were constrained during peak. In total, these new permanent facilities will add more than 5 million square feet of flexible, technology-driven capabilities.","In 2018, we\u2019re adding 6 times more sorting capacity and 3 times as many car positions as we added last year. Additionally, we\u2019re enhancing the efficiency of our air network in 2018, adding nine incremental aircraft to the UPS fleet including six 747-8 and three converted 767s. Also in the air network, we\u2019re upgrading our regional air hubs to greatly enhance throughput efficiency. These hubs will help Worldport better manage weather and spread peak volume surges to more locations.","In 2018, customers will get more Saturday options at UPS and will reach a total of 5,800 cities and towns, when the rollout is complete later this year. In the area of enhanced technology, we have several key initiatives coming online. We\u2019re implementing the next generation release of UPS network planning tools and starting the initial rollout of dynamic ORION technology in 2018.","We are also expanding our virtual assistant and help center technologies to improve accuracy, while also streamlining customer support. Mobile technology will expand with Dynamic Sort and new delivery applications, and we are implementing smart trailer technology across 100% of our fleet, which supports digital, real-time location and greatly improves utilization. All of these tools will enable our facilities and our network to more efficiently manage package flow and growth. Additionally, we are focused on other actions to help manage fields and to ensure our pricing is aligned with our cost to serve.","I am encouraged by what stands before us, the vast growth opportunities and network enhancements that enables UPS to fulfill the high demand for our services. UPS operates a global logistics network, connecting the world.","And now, Jim will share his comments on our International businesses. Jim?","Jim Barber","Thanks, Myron, and good morning.","As David mentioned earlier, the International segment and the Supply Chain and Freight segment generated excellent top and bottom line results during the fourth quarter. Our international value preposition is to offer powerful global network and portfolio that connects buyers and sellers through seamless cross-border movements at the right time and price for their needs. This positions us to benefit from strong year-end demand typical of peak season. In fact, this year reflects our capacity during peak to deliver about 35% to 40% more volume versus our average daily levels.","As a result of our team\u2019s strong execution, the International segment generated revenue growth of nearly 13% in the fourth quarter with balanced growth across all markets. Operating profit increased 19% on a currency neutral basis, our 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit gains. These results are really the outcome of work begun four years ago.","In Europe, the $2 billion investment cycle is allowing to reach the increased network speed and capacity. In the fourth quarter, Pan European exports increased more than 20%. This year, we will have even more capability for growth, as we open new hubs in Paris, London, and in Netherlands. In Asia, we are driving greater market access and capability expansion in China, and other markets. We\u2019ve built the customer base to fill the new air capacity coming online, from the new 747-8 freighters. We are serving key lanes, leveraging our Shenzhen air hub for access into and out of the region with high utilization rates.","In 2015, the Supply Chain and Freight segment rebuilt our foundation for success by strengthening cost management, aligning with customers who committed to grow with us, and positioning the business for the overall market rebound. On these pillars, the global forwarding and distribution units delivered an impressive fourth quarter with revenue up more than 25%, while both approaching double-digit margins. Like the International segment, this group also built a series of improved quarterly performances through 2017.","While the power of our network, portfolio and people are largely responsible for our results, we know that to stay on the path for profitable growth we also need to expand our relationships and capabilities. We completed four strategic acquisitions and into new alliances during 2017 that are providing new solutions and connectivity for customers worldwide.","First, we established a joint venture with SF Express, the leading logistics provider in China. Together, we are leveraging our complementary networks. And we\u2019ve launched a great lower cost international solution that\u2019s gaining strong customer acceptance.","UPS was also selected as the official logistics partner for Expo 2020 Dubai. We\u2019ve already expanded our network to support our growing customer base in the Middle East, including a new direct flight between Dubai and Worldport.","The Company made great regional and local market capability acquisitions in Europe with Freightex and Nightline Logistics. These deals brought local knowledge and market savvy, plus gave us access to a broader customer base. Integration is going according to plan and these units are already making solid contributions to the business.","In summary, our International business is operating in an opportunity-rich market populated by cross-border commerce. I\u2019m very optimistic about our prospects for continued strong top and bottom-line contributions to UPS\u2019s overall business.","Thanks. And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Richard.","Richard Peretz","Thanks, Jim.","During the fourth quarter, UPS produced outstanding revenue growth of over 11%. Top-line gains were balanced across all business segments. Earnings per share came in at $1.67 and full year EPS was $6.01 despite an almost $0.30 headwind from currency.","As you heard, significant network enhancements are forthcoming. We\u2019re executing well on our growth strategies. And the scope of transformation has expanded. The new tax reforms recently passed provide UPS with unique opportunities, and the economic outlook is calling for synchronized global growth, all good things for our business.","Now, turning to the segments in the quarter. In the U.S., revenue increased $922 million or 8.4%. Ground and Deferred Air revenue were up over 9%. Volume growth was up 5.4%, nearly all industry sectors grew. Average daily ground shipments improved by 5.7% and Next Day Air was up almost 5%. Product yields were strong as total revenue per piece increased nearly 3%. These rates were above our target range of 2% to 3% and help offset product and customer mix. The segment was affected by operating costs associated with known projects yet to come on line by about $60 million.","As David and Myron have discussed, cost around the cyber-period was above our expectations in the quarter. We estimate the impact of the additional expense to be about $125 million. Domestic operating profit was slightly below $1.3 billion for the quarter.","Now, looking at the International segment, which produced outstanding results with revenue growth of almost 13% on continued strong export shipments, the segment overachieved on our financial targets. International revenue for package increased 4.2% as yield initiatives drove strong base rate. Premium products grew faster than non-premium as they have done all year. The segment\u2019s operating profit was $760 million, up 7.6%. Adjusting for currency, profit increased almost 19%.","Let\u2019s turn to Supply Chain and Freight. Total revenue increased 21% with gains across all business units. The operating profit was up more than 50% to $270 million, the highest ever for the segment. And operating margins expanded just 8.3%. Forwarding and distribution revenue increased more than 25% to $2.3 billion.","UPS Freight revenue climbed 11% on higher shipments, solid tonnage growth and disciplined pricing strategies. The unit\u2019s focus on profitable middle market growth contributed solid operating profit gains and margin expansion. Prior investments and active strategies in the Supply Chain and Freight as well as the International segment produced outstanding returns. We expect similar results in the U.S. Domestic segment, as the investments go live and we implement key growth and pricing strategies.","Now, let\u2019s turn to the balance sheet. In 2017, we used our strong cash flow, to reward shareowners, and took opportunistic action to lower risks. First, the Company paid a growing dividend to $2.9 billion and repurchased more than 16 million shares for about $1.8 billion. And second, we significantly lowered our long-term pension risk and planned redesign early in 2017. And at the end of the year, we made a tax efficient contribution to the pensions of $5 billion as a result of the new tax legislation.","The funding allows us to optimize the tax benefit, lower ongoing expense, and further unlock cash flow, moving forward. The Company made capital expenditures in 2017 of $5.2 billion to advance our strategic investments. And it positions UPS to capitalize on the additional growth opportunities before us.","Now, I\u2019ll turn to our guidance. Overall, the positive economic outlook and the benefits from tax reform will push our EPS guidance for 2018 above our long-term target. The full benefits of these tailwinds will be dampened by lower discount rates, the timing of projects coming on line and using some of the tax benefits strategically in the second half of the year, also the effect of the new transformation initiatives are not included in our guidance.","Moving to the segments. In U.S., we expect revenue growth of 5% to 6%. Operating profit will include a drag of approximately $200 million, resulting from lower pension discount rates. Additionally, incremental upfront operating penalties associated with opening new buildings and the expansion of Saturday operations will be an additional $50 million. The timing of projects and go-live open dates will create larger drags in the first and second quarter. ","Turning to the International segment. We are planning outstanding year of industry-leading financial results with revenue and operating profits at the high end of our targeted range. Revenue growth should be between 7% and 9%; operating profit is projected to grow between 10% and 12%. And in the Supply Chain and Freight segment, we anticipate the current momentum to continue with topline improvements of 6% to 8% and operating profit growth of 10% to 12%. With contribution from all the business units, we expect another year of outstanding results in this segment.","At the total Company level, let me begin by talking about the recent tax change. These changes have a material impact on UPS\u2019s net income and cash flow, given our prior 35% tax rate. A number of detailed regulations are still being finalized. We will continue to monitor and update our expected rates as needed. Currently, we estimate our 2018 tax rate to be between 23% and 24%, and the first quarter to be about 200 basis points lower, due to the stock compensation accounting. Further, we expect to use around 20% of the benefit from tax reform to fund strategic initiatives in the second half of the year to enhance the value of our business for our customers, employees and shareowners.","Ultimately, the net impact of the tax benefits to EPS is expected to be between $0.80 and $0.85. Our capital priorities remain the same. First, as a result to the new tax laws and our growth outlook, we\u2019re moving up our capital investment level. In 2018, it will be between $6.5 billion and $7 billion. These levels assure we have significant improvements in our global network over the next several years, all while maintaining our industry best return on invested capital of between 23% and 28%.","Second, we plan to reward shareowners with another year of growth in dividends, subject to Board approval and we\u2019re planning share buybacks of approximately $1 billion in 2018. Overall, Company performance will be strong. As a result, we are forecasting adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $7.03 to $7.37, which includes additional expense for pension, Saturday expansion and start-up costs of new automated facilities as well as the strategic investments we\u2019ll make in the second half of 2018.","As we look at the quarters, we anticipate the first quarter EPS growth to be between 15% and 18% as U.S. Domestic expands Saturday operations and increases expense for other projects. EPS growth rate will accelerate in the second and third quarters as project benefits increase. This year, there are two new accounting changes that will be implemented. Overall, these changes do not impact earnings per share growth. However, they will affect the segment results. We will provide you with additional detail and recast prior periods to reflect the adoption of the new accounting standards throughout 2018.","Our current investment cycle is similar to other periods in our history where we invested to build in airline, a global business model and our supply chain capability. The initial short-term costs are soon replaced by long-term shareowner value. The multiyear strategy we laid out is in motion. UPS is in the right growth markets. Our solutions are resonating with our customers around the world and the opportunities before us are vast.","Thank you. And now, I\u2019ll ask the operator to open the line. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Please ask only one question, so that we may accommodate more callers. Feel free to get back into the queue and we will take a second question, time permitting. Our first question\u2026","Scott Childress","I\u2019m sorry, Steven. We\u2019ll go online question first. We\u2019ve got a question from Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. How confident are you in your ability to improve domestic margins in 2018? Can you help us bridge the margin gap between that and your long-term targets?","Richard Peretz","Sure. Allison, this is Richard. Good morning. Overall, when we look at 2018, the first thing we know is the growth in the U.S. remains strong and that strength we saw not only in the fourth quarter, but really we sequentially have seen it in \u201816 and \u201817, and it\u2019s both on the volume side as well as the yield being at the higher end. We also know that some of the efficiencies that we\u2019re getting in operations were masked both by our investment dollars and the op penalties we\u2019ve talked about, but also from the higher cyber-period volume levels.","In 2018, it\u2019s not just all the new buildings that we\u2019re opening, but it\u2019s really also the beginning of some of the technology that\u2019s going to power the global smart logistics network going forward Myron talked about in his talk.","So, we expect 2018 to have some challenges because of the investment dollars, but probably the biggest challenge we\u2019ll have domestically is the unplanned discount rate change. If you look over the last two weeks of December, we saw fluctuations in discount rates of between 20 and 40 basis points to where we ended up at the end of the year. And that has a big impact on the net operating costs. We also know that since this year has started, the longer term interest rate is starting to get more normalized shape on the curve, and that\u2019s going to help us as we remeasure pensions going forward in future years. But, this year, we don\u2019t know that drag around $200 million is going to be something that we\u2019re going to have to deal with. But at the same time, the underlying business remains strong. We are putting the initiatives in place. And we are implementing the technology that\u2019s really going to drive the savings of the 800 to $1 billion we laid out for the global smart logistics network.","Scott Childress","We\u2019re going to take another online question. We have got a number of questions, four or five, about the international business, Brian Ossenbeck of JP Morgan, Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer, Jack Atkins. And really, it\u2019s about how large can the International segment become? Are we positioned given the growth and the optimistic outlook that we are seeing? And then, can you tell us what the real potential there is?","Jim Barber","Okay. Brian, it\u2019s Jim, I guess, and Jack and Scott. Look, we talk about this quite often within the management committee. With 95% of the consumers outside of the United States, a good piece of that in emerging markets which aligns to one of our Tier 1 strategies. Personally, I think that at some point in the future as our business continues to diversify, International will probably become bigger and larger for our shareholders than Domestic. We can\u2019t say when. We certainly want to continue to invest in and keep the U.S. Domestic business growing, because it\u2019s the foundation of UPS and we don\u2019t want to lose that. But, the world continues to move; cross-border continues to grow seven times as fast as most domestic economies. The trick is to be there at the right time at the right place. We do get the competition it gets a little bit more complex from my perspective in each of the countries you go into, you go heads up against the post usually, a national champion, another integrator and maybe some new entrants. And so, the trick for us is to get to the right place at the right time. You\u2019ve seen that over the last couple of years, we will continue that strategy, and we hope all of our businesses continue to grow with pace but hopefully International continues to speed up and deliver for us. So, thanks for the question.","Operator","Question from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Please go ahead.","Tom Wadewitz","Good morning. Richard, I wanted to see if you could add some more perspective on cash flow and how you are thinking about uses of cash, probably like -- maybe both 2018 and if you want, 2019? The CapEx number obviously is a bit higher. What are your thoughts on, is there another big contribution to pension, is there remaining room for share buyback or do you kind of put share buyback on hold as you look at the higher CapEx spend and however pension [weaves] [ph] into that? Thank you.","Richard Peretz","Sure. So, to step back for a moment, Tom, our priorities haven\u2019t changed. The number one priority is to reinvest in the business. We have maintained and continue to perform a return on invested capital that is the best in the industry. We also think the dividend is an important component of our capital structure. And as I mentioned in my talk, with Board approval, we expect to keep growing the dividend.","And at the same time, flexibility is important in the balance sheet. The way I look at it is, we made a $5 billion contribution at the end of the year, really for three reasons. And one of them was it was tax efficient. That contribution was made at a time when you write it off at the higher tax rate of the legacy rate versus the new rate. Second, it improves cash flow, not only this year, but likely for the next few years. And then third, it lowers costs. If you think about the rising PBGC premiums which are going to be 380 basis points that you\u2019ll pay in unfunded pension, my borrowing cost is more than 150 basis points below that.","So, we\u2019re going to continue to manage responsibly. We continue to believe that the strong cash flow from operations allows us to do all of this. And at the same time, taking advantage of the new tax laws with the CapEx that\u2019s really used to continue to grow our business, but also we get the 100% deduction for the next five years. So, when you put it all together, the [priorities] [ph] aren\u2019t any different, we expect the same amount of return. And I guess the last thing is, if these discount rates do start coming back up, it\u2019s a dramatically different view of both the liability side and the entire pension world. It\u2019s just been like almost 9 or 10 years since we\u2019ve been in the normalized discount rate environment. No one expected them to be at what really are all time lows to more than 20, 30 years.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead.","David Vernon","One of the core issues here seems to be being able to price and get the productivity that you need to get earnings leverage in the domestic segment. Are you guys going to be making any changes commercially to how you approach the market in terms of the aggressiveness on fee increases or surcharges, based on what looks like another sort of tough year in terms of getting operating leverage to the Domestic segment?","Alan Gershenhorn","Dave, this is Alan. Thanks for the question. First of all, as you know, our strategy has been for quite some time to target base price increases in the range of 2% to 3%. And certainly, in the fourth quarter of \u201817, we did a phenomenal job with that. We actually finished with our base pricing above the high end of the target. And it\u2019s one of the strongest consolidated RPP growth quarters that we had in the last decade. And it has been aided by some of the revenue management initiatives that we put in place. We\u2019re certainly doing a lot more with surgically managing our contracts, DIM weight has been a nice tailwind and this year we\u2019ve now expanded that to the under one cube.","And again, we\u2019re focused really on the management of the accessorials including the additional handling fees, large package surcharge and you may have noticed that we more than doubled the price of over max. So, yes, we\u2019re really focused on managing the yield, and keeping it between that 2% to 3%. And I think what\u2019s really exciting is the fact that we were able to achieve those yield gains with some of the higher volume growths that we\u2019ve seen in -- and by the way that\u2019s happening both domestically, internationally and in our Supply Chain segments as you can see with the fantastic revenue growth we had this past quarter.","David Vernon","Given that we are getting that accelerating volume under the accelerating pricing, do you feel like you have a better opportunity there to use price to get ahead of this?","Alan Gershenhorn","Yes. Certainly, we\u2019re going to continue to manage the enterprise customers in the middle market and with the goal of achieving those target-based price increases in the 2% to 3% range.","David Abney","This is David. And to summarize, Alan, no doubt about it, we are always analyzing our pricing alternatives. We want to make sure that we get compensated for the value that we provide. We believe that this year was a good step on that journey. We also believe there is more work to be done and we are going to continue to focus in that area. Thank you.","Scott Childress","We\u2019re going to take a online question. This question comes from Jairam Nathan from Daiwa Bank. How would Amazon\u2019s entry into pharmaceutical impact UPS\u2019s prescription delivery operation? ","David Abney","This is David Abney. Thanks for question. First, I\u2019d have to tell you that we don\u2019t know exactly what Amazon is going to do in this area. There has been a lot of rumors and there has been some indications, but we\u2019ll have to wait and see. What we can tell you is that a few years ago, we identified the health care as a Tier 1 initiative; we felt that our capabilities lined up very well with the needs of the market. And we have been customizing solutions, not only in the pharmaceutical side, but in the other aspects of health care. And whether it\u2019s coming directly from manufacturers or using distributors is just an area that we see our expertise, the complexity of the supply chain, the fact that it is global, and pharmaceutical is a good example of that and it\u2019s been a good opportunity for us. As new players may come into the market, we believe that we will take advantage of our capabilities, and we\u2019ll continue to improve our capabilities in that area. Thank you.","Scott Childress","We are going to take another online question; this one is from Allison Laundry of Credit Suisse. How much additional revenue did UPS generate from peak surcharges in the fourth quarter, and how successful have your surcharges been in moving customer demand?","Kate Gutmann","Great. Good morning, Allison. This is Kate. Thanks for the question. So, with our peak season, surcharges for residential deliveries and large packages, we achieved our revenue target, and we were able to better align price with our cost to serve. We acquired as you may be aware, the residential during specific high volume periods and large packages for the full peak period. We have also announced in our 2018, peak surcharge plan for the -- in our GRI, and that\u2019s helping our customers to budget. As David mentioned, we have further to go over max, which is package characteristics outside of our weight and size limitations, did enter the network. We see that as an opportunity to go further. As Alan indicated, we are in 2018 and we are working with our customers to address that specific area. Thank you.","David Abney","This is David. Just to add to what Kate said. We believe also that these peak surcharges did help us to some extent shape the volume around the period, especially peak week. We were able to get packages moved into the week before and non-critical packages moved the week after. We\u2019ll say that around Cyber Week, we didn\u2019t have quite the success that we thought we would into shaping. And we are going to look at that and that will be an area of focus for this year.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Chris Wetherbee","I wanted to talk about CapEx for a moment and take a look back, over the last many years, we haven\u2019t seen anything sort of approaching this, but get your point about sort of building you\u2019re your fleet in previous decades. Maybe you can put into some context maybe the duration of the spend. We\u2019ve seen a really rapid ramp up from a fairly stable level couple of years ago. How long would you anticipate sort of these elevated levels? And can you give us any sort of benchmarks to use as a percent of revenue and maybe absolute dollars for that period of time? That would be helpful.","Richard Peretz","Sure. Again, Chris, this is Richard. And I think, the first thing you have to look at is, there are -- and we talked about between 25% and 30% growth from 2013 until this year, when we finally first took another plane. If you think about the value creation of our air products and our international products, and it\u2019s apparent that that\u2019s an area where we want invest as much as we can, as often as we can, because it does bring return very quickly to the bottom-line. And so, now, we\u2019re going to have a total of almost 28, 747s, as well as about seven 767 that we\u2019ve announced.","At the end of the day, the next few years, we expect these kind of levels, somewhere between 9% and 10%, 8.5% and 10% of revenues to stay. In fact, our plans right now for the next three year are stay pretty much as these kind of levels. And it\u2019s accretive to the business and then you get the 100% deductibility for your investments. If you go back a few years, we kind of announced almost something similar in the International business where about -- by the end of this year will be about 75% of the way through the investments and we\u2019re all seeing the kind of results we\u2019re getting out of that. So, we see that as a good proof point. And with that as the technology and what we\u2019re doing in the business, we believe that these are the right places to put the dollars; it\u2019s got the best return on invested capital; and it\u2019s going to bring the return that we expect.","David Abney","And just one small point to add is that if you\u2019ve been following us for quite a while, then you do know that we\u2019ve had these kind of elevated CapEx percent of revenue before. It\u2019s just that over the recent five or six years we\u2019ve been at this lower level. But, if you look at a longer timeframe, you\u2019re going to see that this is not really an exception; this is maybe slightly higher, but very close to what we have averaged. So yes, for the next few years, we are really growing our international export business and our premium products. We see that this is an opportunity to take advantage of that and we are certainly going to do so.","Scott Childress","We\u2019re going to take another online question. This one is from Bascome Majors of Susquehanna. Bascome has, what led to the external executive hire of Scott Price, Chief Transformation Officer, what objectives has management set, and is there any time horizons that you can gave us?","David Abney","Okay. This is David. I\u2019ll answer. And we are very happy to have Scott with his experience come and join us. We have brought people in from the outside on many occasions from outside the Company, we never, at this level, but we believe with the pace of change, and that is just good to maybe add to our expertise with a little bit of external perspective, although Scott has been in the industry for quite a while.","Our focus is going to be on growing the business, on finding efficiencies throughout the business and creating opportunities for our Company and our employees. But, we have to examine all parts of our business. So, if there is one thing that I made it very clear to Scott is that there is an open canvas, there is nothing protected; I want to examine all parts of our business. We are rapidly moving through our evaluation stage now. I focus on rapidly because Scott\u2019s spend here six weeks or so and he is really made a lot of gains and he is working quickly with our team. We are identifying multiyear value creation opportunities. And we will be sharing more, later in the year, really excited about this opportunity, and Scott has the full support of the entire management team. Thank you.","Scott Childress","We\u2019ve got another online question here, this one from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Can you give us some more updates on the efficiencies generated with ORION and the other technologies that you are implementing?","Myron Gray","Yes. So, this is Myron. We are implementing key operations technologies; that\u2019s a multiyear process. We anticipate that when fully deployed, these technologies will result in 800 to a $1 billion annually at full implementation. This includes ORION, NPT, EDGE, as well as the facility automation. As we continue to build out this network of the future, it will certainly provide us with greater flexibility, greater connectivity to our customers, and capacity and efficiency. This year, we will continue to roll out Phase 2 of ORION, which obviously is dynamic route optimization to over 130 centers and 1,400 drivers. Phase 1 of ORION, we netted greater than our expected targeted savings of 6 to 8 miles per driver and over $410 million.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Ken Hoexter of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. ","Ken Hoexter","Great. Good morning. So, just looking back to the last few years, you talked a lot about the control tower through peak season to ensure you didn\u2019t get swamped again. It sounded like there were some capacity issues in the beginning. What in hindsight, and then going forward, what needs to be changed or adjusted on that ability to control the volumes, or is it if volumes come, we just need to take it and scale the network as quick as possible? Maybe you could talk a little bit about that David?","Kate Gutmann","Thank you, Ken. This is Kate. I\u2019ll take that. You are correct. The collaboration as well as the control tower in forecasting that we did with our customers this year actually increased in collaboration. Also, we added location level planning to this. And for the peak period, it actually worked very well. The forecasts were aligned and the control tower, which is the request of the large customers to go above their forecast, worked well. The example of that is peak week, as David mentioned, worked especially well during those critical last few days to do the wrap up, and gave us a strong finish.","But Cyber Week and weekend was the exception, and definitely more demand in the market than planned. You may have seen that the National Retail Federation noted that holiday retail sales came in 5.5% or almost 45% higher than their forecast. And that marks the fastest pace of growth in the post-recession era. So, definitely, more demand in the market, and as a result, more demand than we forecasted at UPS and then our customers forecasted.","We did have some customers that were able to shift volume into the two weeks after Cyber Week through self gifting promotions and even giving promotion dollars back to customers. And we are going to emphasize that initiative with additional retailers to help move some of that demand into the latter week. But, as Myron noted earlier, we did deliver, over 90% of the days were over 30 million packages. So that increased demand. And we will take all these learnings for Cyber Week and apply them to 2018 and just as we\u2019ve been able to really make some significant impact in the other weeks of the peak period.","David Abney","Yes. Just one last thing on Cyber Week. That old saying that rising tides lift all boats that\u2019s the thing that we were facing. If it was 2 or 3 large customers, the control tower -- it\u2019s 20 large customers, the control tower can be very effective in those regards. But, this was not just the large customers, this was throughout the network. And this is something that was in our network, but it was in the other networks throughout the country too. So that is why we\u2019ve got to really take a look at for Cyber Week. One of the things is we\u2019ve added a lot of additional capacity this year that has been covered and much more than in 2017, and we\u2019ve added more technology. So, I know that we\u2019ve been in much better shape from that regard. But, we\u2019re going to take a good look at the control tower and what we need to do around Cyber Week and we\u2019ll be talking about that further in the year.","Scott Childress","We\u2019re going to take an online question; this comes from Jack Atkins of Stephens. Do the benefits of the Tax and Jobs Act to the economy, combined with improve trade lead you to believe that you should be positioned to exceed your long-term earnings per share targets?","David Abney","Okay. This is David. I\u2019ll take the first part of the question and I\u2019ll hand it over to Rich. First, we want to applaud the President and Congress for passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We really believe that it\u2019s going to stimulate the economy and create jobs, and those jobs are going to create more shipments, which creates more jobs and more opportunities for UPS. It certainly makes the American companies more competitive. And we\u2019re also encouraged about the trade. Trade last year did exceed the percent growth of GDP. And at the same time that we are encouraged, we\u2019re a little cautious too. We have matter [ph] that is being negotiated now and we certainly hope and expect that it will be modernized, but it will stay in place. And we hope that other trade agreements, Brexit and those things that they have a pretty smooth conclusion, so that they will continue to be a boost of trade and not the opposite. So that being said, I\u2019ll turn it over to Richard, Company specific.","Richard Peretz","Sure. So, Jack, first, we put out guidance, it\u2019s somewhat around 20% EPS growth, and we also told you that between $0.80 and $0.85 of that is for the net benefit of tax, which in essence tells you that somewhere around a third of it is underlying business. That\u2019s even with a hit for the discount rate that we had called out. So, if you think about it, we are already seeing that economic activity, our guidance on the revenue numbers of all the segments are at the higher end of our range that we laid out last year. And so, we do believe that the tax reform is creating economic growth. We also believe that we\u2019re participating in that. Unfortunately some of that masked because of both the discount rates and the investments we are making. But at the end of the day, we are seeing a pretty good growth rate, even taking the headwinds that we mentioned.","Scott Childress","We are going to take another online question. We\u2019ve got a number of questions coming in about the competitive landscape in Europe and our ability to continue to win share in that market?","Jim Barber","Okay, Scott. This is Jim, by the way. I think that we get this question quite often. Frankly, it\u2019s about the TNT situation and the cyber attack. And again, I keep reiterating this as long as I\u2019m around it. I don\u2019t know wish that on any one, any competitor or any business in this world. It did happen, it created opportunity for us. If I look at the last couple of years, I just would also like, though to reflect on the fact that we were building capabilities in Europe and European networks since we announced the $2 billion acquisition. Rich talked a minute ago about, at the end of this year, we\u2019ll be 75% of the way through; that\u2019s a capacity play. We also have launched international dangerous goods, these dangerous goods in the region to complement that. And at the same time, we continue to expand our transporter network to basically have 80 plus percent of that, knock wood, touch in two days every buyer and seller on the continent.","So, we have invested, in my mind, nicely, irrespective of the competitive landscape. You have to pay attention to it. Very specifically, when the cyber attack did hit, we saw more customers coming to us, there is no question about that. But, I also would tell you that if I compare the fourth quarter of this year to the fourth quarter of last year, we continue to grow. So, there was a spike, but -- and then, the last thing I would tell you is, it\u2019s our job to keep those customers. And quite frankly, from what we see on our side, those -- the vast majority of those customers are staying with UPS because when they come in and start to feel the benefits of the network, they choose to stay with us. So, hopefully, we\u2019ll get into 2018 and beyond and prove that the cyber was the one-time deal for everyone, quite frankly in the market, and we just go compete and take the UPS brand to the market in Europe.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Scott Group, Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Scott Group","Hey, thanks. Good morning guys. So, I want to try and marry some of the pricing comments and the CapEx comments. So, it sounds like, still targeting 2% to 3% pricing. I guess, I would ask why not target 4% to 5% pricing, just to pick a number, something significantly higher than what you are targeting; take a little as volume growth. And I think if you get less volume growth, maybe need to spend less on CapEx. So, as you talk about like transformation and initiatives, is something like that a major change in strategy or more price less volume, less CapEx? Is that something that is being talked about, is that on the table in any way or is that sort of not the plan right now?","Jim Barber","So, first of all, there is a tremendous opportunity in the market right now with the growth in the market and also the ability to grow with that market. And we continuously monitor and analyze the supply and demand, and work the price to the value of our network and the portfolio of services that we have. And then, we also surgically ensure that we\u2019re pricing to our cost to serve. And I think some great examples of that is what we\u2019ve done with dimensional weight last year and what we\u2019re doing wit it this year, what we\u2019re doing with additional handling, with the peak surcharge, with our cell by cell GRI assessments. They\u2019re all kind of great examples of that. So yes, so, we\u2019re continuing to monitor the market and analyze that and make sure that we\u2019re pricing our services for the value that we\u2019re providing and certainly returning that back to the shareowners.","With that, I\u2019ll give it over to Richard.","Richard Peretz","Scott. In addition to what Alan said, if you go back to few years, our yields on a per package basis was 0.5%, 1%. So, we have taken a much more thorough look and continue to look at the yield side. But to the other side of it is also the total profit growth and how we\u2019re creating value. Because in total, as we grow profits, if we\u2019re bringing back 20 to 20 -- or 23% to 28% return on invested capital, we know we\u2019re creating more value for the shareholders. So, there is tremendous amount of effort, not on both the top-line and the bottom-line. We have a plan, and each business unit, it\u2019s very specific. And a few years ago, the same question could have been asked by about the two other business units. And now, you\u2019re seeing the result of really the strategies we\u2019ve put in place for each of those. And so, we have a deliberate strategy in the U.S. We think at the end, the shareholders will be very happy with the return we\u2019re getting. And it\u2019s really about putting all the pieces together, just as we\u2019ve done in the other segments.","David Abney","And just to recap, and both covered it very well. Let\u2019s don\u2019t get confused though, target pricing with a cap on pricing. Because as the opportunity creates itself, obviously, going to the top end of the target pricing or exceeding that as long, as we are providing the value and the market will hold that, we certainly look to that area. A lot about this CapEx increase that we are doing is also about bending the cost curve, reducing our cost, adjusting to this new ecommerce world that is rapidly migrating. So, it\u2019s a combination. We are not looking at pricing on one side and then separate from that we\u2019re looking it CapEx and how we can take cost out. This is an integrated model that we\u2019re constantly looking at all aspects of.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our Q&A session for today. I would now like to turn the program back over to Mr. Scott Childress. Please go ahead, sir.","Scott Childress","Yes. I would like to thank you. And then, I\u2019ll turn it over to David for his closing comments.","David Abney","Okay. Before, I get into my closing comments Richard has given me hand signal. So, Richard\u2019s got something he\u2019d like to cover, and then I\u2019ll close.","Richard Peretz","I just want to real quickly mention that as we move into 2018, there are two accounting standards that will change segment reporting. There is revenue recognition and the pension accounting, I call it the geography of where pension accounting will break out the pieces of it and some of it will stay in operating margin and other pieces will move below the line. So, it will have an impact on the margins going forward. Before the next call, we\u2019ll probably put out some kind of schedule on the web page to give an understanding. But ultimately, all these changes do not impact EPS, but they will impact operating margin by business units, and some of those will become more volatile based on what\u2019s happening in discount rates. So for example, you could see anywhere from 125 to 250 basis-point change in Domestic; you could see anywhere around 40 to 70 in International; and in Supply Chain, between a 100 and a 150. A lot of it has to do with how you recognize revenue and then how the pieces of pension get moved around. But, it\u2019s something in 2018 we will be adopting, we will be recasting last year\u2019s numbers, but it\u2019s something that going forward we will need to talk about as we get through 2018 actuals.","David Abney","And as Richard said, those puts and takes, they do not affect EPS; it\u2019s just the way we look at the business units. We are, as you have heard, transforming our network for growth and we are doing it now and we were basing it on providing both value now and long-term value to our shareholders. 2018 is a big year for smart logistics network. We are adding significant capabilities both in buildings and aircraft and technology. We continue to see strong growth opportunities for UPS. We\u2019re focusing on advancing our strategies and we are doing it for our customers and for our investors. So, all that being said today, thank you for joining us on the call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our call. We\u2019d like to thank you for your participation today. Have a lovely day.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations' Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Andy Dolny, UPS Treasurer and Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.","Andy Dolny","Good morning, everyone. I'm here this morning with Scott Davis, our CEO; Kurt Kuehn, our CFO, to discuss the company's results for the quarter and expectations going forward. Before they begin however, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. ","Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of the operations of the company. These anticipated results are subject to risk and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2010 Form 10-K and 2011 10-Q reports. These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's call is being webcast, and will also be available on the UPS Investor Relations website.","On Friday, January 27, UPS announced an accounting change relating to expense recognition for company-sponsored pension and postretirement benefit plans, adopting a mark-to-market methodology. This new method implemented in the fourth quarter of 2011 is preferable and will result in simpler, more transparent financial reporting.","As we said on our call last Friday, mark-to-market pension accounting provides several benefits. It's simpler, as gains and losses outside of the 10% corridor are recognized in the year incurred rather than amortized. It provides more transparency to UPS' underlying results, and it's considered preferable by GAAP since it more closely aligns with fair value principles. And remember, there is no impact on benefits to participants, pension plan funding or UPS cash flow. It is an accounting change.","As we outlined on Friday, as a result of adopting this new methodology, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased by $0.03 for the fourth quarter and $0.12 for 2011. In addition, a 2011 mark-to-market charge of $827 million was recorded in the fourth quarter. Therefore, on a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share for the quarter and total year will be reduced by $0.51 and $0.41, respectively. This is inclusive of both the benefit from the accounting change and the mark-to-market adjustment.","This accounting change must be applied retrospectively. As a result, 2010 adjusted diluted EPS and GAAP diluted EPS were reduced by $0.08 and $0.15, respectively. To assist in comparisons, revised results for prior periods back to 2007 have been provided. The impact to UPS financials are shown on the web schedules and described in detail in the presentation we distributed last week. The presentation and the web schedules are available on our website.","I wanted to point out that we included a few extra financial schedules in this morning's quarterly package. For both the fourth quarter and 2011 full year, we provided 3 selected financial data schedules: One that provides adjusted and GAAP results under the new pension accounting methodology, a second under the previous method and a third that reconciles the two. We hope you find this information helpful. Separate from pension, in the fourth quarter of 2010, UPS recorded a net $58 million gain on the sale of certain non-core assets in its Supply Chain and Freight segment. The after-tax benefit was $32 million or $0.03 per share. ","During this morning's call, all 2011 fourth quarter and full year references and comparisons to 2010, will refer to adjusted results unless otherwise noted.  We believe this is a more accurate picture of the company's performance. Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures and free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, are explained in the schedules that accompanied our earnings news release. These schedules are also available on the UPS Investor Relations' website in the financial section.","Finally, in an effort to allow maximum participation on today's call, each participant will be allowed one question and then be required to get back in the queue for any follow-up. I hope you understand. And thank you for your cooperation. Now, let me turn it over to Scott.","D. Scott Davis","Thanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone. I hope all of you had a safe and Happy New Year. I can tell you that during December, we were very busy at UPS, ensuring holiday shipments arrived where they needed to be all around the world. In fact, we experienced our busiest peak ever, delivering almost 500 million packages between Thanksgiving and Christmas. And UPS wrapped up the year with record EPS, free cash flow exceeding $5 billion and a new high in return on invested capital.","In the U.S. we saw a robust growth in e-commerce, while traditional retailers experienced mixed holiday sales. Continued migration to B2C contributed significant growth in UPS' residential shipments. This rapidly expanding market segment enables more and more opportunities for consumers to experience the unique solutions provided by UPS. Solutions like UPS My Choice, the industry's first offering that puts receivers in control of their shipments. UPS delivered almost 3 million packages to My Choice users during the quarter. Enrollment exceeded expectations approaching 0.75 million subscribers, not bad for a service offering in its first 3 months of existence. All in all, the U.S. market performed very well, growing at a faster pace than we projected.","Turning our focus to other parts of the world, in Europe, recession concerns, the debt crisis and the instability of the euro dominated headlines. But for UPS, solid growth continued. While in Asia, economic output and our volume lagged expectations. Looking to 2012, global economic expansion is expected to be slightly below the rate seen in 2011.","The U.S. is one of the few economies where expectations are greater than last year. Some countries in Europe are expecting growth while others are facing contraction. And in Asia, although there's discussion about slowing, growth there is still projected to outpace the rest of the world.","Businesses in Asia understand the power of global trade. And clearly, their economies benefit greatly. The U.S. needs to pick up the pace of exports and increase the participation of small and large companies alike. Recently, 3 key trade agreements were approved. These pave an excellent avenue for growth.","Small and medium-sized businesses are currently underrepresented in global trade. UPS is actively engaged in enhancing the export process for them through our broad set of solutions, expertise of our people and the reach of our network, bringing it all together through the power of UPS technology.","Companies throughout the world face many challenges today. In parts of China, supply chains are stressed by rapid wage inflation, while in other parts of the world volatile energy prices, natural disasters and social unrest provide additional strains. Companies also face more industry-specific challenges as they look to serve the global market. Take healthcare for example, where companies encounter increased regulations, greater competition from generics and a heightened focus on cost control.","As a result, more businesses are trying to diversify the components of their supply chains. And they are looking for reliable outsourcing partners so that they can focus on their core competencies. As these shifts occur, the complexity of the logistics model increases. UPS is uniquely positioned to assist customers worldwide with their distribution and transportation needs as they evolve. This evolution will require further investments on our part to develop new innovative solutions, increase channel access to our global network and expand our unmatched logistics capabilities.","We, at UPS were encouraged by comments made during the state of the union address that supported all of the above when it comes to alternative fuels. We have talked quite a bit in the past about our rolling laboratory approach; not just one alternative fuel solves our needs. Expanding the availability and the use of natural gas is one answer in improving the environment and reducing dependence on oil. ","We were honored to be recognized recently by President Obama for our work in this area. But finding solutions that improve processes is what UPS-ers do every day. And for that reason, I want to thank UPS-ers around the world for their hard work and dedication in providing excellent service. Each of them impacts how UPS is perceived by our customers and communities. All in all, a job well done. ","As I told you a year ago, 2011 was going to be a great year for UPS, and it was just that. We experienced solid top line growth in a challenging economic environment, continued gains in productivity, 20% improvement in operating profit, record EPS and on top of that, we had strong free cash flow, enabling UPS to continue our trend of significant distributions to our shareowners.","Now let me turn the call over to Kurt.","Kurt P. Kuehn","Well, thanks, Scott, and good morning. Before I get started, I want to explain how I will discuss fourth quarter performance in light of the pension accounting change announced last Friday. To make comparisons to past trends easier, I will review our results as they would've been under the old methodology first. After covering all segments, I will bridge results to the new methodology and then guidance, of course, will reflect the impact of our new pension accounting.","Now let's get started. A year ago, we announced that UPS expected to achieve record earnings per share in 2011. I am pleased to report today that we did just that, exceeding our previous peak earnings per share of $4.11, generating earnings per share of $4.23.","Not only did we set a new high in earnings per share, UPS also achieved record revenue of $53.1 billion, up more than 7%, and we surpassed the $4 billion mark in consolidated package volume for the year. All of this was accomplished during a period of uneven global economic conditions.","In the fourth quarter, revenue climbed 5.6% on average daily volume growth of 3.6%. Operating profit approached $2 billion, up 12.6% over last year. And operating margin improved to 14.0%, an increase of 90 basis points compared to 2010.","Notice that the tax rate during the fourth quarter came in higher than expected at 35.3%. This was due to a greater portion of profitability in the U.S. than planned, as well as some year-end adjustments. For the full year, our tax rate was 34.3%. Despite this additional tax expense, earnings per share for the quarter were $1.25. These results are impressive considering the macro trends that Scott outlined.","Overall, UPS had a fantastic peak season with global average daily volume exceeding 27 million packages on 2 days, and exceeding 25 million on 5. UPS technology provided customers and receivers visibility into their shipment as never before, handling almost 58 million tracking requests on peak day.","Now let's review segment performance during the quarter starting with U.S. Domestic. The segment saw strong revenue growth of 7.3% on a 3.8% jump in average daily package volume. Our Deferred Air products rose 12%, while ground was up 3.5%. All products benefited from the surge in online shopping, as we experienced robust gains in B2C volume, especially in our suite of lightweight solutions.","Revenue per piece was up 3.4%. Higher base rates and fuel surcharges were somewhat masked by a decline in weight per shipment and changes in both customer and product mix. Growth from large e-commerce customers outpaced smaller accounts, impacting both customer mix and package characteristics. As a result of this rapid growth in B2C, UPS experienced a meaningful decrease in weight per shipment, down almost 3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2010.","We successfully adapted to this changing product mix, with an operating profit increase of 24% and margin expansion of 200 basis points to 14.9%. The U.S. domestic operations executed one of their best peak seasons, demonstrating the benefits of scale, as well as the flexibility and efficiency of the UPS network. And of course, a little help from Mother Nature never hurts. Key operating statistics, like direct labor hours, miles driven and block hours, all grew at a slower pace than volume. ","Moving to the International segment. Challenging economic conditions existed in many regions of the world. UPS export volume out of the U.S. declined, as the dollar strengthened against the euro. Meanwhile, UPS remained resilient in Europe and continued to produce solid results. And though our growth rate in export from Asia improved slightly compared to the third quarter, it was basically flat with last year and below expectations.","These conditions and a nearly 2% unfavorable currency impact, contributed to the UPS revenue growth of 3.5%. UPS did set a new benchmark in export daily volume, surpassing 1 million packages. The increase of 4.5% was driven by high-single-digit gains from Europe, as well as strong intra-Asia and Asia to Europe trade. What makes this new high in export volume even more impressive is the fact that the Asia to U.S. lane was down by almost 3%.","Non-U.S. domestic volumes were up a little over 1%, as strong growth from Poland, Turkey and France helped offset weaker demand in other markets. Operating profit declined $40 million to $497 million. The year-over-year comparison was negatively impacted by approximately $30 million, due to currency fluctuation and our hedging programs.","Despite the challenging impact of changes in product mix and shifting trade patterns, UPS once again generated the highest operating margin in the industry, in line with our expectations of 15.8%. We experienced a shortening in trade lanes as a result of solid intra-regional shipment growth and weakness in the Asia to U.S. Lane.  International yield was up 2%, negatively impacted by a currency translation. Neutralizing this, it was up almost 4%. ","Also, during the quarter, UPS made available several improvements for International shippers. These included enhanced return logistic solutions, as well as expanded availability of our customer-facing technology, including mobile apps.","Now for the Supply Chain and Freight segment. Operating profits increased 8.5% on revenue growth of a little over 2%. Operating margin expanded 50 basis points over last year to 8.2%. UPS Freight led the way with good operating profit improvement from gains in productivity and the solid increase in revenue. Though LTL shipments and tonnage were down 2.4% and 1.3%, respectively, revenue per hundredweight was up almost 9%, driven by revenue management initiatives and higher fuel surcharges.","The Forwarding business unit experienced a decline in revenue and operating profit, as overcapacity and weak demand in the airfreight market put downward pressure on both tonnage and rates. Margins, however, remained strong.","Our Distribution unit continues to be a success, exhibiting growth in both revenue and profitability, while expanding operating margins. This was accomplished even as the business continued to invest in its healthcare capabilities. In fact during the quarter, we opened the 33rd dedicated UPS healthcare facility and have plans to open 4 more this year. UPS also completed a healthcare acquisition during the quarter, purchasing the Italian pharma logistics provider, Pieffe. With these added capabilities, UPS is positioned to serve pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device companies doing business there.","Moving on to review our cash position. During 2011, UPS generated more than $5 billion in free cash flow, after making capital expenditures of $2.0 billion and pension contributions of $1.4 billion.  In 2011, UPS increased its share repurchase program significantly and stepped up dividends. In fact, for the year, we repurchased 38.7 million shares for approximately $2.7 billion and paid dividends totaling $2 billion, up 10.6% per share. This demonstrates UPS' continued commitment to distributions to shareowners.","Before discussing our expectations for 2012, I want to take a few minutes to build a bridge to UPS' results under the new pension accounting methodology. This new method implemented in the fourth quarter 2011 is preferable and will result in simpler, more transparent financial reporting. It will be the foundation used for results from this point forward, and will be the basis for comparisons noted in guidance. Keep in mind, as Andy mentioned earlier, that historical financial statements reflecting both methods are available on the UPS Investor Relations website.","So looking at the fourth quarter, the new methodology had a positive impact on adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.03. Earnings per share came in at $1.28 per share, an increase of 21% over prior year results, on a 17% improvement in operating profit. 2011 operating margin of 14.3%, increased 140 basis points over the 12.9% in 2010. And looking at our full year 2011 results, adopting this new methodology resulted in an increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.12.","Total company earnings per share came in at $4.35 per share, an increase of 25% over prior year results on a 20% improvement in operating profits. And 2011 operating margin of 12.9% increased 140 basis points over the 11.5% in 2010. Remember, the pension accounting change we adopted has no impact on cash flow or plan funding. In fact, we ended the year 94% funded for UPS-sponsored pension plans. ","Looking towards to 2012, even though we adopted this new method, we still project that ongoing pension expense will increase on a year-over-year basis by more than $100 million, due to additional service cost and an approximately 35-basis-point decline in the discount rate. Continuing with our outlook for 2012, recent economic news about slowing in Europe and Asia is in contrast to the more optimistic tone we are seeing here in the U.S. Our expectation is for mixed economic growth around the world, with modest improvements in the U.S. Overall, we expect global economic expansion to be slightly less than the growth rate seen in 2011.","In spite of this macro outlook, UPS expects another strong year of earnings growth and we are anticipating earnings per share in the range of $4.75 to $5 per share, an increase of 9% to 15% over our 2011 earnings of $4.35.","For the full year, U.S. Domestic segment average daily volume is projected to grow around 2% to 3%. Revenue is expected to be up mid-single digits. Base rate improvements of 2% to 3% are expected, although these may be masked somewhat by continued growth in lightweight solutions that serve the ever-expanding e-commerce market. Operating profit should grow at an upper single-digit pace, as we anticipate continued margin expansion.","In our International business, we expect revenue to increase at a mid- to high-single digit rate on a 5% to 6% growth in export average daily volume.  Domestic volumes are projected to be similar to last year's levels. We expect operating profit growth of about 10% with some margin expansion.  The first quarter is expected to be flat to last year, due to more challenging comparisons and the current weakness in the euro. Although as the year progresses, we do not anticipate currency to have a meaningful impact on year-over-year results.","For Supply Chain and Freight, the first half of 2012 comparisons will be more challenging, due to strong performance in freight forwarding last year. Given this, operating profit growth will most likely be flat to down slightly. For the full year, we expect both revenue and operating profit to increase at a mid- to high-single digit pace. Continued gains in UPS Freight will be somewhat offset by healthcare investments in the distribution unit. The Supply Chain and Freight segment overall is expected to maintain a strong operating margin of approximately 8%.","Looking at total company results for the first quarter, due to the items highlighted in both International and Supply Chain and Freight, we expect year-over-year growth in earnings per share to be a little less than the average for the year.  Our overall tax rate for 2012 should be between 34% and 35%. We expect capital expenditures for 2012 to be approximately $2.2 billion. Regarding cash flow for 2012, UPS expects strong cash flow conversion to continue, exceeding 100% of net income. We remain committed to distributions to shareowners, with planned share repurchases of $2.7 million. And as always, dividends will continue to be a priority.","So to wrap this up, 2011 was a record year for UPS as our business model generated outstanding results. The robust fourth quarter performance that we experienced gives us momentum as we move into 2012. We entered this year with the expectation of delivering strong earnings growth with earnings per share in the range of $4.75 to $5.00, up 9% to 15% compared to 2011 earnings of $4.35.","Thanks for listening this morning. And now Scott and I will be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Ben Hartford of Robert W. Baird.","Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color into the guidance as it relates to the pension impact and maybe shedding some light on that, I know that we have the $0.12 impact in 2011. What would have been the impact in 2012 if we were to normalize for the old pension accounting?","Kurt P. Kuehn","Well, we would've seen, certainly, an increase in pension expense for 2012 under both methodologies. And as I mentioned, we do expect more than $100 million, actually about $115 million, in additional pension expense for 2012. But I guess one thing to keep in mind, that the increase is, perhaps not necessarily as drastic as many of you projected, really due to 2 facts. Number one, the plan did exceed its expected rate of return. We actually generated a 9.4% return. And the discount rate did decline by about 35 basis points and certainly there were some estimates that estimated higher. And as far as the 2 methods, going forward, in some years, the old method results in more expense and in some, it results in less. You could see that in 2010 and 2011. So you saw this in our restated results were we've shown those results. So the best reference point, really, is from the base that we've restated 2011. We do expect to see about $115 million increase in pension expense, and you could adjust accordingly based on that.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I was wondering if you could give a bit more perspective on how much of the volume improvement was, really, just a very strong peak season and your, obviously, good traction with your products to serve online, those shipping online sales. And how much is, I guess, either a change in your share performance or a change in the economy? Because it's a pretty notable difference in your Domestic Package volumes versus kind of flat in the third quarter. And your guidance in 2012 also implies, I think, a better volume trajectory than you saw in 2011. So I wonder if you could give more color on that.","D. Scott Davis","Let me start, Tom, with kind of the macro approach. I think that we certainly are seeing a better U.S. economy than we would have thought back in, probably August, September, back at Investor Conference time. I think that, back to that time frame, people were talking about a chance for a second recession. You don't hear that anymore. Clearly, we saw a strengthening economy and a strong holiday season. And frankly, it stayed fairly strong into January. So I think the U.S., while I wouldn't call it a robust economy right now, I do think the small package market is performing better than we would've thought 4 and 5 months ago.","Kurt P. Kuehn","Yes. That's right. So at a macro level, clearly, we feel a little better about where the U.S. is at. Looking more specifically, I guess, to your question, Tom, we clearly were pleasantly surprised by the demand surrounding the holiday season. Really, this is the first peak where we've really had our full suite of lightweight product offerings in place. And about half of the additional growth we do, we did see in our basic and SurePost products. If you recall, SurePost really was just launched in 2011. So we did see a big uptick and clearly, this fits into the trend of lighter-weight products, computers moved to tablets or portables and a lot of small products. And then the e-commerce growth continues unabated. We estimate, in general, e-commerce was probably up about 15% for the holiday season. So basically, we were in place with a new suite of products that was able to both attract volume and at the same time, handle it very profitably. So we were pleasantly surprised, frankly. I think, that combined with the increased focus we've had on B2C with My Choice and really differentiating our residential products, created a nice uptick. We also saw, the other number that might have surprised you a little bit, was the substantial growth in deferred air. And a lot of this is also surrounding the e-commerce trends, I guess, that there were a number of Internet retailers that decided to differentiate their products by offering a tighter Time-In-Transit. So we're seeing some pieces moving around. But all in all, we were thrilled that our business model and our product offerings were able to generate a great quarter.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Do you think there's a difference in share dynamic or competitive dynamic, is that part of this as well?","Kurt P. Kuehn","I wouldn't comment on that. I think, in general, it was a good holiday season. The market moved pretty well. So we'll see how everything else settles out.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I wanted to ask about the B2C trends, obviously, quite strong in the quarter. So it sounds like, deferred strength was driven partially there. But you also talked about a mix shift that's occurring. So maybe you could put some numbers around the growth in B2C that you saw in your business this year versus last year, some expectations going forward. And then, maybe help us think about why that weight per shipment is lower and how that affects mix from a yield standpoint?","Kurt P. Kuehn","Yes. As I guess a ballpark number, I think there's a couple of parts to it. Number one, B2C is growing robustly, especially through the e-commerce venue. Clearly, the e-commerce branches of companies seemed to do a lot better than the brick and mortar. In fact, in December, B2C volume was over 50% of our volume. December, it always spikes. So we are continuing to see that grow. The other nuance, and this is more company specific, is the substantial success of our SurePost product, which for the first time has offered a broader suite of services for lightweight products, lower values. So that was another big part of the success. So the combination of the trends in general, UPS positioning and us being able to differentiate. And as we mentioned, sign up 0.75 million customers for the new My Choice service, we think really puts us in a great position to capture some of the benefit of these trends.","D. Scott Davis","And Justin, I think you'll also see these trends internationally; it's not going to be unique to the United States. I think the whole global B2C phenomenon is still in the early innings and we'll see that grow going forward. But the key is that UPS is adapting the operations to be profitable in this business.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Can you guys just remind us, SurePost, that\u2019s the competitive product with SmartPost on your primary competitor side?","D. Scott Davis","Yes. SurePost is for lightweight, relatively low-value products where we do postal injection. We also, though, have a basic product that's a mix of both UPS delivered and injection.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch. [Operator Instruction]","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Can you talk on the International side, you talked about the slowing of growth or the expectations for a bit slower, particularly out of Asia. When you think about your CapEx, I guess, you talked about increasing it 10%, is that -- can you talk about what you're doing in terms of are you slowing down or shutting down any lanes and where are you increasing that CapEx?","Kurt P. Kuehn","Well, we did certainly make some adjustments in the network after the fairly significant slowing we saw during the third quarter. And as we said, the Asia ended up being a little slower than we'd anticipated, most notably on the U.S., Asia to U.S. lane. Yes, we have tweaked our network. Actually, if you look at Asia, specifically, we reduced capacity about 10% over the last couple of quarters maintaining service levels in all markets, but some of the duplicate flights and additional lift we took out. And that allowed us to sustain still a pretty good margin, although we will continue to adjust. Trends so far for this year are a little hard to tell because the Chinese New Year is coming a little earlier. But we'll stay responsive in monitoring where things are at in Asia. On the flip side though, Ken, we did see yet another quarter of solid intra-Europe growth. So in spite of the headline risks in Europe, we are continuing to see good growth there and some of our investments for next year surround the expansion of our Cologne air hub in Germany, that helps to support all that.","D. Scott Davis","And in general, Ken, our CapEx is still historically quite low. It's going to be still around 4% of revenue. If you recall, we used to spend between 5% and 8% of revenue. So we've had, really, a 3 low years. I mean 2009 was extremely really low, 2010 was low and 2011, what, 3.8%, I think 2011, and about 4% for 2012. So still, it\u2019s still quite low.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. David Ross of Stifel, Nicolaus.","David G. Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","On the Supply Chain and Freight side of things, you mentioned that you saw a decline in revenue and operating profit due to mainly overcapacity and weak demand in the air freight market, but that margins were strong. Did margins actually expand year-over-year for the Freight Forwarding segment?  And also, if you could comment on ocean and what you're seeing on the ocean side of things?","Kurt P. Kuehn","Margins expanded slightly year-over-year. But yes, there's clearly been a reduction in demand, not surprisingly, and rates. And there is certainly some challenges with margin squeeze. Ocean, we did pretty well on, although I think, clearly, the market remains very slow. But we've done a lot of work on our expanded ocean portfolio less than container load. But it remains a minority part of the business, air freight is the primary focus.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Nate Brochmann of William Blair & Company.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Wanted to talk a little bit about the disconnect that I'm kind of picking up on a little bit between the very strong U.S. e-commerce activity through the different channels, coupled with the kind of slower import growth in terms of wondering where, in terms of the shift in production, a lot of those e-commerce products then might be coming from or how the supply chains are moving?","D. Scott Davis","I think, in general, it's been all about inventory levels. And I think that we did not, even though inventory seemed to add to GDP in the fourth quarter, we feel that most of the inventories are still pretty slight in the United States. I think we saw the holiday season, a lot of people are running out of product. We have seen a pretty strong January. I think those people had to replenish inventory levels. So I think that, that because of low imports from Asia you're going to, hopefully, see some improvements in the near term as people replenish the inventory levels.","Kurt P. Kuehn","I think we are fairly bullish though on production within the U.S. seeing somewhat a renaissance. If you look at the cost of energy with natural gas so low, you look at the fact that wages on a global competitive perspective have improved in the U.S. And the fact that people are realizing that it's nice to have local sourcing in addition to global sourcing. We feel generally bullish that the U.S. economy is seeing a bit of an uplift and will next year.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Chris Wetherbee of Citi.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of color on kind of the intra-European volume flows during the quarter, and maybe what you're seeing in the first month of this year?","Kurt P. Kuehn","Yes. As I said, Europe continues to be a good story. And I think it's really 2 components. One, is the UPS-specific success in offering European shippers an integrated solution. And the other is I think the, and we heard some of this from Davos, that the core business activity is probably a little better than the headlines would suggest. So I think, we did see upper single-digit growth in shipments within Europe, that is a little slower than some of the previous quarters, but reports of Europe's demise have been exaggerated a bit.","D. Scott Davis","Yes, we really are -- have built our plan on a pretty flat economy, probably slightly negative European economy in 2012. But again, that small package market should grow even in that environment.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Gary Chase of Barclays Capital.","Garrett L. Chase - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I hate to ask you this one, but it's polluting my inbox right now. Could you just clarify, Kurt, you said when you were giving your outlook, I thought what I heard you say was flat international profit and that EPS at the corporate level, you were thinking was going to be lower growth in the earlier part of the year than in the back half. I think some people might have heard that it was flat EPS with, I think it's $0.88 last year. Could you just clarify? Could you just go back over that and clarify exactly what you were trying to communicate there, please?","Kurt P. Kuehn","Great. I'm glad you asked that if it was confusing, because that was not the intention. We had said that the first quarter for international is likely to be flat, really, because of some of the trends we've talked about, plus we do have a pretty strong euro headwind in the first quarter. We're currently hedged and protected at about 1.30; last year, it was at about 1.36, so that was purely a quarterly guidance. Overall, for the company, we expect earnings increases in the first quarter. They'll just be probably a little less than the average that we guided for, for the year. We guided a 9% to 15% range. So that was solely a comment about the first quarter, Gary.","D. Scott Davis","And the currency drag, Gary, is euro is primarily in the first quarter, our hedging program will protect us pretty well from Q2, 3 and 4.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Art Hatfield of Morgan Keegan.","Arthur W. Hatfield - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just a quick follow-up on that. To make sure we understand your guidance correct there, Kurt, what numbers are you using, the quarter numbers for the year and for the full year?","Kurt P. Kuehn","Well, overall, we're guiding to a 9% to 15% increase, $4.75 to $5.00 a share. We've said, in general, we expect Q1 to be a little more challenged. So it'll show earnings growth but at a little lower rate than the rest of the year, primarily because of the headwind in international. And also the comps in supply chain are tough, given the current margin squeeze.","D. Scott Davis","So remember, Art, we guide annually to help you a little bit on the quarterly, but we guide annually.","Arthur W. Hatfield - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division","No, that's helpful. I was just curious which base you were using.","Kurt P. Kuehn","No, all bases are against the restated. We're moving past the old numbers. I wanted to review and give you some sense since you'd anchored on those for Q4. But we have a base earnings of $4.35, that is the methodology. And all the guidance is based off of that base. And as I said, we do have a pension headwind heading into next year. But virtually, everything that we talk about and you see from now on will be based on this improved, more transparent approach. And we feel good about the year, but we do feel Q1 will be just a little more challenging.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. William Greene of Morgan Stanley.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Kurt, can we just come back to the impact from the changes on the pension accounting. Will that affect any of the long-term guidance that you gave us back in September? Did those numbers get affected? I assume there is some impact, but how would we think about that impact?","Kurt P. Kuehn","Bill, they really don't. When we restated, 3 of the years went one way, and 2 of the years went the other. So if you paint me a scenario of different discount rates and market returns, yes, it may be different. But as we've looked at it, it's not a material change over the longer term for margins or any of that. Well, it may make the results slightly different year-over-year. So we went back and looked at that, and we really don't see a scenario. If discount rates rise and markets do well, this method is a drag, because we are not going to take credit for those market returns on our quarter results. Conversely, if we stay with these incredibly low discount rates with 10-year treasuries under 2%, then we -- this method may pull some of that, those investment losses or at least the discount rate impact out of core earnings. But long term, our guidance that we gave in September remain. Probably, the only notable difference in guidance is we are actually a little more optimistic on 2012. If you remember, we gave guidance of 10% to 15% to earnings in September, but said that 2012 would be more challenging because we believe there would be below-trend growth in the global economy. But we do think it's going to be below-trend growth but clearly, we're giving earnings guidance very close to that long-term momentum.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Question on the international cargo revenue that's booked within the International Package segment. That number is sort of lower than it's been since the recession and I was wondering how much of that decline is due to less space on the brownfield aircraft for cargo revenue or just very weak rates for the filler freight you are taking on?","Kurt P. Kuehn","It's a little bit of all of those. A, we did reduce capacity out of Asia, so we had less excess capacity to use. Rates have also softened a little bit. Plus some of that space is used by our forwarder and would not show up in that cargo line.","D. Scott Davis","But clearly, the excess capacity has driven down rates and that\u2019s going to have an impact on the revenue.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Chris Ceraso of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I have a question on the pension. What's driving the increase in service cost? Did you change benefits? And also, what is your plan for cash contributions? Are you putting anything in the plan in '12?","Kurt P. Kuehn","Yes. Service cost is just going to be up as kind of a normal continued growth. Each of us clicks another year on the pension, I guess. The biggest impact is the lower discount rate. And as far as contributions, we expect to make about $400 million of direct contributions to the pension plans, and another $400 million or so to cover our post-employment benefits retiree, medical and some of those things.","D. Scott Davis","And everybody is living a little bit longer, so mortality tables have an impact on it also.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Peter Nesvold of Jefferies.","H. Peter Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","If we got the model together fast enough before the call, it looked like deferred air yields in the U.S. Package business were up 2.5% year-over-year in 4Q, which was kind of a notable step down from the 9.8% in 3Q. And again, assuming we got the model together is fast enough, is there any kind of trade down that's happening in that business or is there anything else that may be impacting the yields there?","D. Scott Davis","On deferred air, it's really trade up, if anything, from ground. The big issue there is the weights are significantly lower. That was the product hit most significantly by reductions in weight. So a lot of e-commerce volume with lightweight volume being shipped. So we're very conscious of it, the base rates underlying, as we said, remains strong 2% to 3%. But a 4% reduction in weight for deferred air, clearly, caused a big impact.","H. Peter Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then a brief follow-up and I'm done. Any conversations around Brent? Oil prices these days, north of $100 here for a couple of months. Is that starting to creep up again and shift our conversations?","Kurt P. Kuehn","Really not. Over the last several years, we have migrated gradually some of the new normal for fuel into base rates. So the absolute amount of the surcharge is lower than it was in historical. And our plan for the year assumes fuel somewhere plus or minus near the $100 rate anyway.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Trahan.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","So wanted to talk a little bit about the pricing guidance. I think you mentioned 2% to 3% pricing in the U.S. And I know that's in line with the longer-term expectations, but seems like a step down from what we got in 2011. And wanted to understand kind of the drivers of that, is this just being conservative or is there something changing in the pricing market that's not letting you get in '12 what you got in '11?","Kurt P. Kuehn","No. We think the core momentum as I was -- certainly, something we've been looking at very closely. The core base rates are continuing very stable. We did see in Q4 significant impact of customer mix with our lightweight product suite, really kicking into gear. And we do expect that momentum to continue for a while. So the overall reduced weights, 3% in Q4, and that trend may continue given the customers and the e-commerce that we're seeing. It does create a net impact that shows lower yield. But as you can see, we are able to profit on that. So all in all, we think the market pricing is stable, it remains a very high priority for us. You're just really seeing a fairly significant market change and also a significant change in mix to UPS as we've really hit our stride with this light rate e-commerce volume.","D. Scott Davis","As Kurt said, the market is rational from a pricing standpoint. What can help us obviously is, Kurt referred earlier to the manufacturing increase in the U.S. If we see that throughout 2012, that certainly can help the weight and help the yield.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Yes. Well, I guess, I mean, I understand the negative mix impact from lower weight. I guess, I would've thought, though, with an improving macro outlook that there could have been an opportunity for better than 2% to 3% underlying pricing, and just trying to understand the drivers of that if it's just being conservative or what?","Kurt P. Kuehn","It's consistent with what we talked about in September. Our long-term goal is to, in the domestic environment, is to generate 2% to 3% base rate increases. As long as we can keep yields moving at that rate and be able to keep our unit cost below that rate, we'll see gradual and positive margin expansion. So Scott, we think that's a very disciplined and appropriate approach. It maintains a stable relationship with our customers and we're very pleased if we can continue that positive balance of yield and unit cost.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Sterne Agee.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I just want to clarify. You said going forward you were looking for about $400 million direct contribution of the planned $400 million postretirement benefit contributions. So $800 million versus the $1.4 billion I think that you talked about making last year. In terms of longer-term modeling, we should think of the $800 million as a base plus or minus being outside the corridor with your 94% funding?","Kurt P. Kuehn","It's hard to forecast perfectly, but that's probably more normal. Clearly, we were catching up and fully funding the new plan that we had over the last year or 2. And frankly, that's one of the good news stories on our cash flow long term. Scott mentioned that CapEx should remain at or below 4%. The pensions are, even after what has been a tough year because of lower discount rates, we\u2019re 94% funded. So yes, the pension plans will not be a major hit on cash flow for the foreseeable future.","D. Scott Davis","Yes. Even from a tax formula standpoint, we're actually over 100%, and that really was what drive your contributions going forward. So we feel good. Now we would have said a year ago that interest rates wouldn't have dropped. So I wouldn\u2019t expect them to drop going forward long- term rates, which could have an impact. They go up, that improves our funding position.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Robert Pickels of Manning & Napier.","Robert F. Pickels - Manning & Napier Advisors, LLC","Hope it's not a repeat, I think it's a little different from Tom Wadewitz's question. But I'm just wondering how all of this growth in e-commerce is changing the seasonal nature of your business. It seems like the e-retail might make 4Q even stronger than some of the other quarters on a go-forward basis. And I'm just wondering how you manage this. Is it significantly different? Do you have to take capacity up and down more than you used to? Just comment on that, please.","Kurt P. Kuehn","Yes. Robert, you're absolutely right. And we've done a lot of work studying this. If you look at the seasonal factors of how different quarters and different seasons compare to themselves, we are really seeing that the fourth quarter become more and more important. And really 2 issues, I guess, number one, the demand for the fourth quarter has really created almost 2 peaks. We were extremely busy after the Black Friday and Cyber Monday period, that was a peak. Settled down and then, certainly, the last week of the holidays was another peak. The one piece of great news and this is reflected in our earnings results, is that the big challenge for us in the past of a large peak was tremendous amounts of training, a lot of disruption in our operations. As you guys saw in our investor conference, we have done a tremendous amount of work to, through operational technology to streamline our jobs, to deskill, so we don't have to train as much, and to optimize in real time. So what you really saw in the fourth quarter was a great demonstration of operational performance, driven by data-driven operations. And so the good news is we can handle these peaks and this growth in e-commerce very productively.","D. Scott Davis","And in fact, in the fourth quarter, our productivity improvements offset the entire wage rate increase. Now you'll see that because of the large scale in the fourth quarter, you won't see that necessarily in Q1, 2 and 3. But it does come through in a large-scale period like the fourth quarter.","Robert F. Pickels - Manning & Napier Advisors, LLC","Does it make it harder for the -- is it possible the fourth quarter is less indicative of broader economic trends because of the e-commerce?","Kurt P. Kuehn","Yes. I think that's a valid point. I mean, if you look at overall retail, it was a little better perhaps than expected but not hugely. With our bias with the e-commerce hitting our industry more heavily, you do get a little bit of an outsized gain.","D. Scott Davis","But it's still tied somewhat to consumer sentiment. And if consumer sentiment is negative, you're going to get impact in of the fourth quarter or the first quarter. So it's got to be a good sign of what the consumers are thinking, consumer confidence in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of John Barnes of RBC Capital Markets.","John L. Barnes - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a quick question on International. Kurt, I heard your commentary around you're reducing flights and that type of thing out of Asia, took out some of the duplicate type of businesses. But I'm kind of curious, it looked like the incremental margins domestically were very strong, some degradation on the international side. Is there anything else you can do to manipulate that cost structure to maybe get the incremental margins positive again on international? Or is it just a matter of kind of letting that [indiscernible]?","Kurt P. Kuehn","Absolutely not. I mean, you know us, John. We're working very hard to make sure that we've optimized the network, that our cost infrastructure is appropriate. As we did mention, we had about a $40 million decline in profits, $30 million of that was purely due to the euro hedge comparison. We'll face a little bit of that in Q1 but after that, as Scott had mentioned, our hedges put us in very good shape. So if you factor out that currency issue, we came pretty close to holding profits even in an environment where trade flows are changing substantially. So we're going to stay on our toes, make sure we've got the right assets in the right place and that our productivity and efficiencies cover it. One of the big trends that we're working on is taking some of the operational technology that we showcase that's used primarily for domestic and beginning to migrate that over to our international environment. So there's still more to come.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. David Campbell of Thompson, Davis & Company.","David P. Campbell - Thompson, Davis & Company","I just wanted to say that Asia, it seems like business there has been relatively stable since April. It hasn't really been dropping. So when we get to April this year, won't there be -- isn't there a good likelihood of an increase in business that could be better than you're anticipating in your estimates.","D. Scott Davis","Well, I think, David, that yes, with certainly Asia exports to Europe and the U.S. have not been that strong for -- really, for us it started in August, we saw the fall off. But intra-Asia has stayed strong. Certainly, as time goes on and consumer optimism keeps improving in the U.S. that will help demand, help imports from Asia into the U.S. We're guarded right now. We think there's some room for improvement, but we're just pretty guarded as far as what we see in 2012. It'll get a little bit better but we're not seeing a robust consumption out of the U.S.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Can you please comment on SurePost facilities, magnitude and margins? I'm wondering is this handled in existing sort facilities?  Is the order of magnitude below a percentage point of ground volume and I imagine ground margins -- or margins, are slightly lower in SurePost than they are in your own network?","Kurt P. Kuehn","Yes. The concept of unique SurePost facilities is a misnomer. This is another product in the UPS suite portfolio. Virtually all of the SurePost volume comes to us from customers that give us multiple times volume in our traditional networks. So really the only difference with SurePost is the last final mile of lightweight volume going to the post office. But the pickup process, all of our sortation and our feed networks, that really remains in the UPS network. So it's traditional UPS taking advantages of the economies of scale and integrating it. So it is just one product in the suite of products that our customers choose from. And as I mentioned, for every SurePost package we have, a given customer will have 4 or 5 other packages with them.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Jason Seidl of Dahlman Rose.","Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Wanted to focus a little bit on your Asia to U.S. number. Obviously, it was a decline of 3%. Can you remind us when we stop lapping the negative year-over-year comps? And also, could you comment whether you think part of this might be a little bit of a shift in terms of some of the near sourcing that we've seen occur down toward Mexico?","D. Scott Davis","The volume out of Asia, really as I said earlier, slowed down in August of 2011. So when we get to August 2012, the comps will get much easier.","Kurt P. Kuehn","Yes. And the Mexico trend does seem to be an interesting one. It's hard to call it a groundswell but clearly, in our supply chain discussions with companies, there is a lot of discussion about should the next unit of capacity be closer to home. It's not necessarily that people are shutting down operations in any area, but there is a lot of interest. I think if you look over the last year or 2, whether it's floods or earthquakes, supply chains are very extended and can be fragile, as Scott mentioned. And so we do see a lot of interest in near sourcing.","D. Scott Davis","Yes. We saw it peak in 2008, when oil got to $145 a barrel. So if oil and energy prices were to peak again, we'd certainly expect to see more of that.","Operator","Our next question will be a follow-up from the line of Mr. Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to get your comments on cost inflation and productivity within the domestic network in 2012, I don\u2019t think I've heard much of that on the call. And given that you expect positive volumes, could you see your seniority begin to come down and kind of how would you view the per hour inflation when you look at the labor side in Domestic Package in 2012?","Kurt P. Kuehn","Yes. Tom, we do expect those trends. Certainly as the business grows and we're able to add new employees or see turnover as people find full-time jobs that are part-timers today, we will see some benefit. And our wage rates mitigated and moderated just a touch in the fourth quarter. It wasn't a huge driver but it was a slight positive. We do expect to keep comp and benefits somewhere between 1% and 2% increases year-over-year as opposed to volume. So as long as we're able to do that and at the same time manage the yield environments above that, then we're pretty confident we can manage margin expansion.","D. Scott Davis","Again, we are confident that our product [indiscernible] will offset probably half of the wage rate increase, which is consistent with what we've been doing.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Gary Chase of Barclays Capital.","Garrett L. Chase - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I wanted go back to the conversation about the tax rate and understanding that it came in lower than you expected because of the international profitability. What was it -- obviously, you adapted during the quarter, you tried to reduce capacity to combat some of the international weakness. It sounds like that didn't have quite the offsetting impact that you were expecting. Can you elaborate a little bit on that and then just help us think about of how you think that will play into the New Year and how things will improve during 2012?","Kurt P. Kuehn","Yes, Gary, sure. Yes, the impact of our year-ending tax adjustment did reduce earnings by about $0.03 versus what we had guided to. As we said, one of the primary areas is, as we rolled up our profits from around the world in the 200 countries we operate, certainly, the lower international profits are taxed at a lower rate. Plus, the U.S. had a very strong quarter. So the U.S. rate's just about the highest in the world, so you've got a weighted average mix that drove our rate up and did impact profits by $0.03 or $0.04 a share or so. It's just part of the normal mix of business. Clearly, we're doing a lot of work to improve the international. We do expect to see profits up, approximately 10% next year. So we still feel great about the International business, but the tax accounting can be challenging when you've got dramatic changes in mix.","D. Scott Davis","And always, in the fourth quarter, Gary, we true up to returns we've filed from the prior year also, which results in some adjustments. And unfortunately, this fourth quarter, they went the wrong way.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Art Hatfield of Morgan Keegan.","Arthur W. Hatfield - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division","I'm sorry. My follow-up has been answered.","Operator","And due to time constraints, our last question will come from the line of Mr. William Greene of Morgan Stanley.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","If you look at what you did on rates in 2011, I think they were basically in line with your guidance sort of in this 2% to 3% range. But I think it also, correct me if I'm wrong, I think it benefited from some unique changes, things like dim weight, if I remember correctly or maybe I don't. So can you just clarify sort of are there any unique attributes to the rate changes for 2012 that we need to keep in mind when modeling?","Kurt P. Kuehn","There's always moving -- multiple moving parts within the rate structure, Bill. I mean dim weight was a visible one, but it wasn't material outside the scope of normal adjustments we do for rates. So we expect a fairly typical rate environment for the coming year. We did announce our rates for both air and ground last quarter, and do expect base rates to remain in the 2% to 3% level. The guidance, really, is just that with this changing mix and the influx of lighter weight e-commerce packages that's coming in at a greater-than-expected rate, the top-level rate may look a little lower than that. But if you get to the bottom of it, the core rates will remain strong.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes. The yields, you mean, right?","Kurt P. Kuehn","Right.","Operator","I would now like to turn the floor back over to your facilitator, Mr. Andy Dolny.","Andy Dolny","Yes, I'm going to turn it over to Scott for some final comments.","D. Scott Davis","Thanks, Andy. We finished 2011 on a strong note with an exceptional peak season. UPS produced strong Domestic Package margins in the fourth quarter. In the period we've talked about where e-commerce and B2C dominated our growth, we've been able to adapt and we'll continue to adapt our business to meet the demands of the marketplace. As Kurt said, despite a mixed economic outlook for 2012, we expect earnings growth to be in line with our long-term targets. We look forward to another record year.

My name is Steven and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations First quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise, and after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. Please note, we will only take one question from each participant to accommodate more analysts during the call. Thank you for your cooperation.","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Joe Wilkinson, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.","Joe Wilkinson","Good morning and welcome to the UPS first quarter 2014 earnings call. Joining me today are Scott Davis, our CEO; and Kurt Kuehn, our CFO; along with Chief Operating Officer, David Abney, International President, Jim Barber; President of U.S. Operations, Myron Gray and UPS Chief Sales and Marketing Officer, Alan Gershenhorn.","Before we begin, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the Company. These anticipated results are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2013 Form 10-K which is available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Although there were no adjustments to first quarter 2014 results, there was an adjustment related to the attempted acquisition of TNT that increased first quarter 2013 diluted earnings per share by $0.04. As a result in our remarks today, all quarterly and full year comments and comparisons were referred to adjusted results. In addition we will discuss UPS\u2019 free cash flow which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The webcast of today\u2019s call along with a reconciliation of free cash flow and adjusted results are available on the UPS Investor Relations website.","Before we review the details of the quarter I want to announce that we plan to hold an Investor Conference later this year. The 2014 UPS Investor Conference will be held at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in New York on November 13th. We look forward to updating you on our strategy, demonstrating our technology and sharing our plans for the future. You will be receiving a same day invitation soon with more details. And just as a reminder, as on previous calls please ask only one question so that we may allow as many as possible to participate.","Thanks for your cooperation. Now I will turn it over to Scott.","Scott Davis","Thanks Joe. Welcome to your first call and good morning to everyone. UPS first quarter performance produced mixed results. International demonstrated strong volume growth and margin expansion and a 8% increase in export shipments. Supply chain and freight delivered results that were about as we expected, however our U.S. domestic segment fell short due to the unusually harsh weather during the first quarter.","We pride ourselves on being an all-weather company, but the intensity of this year\u2019s winter storm season produced challenging conditions. Buildings across UPS network were forced to cease operations somewhere in the U.S. on 34 days during the quarter. These weather events not only led to increased cost but also influenced UPS product and customer mix contributing to lower yields. We saw business to business shipments slow as manufacturers, distributors and retailers closed shop.","On the other hand snowbound consumers took to the Internet to make their purchases. Clearly UPS results in the U.S. reflect both the loss revenue and the additional cost associated with these storms and Kurt will provide more details in just a moment.","While we are yet to see the first quarter U.S. GDP numbers, it\u2019s safe to say that growth will be slower due to weather. The good news is that spring has arrived and we expect the pace of U.S. economic growth to pick up as 2014 progresses. In Europe the economy is showing signs of recovery and faster growth. Yet as the situation in Ukraine deteriorates, that pace may slow. Economic expansion in Asia has remained steady with mid single digit growth and in Latin America expectations call for increased merchandise exports. The economic benefit of global trade is clearly visible in both established and emerging economies. Trade per modes economic expansion creates jobs, makes companies more competitive and lowers prices for consumers.","Congress now needs to act to pass a trade promotion authority bill or TPA that supports economic growth in job creations in the U.S. TPA gives the administration authority to pursue trade agreements that meet objectives laid out by Congress. We strongly encourage swift passage of TPA as there are currently three important trade packs pending that provide real economic benefits and TPA will clearly increase their chances of success. The expansion of global trade is an important catalyst to the UPS growth strategy. Recently our management and board of directors conducted detailed review of UPS\u2019 long term strategic initiatives and identified key opportunities that bring long term value to both customers and shareowners. The updates we received were encouraging. UPS is on the right path to ensure that our solutions meet the ever changing needs of the marketplace. We will continue to stay focused on providing industry specific solutions as we invest in our healthcare capabilities and develop omni-channel solutions for the retail industry.","In addition we review the implementation of the operational technology projects or ORION and Hub Automation. On the international front Jim Barber will bring you up today this morning on how we\u2019re expanding the UPS global network in both developed and emerging economies as well as what we\u2019re doing to serve end consumers around the world.","In support of our healthcare strategy UPS announced several investments during the quarter including the acquisition of Polar Speed. This addition to our global healthcare network will provide improved access to the important UK market as well as unique cold chain transportation capabilities.","Also UPS opened new healthcare distribution facilities in Canada and Mexico and thus plan to expand with additional facilities in Brazil and Chile later this year, further increasing our capabilities in Latin America. Adding to these industry specific solutions, we've expanded our distribution network in North America for retail and manufacturing clients. These investments add almost 500,000 square feet to our footprint at three key distribution sites in Kentucky, California and Alberta, Canada.","Now before I turn it over to Kurt, I want to give you a quick update on what we\u2019ve been doing regarding peak season. During the last couple of months we have met with UPS\u2019 largest customers. We are working collectively to improve forecast and accuracy, increase visibility of shipments and improve mutual planning capabilities. Our shared goal is to enhance the end consumers\u2019 experience. In addition, David Abney and his team are on track with the system changes, facility automation and capacity enhancements we discussed last quarter.","These improvements will provide better flexibility of peak and will deliver service and productivity gains throughout the year. As we continue to implement these enhancements, we\u2019ll keep you updated on our progress.","Now Kurt will take you through the details of the quarter.","Kurt Kuehn","Well thanks Scott and good morning every one. Our goal today is not to make this call all about weather but unfortunately it did significantly weigh on earnings. So we\u2019ll have to spend a minute or two talking about it. The difficult weather environment this quarter created severe operational challenge that increased cost and also pressured demand. Unfortunately due to our diversified portfolio, weather is not the only story. Most notably we\u2019re encouraged by the strong momentum in international and the positive results in the supply chain and trade segment. We expect both of these to continue.","Now let\u2019s review the segment results. Our U.S. domestic operating profit was 927 million down 158 million with margin contracting 220 basis points. Clearly the impact of weather was reflected in the bottom line. We estimate that the profitability was lowered by almost $200 million. This includes the additional expense from loss productivity, snow removal, increased utilities, in addition it was a drag on revenue due to perishable demand and increased service refunds.","UPS experienced service disruptions in the network on more than half of the operating days in the quarter, materially increasing network costs as we attempted to navigate around the many storms. For example, a substantial rise in the number of delayed trailers slowed network operations and pushed direct labor hours up 5.4% including a 20% increase in overtime.","U.S. domestic revenue increased 2.6% to $8.5 billion. We were encouraged to see strong demand in the U.S. as daily volume was up 4.2%. Ground products were up 4.4% driven by SurePost, which grew more than 50%.","UPS deferred products grew 6.3% and Next Day Air was 1.5% higher due to increases in Next Day Air Saver package. B2C shipping contributed broadly to gains across all products, while B2B improved slightly primarily from ecommerce including omni-channel customers. Average revenue per package declined by 1.5%, days rate increases were more than offset by changes in customer and product mix slightly lower fuel surcharges and weather also contributed to yield declines.","Couple of interesting things we noticed. Customer mix shifted a bit as large accounts were able to more effectively manage around storms. Also B2B volume was clearly reduced by weather events whereas in contrast B2C growth remained robust as consumers were able to continue shopping online, pushing our residential delivery mix to almost 44%.","Next, the international segment results. We are encouraged by the positive business trends we\u2019re seeing especially in Europe. UPS international revenue was up 5% to $3.1 billion. Operating profit increased 12% and operating margin expanded 90 basis points to 14%. Over the last several quarters, we\u2019ve been making adjustments to optimize network efficiencies. These improvements coupled with the increased shipments contributed to margin expansion during the quarter. Our international export volume was 7.7% higher, with Europe leading the way with growth to all regions of the world. Strong demand for UPS transporter products increased intra-European exports by more than 15%.","Non-U.S. domestic volume jumped more than 8% led by Germany, Poland, The UK and Canada. Export yields on a currency neutral basis were down 3.2% negatively impacted by shorter trade lanes and changing product mix as non-premium products grew by 13% with premium up 4%.","Looking now at supply chain and trade, operating profit was up 3.5% to $148 million led by the forwarding and distribution business units. Operating margin expanded 30 basis points to 6.8%. In forwarding, shipments and tonnage increased while market conditions drove revenue per kilo lower. The ocean forwarding and brokerage businesses both experienced solid revenue gains and improved profitability. The distribution unit continued to expand its footprint with the facility openings that Scott mentioned earlier. The retail and healthcare sectors combined to produce mid-single digit revenue growth. Operating margin expanded 80 basis points to 9% despite the expansion cost. UPS freight saw both pressure on demand and higher operating cost due to weather. Revenue was up slightly due to a 3% improvement in LTL revenue per 100 weight that was offset by a 2% tonnage decline. Operating profit was lowered by increased network cost associated with the difficult conditions.","Looking now at cash in our balance sheet, the ability to generate free cash flow on a consistent basis is a hallmark of UPS. This quarter, UPS once again had a conversion rate well in excess of 100% generating 1.9 billion in cash. Capital expenditures were about 320 million. The pace of investment will accelerate as the year progresses. We expect capital expenditures to reach 2.5 billion for 2014, many of the network enhancements and operational technology projects will ramp up during the second and third quarters. Regarding share under our distributions, UPS paid 596 million in dividends reflecting the 8.1% increase announced by the board in February. In addition, the company repurchased 6.8 million shares for approximately $660 million.","On the labor front, we are pleased with the progress that\u2019s been made and while we\u2019ve not yet received final word from the Teamsters we feel it\u2019s an appropriate time to share with you some key elements of the new agreement. A detailed presentation will be made available on the IR website upon implementation of the contract. The new agreement includes reasonable wage and benefit increases as well as flexibilities that will improve service and profitability. UPS has devoted substantial time and effort working to help the Teamsters better understand our cost structures and the changes needed to provide attractive benefits in the future while remaining competitive in the industry.","Sponsorship of healthcare plans has become expensive largely due to high healthcare inflation trends and legislation like the Affordable Care Act. After much evaluation, we determine that the best path for UPS was to move our union employees to multiemployer healthcare plans. In simple terms, UPS is moving from a defined healthcare benefit plan to a defined contribution environment with the contribution set for the duration of the contract. Once the new contract is implemented, the responsibility for proving medical coverage will be assumed by Teamster plans.","As a part of this settlement UPS will also remove existing post-retirement healthcare liabilities from our balance sheet. This obligation for future retirees as well as ongoing coverage for active employees will become the responsibility of the multi-employer plans. When we transfer this liability to the Union, UPS expects to make a significant cash payment to these plans and record a one-time charge. As I said, more details will come in the future when the contract is finalized.","Looking now at our expectations for the rest of the year. While we took a hit in the first quarter our expectation for the remainder of the year are unchanged. In U.S. domestic, we still anticipate operating margin of approximately 14% for the remainder of the year. We expect a little higher package growth somewhere between 4% and 5% resulting from the gains in UPS share post.","Looking more closely at the quarters, as we discussed back in January we will be incurring at least 100 million in extra operating expense. This expense is related to network and systems enhancements as well as the accelerated deployment of ORION. The lion's share of this expense will weigh on the second and third quarters by about $0.02 to $0.03 each.","Our expectations for international and the supply chain and freight segments remain unchanged. So overall we are encouraged by the positive trends we\u2019ve seen across the business and anticipate the remaining three quarters to perform as we originally guided. However, due to the challenging start to 2014, we expect to be at the low end of our earnings per share guidance range of $5.05 to $5.30.","Now Jim will take you through our international business.","Jim Barber","Thanks Kurt. I would like to take a few minutes to update you on the key components of our international strategy and the positive momentum we are experiencing. The international segment delivered our best volume growth since the third quarter 2010 up almost 8% per day. This growth combined with our network and operating efficiencies drove our industry leading margin to 14%.","As we look at the business around the world, UPS experienced high growth in many developed economies during the first quarter. For instance, in large European markets like Germany, The UK, France and Spain exports were up more than 17%. Meanwhile large Asian markets like Hong Kong and Japan saw export growth of more than 6%. We continued to align our networks to market conditions and regional trade patterns.","Europe has been the foundation for UPS international investment and growth. Our customers continue to value the capabilities and solutions that we provide to support the single market economy. One of the most rewarding components of our Europe growth is to see the success of our recent acquisitions. Some examples of that success are Turkey with revenue up 18%, the UK was up 11% and Poland was 15% higher. UPS operational methods and systems facilitated the successful integrations of these key acquisitions.","Our intra-Europe air and ground networks are proving attractive to customers looking to optimize their supply chains. We recently invested $200 million in the UPS Europe air network with the expansion of our Cologne Air Hub. This increased our sort capacity by 70% coupled with state of the art securities screening and improved our air and ground network performance.","The value of our extensive ground network in Europe was also evident. As cross border shipments were up 15% in the first quarter. Recent investments such as our Kiala acquisition and the UPS Access Point Rollout in Europe are further strengthening our ecommerce proposition escalating our ability to serve the end consumer around the world.","UPS My Choice continued to be a great success in the U.S. As part of our global retail strategy we are evaluating expansion opportunities for this end consumer solution in markets around the world.","In 2012 we changed how we interact with our middle market customers across our international business. We understand our needs better and are tailoring industry specific solutions that add value for them. This initiative is paying dividends as we achieved double-digit gains in four important verticals; retail, healthcare, industrial and automotive. UPS capabilities and solutions resonate well in these verticals, giving us confidence of recent trends are sustainable.","Emerging markets are the next logical step in the UPS international expansion strategy and will contribute to growth as we enhance our capabilities in these underserved markets. We are in the early stages of the UPS emerging market strategy. The realignment of the international business units is allowing us to concentrate our efforts and leadership teams in these developing economies. As we progress we will keep you updated.","In closing, I am proud of the dedication and hard work of UPS' around the world that produce these results. In fact I see our most important competitive advantage as the UPS culture and how it integrates with local communities in our diversified portfolio. No matter where I go, UPS people speak the language of dedication and commitment to exceeding our customer expectations.","Thanks, now I\u2019ll turn it back to you Kurt.","Kurt Kuehn","Thanks Jim and we look forward to lot of great future events in the international segment.","Operator we\u2019ll turn it back over to you then to open up the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question will come from the line of Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer","I trust the weather and the guidance first off here. You\u2019re maintaining that you can hit the low end of the previously stated guidance range, despite the tough first quarter. I am just curious what are the two or three main drivers that give you confidence, you mentioned some strong package growth in SurePost, but just the two or three broadly that you think will help you and may be some trends here into the second quarter that support your confidence in those. Thanks.","Scott Davis","Yeah Scott it has been a challenging time and our operations people in the U.S. faced clearly extraordinary conditions and really storm after storm and as you heard, over half the days we had some significant network operations with facilities shut down. So it was a very tough quarter.","Beneath that though we do feel that the initiatives we\u2019ve rolled out in the core momentum of the company is continuing steadily. So if you peel away that exclusion basically our guidance remains unchanged. We\u2019re seeing a little better volume on the light weight side and the operations now that skies have cleared have worked a little better. So Myron may be you could talk a little bit how you guys I guess survived Q1 and the momentum coming into Q2.","Myron Gray","Scott and Kurt both have alluded to in their opening comments on 34 of the 63 operating days in the quarter, we experienced severe weather conditions prompting many of the governors in the States that were effected to issue a level three emergency condition that prohibited us from working.","We also saw a tremendous uptick in the number of trailers that were impacted by weather rising over 400%. As the result of it, our direct labor hours as well as overtime expense went up significantly. Overtime hours were impacted by more than 20%, I don\u2019t think there is a person in the country who is more happy about seeing spring weather return and as a result of it in April, both our productivity and service has returned to normal level. So as Kurt has alluded to you, we don\u2019t see an issue moving forward.","Scott Davis","Can I just the macro-economic environment looks decent as we move forward. I think the both the global GDP and U.S. GDP will be a little better than they were last year, not robust, but better than they were a year ago. And what excites me is I think we\u2019re going to see all three segments producing good growth. We saw international, we saw supply chain and freight accomplish what they\u2019re supposed to in the first quarter, that momentum is going forward. In domestic we saw (currency) [ph] improvement in to the March and we\u2019re seeing it in April, so we feel very good about the 14% margins in domestic.","Operator","Next question will come from the line of Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Kurt and Scott I am curious if you can talk a little bit about pricing. Scott, given the comments you just made about GDP and given the experience in the fourth quarter where we kind of ran out capacity which seemed to me we\u2019ve got maybe an increasingly positive backdrop for pushing harder on price. Can you talk a little bit about how you think about that and are we entering a period where may be pricing gets a bit better?","Scott Davis","Well, we do think that pricing is very stable and I\u2019ll have Alan talk about it little bit. Clearly the significant change in our mix does mask what we think is a core base rate pricing of about 2% plus or minus. And so with the substantial mix shift, it\u2019s made it hard to see but we feel pretty good that we\u2019re making investments and we\u2019ll be compensated fairly for it. So, Alan may be you could expand a little bit on pricing.","Alan Gershenhorn","Yes I mean I would just add that the base rate increases of about 2% we\u2019ve been experiencing for quite some time certainly masked by customer and product mix changes that were certainly exacerbated by some of the weather trends that Kurt alluded to in the opening comments. As far as peak season goes, our goal is to ensure we are properly compensated based on our customer shipping characteristics and also their seasonal patterns. And we\u2019re certainly working with each customer and their specific contracts on an individual basis to make sure that we\u2019re compensated fairly for this services that we\u2019re providing.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch","Great. Good morning. If I can just follow up on that, the pricing commentary there, may be just get a little bit more specific on that. Do you plan to use price to then adjust behavior in terms of getting it away from the December 23rd kind of peak day and kind of may be shifting the behavior a little earlier to help the network and I guess following on that, what additional projects, it sounded like you\u2019re things to accelerate shipments. It may be some more automation, can you may be dig into that a little bit in terms of where the 100 million and 500 million of investments are going?","Scott Davis","Ken I\u2019ll take your first question anyway and I\u2019ll let Alan expand a little bit on our real priority with customers. Our top priority this year is to provide superior service and quality operations to help our customers succeed during peak season. So we\u2019ll talk a little more in the future about the network enhancements. But Alan this is not the new, you guys work with customers and plan operation specifically peak season and use both price and strategy to manage it, right?","Alan Gershenhorn","Yes, so just to add a little bit of color on that. We\u2019ve met with all of our major and certainly our largest customers to increase the collaboration, very-very productive meetings that we\u2019ve had, we\u2019re working on improving mutual planning capabilities with obviously the ultimate goal of enhancing their end consumers' customer experience. Working on areas with these customers splits, bypasses, direct ships, late multiple, we can pick up special operating plans and then we\u2019re obviously communication the plans that we\u2019re working on unilaterally in the areas of forecasting, capacity planning, visibility and communication.","Scott Davis","And Ken I'll just add there, pretty much all options are still on the table, it\u2019s early in the process. We said last quarter, we really want to be able to meet customer expectations, but also meet our financial objectives at peak. So, we\u2019re still evaluating alternatives out there.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Nate Brochmann of William Blair & Company. Please go ahead.","Nate Brochmann - William Blair & Company","Yes, good morning everyone. I wanted to talk a little bit about may be some of the network adjustments that you\u2019re making in terms of as you\u2019re getting more of the SurePost revenue, one of the benefits of the ground network had been getting the better density on that local delivery on the B2C type front and if more shifting over the SurePost which is probably great for the overall network in terms of the revenue streams, but like you had to do on the international side, are you having to make any network adjustments because of that falling in to SurePost and then secondarily to that and I know it\u2019s probably too early to talk specifics, but does the new contract for the Teamsters give you a better flexibility to may be handle more SurePost away from the direct ground business? Thank you.","Scott Davis","I\u2019ll take the Teamster question, I guess the contract question first and we\u2019ll move over to probably David. The news just broke last night on this contract being ratified. We have not yet been formally notified by the teamsters. Once we get formal notifications as Kurt said, we will do a webcast of the details of the contract, so really do want to get into the flexibilities of the cost until we get the formal notification which hopefully is coming soon.","David Abney","Okay, as far as the changes in the system and effects that it could have by additional SurePost, really it\u2019s the same technology that we use in the rest of our business, certainly helps us here. So SurePost redirect is about as good an example as you can have and how our technology allows us to accommodate this change.","So very late in the process, we can determine if there are additional packages going to the same stop and then we can redirect that and then we will actually deliver it. It will be much cheaper than tendering it to the post office. If it\u2019s a single package, then we would do just the opposite, let it go ahead and flow. There is other, the technology where we can scan and make those decisions in the automation that we have placed in our hubs, we also have in our preloads. So yes, we see a change in the types of packages and the flow of the packages but we certainly have the automation and we certainly have the technology to adjust to that.","Scott Davis","Yes I guess may be one high level recap on that is that the goal for us is to make the investments to get our variable cost down extremely low and these packages drive very little capital and low operating expenses they flow through our automated system, so we\u2019re confident that we understand the operational changes and we\u2019re making the investments to be able to profit off of this growth for a long time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mr. David Vernon of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","David Vernon - Sanford Bernstein","Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Could you give us a little bit of an update on the rollout of the ORION system and may be talk at the micro level about what types of sort of productivity impact this is having in terms of [indiscernible] an hour or any type of metric that can give us some better sense for how impactful this rollout can be going forward?","Scott Davis","Right, well other than the fact that we have in some of our (ORION) [ph] people out in three feet of snow trying to chart out route, so I think it\u2019s moving pretty well. Myron what do you think?","Myron Gray","David we\u2019re certainly encouraged by the results that we've seeing thus far and as we alluded to in the first -- in last call, we certainly added 200 resources to help us with our implementation. To-date only approximately 20% of our drivers have been implemented, we will expect that to approach nearly 45% by year\u2019s end but it\u2019s too early to give you any numbers at this point even though we\u2019re encouraged and at the November investors conference, I think we will have more information to divulge to you","Scott Davis","But we\u2019re very encouraged by the progress we\u2019re seeing so far and as Myron said in November we\u2019ll probably give you the metrics.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","So wanted to ask a little bit about the buyback and if there if you see some flexibility now that the teamsters\u2019 contract is about to get approved to ramp that up and may be do you feel comfortable putting some broad numbers in terms of the payment to the multi-employer plans and then as debt comes off the balance sheet, is that an important metric you look at or consider when you think about how much stock you do want to buyback?","Scott Davis","Okay, Scott I\u2019ll try to piece all that together into one question I guess. No, our capital distribution policy, we guided this year of repurchasing 2.7 billion in stock you can see that we\u2019re well along the way on that in the first quarter and the increased dividend, so the settlement of the contract is not a material impact on our capital policies. We remain very strong on free cash flow and we\u2019ll distribute accordingly. We\u2019ll be sharing a lot more information on the migration of the retiree healthcare liability off our balance sheet and are always looking for ways to use our low cost to capital and our quality balance sheet to minimize volatility and improve returns, so this is no different.","Kurt Kuehn","And that those information will be forthcoming soon. If the reports are accurate from last night we should have the information hopefully in a couple of days and share that with you. I guess the one thing I'd add Scott is, is even though obviously net income was impacted dramatically by the weather, our cash flow gain was extraordinary in the first quarter of over 1.9 billion in free cash flow. So, we\u2019ll obviously consider that in our decisions going forward.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital","Good morning everyone. Kurt or Jim, I want to talk little bit about international margins, because I know there is a lot of moving pieces this year and you did have a good outcome in the first quarter year on year, but the comps get a little bit more difficult in the second and fourth quarter. So what are some of your assumptions around margin improvement for the remainder of the year, are you assuming sequential demand improvement and yield improvement, can you talk a little bit more about that?","Kurt Kuehn","Yes, we have guided to profits growing 12% to 14% this year, clearly they\u2019re off to a good start, so I think you\u2019ll continue to see improvements and hopefully you got to sense that we do think that things are moving well. So, Jim may be you could expand a little on some of your guys' results and outlook.","Jim Barber","Yes so Brandon obviously the comments in the opening gave some framework to it. I think that we should keep in mind that international, we keep talking about momentum. This is really the fifth quarter in a row, it\u2019s come up. I think we have to also keep in mind it\u2019s been a year since the (TNT) [ph] situation ended, I must put that way. And the business itself has really kind of gotten back to the basics of what we\u2019re supposed to do, you can see that. And so the leadership teams are in good place right now and I think the other comment I would tell you is, we\u2019ve also looked at the international business and not only investing today what you\u2019re seeing today but in some of the guidance, some of the emerging market investment, the teams are restructuring this coming forward. So we\u2019re actually I think in a very good place internationally and all the confidence in the world to the guidance we've given you so far.","Operator","And we have a question from the line of Mr. Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Please go ahead.","Chris Wetherbee - Citi","Just following up on the international question, when you think about sort of this re-acceleration of volumes that we\u2019re seeing particularly in Europe. Does it bring to the table any more opportunity to start thinking a bit more about price, it seems like sort of the underlying base rates are still pretty good, just getting a rough sense though of how maybe there could be some leverage there. This is more going to be a sort of volume opportunity as you look forward over the course of the next couple of quarters.","Scott Davis","Yes, well not all volumes are created equally and I think that Jim maybe you can expand a little bit on our focus there.","Jim Barber","Yes, a couple of things that are also going on, I think that to recognize certainly in Europe, the supply chains are moving too, they don\u2019t remain static. So some of the big supply chains around the world the customers are trying to optimize their networks, we work with them to do that, so the zones move, the distribution patterns move, so our trans-border growth in Europe, a lot of that was to support moving distribution patterns that shorten up zone, that affects the yield of the package, but our job is to create the margins in the new networks. So we\u2019re very comfortable with that.","I also made an opening comment that I think is important which is our middle market acceleration we\u2019ve seen in last couple of quarters and we really haven\u2019t seen this in the past as our middle market is now outpacing some of our larger gold enterprise accounts. And then the other thing that\u2019s going on I think of material nature is the high-tech industry and those product launches have kind of laid down. So in the middle of all that, some of internal optimization investments seem to be paying dividends and what they\u2019ll move forward and we\u2019ll leverage all that together.","Scott Davis","What encouraging Jim in that quarter too is while we still saw the slower products grow at double-digit pace, we still saw express grow at 4% to 5% pace internationally which is a good sign to see express markets still growing.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Ms. Allison Landry if Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse","I wanted to ask about growth in Europe and specifically the strength that you\u2019ve seen in the Pan European business. Can you give us a sense of the contribution of this segment to international profit margins and returns on invested capital? And do you think Europe as a whole will be able to achieve margins that are similar to the U.S. at some point?","Kurt Kuehn","Yes, as you know, we don\u2019t breakdown margins specifically by area of the world. But clearly the international business has been a great business for us and Europe is our flagship over half of our revenues are European based. So we want to get into more detail, but we do think Europe\u2019s here to stay and that the business model Jim, that you\u2019re managing is in pretty good shape.","Jim Barber","Yes, I think the underpinning as Kurt said I think margins by product will keep away from. I think it\u2019s more about the network and its capability to react to the market, the single market that\u2019s there today and we\u2019ve been building that effectively from my perspective since about \u201896. And it\u2019s in great shape and we continue invest in it and we\u2019re very happy with the returns on capital and we\u2019ll keep investing where that makes sense for us and for our customers.","Kurt Kuehn","That\u2019s absolutely right. I think the European networks are built a lot like the U.S. network and we\u2019re getting excellent returns on invested capital in that network.","Operator","And we have a question from the line of Mr. Kevin Sterling of BB&T Capital Markets. Please go ahead sir.","Kevin Sterling - BB&T Capital Markets","Just kind of dive in and maybe taking a different look at international. You talked about the strength we saw in the first quarter. I think, it sounds like April\u2019s off to a good start. I think you also said there is an improvement in your (forwarding) [ph] business on a net revenue basis. And you could about a little bit what\u2019s going on there? Is that just kind of strength you\u2019re seeing in the overall international economy? Or maybe you\u2019re getting some market share gains there as well?","Scott Davis","So as the opening comments alluded too, yes we are. Tonnage is up, we know that, the yield is really kind of still pressured. And when I say that, what I mean is, a few quarters ago I talked about concentration in hi-tech in military and making sure that we try to diversify through that. The team is doing good job with respect to that in some lanes the markets still are tough to actually get the buy sell jokes right. We\u2019re very, very happy with the ocean product, with the brokerage product, with a North American air freight products. So we\u2019re just -- we\u2019re very focused on and have some projects in the pipeline right now that kind of get up that air freight so we continue the momentum there. So we feel like we\u2019re hitting on three of the four cylinders with the fourth one being worked on in a pretty good way right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Ben Hartford of Baird. Please go ahead.","Ben Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co.","So, I think Scott had said that the international outlook was more or less unchanged, the total volume growth in the quarter up 8% above I think the target that you had provided for the beginning -- for the full year 4% to 6%. I am wondering if we should expect that rate of growth to decelerate through the year to converge towards that target. And then I am also, in conjunction with that, can you provide any context to how you see the growth between non-premium and premium products trending through the year as well? Thanks.","Scott Davis","Yes great couple of pieces there, but I think we did show very strong growth in the first quarter, but surprised us to positive just a little bit. There is a little bit of a benefit of the Easter timing I think in the first quarter. Easter was right at the break between Q1 and Q2 last year so there may be a little extra beef in Q1 that would put a little drag on Q2. As far as the trends on premium versus standard, I\u2019ll let Jim talk to that little bit.","Jim Barber","Yes I think again I think as I mentioned a minute ago, four-five quarters of growth and I would combine that with the acquisition comment I made in the opening in the UK\u2019s and the Poland\u2019s and the Turkey markets for example. A lot of this is from good solid growth in the domestic product now four-five quarters in a row so you start to get lapping yourself quite frankly from that perspective. Therefore the end of the year looks a little bit different than the first, but we keep talking about that in a momentum basis. So, what that kind of outlook that you see on paper is certainly, we want to focus on the export and then combining that with the domestics in the markets where we currently are will in the future have the great capabilities.","Operator","And we have a question from the line of Thomas Kim of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs","I had a couple questions just related to the Europe part, one was just, can you parse out the organic growth related to Europe, if you were able to parse out the harvesting of the recent investments.","And then I guess just one of the other sort of comments or questions is, wondering if you could elaborate on the mix shift change that\u2019s happened in Europe where your non-premium is growing more than premium and should we be thinking about that mix shift change similar to the way that we\u2019ve been seeing it sort of evolve over in Asia where you\u2019ve had increase in deferred impacting the overall mix and pricing? Thanks.","Kurt Kuehn","Yes let me piece the parts of that so I can combine for you here. First off the issue of the organic is everything is organic right now. The acquisitions were several years ago, so there is no material acquisitions above all, really the only notable acquisition is in the healthcare space and that did not impact the results at all. The whole issue of managing the mix changes, it makes a big difference if it\u2019s -- that you\u2019re seeing trade down against the same asset. That\u2019s been the challenge in Asia where you\u2019ve gone from express to slower modes and if you don\u2019t adapt, then you\u2019re stuck with lower revenue on a fixed asset.","But the whole nature of the UPS network is to allow customers to move up and down and I\u2019ll tell you there is a huge difference in capital employed between a package moving from Asia to Europe in a 747 versus a package moving across Europe in our integrated ground network. So the capital required and the returns are substantially different and so we\u2019re very happy to see robust growth through our integrated network.","And then to Jim\u2019s point, as we grow the domestic business, what that does is it lowers the pickup and delivery cost for all products. So that\u2019s the benefit of the portfolio that these products reinforce themselves and we get both economy of scale as we get bigger in each country and economy of scope as we have complementary product. So as Scott said, Europe is very much following the lessons we\u2019ve learned from the U.S. capital returns and investment and we\u2019re happy to get standard volume there or premium.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Rob Salmon of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Kurt a quick housekeeping item can you give us a sense if the new Teamster contract is incorporated into the current guidance because it\u2019s not yet finalized and then Jim two quick follow ups with regard to the European network. With the stronger than expected growth that we\u2019ve been seeing to-date, are there any sort of necessary incremental capital investments within the ground network and can you talk a little bit about the density within your line haul network in Europe and how that compares to U.S. currently? Thanks.","Kurt Kuehn","Okay Teamster I\u2019ll break ranks and answer two questions because the answer to the first one is one word, and that is yes in our guidance. Jim may be you could talk about the capital expansion for Europe and whether it\u2019s material.","Jim Barber","Yes so I would say that certainly in the network today, part of the ongoing process and numbers we give you every year the capital is in there, but I would also say yes to the question is we have to keep investing in that network. We talked about Cologne today but our big hubs in Germany and the UK, we\u2019re investing in Turkey hubs as we speak, so yes there is continued capital requirements, but again that\u2019s all baked into the overall network and bringing the customers in that they choose the network. So we\u2019re very, very comfortable with that.","As far as density and line haul network question, the really different networks to be honest with you, the way we run the networks European wise versus U.S. is the different and the mix of the carriers and how we actually take those products across the single market in the UPS or Partnership or contractors is different, so you really can\u2019t compare the two networks from my perspective, but again I think the networks in Europe are performing across the business beautifully and they\u2019ll continue to do so.","Kurt Kuehn","Yes I guess one comment on Europe that clearly we cycled through this as the one year anniversary of us bidding good bye to the attempt to purchase TNT. During the period of negotiation and work with TNT, we clearly put some projects on hold, both strategic projects and opportunities and also capital expansion until we were sure how we\u2019d optimize new assets. So, we certainly are in a period right now of to some extent facing the next five years with an aggressive organic approach. And we are thrilled to make investments to grow our integrated ground network in Europe.","Operator","And we have a question from the line of Keith Shoemaker of Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Keith Shoemaker - Morningstar","Yes, a quick follow up on the capital investment. Given the growth in Europe and the mixed realized, do you anticipate making adjustments to the air fleet or is this what you needed for now?","Kurt Kuehn","No the air fleet is in great shape, as we said, David in the airline finished purchasing 767s last year and David, I think at least as far as the foreseeable future, we don\u2019t expect any major capital additions.","David Abney","No we don\u2019t have any plans to buy any aircraft in the next few years. We have of course been able to increase our load factor and the biggest focus is just on improving the quality of the revenue that\u2019s in our aircraft and with the fact that our expedited volume has grown, has given us a lot of flexibilities on how do we actually put that our aircraft, do we do something else with it or do we hold it for a day to more fully utilize the aircraft. So it\u2019s giving us lot of flexibility.","Jim Barber","And this is Jim, I would add one comment to it parallel to the opening comments is the network in Europe as an intra-European fleet is in great shape as everybody is saying. The real -- the fun part of this right now given where we are is through the emerging markets is to adapt and connect it globally across world in a different way and the teams are working on that and as we go forward that would probably be likely where the adaptations come to the network to connect to the European network versus changing the core of it.","Operator","We have a question from the line of John Barnes of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets","Just trying to keep track of the kind of investment that you were talking about in terms of being prepared for peak season and understanding that when you look at not in the next 10 years have been normal days in Thanksgiving and Christmas not the compressed period. Just trying to get a sense of what percentage of the investment is being made with capital dollars to address network, maybe deficiencies on a long-term basis versus what percentage may be, you're going to address using operating dollars, might be for temporary employees or something like that. How are you trying to balance that investment?","Kurt Kuehn","I\u2019ll start off and then David can fill you may be on the status of it. We\u2019ve really quoted a couple of numbers; one that we\u2019re expanding our capital investments in general broadly to expand capacity in the U.S. and automate facilities. Those are long-term investments that stand regardless of the peak issue. The other is we are doing some things on the technology side, on the customer alignment side and on the flexible capacity side and that\u2019s really driving that 100 million expense headwind this year, that\u2019s more of a one-time issue. And Dave maybe you could expand a little.","David Abney","Certainly well, our peak planning committee has been focusing all this year made solid progress. And when it comes to capacity we are taking two approaches. The permanent capacity will help us throughout the years and Kurt referred to that a little bit but the North Bay Automation retrofit project is an example of that. We\u2019re also increasing the capacity of CACH, our Chicago Consolidated Hub and we\u2019re also adding some trailer capability in Worldport, both from an unload and a load standpoint.","But then the other thing we\u2019re doing is temporary what we call mobile capacity, that we can move from peak to peak, from building to building. And it\u2019s adding, we\u2019re going to add nearly 10% car positions this year, it\u2019s over 6,000 car positions. And in general we call mobile distribution units and these will be addressing specific temporary needs. But if those needs change next year, we'll just simply move that capability from year-to-year.","Operator","And we have a question from the line of Mr. David Ross of Stifel. Please go ahead.","David Ross - Stifel Nicolaus","Real quickly on the ground side, U.S. domestic ground volumes ex-SmartPost, what do they grow year-over-year in the first quarter and how are they trending in April?","Scott Davis","They were up moderately and I think trends in April as we said once now that the weather has cleared continue very steadily, it\u2019s why we feel pretty good on the U.S. economic outlook.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Kelly Dougherty of Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Kelly Dougherty - Macquarie Capital","I just wanted to follow up on the mix conversation. Should we think about these mix trends as secular trends that will accelerate or do we expect some kind of normalization if only from easier comps. And just wondering if you can give us a sense of what yields might look like after you incorporate your base rate increases and then what\u2019s going on the mix side of things?","Scott Davis","Yes, there is a couple of big dimensions and I\u2019ll let Alan talk a little bit about it. That some of them are cyclical and some of them are long-term trends, certainly the continuing growth of B2C both in the U.S. and globally is something that\u2019s here to stay. But things like weight increasing or decreasing or near shoring versus far shoring are things that come and go a bit.","Kurt Kuehn","Yes, let me add a point before Alan gets in. It\u2019s only the first quarter exaggerated though with the weather. And we hit commercial manufacturing harder than it hit obviously ecommerce, so what you saw in the first quarter was exaggerated.","Alan Gershenhorn","I think certainly the -- we\u2019re going to continue to see strong residential growth and I think you\u2019ll see it across all of our residential products whether its air, ground or SurePost as retailers are out there offering wide variety of services to their customers to meet the varying needs. Certainly these last few quarters, we\u2019ve seen our commercial growth turned positive on the ground which is a good sign also. And I think that while there's certainly been a significant amount of down-trading in the marketplace, we believe that the express market will come back as the economy gets better and global trade increases.","Scott Davis","And we\u2019re not uncomfortable with these trends. We still think for the last nine months of this year will generate 14% margins in the U.S. We did that really in 2012 in the first three quarters of 2013. So with our technologies, our network we could still generate good margins on B2C.","Kelly Dougherty - Macquarie Capital","Is there any way you think about once you incorporate mix, so what yield may look like?","Scott Davis","That\u2019s a bit speculative for right now and we\u2019ll move onto next question.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs","Thanks.","Operator","And we have a question from the line of Jack Atkins of Stephens. Please go ahead.","Jack Atkins - Stephens Inc.","Good morning guys. Thanks for the time. So I guess focusing on the international airfreight side of things for a moment, trends thus far in 2014 seem to indicate they were seeing some modest sustained improvement there for the first time in a couple of years. So I guess could you comment on what do you think is really driving that. Is it a better global economic picture? Do you think maybe it\u2019s inventory restocking or is this something else and do you feel like these trends are sustainable for 2014 and may be beyond?","Jim Barber","I would say was all of what you just mentioned plus one and that is that, that our customers don\u2019t stay static with their supply chains and they move them and they\u2019re trying to optimize their supply chains and they\u2019re moving from small package at times to airfreight and airfreight to ocean and ocean to a domestic on another continent. So our job is to be ready for that and be one step or right in lock step with them, so that is -- and I think the other thing that you should keep in mind is that, that\u2019s kind of the power of the UPS offering is we don\u2019t run a pure freight network, it\u2019s a hybrid and we\u2019ve got a lot of options depending on how the customers choose to come to us. So there is a lot of factors going on and we just got to make sure we\u2019re supportive of really the needs and the request of our customers.","Scott Davis","And I guess one of the nice things is, we did see and are seeing some rebound in exports out of Asia on the freight side, but Alan we\u2019re also seeing quite a of strength south of the border, right?","Alan Gershenhorn","Yes, so on the U.S. Mexico lane there, we\u2019ve launched on the package side a standard ground service to and from Mexico which on a small base right now is experiencing very, very significant growth on a percentage basis, so we\u2019re really excited about that. We\u2019ve got our cross border connect product on the freight side, that\u2019s also experiencing good growth. And I would just add to Jim\u2019s comment that, the portfolio that we\u2019re positioning with our customers is also I think allowing us to penetrate the airfreight market in a bigger way and I think you\u2019re going to see some broader gains in that area for us. And the other last thing I would just say is worldwide express freight we haven\u2019t talked about today, that\u2019s been launched I guess a little bit over a year ago now in a big way and we\u2019re experiencing very, very high growth in that area again on a small base right now, but very well resonating with our customers.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Ms. Helane Becker of Cowen. Please go ahead.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co.","Thanks very much operator. Thanks for the time. You might have talked about this and I just missed it, but can you just talk about why the tax rate went up so much in the first quarter on a year on year basis?","Scott Davis","Yes, Helane we did guide this year that we would be seeing an increase in the tax rate. We retched it up in the middle of last year from the (34 or 35) [ph] that we had in January of last year first quarter and it is now at 36. So we have seen an increase and this is the last quarter at which we\u2019ll have this big of a gap, but it clearly was an increase that just has to do with the mix of profits around the world, our forwarding unit that struggled last year and some of those things impacted our marginal rate. So certainly there is no company more eager to see U.S. tax reform and some rebalancing of rates around the globe than us and we continue to make that a priority and are working with Washington to ensure that U.S. remains competitive.","Kurt Kuehn","Helane we did build the guidance in a 36%, so that was expected.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co.","Right, well I figured you did that but I was just kind of wondering is 30.4% last year going into 6 I think this year, so, okay.","Kurt Kuehn","The 30.4, I\u2019m sorry Helane, that was distorted because of the nature of the TNT settlement, some of the payments were taxable some weren't, but the core rate for last year on the adjusted is 34.5.","Operator","Due to time constraints our last question will come from the line of Mr. Jeff Kauffman of Buckingham. Please go ahead.","Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research","Thank you, and thank you for taking my question. Just wanted to touch base, the cash on the balance sheet's back over 7 billion. I know you mentioned it will cost you some money to exit these remaining pension liabilities. But could you talk a little bit about how much cash you think you need on the balance sheet, because this is almost double what it was at the bottom of the recession here, and just kind of longer-term thoughts on capital deployment.","Kurt Kuehn","Yes, and as Scott said, we had just a huge free cash flow quarter, in Q1 capital expenditures were little low, clearly it\u2019s hard to build buildings in the blizzards. So we\u2019ll ramp some of that up and use some of that cash for capital improvements Jeff, but we do expect to continue strong distributions, the company has no agenda to hoard cash. At the same time we like to have a strong balance sheet. So we\u2019re going to continue with our basic targets of distributing near 100% of net income in the form of dividends and share repurchases and keep a little powder dry for M&A and other strategic initiatives.","Scott Davis","In Q1 Kurt, I think we distributed 140% net income, so Jeff it will be balance. We\u2019ll continue the strong distributions, we\u2019ll continue to reinvest in the business.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Wilkinson. Please go ahead sir.","Scott Davis","Well let me just -- this is Scott, I\u2019ll do a quick recap. It was clearly the first quarter was a challenge, but again as we talked about the rest of 2014 looks quite promising. The economy though is still not robust, it\u2019ll be better than what we saw last year, both here in the U.S. and globally. What I am excited about is the UPS we\u2019re going to be hitting it on all cylinders as all three segments for business will show nice improvements in operating profit over the last nine months of this year. And frankly we\u2019ve not seen all three segments improve at the same time since 2010. So look for good things ahead from UPS and thanks for being on the call today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, it does conclude our conference call for today.

My name is Brad. I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Joe Wilkins, Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead, sir. The floor is yours.","Joe Wilkins","Good morning and welcome to the UPS fourth quarter 2014 earnings call. Joining me today are David Abney, our CEO; Kurt Kuehn, our CFO, along with International President, Jim Barber; President of U.S. Operations, Myron Gray and Chief Commercial Officer, Alan Gershenhorn.","Before we begin, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the company. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties which are described in detail in or 2013 Form 10-K and 2014 10-Qs. These reports are available on the UPS investor relations website and from the Securities and Exchange Commission.","As previously disclosed there were two accounting events that influenced our fourth quarter and full year results. First, expense recognition related to our company-sponsored pension and postretirement plans. A 90 basis point decline in average year-end discount rates more than offset improved asset returns. This led to a noncash mark-to-market after tax charge of $670 million.","Second, recent contract gratifications triggered the recognition of $22 million in after tax charges for our second quarter transfer of certain Teamster employees to union healthcare plans, neither of these charges affect benefits paid to plan participants or required pension funding. Ignoring the impact of these charges, diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1.25 and GAAP earnings were $0.49. A tutorial has been provided on the IR website to provide additional information on mark-to-market accounting.","In our remarks today, all quarterly and full year comments and comparisons will refer to adjusted results. In addition, we will discuss UPS's free cash flow which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The webcast of today's call along with a reconciliation of free cash flow and adjusted results, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website\u00a0and just a reminder, as on previous calls, please ask only one question so that we may allow as many as possible to participate.","Now we'll turn the call over to David.","David Abney","Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings review. By now I suspect almost everyone on the call reviewed the press release and Kurt's audio message from January 23, those that did understand that we're disappointed in fourth quarter financial results but pleased with our strong service levels. Peak season 2014 provided us an opportunity to deliver excellent service during periods where UPS volume more than doubles. To meet the challenge, we invested in capacity with new facilities, automation and expanded operations. It was important to fortify the trust of customers and protect our brand and from that perspective, UPS was successful.","UPSers around the world went the extra mile to ensure service levels remained high throughout the holiday season and our customers were delighted with the results. The management team and I received numerous calls and emails from customers of all sizes. They expressed their appreciation for the efforts of UPSers. I'm extremely proud of our team and the service they provided this year. And while we met our commitments to serve customers, we certainly did not achieve our financial objectives. Executing an efficient operating plan to meet the surge in demand is complex.","Ultimately, we erred on the side of caution and built an operating plan that would provide superior service if volume levels exceeded expectations, contributing to higher than expected costs.","In addition, the rapid growth of online retail over the last few years has pushed us beyond our normal peak workload and limited our traditional economies of scale. To illustrate the enormity of peak season, consider that during this peak we averaged over 30 million deliveries per day. Looking back just two short years ago, that's about 6 million more per day than we handled in 2012. In those two years, we saw peak volumes go from 55% above our average day to 75%. This is a trend we expect to continue as e-commerce expands its influence over the retail sector.","Going forward, there are two clear paths to improved results. As we laid out at our investor conference, UPS will continue our long term initiatives to invest in technology and capabilities, ultimately bending the cost curve lower. While at the same time we will pursue specific revenue initiatives that will improve yields and ensure we achieve our financial objectives.","Looking shorter term, there were obvious cost overruns that will be addressed. On the operating side of the equation, we will improve production with a tighter dispatch, improve helper utilization and reduce overtime. We will expand hub capacity in key areas ultimately reducing the need for temporary sorts. Additional hiring and training costs associated with staffing the new sorts and facilities will be reduced going forward with the permanent capacity expansions. We made the decision to conduct full operations on Black Friday this year with the expectation of smoothing the network during Cyber Week. While we did achieve benefits for our hub and feeder network, the pickup and delivery network was underutilized. In 2015, we will adjust operations as needed.","Purchase transportation expense including contract carriers in TOFC will be optimized with more efficient use in 2015. In addition, we will improve our cost profile through the acceleration of ORION deployment and enhanced operation technology. We will be implementing peak residential surcharges that are differentiated from our nonpeak time of year on a customer segmented basis. These surcharges will focus on SurePost and residential packages. In some cases, these changes will be implemented over a multi-year period as contracts come due. These pricing strategies will be designed to ensure we're properly compensated for the value we provide. We will align revenue with cost, extracting the value for the investment in our network, especially during peak periods.","The control tower was put into effect in 2014 and was mainly focused on capacity management. In 2015, the control tower will continue to focus on capacity management and also be utilized more for revenue and yield growth opportunities. I'm confident our team will manage costs, tighten up the plan, keep service levels high. At the same time, we will implement rational new revenue actions to improve yield during this period. UPS has a high value offering in the market which our customers appreciate. These steps will further align value, cost and yield. Overall, the other two business segments performed fairly well this quarter and Kurt will provide you more details in a moment.","Looking to the future, the global economy is expected to be modestly stronger in 2015 with global GDP and exports increasing at a faster pace. While the U.S. economy is expanding, parts of Europe and Asia are expecting slower growth. Fortunately for UPS, there are opportunities for growth outside general economic expansion.","E-commerce is expected to outpace global GDP growth by fourfold and cross border e-commerce at 7 times. Concentrated investment in growth industries like healthcare and retail put UPS in the position to capitalize on market expansion. One way our government can help advance economic growth is by supporting global trade. We were pleased hearing the President's support for advancing trade promotion authority. We continue to urge Congress to pass PPA legislation that will facilitate new trade agreements. Free trade enables businesses to gain access to new markets and compete on a level playing field.","Before I turn it over to Kurt, I want to emphasize that we're resolute in improving the financial performance of the company. During the next couple of years, the cost initiatives will provide escalating benefits and the revenue strategies will continue to be implemented. We're 100% committed to our long term financial targets that we shared in November. UPS is focused on the key points of our long term strategy which include investing to position UPS for future growth, developing innovative industry-specific solutions and adapting our B2C delivery model to improve profitability.","Keep in mind this is a multi-year transition. 2015 will be a year of progress and we expect solid growth in all three business segments. I'm confident we have the right strategy, the right solutions and the right people to deliver on these objectives.","Now Kurt will take you through the financials.","Kurt Kuehn","Thanks, David and good morning everyone. Back on January 23, I shared with you our performance during peak season and I also committed to provide you additional details on today's call. Now I'll provide you with more information on our results, as well as further insights into what we expect in 2015. UPS fourth quarter earnings per share were $1.25. The U.S. Domestic segment results came in less than planned due to higher than anticipated peak operating costs. Meanwhile International results were in-line when adjusted for currency and onetime items and the supply chain segment was pretty much on plan. On the positive side, our revenue growth was 6.1%, the best we've seen in some time.","Now I'll take you through the segment details. The U.S. Domestic average daily package volume for the quarter was up 6.6% driving total revenue up 7.5%, daily shipments for ground increased by 7% which includes over a 28% jump in SurePost shipments. Deferred Air increased 11% while Next Day Air declined by 3%. The drop in Next Day Air was primarily due to changes in the holiday calendar and distribution channels including the proliferation of omni-channel. This year retailers employing a local distribution strategy increased by 50% and the number of stores participating was up by 30%.","Products distributed closer to the consumer have resulted in some trade down from premium products, package yields declined by 0.8%. Underlying base rate increases were offset by lower fuel surcharges and changes in product mix. This does mark however another quarter of improving trends in both reported yields and underlying base rates. Operating profit was $63 million lower than last year as operating margin contracted 150 basis points to 11.4%. In total, U.S. domestic operating cost was more than $200 million higher than anticipated.","During the quarter, operations ran well in October. However, the opening of an unprecedented number of new buildings and sorts in November caused a notable decline in productivity as operations geared up for peak. Early seasonal hiring and training, as well as working nontraditional operating days, contributed to excess hours. As a result, direct labor hours per day increased by 11%, outside carrier costs were up 65% due to both increased usage and higher rates. Also contributing to the cost overrun was the disruption to our network from the West Coast port dispute. On a positive note, we're seeing benefits from ORION as miles driven increased just 5.8%.","As David mentioned earlier, we're committed to lowering our long term operating costs while at the same time implementing pricing strategies that ensure we're properly compensated for the additional cost of peak season operations.","Now looking at our International segment, the volume growth was healthy and operating profit showed positive momentum. In fact, if you strip away the currency impact and the onetime items, fourth quarter performance was very good. Total International revenue when adjusted for currency was up 5.9% and daily shipments increased by 4.3%. Our International Export volume was up 5.2% with high single digit growth in Europe and double-digit gains on the Europe to U.S. trade lane. Average revenue per package was down 0.6% on a currency-neutral basis. This is actually a continuation of an improving trend in yield.","Total operating profit was flat with last year at $536 million and operating margin declined slightly to 15.6%. International results were negatively impacted by the fluctuations in global currencies, lowering operating profit by $40 million. UPS does hedge the major currencies like the euro, the British pound and the Canadian dollar. However, the volatility and rapid devaluation of our unhedged currencies in comparison to the U.S. dollar weighed on results.","During the quarter, the segment also experienced $30 million in onetime items including a restructuring charge in Europe. The International business experienced increased in-country expenses especially in Europe where demand during peak season exceeded network capacity and did push costs higher.","Now turning to Supply Chain & Freight which performed pretty much in-line with our expectations, revenue was 7.4% higher due to strong growth in Distribution and UPS Freight. Operating profit was up 5% to $179 million with an operating margin of 7.3%. Forwarding revenue improved slightly during the quarter primarily from strength in North American Air Freight. Operating profits declined as gains in Ocean and North America were offset by the continued challenges in the International Air Freight unit. Distribution revenue was up more than 10% while operating profit improved by 9%. Growth in the retail and healthcare sectors offset a slight decline in high tech. UPS Freight expanded operating profit and margin over the prior year. Revenue increased by 8.6% to $773 million during the fourth quarter. LTL tonnage increased by 5% and LTL revenue per hundredweight was up 2.4%.","Now for an update on our cash position, for the full year 2014, UPS generated $3.4 billion in free cash flow. This includes after tax contributions of $800 million to company sponsored pension plans and $1.5 billion for the transfer of certain union employees to multi-employer healthcare plans. UPS made capital expenditures of approximately $2.3 billion, slightly below our $2.5 billion guidance due to the timing of project payments at year-end. In addition, the company paid dividends of $2.4 billion, an increase of 8.1% per share. UPS repurchased 26.4 million shares for approximately $2.7 billion. In total, the company returned over 100% of net income to shareowners in 2014.","Looking now at our expectations for 2015, as we look at the year, continued investment in making the business model more flexible and adaptable will weigh more on operating margin expansion than originally anticipated. However, this is absolutely the right thing to do to position UPS to capitalize on future market growth opportunities. The company expects growth across all business units with earnings per share of 6% to 12%. This includes a $240 million headwind from pension expense and currency. Overall operating profit is expected to improve 5% to 9%. Total shipments per day are anticipated to rise about 4% with revenue up 3% to 4%. Excluding the fuel impact, underlying revenue growth would be 5% to 6%.","Now looking at the segments, the U.S. Domestic Package volume is expected to increase by approximately 4% with revenue up at a similar rate. We're expecting solid base rate improvements due to dim weight and other and other pricing initiatives. However, the gains will be mostly offset by lower fuel surcharges which will be around a 200 basis point drag on package yield. Operating profit is anticipated to increase by 5% to 9%. International shipments should grow by 3% to 4% with revenue growth of 2% to 3%. Falling surcharges in International will lower yields by approximately 300 basis points. Operating profit is expected to increase by 6% to 12% with currency being a $50 million drag.","Supply Chain & Freight revenue is expected to grow 2% to 3% as faster growth in Distribution and UPS Freight is offset by revenue management actions that we will be taking in Forwarding. Operating profit is expected to increase approximately 5% with modest margin improvement. UPS Freight will be challenged by the decline in fuel surcharge revenue as it isn't fully compensatory at the current low fuel prices. Total company 2015 diluted earnings per share are anticipated to increase 6% to 12% to a range of $5.05 to $5.30 and our effective tax rate is anticipated to be about 35.5%.","Looking specifically at the quarters, there will be variability in the quarterly results due to the year-over-year comparisons. We expect the first and fourth quarters' earnings per share growth of be higher than the year's average while the second and third quarters will fall below. Looking at the balance sheet, we're planning 2015 capital expenditures of approximately 5% of revenue or about $3 billion as hub automation and capacity expansion projects accelerate. Share repurchases in 2015 are expected to be $2.7 billion continuing our philosophy of robust distributions to shareowners and of course, dividend growth will remain a priority.","So 2014 was a year of demonstrating our ability to handle the peak surges and we met that challenge. 2015 will be a year of continuous improvement and positioning UPS for the future. Advances in our strategic initiatives have great potential for the company. E-commerce growth, operations technology implementation, emerging market expansion and industry-specific solutions will all provide momentum for UPS as we move throughout this year and into the future.","Well thanks for listening. That completes our prepared remarks and we're ready to take your questions. I'll turn it back to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please go ahead.","Chris Wetherbee - Citi","Just wanted to ask I guess a question on pricing and the outlook for 2015. Kurt, as you kind of laid out the Domestic outlook on the revenue side, ex the fuel headwind, it seems like maybe there is I think a consistent amount of core pricing embedded in the guidance. I guess I just want to understand, as you're taking on some of these pricing initiatives to offset some of these costs, how quickly can you start to realize that? How much is in 2015? Does it take a little bit longer, 2016, 2017 and beyond to catch up on that pricing side? Thanks.","Kurt Kuehn","Yes. Chris, you're right. There is certainly underlying momentum and if you look at the quarter-to-quarter changes, you can begin to see some of that picking up already. We did say at our investor conference that we expect our base rates to be at the high end of the 2% to 3% targets that we normally have. So we're well on our way towards that, but it is a long term process and I'll have Alan talk a little bit about some of the moving parts with that.","Alan Gershenhorn","Yes, so we're certainly expecting throughout 2015 including peak, to see additional revenue for piece improvements just like Kurt alluded to last year. We saw quarter-over-quarter gains from the second, third to the fourth quarter and that's going to continue into 2015. Certainly the Ground dim weight changes are going to impact the 2015 results. We're also continuing to work with our customers on their packaging to obtain mutual cost reductions. So we will see a little bit of impact there on the cost side. So we're going to see improvements throughout 2015 and it is going to be on the high end of the 2% to 3%.","Kurt Kuehn","Yes, although it certainly will be masked a bit, as I said, with fuel surcharges down a couple hundred basis points, but we feel very confident that the underlying momentum is strong.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of David Vernon with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","David Vernon","So it sounds like the overshoot on costs in this fourth quarter and I'm trying to understand how the $200 million extra that we spent in the fourth quarter kind of plays into the guidance for next year. Should we be expecting that that level of inefficiency that we saw in the fourth quarter you guys are sort of baking some of that into the model or are you guys also adding additional operating expense into 2015 that's keeping that cost recovery that we had been expecting in this year from last year out of the numbers and out of the guidance numbers?","Kurt Kuehn","Yes, maybe let's start, David, I know, wanted to at least put a recap onto peak season of 2014. He can talk a little bit about what our intentions were and then we can migrate from that into guidance.","David Abney","Yes, first, our main priority going into peak was protecting the brand. After 2013, we just felt that was something we absolutely had to do. We were successful in doing that. We also made significant progress working with our customers in forecasting capacity, vision, visibility and communications, but the cost associated with providing this quality of service was greater than expected. We built our operating plans to accommodate higher volume and that was based on the volume surge of 2013. So we certainly erred on the side of caution. We did overbuild to some extent and that is the basis for some of our 2015 initiatives where we will be able to eliminate some of that expense lessons learned from 2014.","Kurt Kuehn","So I think as we look into 2015, we were certainly a little concerned and surprised at the challenges of opening up so many operations in November. It's really unprecedented for us and that was the primary disconnect I think that happened between where we thought we were heading. Just bringing that much capacity on after what had been a breakneck speed on the engineering and operations side getting ready overshot. So we're a little cautious I guess going forward, twice burned thrice wise and so as we look into 2015, this forecast does assume that a higher portion of that expense -- the peak season added expense stays with us.","Clearly over time, we will work through it, but right now at least that guidance does assume more drag in the fourth quarter. Certainly the revenue will help to cover that because we do feel that cost is maybe more structural than we thought. That's why we're focusing more on revenue. We do think over time though fourth quarter will become much more profitable. It wasn't too many years ago, just a couple of years ago where the fourth quarter was our most profitable quarter but it is going to take us a few years to get there.","David Vernon","And does the guide also have some of that peak season surcharge in it as well?","Kurt Kuehn","Some portion, yes.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Brandon Oglenski","Kurt, coming off that comment about how the fourth quarter used to be the most profitable. I mean, you know, David in your prepared remarks here, obviously your customers like the service that you provide in the fourth quarter definitely better than where you were in 2013 and with 6% volume growth and operating earnings down, I'm sure customers do like that outcome, but your shareholders obviously have a little bit different priorities here which a lot of them are taking significant risk investing in a cyclical stock like yours.","And if we can't convert the upside right now in a very robust growth period, ultimately we're going to be exposed to a lot of cyclical downside whenever the economy does potentially roll over. So I guess with you being in the leadership role here for the last half year now, what is the real priority of UPS going forward for the next few years because it's been a while since you guys have hit your long term earnings growth targets and it seems like the discussion here is all about additional capacity, additional service. It doesn't sound like there's a lot of aggressiveness to take yield from customers which are obviously benefiting from all these additions you have put in the network.","So can you tell your shareholders what is the priority here? Is it really returns and a financial focus or is it more about protecting the brand and potentially this is a cycle where we just don't hit those long term growth targets because we're putting so much capacity in the marketplace and underestimating on the pricing ability?","David Abney","Well first, let me tell you that we certainly take our responsibility to our investors very seriously. In fact, when I talk about this first priority of protecting the brand, we believe that was necessary in order to take care of the interest of our investors, but let me focus on and I know we covered it at the investors conference, but, based on peak, I'll really focus on a couple of things to solve the peak issues that we saw and then we can of course talk about the entire year of 2015.","One is it is a cost reduction story and we're going to ask Myron in just a second to really focus on some specific things that we're doing that will be in the best interest of the shareholders, lessons learned, lessons learned, things that we will be able to improve this year. We can also talk a little more long term. But the other thing and we mentioned it at the investor conference, but the tone is much, much stronger today is that we're taking this revenue management side very serious. The fact that we realized some of these extra costs in peak are going to be with us for a few years has just made us that much more determined. So what you're hearing today is that we absolutely will charge our customers more for the extra costs that we have in peak and that we absolutely are pushing our foot down harder from a revenue management side.","So Myron, why don't you talk a little bit about some of the cost initiatives and what you're going to do this year?","Myron Gray","Thank you, David. We will continue to ultimately bend the cost curve lower by our continued deployment of ORION, by the end of 2015, we will have over 70% of our drivers deployed. We'll continue with automation and modernization and then, of course, there are other operational technologies and innovations that we'll continue to focus on such as driving density with SDS, SurePost Redirect and we're going to continue with our deployment of Access Points to take cost out of the system.","As David and Kurt both alluded to earlier, we erred on the side of caution considering the peak surge of 2013. However, there were a lot of lessons that were learned. I'll give you just one example, we made the decision to conduct a full operation on Black Friday in the intention of smoothing out demand on our network during cyber week. While that benefited our hub and feeder operations, we did underutilize our pickup and delivery operations. We'll make the necessary adjustments in 2015 to cut the cost.","David Abney","And just wanted to sum that question up, we\u2019re certainly focused on our long term strategies. We're 100% committed to the long term financials that we reviewed for the time period 2015 through 2019 during our investor conference. So we have not backed up from those numbers. We do have some challenges that we have to address and we certainly will do so.","Operator","And we have a question from the line of Tom Wadewitz from UBS. Please go ahead.","Tom Wadewitz","I wanted to focus a little bit more on the revenue actions that you're talking about. It sounds like this is primarily focused on peak, but is there any element of saying that's broad or that says we just need to be more aggressive on price and so we're going to look for more in base rate with our B2C shippers? And also I guess just in terms of understanding the magnitude I think you said $200 million difference in cost in fourth quarter. I don't know if you would say it is $200 million or more than that shortfall in operating income probably more than that. So is half of that shortfall going to be on these peak season price changes, so you're looking for a couple hundred million or what's just the magnitude of that pricing change when you look at the peak? Thanks.","Kurt Kuehn","Well clearly Tom, the solution for the fourth quarter for us in peak is really two-pronged. We're going to need to improve operations, streamline it, lessons learned, find how can we scale up 100% without driving our marginal cost so high that it's unprofitable and we've got a number of initiatives there both physical capacity and operating changes. And then the other path equally important is the yield side to make sure that for that disproportionate increase, we do need to increase yield and also as we've talked, certainly we're more focused on yield in aggregate because of the -- last year was a brand-building and capacity-building and this year clearly the value is there. So Alan can talk a little more on the revenue side.","Alan Gershenhorn","Yes certainly, as we said before, the Ground dim weight changes are going to amplify the impact in 2015 and go a long way to increasing the yields and specifically in the B2C market, as well as more broadly and as peak has become more costly, there has been additional pressure on the margin. So going forward, we do plan to better align the revenue against this increased cost. So we're going to focus on residential and peak surcharges for specific customer segments and we're firming our strategy to better align revenue with costs during peak season as well as throughout the year. Certainly also very focused on the value creation that UPS does with our customers and ensuring that we're getting paid for that.","David Abney","One other addition to the peak pricing is this past year we really focused on a control tower from a capacity management standpoint and we had a lot of success from that end. This year, the control tower is still going to be focused on capacity management, but also will be focused on taking more revenue action for those real peak weeks. So it's going to be a big step for us from a revenue management standpoint.","Kurt Kuehn","I think one thing maybe we could bridge to a little bit is certainly the revenue management is a critical part of peak. Outside the U.S. where we're a little farther ahead with some of our alternative delivery modes, we're looking at both revenue enhancement and also some cost reduction with our Access Points network. So Jim maybe you could talk a little bit about how the e-commerce surge is working for you guys internationally.","Jim Barber","Sure. I think that, Kurt to that point, I think one thing you have to first look to is that as you move outside the U.S., depending on what part of the world you are in, you have got different market characteristics, capabilities and situations and operating models. So it really does present us some unique opportunities as we've grown this International business to experiment in different ways. ","Our Access Points are up to about 16,000 outside the U.S., when we bought that company; they were at about 6500 so we've organically over doubled that network. It's providing us good opportunity and benefits in this B2C space to actually get at this and provide different solutions to customers and you would also probably have noted the acquisition of i-parcel that gets us into this cross-border e-commerce as well here recently that we plan to roll out globally. So lots of change on the forefront and International provides us a great platform to experiment and grow the business.","Operator","And we do have question from the line of Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Bill Greene","Kurt or David, I wanted to ask you about the rest of the year. So obviously, peak has all of its challenges that we're aware of given the increase in the peak volumes and you'll do what you can with the surcharges and whatnot and I'm sure you'll work hard on the cost there, but is there something to be said for trying to smooth this out not by managing peak but more increasing the volume in first, second and third quarters to the point where if we have added structural costs, the average profitability in the other periods gets much better and peak will just do what peak does? So the real key here is getting more balance through increasing throughput in the first three quarters to adjust for those structural costs. Is there an argument for that or does that not make sense in your mind?","Kurt Kuehn","Well, Bill, it's a great argument. We would love to have the rest of the year pumped up that high if we could scale to it. Certainly what you're seeing is an industry in transition and part of the challenges that we're wrestling with is this factor of peak versus the rest of the year has gotten much more extreme. So what used to have very low marginal cost for us as we grew the volume has gone beyond that. I think one silver lining to your comment is that we're seeing an uptick in our commercial growth. Our B2B business was up over 3% in the fourth quarter.","So as the U.S. economy has begun to broaden its expansion and the industrial manufacturing components grow, that does actually help to grow the other quarters frankly. What we have seen up until last year was a small package growth business driven primarily by B2C which exaggerates the Q4. So Alan I know has a big focus on these industry-specific solutions and Alan, maybe you could talk about how are we tackling the opportunity and the rest of the segments.","Alan Gershenhorn","We've certainly seen a revitalization of growth outside of the B2C retail market. Five of our top six industries are growing now and we're very, very focused on healthcare, high tech and the industrial manufacturing segment and creating value for those segments to create more year-round type of opportunities for UPS versus the peakiness of retail.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Nate Brochmann with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Nate Brochmann","I wanted to follow up back on Tom's question regarding the pricing and getting the surcharges and that certainly all makes sense in terms of going back and getting paid for all that high service. But how far kind of going back to a question not too, too long ago, how far do you think you can really push that without foreseeing those various shippers to go in a different direction? You\u2019ve often talked about maybe some competing opportunities out there for them and I know it's a growing space, but how do you balance that in terms of pushing that price to the point where you don't push your shippers to go think of different alternatives?","Kurt Kuehn","Clearly that's the judgment that we have. We have long term relationships with our customers and we tend not to have dramatic price swings as part of the value proposition as a large company for us to do. But that is clearly part of the activity and Alan, I know you guys have talked about but this is really a multi-year cycle as contracts come due, right?","Alan Gershenhorn","Yes. So you're right, but we do have a long history of revenue management that balances aligning the revenue with the cost and also the value that we provide to our customers while maintaining a fair and rational pricing environment. So we think that the GRI we just implemented, the dim weight changes that we're already seeing the effect on are going to pay some dividends in 2015. It is a multi-year process with some of our customers because they do have multi-year agreements, but we do expect to see positive results from the actions we're taking during 2015.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Ken Hoexter","In terms of using the tower for volume seemed to work well in trying to allay some of the volumes to different dates, but adding 100,000 temp workers for a few days. How quickly can the surcharges be implemented to smooth out those peak days and when you think about getting a return on the investment for the $3 billion? You're jumping CapEx nearly 30%. So just wondering the balance of those permanent costs in hiring 100,000 workers with the returns on those price increases?","Kurt Kuehn","Yes, it is very difficult to just will the tower ever recover. Your incremental costs for just those few pieces over a threshold are challenging, that will be just one of many mechanisms that we deploy. So it is a multipronged process. We've accomplished the first step which was maintaining and sustaining the value of the brand and our commitment to our customers and going forward, as we said, we'll both reduce our costs with more streamlined operations as we get a little smarter in handling these spikes and also pursue revenue in a number of fronts, not just control tower.","David Abney","As we invest in the capacity of our buildings and facilities and vehicles and others, you got to remember that we still expect a real high return on invested capital. And we've said before, we'll continue to say that we expect a 25% to 30% return. So these investments are made with the investor in mind and it is to get the return that our investors have become used to and that we certainly are committed to continuing.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Kevin Sterling with BB&T Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Kevin Sterling","Kurt, I think in your prepared remarks you talked about products being closer to the consumer which resulted in some trade down from premium products. I want to ask you kind of going forward do you think this trade down will continue as you say more distribution centers are built? I would think this trend might continue that way, but I would love to hear your thoughts looking forward regarding products closer to the consumer in the trade down.","Kurt Kuehn","Yes, Kevin, I guess there is really two things that are going on. One of them is really a comparison to last year where a number of customers given the challenges of peak accelerated and traded up, but the other one is more of a structural issue and we do think that Next Day Air, at least for B2C fulfillment is likely to decline over time. We think the B2B as the industrial base grows there is good opportunity. But, Alan, I know this omni-commerce omni-channel is quite a trend that's revolutionizing retail.","Alan Gershenhorn","Yes, so like we've said before we're seeing a significant amount more of our brick-and-mortar retailers utilizing the inventory from their stores to fulfill the e-commerce needs of their distribution centers. So this year, we've got about 120 retailers, nearly 22,000 stores that have the ability to ship packages now using omni-channel solutions and this year we've added about 41 retailers and more than 5000 stores in 2014. So we expect this trend to continue and certainly echo Kurt's comments on how the retail industry and e-commerce is going to handle the overnight or shorter shipping timeframes.","Kurt Kuehn","It does make for some year-over-year changes in distribution patterns that keep us busy though.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Scott Group","So wanted to follow up on the pricing, there has been good kind of broad discussion, but maybe we can put some numbers around it. Is there any way that you can talk about how much your cost per package has gone up domestically and maybe that's a way to quantify how much pricing you need to get to offset that cost? And just along those lines, just want to understand is the idea with the peak surcharges that fourth quarter is going to start being the most profitable margin quarter again?","Kurt Kuehn","Well certainly that's our goal over time, Scott. We think it is the time when the capital is fully deployed, so to recover cost of capital for that it should have our highest margin. It's also the time of the greatest demand. So for I think six years up till 2012 we had I think both the highest margin and the highest profit in the company in the fourth quarter. So is this a challenge for the company? Absolutely. Have we figured it out and operated successfully in the past? Yes. It's just gone beyond that economy of scale to where the added volume is creating diseconomies. We will get this solved. It is a two-pronged process with operational enhancements, some automation, some smart capacity and efficiency and also making sure that price recovers it. So we really can't decompose all of that stuff at this point yet, but it is job one for us and it's a great problem to have. We're disappointed that we over swung last year.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Helane Becker from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Helane Becker","I was just wondering if we could get away from the fourth quarter for a second and just look out to 2015 and the first quarter and what you're seeing. I was just wondering if you can make some general comments about what you're seeing in the economy, maybe with a specific comment to what you're seeing from your corporate accounts who are energy\u00a0focused and if there is something you can fill us in about what you're seeing there.","Kurt Kuehn","Yes, our exposure to the energy sector is not huge. There is not a tremendous amount of small package. But clearly all industries are having an impact over time with this low energy cost. On the procurement side, it will ripple through into reduced prices we hope for things like tires and some of our commodities. Clearly, the fuel surcharge changes our impact. We did mention that the UPS Freight and the LTL surcharges are a bit of a challenge, but we think in general the reduced fuel prices are good for the economy and will help certainly the U.S. continue to grow.","I think trends so far in January -- certainly things look better than they did a year ago at this time because of the incredible disruption of all the snowstorms. Although those people in Detroit and Chicago right now may not be feeling that way. So we feel pretty good in general. I know, Jim, around the globe anyway, the Chinese New Year is a little later than normal. Maybe you could talk a little bit about trade flows and anything you guys are seeing.","Jim Barber","Well I think it's just as you said. We're about where we thought we would be and of course, year-over-year it's different because of weather and some other options. I think the port delays are presenting some unique trade patterns. I think generally though, since that port delay is heavy into the oceanside of the supply chains that really presents some challenges for our customers. We've been at it for a year now actually. We started last February 2014 with webinars with all of our folks and customers to give them solutions and some of that you've seen appear in Myron's side of the business when it actually gets into -- because you've got to get into the port, through the port and out of the port and that's where our network provides some really good options. So I would say the port would be the big one and the wildcard here going forward as it moves from freight off the ocean, not so much into the air, but other surface modes as it appears in the U.S. side of the business.","David Abney","Just a couple things on the economy. one is things seem to be continuing to be going up or getting slowly better in the U.S. Unemployment rates are getting much down, very close to prerecession rates and consumer confidence is increasing and it's one of the reasons that we believe that our revenue is going to continue to grow and grow at a good pace in this year in the U.S. In Europe, of course, there's a lot of concern about the economy there, but our results have been and continue to be much better than we're seeing from an economic standpoint. Jim, could you talk a little bit about the transborder in Europe and the success we've seen there?","Jim Barber","Sure. As we know, the transborder network, we've talked about it many times on the previous calls it continues to drive our growth. You've seen that in the export numbers. Kurt mentioned about a year ago we would continue to reinvest in Europe, his number at that time was about $1 billion. We actually have sized it for the next five years. It's actually above that. We won't get to the specific numbers because there's changes, but it's above $1 billion and we believe that investment in essentially the Western side of the European operations, A, is needed, but, B, can bend that cost curve as we talked about it back to some of the days where it was at its best. So we would continue to do that.","The other wildcard I would mention at the same time though, David is I think the strength of the dollar will have implications going forward that we're going to have to watch as trade patterns move around that, so that would be another wildcard, but we're happy with Europe and its continued growth for the business.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Ben Hartford","Jim, maybe if we could just continue down that path and focus on international freight forwarding for a moment. There was some acknowledged weakness this quarter. I would be interested in your perspective on the yield dynamics in the fourth quarter and how you see that playing out in 2015. It seems as though there is a desire for some more yield discipline in that space, whether that comes through or not, I would be interested in your take. And then also if you could include your perspective on some of the attempted changes from the air freight carriers to comingle fuel surcharge with base rates and what effect that might have for 2015 as well that would be helpful. Thanks.","Jim Barber","Sure. I appreciate it. So if you look at our forwarding unit like many, we've got the ocean product, we've got the surface stuff; we've got the air products. Our North American operation, we continue to see it grow and do very nicely for us. Ocean was a turnaround story for the last five years. It continues to do really well for UPS and our customers and bring differentiated solutions to them. The air freight issue for us, you might have heard me say a couple times previously that we had some overexposure to some verticals around military and so forth.","At this point, I think it's all about the mix of our air freight product. We're still heavily concentrated in some of the enterprise segments of the business. We believe we've got capacity going forward to extend that product into the middle market in a different way and change the mix and the structure, we will do that. You would see that in some of our guidance going forward with respect to a bit of a slower growth and so we'll manage that yield and the kilo growth which you've seen really good growth over the last couple years, but we believe it's time for us to shift.","Your second question really got at this issue of fuel and the mixing of that into transportation. In fact, it's already started to happen with a dip in the oil. We've got some different looks at that. Obviously each organization has to deal with that and how they see that, but yes that is happening in the market right now with the concept of trying to split that apart in a different way and capture that dropping oil price. We have some solutions and some strategies to make sure that we do that on an equitable basis, but right now as we move out in the first part of the year, our strategy remains as I just walked you through and we will obviously have to deal with the fuel dip going forward, but we feel like we've got good controls in place to do that.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Scott Schneeberger","I'm kind of pulling us back into peak on U.S. Domestic. Obviously, you're going to try a lot on the yield side going into 2015. I'm just curious on the cost side. There is so much opportunity and you're talking of structurally higher costs and sounding very conservative, but with driving density, SurePost Redirect now feeling like maybe the pendulum has swung a little bit to the other side on overtime and training. It seems like there is a lot of opportunity, I guess Myron, perhaps for you, is that something that you're going to be conservative and be cautious and protect brand again in 2015 may be planning for 2016 or is there real opportunity there and we should potentially view some conservatism in that guidance? Thanks.","David Abney","Let me just kick that off with our long term initiatives that we've talked about are certainly going to be very important to us over the next three to five years and so we're going to continue to bend this cost curve. We're going to continue to use technology and accelerate ORION deployment and our automation. All of those will help us from a long term perspective and we're going to continue to use other operational technology. But there are some real specific things that we need to do this year to reduce our costs and Myron, why don't you review some of the specifics.","Myron Gray","Earlier and my statement reflected on Black Friday operations, but certainly there are additional things that we'll certainly do and one is certainly not to err so much on the side of being cautious. In certain locations where we probably brought helpers on too early during peak, we obviously drove up our contract carrier costs by going out and securing contract carriers earlier in peak and paid a premium for them. We won't do that moving forward next year. We obviously -- also in some cases drove our driver paid day too low and added too many drivers. We'll have a tighter dispatch this year and we'll seek to have driver paid days that resemble peaks of the past.","And we've also made some significant progress working with our customers on forecasting and as we get additional visibility tools, we can tighten our dispatch on a daily basis. However, peak does continue to be more complex and it will require that we run a tight dispatch. So we'll certainly plan to do that and make the obvious cost improvements that we can while we continue to invest in hub modernization and show that these peak operations that we have won't drive so much training and associated costs with them, but we will operate much tighter this year in 2015.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Tom Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Tom Kim","Staying on the topic of peak season, what seems to be -- over the last few years what we can easily derive is the fact that predicting demand around the peak season is obviously difficult and you and the shippers can try to influence the timing of shipping, but I would think that demand will remain uncertain which leads me to think that there probably should be more focus on just controlling your capacity and your cost and I guess what's missing in today's conversation is your willingness to simply walk away from business and more specifically I'm wondering like how are you thinking about setting volume caps? Thank you.","David Abney","I will start that out and then hand it over to Alan. But the control tower absolutely did what you're talking about during the very peak moments. Now the purpose of it wasn't to see how much volume we can turn away. The purpose was how we could work with customers to maybe change the timing, maybe change the operating plan so that we could handle their needs. We also though made it very clear especially on peak days through this control tower that we would not be able to take additional volume and we had good cooperation from our customers from that. So Alan, do you want to talk a little more?","Alan Gershenhorn","Yes, look I mean, we're always going to have a max capacity of what we can handle and we certainly need to manage to that considering obviously the revenue and cost and profitability implications. But like Myron said, we've come a long way this past year in really working with our top shippers to coordinate our planning activities to understand how much volume they were going to have and we came to mutual agreements on that. We will do even more of that next year and we're certainly going to be looking at our capacity, but also looking at the revenue cost and P&L implications going forward understanding that we never want to turn business away if we don't have to.","Tom Kim","I guess I'm just a little bit confused because on the last call Myron had talked about being able to adjust capacity if the demand expectations were optimistic and I'm just wondering what had sort of gone wrong there, what was missed given that the control tower was intended to foresee how volumes were going to be shaping up and then adjusting around that. So if you could just help flesh that out a little bit, that would be helpful. Thanks.","Kurt Kuehn","Yes, I think the big issue is just that the demand has become much more spiky at the very beginning of peak and at the very end. And so forecast aside, the shape of demand around the cyber weekend and then the weekend before Christmas was the big spikes and there just wasn't as much needed in that flat period.","David Abney","And we did increase customer collaboration and made a lot of improvements when it comes to forecasting. That is something that we still though will need to continue to work with our customers on.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Keith Schoonmaker","Both this morning and at the recent investor meeting, we've heard about UPS's commitment to investing in Europe. How would you characterize the current B2C growth in Europe, maybe what's the proportion of B2C in the most recent period? And then more importantly how applicable are the learnings from the U.S. peak season challenges in avoiding similar margin crunches in Europe?","Jim Barber","So I would say this. Obviously the business, as you can see is smaller relative to the U.S. and more disperse, but the same patterns actually exist internationally as they do in the U.S. It depends on what country you're in. I would tell you that the expansion of our Cologne operation has provided us great ability to move it transborder, but a lot of this does move domestically. I think you would have seen outside the U.S. some of our local competitors actually didn't make it through this peak. They actually as they say, kind of -- the investors pulled back on them. In the UK we had some issues and we think that our operating model does in fact with a combination of the Access Points and what we're looking at going forward give us the ability internationally to give our consumers choice on how they want this delivered at the right value proposition that in fact in the years to come may present some opportunities back in the U.S. And you're starting to see that with Myron rolling out Access Points, we're bringing My Choice to International. So it's a fee back-and-forth and we like where we're in that and Europe is our probably best market to prove that in the years to come.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of John Barnes with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","John Barnes","I hear your commentary around customer collaboration and I recognize the need to have those conversations, but if I'm looking at this incredible surge in volume a couple of times year and especially around peak season and there is only a couple of networks in this country that can handle that level of surge. I'm trying to understand why there has to be this level of collaboration. I mean the e-commerce revolution has taught us anything, its people want a lot and they don't want to pay a lot for it. So it seems to me like there is always going to be this give-and-take and if there is only a couple of networks and you're in what is essentially a duopoly situation, why not be more aggressive? Why does this have to take multiple years? Why can't this be a much more aggressive focus on one getting paid for what you're offering?","Kurt Kuehn","Yes, John, I think certainly that is our focus. We may disagree on the speed and the intensity of it. This is a competitive market. It's not a duopoly, there are multiple players. Part of the value we create, part of why we extract such great returns is the long term success we help our customers get to. So it is a balancing act of trying to milk every dollar out of a couple of days versus creating a sustainable and profitable business year-round and that's the balancing act we're heading towards.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of David Campbell with Thompson Davis. Please go ahead.","David Campbell","Kurt, you mentioned in your presentation that you were estimating in 2015 a 5% increase in domestic packages, I think that's what you said. I just wondered in general it doesn't seem to reflect the fact that we have $50 oil and the possibility that we're going to get faster growth, not less growth. I'm just curious as to is the 4% growth estimate based on what you see today or does it reflect a longer-term benefit from lower oil prices? Just how does that all work out?","Kurt Kuehn","Well David, we're looking at about a 4% volume level and certainly there is some range in that number depending on how the economy goes. We did have a very strong year last year and we're cycling across some fairly large wins. There is also some issue that we may be a little more selective in volume. Clearly, it's the flip side of the revenue management initiative. So we think our guidance reflects both an improving economy and also a prudent growth path. So we think that's certainly a number that's in excess of GDP growth and that there may be more volume out there, but we will be somewhat selective especially if we're not appropriately compensated for it.","Operator","And that does conclude our Q&A today. I now turn the conference back to your host, Joe Wilkins. Please go ahead.","Joe Wilkins","Thank you, Brad. I appreciate it. And with that, I will turn it over to David for closing comments.","David Abney","All right, thanks, Joe. So yes, we do feel we have customers back onboard after providing a great service during peak. The financial results will improve as we take the steps to lower the cost curve and adjust pricing where necessary.","The long term growth strategy for all of our business units that we laid out in November remains intact and will provide great opportunities for UPS in the future. UPS has always been a good place for investors, for customers, for employees and we certainly expect that to continue. And thank you for listening and have a great day."],"21318":["United Parcel Service, Inc.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. And after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. And, as a reminder, today's call will be recorded.","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Scott Childress, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Good morning, and welcome to the UPS fourth quarter 2016 earnings call. Joining me today are David Abney, our CEO; Richard Peretz, our CFO; along with International President, Jim Barber; President of U.S. Operations, Myron Gray; and Chief Commercial Officer, Alan Gershenhorn.","Before we begin, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements and address our expectation for the future performance or results of operation of our company. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2015 Form 10-K and the 2016 Form 10-Qs. These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the Securities and Exchange Commission.","During the quarter, UPS recorded a non-cash after-tax mark-to-market pension charge of $1.7 billion. The charge resulted from lower discount rates and asset returns. Lower interest rates used to calculate the plan discount rate contributed to the bulk of the shortfall. In addition, investment returns on plan assets were negatively affected by the overall market performance.","In the prior year period, UPS recorded a non-cash after-tax mark-to-market pension charge of $79 million. The charge resulted from lower asset returns that were partially offset by higher discount rates. More details on mark-to-market accounting are available in a presentation on the Investor Relations' website.","GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter 2016 was a loss of $0.27. Excluding the impact of the mark-to-market pension charge, adjusted earnings per share was $1.63, while fourth quarter 2015 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.48 and adjusted earnings per share was $1.57. Unless stated otherwise, discussion today will refer to adjusted results.","The webcast of today's call, along with a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, are available on the UPS Investor Relations' website.","Webcast users can submit live questions during today's call. We will attempt to answer questions of a long-term strategic nature. Callers are asked to submit only one question, so that we may allow as many as possible to participate.","Before I turn it over to David, I want to remind everyone of our Investor Conference on February 21. UPS senior leaders will update you on our latest technology and our long-term strategy. We look forward to seeing you at the conference.","Now, I will turn the call over to David.","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. UPS produced record earnings in 2016, and revenue reached an all-time high of $61 billion. We completed the initial stages of our long-term investment strategy, which enabled UPS to accelerate e-commerce and international shipment growth in the second half of 2016.","For the fourth quarter, the International segment delivered another extraordinary performance, with shipment growth exceeding 7% and operating profit rising by double digits for the eighth consecutive quarter.","Over the last two years, our International business has built a strong foundation, generating 30% incremental profit growth. This positive momentum in our core International business model will continue going forward.","Looking specifically at peak season, UPS helped our customers complete another successful holiday season. We delivered more than 712 million packages globally, a 16% increase over the same period last year. This record volume was driven by strong and steady e-commerce demand throughout the period. Our embrace and, in reality, our facilitation of the e-commerce boom offers even more growth and earnings potential as we further transform our network. We will continue to invest in air and ground capacity and operating efficiency improvements in order to fully capitalize on the e-commerce growth with an improved bottom line.","In the U.S., we completed investments that enabled our network to respond with on-time service, even with this record-setting volume. However, during the quarter, we experienced a significant shift in mix toward lower revenue products. This, combined with the cost of facility investments yet to come online, weighed on our Q4 results.","In 2016, we completed nearly 200 facility projects and announced about 7 million square feet of new capacity. This included a dozen all-new facility or major modernization investments. And we are moving rapidly towards completion of many of these projects.","During the fourth quarter, we announced substantial hub modernization in (6:36) greenfield expansion projects. These and other investments will create improved network flexibility to address e-commerce mix and generate greater operating efficiency and enhance profitability. In Atlanta, we unveiled our largest current project, a new 1.2 million square foot facility. This highly-automated $400 million ground hub will be our third largest sortation facility in the network.","We also announced projects at two large regional hubs in Ohio and Florida. These high-priority facilities will expand network capacity and utilize the most advanced sortation technology available. The capacity and efficiency benefits from these latest projects will come online over the next two years.","In Europe, we've already completed one-third of our $2 billion network expansion and redesign program. Many of these investments are starting to contribute to our strong International segment performance. We have more announcements planned as part of our U.S. and European investment programs in the coming months.","We are also executing inorganic strategies to drive growth across key industries, building additional capabilities through acquisitions and partnerships. We added new health care capabilities with the acquisition of Marken, a global provider of supply chain solutions to the life sciences industry. Marken's 44 locations, combined with our pre-existing health care network, makes UPS a leader in clinical trials logistics. We now operate more than 100 dedicated health care locations worldwide.","We also acquired Freightex, a U.K.-based asset-light provider of truckload brokerage services. This acquisition gives us a great expansion platform in Europe for the Coyote business model.","In addition, we entered a partnership with Optoro, a reverse logistics technology company. This alliance creates a comprehensive return solution that extends our reach within the retail and manufacturing sectors. It's a powerful combination of logistics know-how and data analytics to minimize returns costs and complexity. The addition of these unique capabilities gives UPS unmatched global solutions across industry verticals.","Now looking at 2017, the global economic outlook remains generally positive, and forecasts have risen modestly over the last few months. In the U.S., GDP growth for 2017 is forecast to be slightly higher than last year. The expansion of e-commerce is expected to continue, with another year of double-digit growth. On the commercial side of the economy, industrial production outlook has gone from negative to slightly positive. That favorable move is a good sign for the manufacturing sector.","However, U.S. exports are expected to face continued headwinds from a strong U.S. dollar. Global growth estimates for 2017 have been largely unchanged. The outlook for both Europe and China has rebounded slightly, although economists are still expecting slower year-over-year growth.","We believe a key to continued global economic growth is the expansion of free trade. UPS supports trade initiatives that give our customers fair and simplified access to markets outside their home country. We support the move towards additional bilateral, as well as multilateral, trade agreements that give improved access to international markets. UPS is ready to help our customers navigate this period of change using the expertise we've developed as one of the world's largest customs brokers.","In the U.S., a new political era has begun, and we look forward to working with the Trump administration and Congress. We expect the economy will be center stage, along with efforts to strengthen U.S. competitiveness. There are opportunities for progress on a number of critical issues that impact economic growth.","At UPS, we strongly support comprehensive corporate tax reform. Lower corporate tax rates will encourage investment, create jobs, and make the U.S. a more competitive country. We believe the case for infrastructure development is clear. A world-class infrastructure is the backbone of a modern healthy U.S. economy, and it will certainly reduce costly delays for UPS. In addition, reduction of Federal regulations will also make the U.S. economy more vibrant.","UPS supports a streamlined and targeted regulatory environment, reducing uncertainty and producing better conditions for growth. We are encouraged by these prospects and look forward to offering input as specific proposals are developed and implemented.","Before I turn it over to Richard, I want to take a moment to personally thank all UPSers around the world for their dedication and extraordinary efforts during the holiday season. As we begin 2017, we're optimistic about our future. We see great opportunities ahead for UPS. We are strengthening our network and market position by making investments that create long-term value for customers and share owners.","Now, Richard will provide you more details on our results. Richard?","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. During the fourth quarter, UPS produced strong revenue growth of 5.5%. Top-line gains were driven by the opportunities in e-commerce and robust international shipment growth. Earnings per share came in at $1.63. And full year 2016 EPS was $5.75, an almost 6% increase over last year.","International continues to lead the way, completing its eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit profit expansion. The U.S. Domestic segment delivered record volumes and adjusted to a historical shift of product mix. Finally, Supply Chain & Freight grew top line, tonnage, and shipments, but is still managing through tough market conditions.","Now, turning to details within each business segment. U.S. Domestic revenue was up 6.3% to $10.9 billion in the quarter. Fuel revenue was a benefit to the top line growth by about 20 basis points.","Package growth was strong the quarter. Its average daily volume was up 5%. Ground products were up 5.4%, driven by more than a 25% jump in SurePost volume. We also had solid gains in our Air products. Next Day Air shipments increased 4.4%, and Deferred Air was up almost 3%.","Strong market demand for our e-commerce solutions created a significant shift in product mix during the quarter. B2C shipments grew at 11.5%. We reached a number of historic levels during the quarter, including 55% B2C, the largest volume increase in a quarter and the highest month ever at 63% B2C in December.","We also delivered to an additional 2.5 million new addresses this quarter. These UPS records demonstrate the expanding reach of e-commerce, which comes with great opportunities and some challenges.","On the commercial delivery side of the business, B2B shipments were down slightly. Growth in return shipments was double-digit. However, commercial activity remained soft, including brick-and-mortar deliveries. Weak industrial production trends, revenue management actions on a handful of large accounts, and a strong U.S. dollar were all headwinds in the quarter.","Looking at operating expense, average delivery stops increased 4.6% and average daily volume was up 5%. Yet through the power of ORION, we held daily package miles to only a 0.3% increase.","Total cost per piece growth was held to 0.6% including a 0.3% impact from fuel. Given all these factors, overall profits fell below our expectations, as the balance of e-commerce shipments affected our bottom line. As a result, operating profit was relatively flat at $1.3 billion for the quarter.","We are mid-cycle in transforming our network over the next several years, as we move through this period of expanding e-commerce opportunity. As investments come online, we are adding capacity, more efficiency and greater flexibility. With the e-commerce opportunity, we recognize additional revenue initiatives are needed to better align price with our cost to serve. This is a dynamic process to ensure that we are properly compensated for changes in product mix and the cost to manage volume surges through the year. We are using this multi-pronged approach to build upon our results.","Looking now at the International segment, our business model is creating value for our customers and shareholders, with eight quarters of consistent double-digit profit gains, resulting in almost $600 million in incremental profits since 2014.","Total operating profit climbed more than 13% to over $700 million for the quarter, another record level for the segment. Operating margin was strong and expanded year-over-year. This quarter's margin benefited by approximately 300 basis points due to the hedging gains. The total revenue was $3.3 billion, or up 5%, and up 6.2% on a currency-neutral basis.","Export shipments were up 8.4%. Results were driven by strong growth across a number of regions and products. The Asia region was up 20%. And intra-Europe exports saw over a 10% increase, showcasing the strong foundation of our broad cross-border network.","Finally, the Supply Chain & Freight segment continued to manage through soft market conditions. More specifically, the Forwarding and Freight units remained challenged by overcapacity in the market. In the Forwarding business, tonnage increased in Air and Ocean Freight for the first time in more than a year. The unit saw mid-single-digit growth in tonnage for Air Freight, but narrowing buy-sell spreads in the quarter. Ocean Freight produced strong results, as tonnage and profits increase year-over-year. UPS Freight returned to growth, producing modest increases in revenue, tonnage and shipments.","We remain focused on profitable revenue and growing our middle-market customer base. Growth in (18:36) logistics continues to outpace the general market. They are creating customer value with their high service levels and through expanded access to the full suite of UPS capabilities. The acquisition of Coyote was a great addition to UPS, providing us with the unique technology platform, strong adjacent market growth, and it was accretive in year one.","Now, let's turn to our cash flow. Once again, UPS returned more than 100% of net income to shareholders, as we purchased more than 25.5 million shares for approximately $2.7 billion and paid out another $2.8 billion in dividends, up about 7% per share over last year.","Through 2016, UPS generated healthy cash from operations, producing over $6.5 billion. We reinvested just under $3 billion in our business this year as well. Also in the fourth quarter, we made an opportunistic discretionary payment to fund pension liabilities for approximately $1 billion, basically taking advantage of the rate arbitrage around increasing PBGC premiums.","Looking at our tax rate, in the fourth quarter, UPS lowered the effective tax rate to 34.5%. International profit growth, combined with adjustments for several discrete tax events, produced these savings. For 2017, we expect our tax rate to remain around 35%.","Now, let's cover the rest of guidance. At our Investor Conference in three weeks, we'll provide more details on our plans for 2017 and update you on our expectations through 2019. Today, we are providing a high-level view of where UPS is headed in 2017.","We've enjoyed the advantages of multi-year hedging over the last few years. And 2017, as we have discussed, is a transition year. With the strength of the U.S. dollar, we now anticipate a combined headwind from hedged and unhedged currencies of about $400 million for the year.","We expect total revenue to grow 5% to 7% ahead of our historical norms. We are adapting to the on-going growth of e-commerce, and we are leaning into this opportunity. As a result, we will be moving our CapEx target range in 2017. CapEx is expected to be around $4 billion for the year. These additional investment dollars will give us more capacity and greater efficiency in both our Air and Ground networks.","Elevating our CapEx, given our high ROIC, and continuing to be opportunistic with capital, we are increasing our long-term shareholder value. We remain committed to growing dividends and expect, based on our current view, share repurchases to be around $1.8 billion for the year. It's important to remember that the currency headwinds will impact operating profit by about $400 million this year, and that reduces the EPS guidance range by about $0.30 per share, or almost 500 basis points. As a result of the $0.30 currency headwind, we expect earnings in a range of $5.80 to $6.10 per diluted share. The distribution of EPS across the quarters will be very similar to 2016.","Looking more closely at the segments, in the U.S. Domestic segment, we expect average daily volumes to be up 3% to 5%, driving revenue up 5% to 7%. As we increase the pace of investments, additional operating costs will be incurred and temporarily impact margins. Therefore, operating margins will only improve slightly in 2017.","And the International segment is anticipated to continue its positive momentum, with average daily shipments up 4% to 6%. Product mix will continue to be a headwind for the yield. And, as a result, we see revenue increasing 2% to 4%. Operating profit is expected to be below 2016 by 4% to 8%, due to the currency headwinds of almost $400 million. Adjusting for this headwind, the core growth in bottom-line results remains strong.","In the Supply Chain & Freight segment, we will show improvements throughout 2017, due to the conditions in Forwarding and the Freight sector getting better. As a result, we anticipate revenue growth of 8% to 10%, with margins slightly below 2016 levels. Operating profit will be down during the first quarter, due to the slower recovery in the Freight Forwarding area. Profits will accelerate throughout the remainder of the year.","Overall, we anticipate 2017 to be another successful year for UPS. We are investing today to ensure we capitalize on the expanding market opportunities. We have a long history of financial strength. We're using our power to build long-term value through our investment and growth plans to meet these opportunities.","Thank you for your time today. We look forward to spending more time at the Investor Conference on February 21, providing you additional details on our long-term business strategies and expectations for 2017 and beyond.","Now, I'll ask the operator to open the line so we can take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question will come from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Please go ahead.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey, great. Thanks and good morning. I wanted to ask a question on Domestic margins. So, Richard, you just noted that you're expecting margins to improve slightly, I think, in 2017. What are the specific actions you're going to be taking? We're seeing this sort of mix shift happening here. You mentioned price earlier on the call. Is price going to be the primary tool? Is there a way to accelerate that to maybe see a little bit more than slight improvement in 2017? Thank you.","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Sure, Chris. I think the first thing to think about here is that based on this tremendous change in mix, we think it's important to continue to lean in. And so, what you'll see is that we're going to actually quicken the pace of our CapEx, because we think the benefits long-term make sense. So we're going to take some operations penalty, and that's why you see the margin going what it is. But it is two sides to the equation. And in a minute, I'll ask Alan to comment on the revenue side.","But from a cost side, we continue down the same path we've been on, but with this tremendous opportunity, we feel like we can take the challenge on because the market is expanding and gives UPS an opportunity to continue to grow. And that's why you see in our guidance, that we actually guided higher than our historical norm. And you saw for this quarter, actually the fastest growth of revenue that we've seen in any of the quarters this year. Alan?","Alan Gershenhorn - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Yeah, thanks, Rich. Clearly, our integrated model generates superior margins and returns. However, as Richard alluded to, it's more complex to manage when the volume surges or when we see these product mix shifts that we're seeing, unlike any past trends. So the first goal is to ensure that the revenue aligns with the new product mix and the peak value that we're creating for our customers.","So for 2017, we've already taken some significant action. The 2017 GRI was really targeted to maximize our base rates and profitable growth. And, in addition, there's a few notable items that are targeted specifically at some of these changes we're seeing. First is, we have a new DIM weight divisor for all the U.S. domestic packages greater than one cubic foot. We've changed that from 166 to 139. And then with e-commerce, we're also seeing a lot more of these larger packages. So we've changed our additional handling fee for all packages with lengths over 48 inches versus 60 inches. We did that back mid-year for Ground in 2016. And for Air and SurePost, that's effective for 2017.","And just one other note on the large packages, we've also raised our over max charge very significantly. So those are a few of the actions that we're taking, but certainly there's going to be additional focus on yield management improvements for peak and year-round to make sure we're aligning our price to our cost to serve and the value that we're creating for our customers, ensuring we're receiving proper returns. Thanks for the question, Chris.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Kenneth S. Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, great. Good morning. If I could just follow up on that a little bit, you keep investing to keep pace with e-commerce, so your outlook is a 0% to 5% EPS growth. You mentioned the 500 basis points impact from currency. I guess the $400 million is a little higher than the prior $300 million target. Is that a structural shift down from your prior EPS long-term growth rate? Does this shift back over time as investments slows? Maybe you can talk a little bit about that structural change.","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Sure. I'll start by saying that when we look at guidance, we look at two things. First, we look what's happening inside UPS, and of course we look at the economic conditions. In terms of inside UPS, we're continuing to create operating efficiency through implementation. But what we're really doing is leaning in and saying, we need to do this faster. And so that creates long-term value, because when we change our network, we're changing it for not just our B2C volume, but we're changing it for all of our products, because we run that integrated network.","So we will see some operating penalties in the short-term as we have temporary buildings, as we do more hub mod a little faster, things like that. But at the same time, economically, we provide a guidance range that's realistic. And so, that's why it's actually \u2013 the guided number was 1% to 6%, (28:52) but you have to add that 500 basis points to it, or $0.30 a share, and you get to something that shows underlying growth actually continuing to be strong.","And essentially, when you look at \u2013 because you referenced the old guidance numbers \u2013 if you look back in 2014, the forecast for industrial production was different over the last two years. It stayed soft. There was supposed be a recovery mid-2015, and that did not occur. Additionally, you've seen this continued contrast in consumer versus industrial growth. And, of course, the last point is that the pension discount rates and interest rate environment generally have stayed softened really for eight years, and again, there was an expectation back in 2014 that that would start to recover.","So we'll cover all this in a lot more detail when we meet in a few weeks at the Investor Conference, but we feel like, when you put it all together, the underlying business is performing well. We're preparing it for the future, and that's why we've guided the way we have.","Kenneth S. Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","We're going to take a online question from Brian Ossenbeck at JPMorgan. And Brian's question is about the investments in Europe, the $2 billion investment that we've laid out. And to the extent that the program is improving time in transits across our International Ground network, when will the benefits really start being realized?","James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Okay, Brian. This is Jim Barber. I'll take that one. I guess I could start with the last question and move back to the first is, when will the benefits be realized? I think they continue to be realized every year we perform our growth model in Europe. Very specifically to the question, a couple of points, is that I like to say that the buildout in Europe is in thirds. We've completed a third, we have a third underway and a third yet to go. I almost liken it to an integration, it just happens to be organic versus inorganic. And the reason I say that is, when we're done, we will have actually modified about a third of our network in Europe.","Now to one more point, I think would resonate on the question and the discussion about, when will benefits accrue? Earlier in the year, we took a look at the network and decided we needed to speed it up on behalf of consumers in the market. We actually modified 7,000 lanes in 27 country pairs, effectively speeding the network up by a day in every case across intra-Europe.","The proof point is that, if you look at the growth model in Europe, the first quarter was flat. The second quarter, we grew on the ground at almost 6%, the third quarter almost 8%, and the quarter we just finished, we grew at about 11%. So I think the question about, when will the benefits accrue, I think that's rhetorical. And I think the issue is for us to keep it going. And in 2017, our next steps will be up in the air to continue the expansion. So I appreciate the question.","Operator","The next question will come from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Please go ahead.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Yeah, good morning. I wanted to ask you a little bit more about the Domestic margin pressure that you experienced in fourth quarter. Is this primarily a start-up cost issue? And you did describe how you ramped a lot of facilities up, and that was a pretty strong pace. Or is it more of a delivery-point density issue? You talked about the miles driven, that that was pretty efficient, but your stops were up a lot. So I don't know if you can kind of differentiate if it's both or more of one of the other. And then, I don't know if you have any thoughts that you want to provide on the, just where you're at on the hub modernization program? Because you did refer to accelerating that a bit, I think, versus what the prior plan was, so I guess those are the questions. Thank you.","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Sure. So, when you look at the operating margin, the biggest impact to the operating margin for the fourth quarter was really driven by the balance of volume. We saw, in fact, a dramatic shift in B2C. And we went back all the way 10 years, and this was the fastest pace of movement from B2B to B2C on a weighted average. So, on one side, it's partly driven by that.","The other side is what's happening externally, too. And, of course, that means the industrial production is still \u2013 remained soft. In a minute, I'm going to ask Myron talk a little about specifically the operations, but what we're really saying is, by talking about our increased CapEx really this year, we went up over 20% and next year we're going to do it again, it's really about quickening the pace so that we can continue to transform the network, because long-term, that's going to improve the margins. And it's actually going to help or be a tailwind as we come against more volume that has a little less density.","We are still creating that synthetic density through SurePost redirect, through My Choice and the use of access points. But when you put it all together, this is really about, we're mid-cycle in a process that we laid out a few years ago. And we said it would be about a five-year process to get done. And we are going to quicken a little bit to get it done, because of the results and the value it creates is worthwhile. With that, on hub mod, we're going to talk about that at the Investor Conference in a few weeks, and I'll ask Myron to talk specifically about the Domestic business.","Myron A. Gray - United Parcel Service, Inc.","So, Tom, quickly, we're, as Rich mentioned, mid-process of a multi-year approach to our automation process, but they are giving us 20% to 25% greater productivity. That helps us to improve flexibilities, reduce the handles in our network, which obviously continue to help us reduce or bend the cost curve. So we're about mid-way through the process, with most of the capacity and automation coming online in 2018, 2019 and 2020. But as Rich mentioned, we'll give you more information in a few weeks.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","This is Scott again. Let's just make sure that there's only one question. We're trying to get through as many sell-side analysts as possible, so we'll only select one question moving forward per analyst.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. Richard, just maybe can you give us your thinking on how you get comfortable that the Domestic margin has kind of found a floor here, and whether or not you can give us any more detail on how big the OpEx penalty that you pulled forward is for 2017?","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Okay, David, good morning. When we're looking at the operating margin and what we're doing, it really has to do with several different initiatives that we have coming on. We have about 15 or so initiatives this year that we're investing in that are really about the future, both from a capacity standpoint, but also from a capability standpoint. I think it's best if we leave a lot of that discussion for when we meet at the Investor Conference, but I do think the important part is that we think there's two sides to solving this. The one side is continue bending the cost curve, and we've seen that with ORION. And if you think about these different projects we're talking about, they're the same kind of thing; continue to find automation and efficiency through investment of capital.","At the same time, there's the revenue side and the things that Alan talked about. I think if you also step back for a moment and you look at where we are today versus a few years ago, because there's been references to that, since 2014, our revenue in the U.S. has grown 9%. And since 2014, our profit has grown almost 18%.","So while we know we're not quite where we wanted to be this quarter, we do know that even though we took on historical numbers from B2C, fastest growth we've seen in 10 years, that the returns, while not where we want them to be, are still very strong. And we are building for the long-term with transforming our network, and this is just one of those steps in the process that we laid out a few years ago.","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Yeah, so this is David. I'd just like to reinforce what Richard said. Just want to remind everybody, we did have record EPS for the fourth quarter and for the full year. E-commerce brings challenges. It certainly brings great opportunities. We believe we have the right strategy. We feel we're making the right investments. If this quarter told us anything, it told us we've got to quicken the pace and we've already said we're going to do that. And we're going to seize the opportunities that we know can come worldwide from B2C. So we see it as a very good opportunity for our people, and we're going to capitalize on it. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey. Thanks. Morning, guys. So wanted to ask about the CapEx guidance, it implies about 6% of revenue on CapEx, which is the highest we've seen in, think, over 10 years. Would you characterize this as kind of a one-time step-up in CapEx, given kind of quickening the pace of capital projects or is this more of a new kind of run rate for CapEx? And maybe just at a higher level, can you just talk about, do you \u2013 you've said in the past that e-commerce was going to be a business that requires lower capital. Do we need to now rethink that, where it's a business that requires higher capital?","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Sure, Scott, and again this is Richard. I think one thing to keep in mind here is our priorities have always been the same, which is first is to reinvest in the business because of the high ROIC being mid-20s or higher. When we look at it, we're not talking about investing in automating the networks because of only e-commerce. As I hopefully have communicated in the past, one of the benefits of everything we invest is that every package gets a benefit, and they get a benefit because we run that single integrated network. And so, we're investing to create automation and the use of technology across the network in major hubs. And that's going to impact both our B2C volume, our B2B, our Next Day Air and our exports and imports out of the U.S.","That all being said, I think how you should think about the CapEx is for the next several years, we'll be a little higher than we have been, say, the last six or seven years. But it's all about continuing to create value, continuing to grow this company a little bit faster than historical norms. And that's why we also guided on the revenue the way we did. So we'll again talk a little bit more about our CapEx and where we're headed at the Investor Conference, but I think that gives you a pretty good picture of where we're headed.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","We'll take an online question. This one, we've had multiple questions on trade. The questions are thoughts around global trade outlook with this new administration; how that's going to impact our business as well as the comments on the TPP and that losing favor in the current administration.","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Okay. This is David Abney. The first question came from David Ross [Stifel, Nicolaus]. And you know in spite of the headlines, and there's been quite a few, President Trump is really not against trade agreements. Now, he's made it very clear he wants trade agreements to be fair from a U.S. perspective. And he also has made it clear that versus multilateral agreements, that he's much more focused on bilateral agreements.","UPS, as a company, we support trade agreements. We support bilateral. We support multilateral. And I can tell you that in every country where the U.S. in the last 10 years has reached a trade agreement, we have seen an actual real increase of packages entering our network going out to these countries, U.S. exports, of a 20% increase. And 20% increase, whether you get the benefit from many bilateral agreements or one multilateral agreement, you can see how that adds up.","We did get a separate question, and it was concerning TPP and how disappointed are we that the U.S. has withdrawn from TPP negotiations? And obviously, UPS is a big supporter of TPP, and we thought it was a modernized trade agreement for the 21st century. And so, yes, we would like to see multilateral agreements like that get approved. But I can tell you that if you follow the President's strategy, and you do a series of fairly quick bilateral agreements with the major countries that are involved in TPP or that may eventually have been included in TPP, we think you can still get there, maybe not as quickly as you would in this manner, but we are encouraged that the U.S. is going to focus on trade agreements. And we are expecting to see some progress in a fairly short period of time. So thank you for the question.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Brian Ossenbeck of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning. David, you mentioned you're a fan of corporate tax reform. And I was hoping to get your thoughts on just the House GOP tax plan as it's written and then perhaps some comments on the details of the repatriation of cash held overseas, CapEx expensing, interest, the loss of deductibility; just how you think that would impact UPS as a company. And then also the border-adjusted provision, obviously, tied to that for the time being, how would that affect your customers if that were to be implemented? Thank you.","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Brian, we're going to take the first part of that question, just the tax reform.","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for that part of the question, Brian. And I may be able to cover a little part in answering this one, too. But first, you've got to realize that we have a high tax rate. It's about 35%. And so when we hear about comprehensive tax reform, we get pretty excited pretty quickly. There's no doubt about that. And we look for a competitive tax rate. We also look for the territorial provision that we can bring earnings back.","When you get to the House blueprint, while we do appreciate the tax rate, we do share some concerns that many of our customers have about the potential impact of the border adjustment tax. And one of the first questions is we're trying to find out just exactly how that's going to work. And it's a little bit early. We don't have all the answers yet. So we're certainly pursuing those answers.","And the second part of this, you have to know how it's going to work to see if it's really going to affect trade coming into the U.S. So from the blueprint, we are certainly excited about a lower rate, but we think there's a lot of concerns and a lot of questions about the border adjustment tax, and we need answers before we could go much further there. So thank you for the question.","Operator","The next question will come from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Good morning. And thanks for taking my question. So, David, I realize you are at record earnings levels for the company, but I think if we look from 2014 through your guidance in 2017, we've only hit the long-term guidance one out of those four years. So when you talk about bending the cost curve going forward, we've heard about these technology investments for a long time now, package flow technology going back a while. We've heard about ORION for a number of years. I know you guys have implemented that; synthetic density, automated hubs. We can go on with the Coyote acquisition, but what is it about the business where you've just seen the degradation in margins for the past decade? And why is it that we think going forward, this acceleration investment is going to help profitability in the business?","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Well, I'm actually going to take the question, Brandon. This is Richard. And I think the first thing you have to look at is, again, if you go back to 2014 and our long-term guidance, we expected to see growth in industrial production in 2015 and 2016. And really for the last year and a half, last year and three-quarters, you've seen that go negative. That has a big impact on growth rate of the B2B business. And earlier, I talked about, we looked at both the internal and the external, and we try to give you a range of realistic goals based on economic assumptions, and they've come in much differently.","The other thing that plays a large part in where we sit is the discount rate is something like 100 basis points different. And you saw what that did to mark-to-market. That impacts expense, too. But separating all the external, what's happening inside the business is you're seeing this massive trend of B2C going much faster.","We talked about in 2014, that it would be a five year process to get our hubs all automated. And so we're mid-process in it. And what we're really saying is for 2017, 2018, we're going to go a little faster than what we originally said because the value of that is so great, not only for the B2C, but for all of the business in Ground and our Next Day Air, et cetera.","So one of the reasons we're coming together in a few weeks is really to talk about where we see the business today, what the economics numbers kind of show externally and how we see we're going to continue to grow this business. Because at the end of the day, one of the parts that's very important to us is that we do spur growth, and that's why you see us guide on revenue above our historical norm.","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","And this is David. Just like to wrap up that question and still want to remind that we have the best margins in the industry, and there was a little bit of reference to, over the past couple of years. Let me just give you a quick comparison, just to keep everything relative. And I'll compare fourth quarter 2016 to fourth quarter 2014. Our operating profit's up over $200 million and 17.7%.","We do have a very interesting opportunity when it comes to B2C. And it is not progressing in a linear fashion. There will be times that it doesn't speed up quite as much, and then there'll be times that it'll shoot forward, like it did now. But under no circumstances should anybody doubt whether we have the strategies or making the right investments. ORION, that you do hear us talk a lot about, we had 5% volume growth, and the number of miles that we traveled was an additional percentage-wise, Richard?","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","0.3%","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","0.3%. So you just look at that. And if we had not made the investments in ORION, you just normally expect that you're going to grow volume by 5%; you're going grow stops by 4.7%; that you'd grow miles accordingly. And we were able to reduce that to 0.3 of a mile.","These automated hubs have given us 20%, 25% efficiency. And so, the end of the day, it is not that we need to change our strategies, we need to quit making investments. The end of the day is, we've got to speed and go forward. We have to stay up with the market. The market is clearly moving greater B2C. That's the focus that you will see UPS from both an innovation, from a cost, and from working with our customers to make sure that we get paid for the cost to serve their packages.","Thanks for the question, and let's move on to the next one, please.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Swinging into International, could you discuss your outlook for package yield international, excluding ForEx, and elaborate on some of the key drivers going forward; looks like that's one of the stronger areas? Thanks.","James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.","This is Jim. So I think Richard kind of got close to that in the beginning. I think when you clean it up for FX, we're going to be sitting about 18%, and that certainly is a margin we're comfortable with. If you look at going forward, I've talked previously, a few minutes ago, about Europe. No question that that is paying dividends for us.","I think, last quarter, we talked about our 747-800s. We touched on the fact that Asia grew almost 20%, to right at 20% for us in the fourth quarter; hence, leaning into the aircraft that'll start to come online in October of this year, which will pay dividends for us in peak of 2017. We're expanding in 21 cities in China. In those cities specifically, the growth rates are truly 50%, where we're putting in a different model to go to market in China, so we really feel good about Asia.","And then I think the other thing that I would mention that's kind of gone quietly through International is, this year, last two years, we purposely put in Express expansion into the world. We kind of took a look at it internally. David pushed us to look at growth a little bit differently in 2015, actually. What that meant is that so far, in 2016, we've added Express to 60,000 more ZIP Codes in the world, in 52 different countries. We put 26 new countries on early a.m. at the same time, and proof point, just like the European growth model, our worldwide Express growth for the year 2016, which we will continue to move into 2017, has gone from flat to 4.5% growth to 8%, to now almost 11% growth in the export \u2013 in the International products, so we feel good about it, and all these things are coming together to get what you've seen in the past and will continue in the future. Appreciate it.","Operator","The next question will come from the line of Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Danny C. Schuster - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Good morning. This is Danny Schuster on for Allison. Thank you for getting our question in. So Richard, you mentioned a couple times that one of the two big headwinds outside of your control since 2014 has been the 100 basis point pension discount rate decline. So we just wanted to clarify going forward, how much pension expense headwind is included in the 2017 guidance?","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Sure, Danny. I think, when you look at pension expense in 2017, we look at it in two buckets. We look at the multi-employer, and that will grow the same as volume, and so we don't really see any change to that. For the UPS-sponsored plans, it actually will be relatively flat, and it's really driven by the actions we took due to the increasing PBGC premiums and the pre-funding, as well as coming up against headwinds from the discount rate. So the important point here is that we actively manage the pension environment. And we're doing the right thing for UPS and for the investors, but essentially the expense for UPS-sponsored plans will be flat in 2017.","Danny C. Schuster - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Jack Atkins of Stephens. Please go ahead.","Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.","Hey. Good morning. Thank you for the time. Just following up on your comments earlier about global trade and the new administration, I was just curious if you could maybe talk to the flexibility that you think is in the network to be able to add capacity in certain geographies or reduce capacity in others, given what we're seeing as could be fairly dynamic trade policy coming out of Washington, and the potential tax policy changes. How do we think about your ability to flex up and flex down your cost structure to match what could be changing freight flows?","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. This is David. The biggest advantage of our network is our ability to flex up and down. And if that means that trade happens more in one area versus the other, then we obviously can move our assets, and we can make those adjustments. We still, though, we don't believe that the world is falling off the cliff. We think that there will be trade agreements. We think that global trade is still going to continue to grow, and we're prepared to make those adjustments. And if something does happen where trade drops in particular areas of the world, then we will make those adjustments, too. If it means that we have to remove some of our planes from these areas temporarily or if we have to move resources, we will certainly do that. So we're prepared either way, but we're going to work very hard to make sure that everyone understands the importance of competing in the 21st century and that is through trade, which drives jobs, and it also drives opportunities for Americans. Thank you.","Operator","Next question will come from the line of Bascome Majors of Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yeah, thank you. So can you refresh us on your current rolling strategy of hedging FX forward a month at a time and how far you are into implementing it? Or we said it another way, just trying to get a sense if you're going to feel the impact of the late 2016 dollar strength this year in that $400 million that you guided, or if this is a more gradual headwind that comes on in 2018, 2019?","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Sure. This is Richard, obviously, and what I wanted to make sure that I cover on this, the headwind is for the year 2017. And what's actually going to happen over time is we'll see less of this because we're moving from a multi-year hedge, where extreme volatility that came out in 2014 and 2015 saw a dramatic drop. So therefore, we were kind of exposed because it went to one to $1.35 down to $1.11. Earlier last year, we started guiding around our dollar cost averaging, and so it's fully implemented in 2018, but we're fully covered in 2017 as well.","And what we do is we buy $1.36 of our coverage each month. And so what that does is takes the volatility out of the currency. And that's how you hedge currencies. So what that means is your year-over-year comp won't have as much exposure because it's only the head and the tail that are different for the comparison periods.","That being said, the unhedged currencies have exposure and that's because there's hundreds of currencies and it's all about how the currency reacts against the dollar. We haven't seen the kind of reaction that we saw really in the last six weeks to eight weeks of 2016 historically, where almost every major currency in the world went a different way than the dollar. And that's why we had to guide up that the expected impact for 2017 is around $400 million, but as it occurs through the year, we'll have to continue to give you information.","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you.","Operator","Due to time constraints, our last question will come from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Aegis Capital. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Aegis Capital Corp.","Thank you very much for letting me ask my question. You're about 1.2 times debt to EBITDA. You've explained why you're accelerating capital investment and reducing the amount of cash allocated to share repurchase. Since this level of CapEx is going to be at an elevated spend strategically for the next few years, should we expect less cash funneled towards share repurchase or might you be in a position to use some of the balance sheet to maintain the level of share repurchase for the next couple of years?","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","So again, this is Richard, and I think the most important thing is to remember that our priorities haven't changed. We still think investing in the business, making dividends a priority is important. But having the flexibility based on opportunistic-type things makes a lot of sense, we feel like. At the same time, it does appear we're entering a very favorable cycle for pension accounting, and so that may drive us to do things differently.","We'll kind of put all this together and talk a little bit about that when we're together at the Investor Conference, but we think it's important that we're fortunate because we can balance the needs of the business and still have a strong total return to our shareholders. But we're always evaluating ways to accelerate and create value. And again, we'll plan to talk a little bit more about that at the Investor Conference.","Operator","That concludes our Q&A session for today. I would now like to turn the program back over to Mr. Childress and panel for any closing remarks they may have.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Yeah. We appreciate you joining us today. I'd like to allow David closing comments, if I would, please.","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Yeah, so I'd like to thank everyone for being on the call. And we'd like to just finish up that we're very excited about the opportunities, the opportunities that we're going to have in e-commerce, but the opportunities \u2013 we didn't talk about this as much \u2013 in emerging markets, and with what Jim and his group is doing in our International business. And then, last is the focus on technology and making sure that we continue to implement technology that's going to make us more efficient. It's going to make us more flexible, and it's going to provide more value to our customers.

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. And after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Scott Childress, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Good morning, and welcome to the UPS first quarter 2017 earnings call. Joining me today are David Abney, our CEO; Richard Peretz, our CFO; along with International President, Jim Barber; President of U.S. Operations, Myron Gray; and Chief Commercial Officer, Alan Gershenhorn.","Before we begin, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements and address our expectation for the future performance or results of operations of our company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty, which are described in detail in our 2016 Form 10-K. These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the Securities and Exchange Commission.","The webcast of today's call, along with a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website.","Webcast users can submit live questions during today's call. We will attempt to answer questions of a long-term strategic nature. Callers are asked to submit only one question so that we may allow as many as possible to participate.","Now, I will turn the call over to David.","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Thanks, Scott, and good morning everyone. At our Investor Conference in February, we laid out our investment strategy for the next three to five years. The cornerstone was accelerating investment in our smart global logistics network, which represents the most sweeping transformation of our network in decades.","We're stepping up the pace of investments now to enable UPS to better participate in the vast opportunities we see ahead. The benefits from new revenues and improve productivity will be fully realized in coming years and quarters as these investments become operational. The market dynamics and customer demand experienced in the first quarter deepened our confidence that we are on the right track.","Looking more closely at the first quarter, we're very pleased with the revenue gains achieved in each of our three operating segments. While revenues were strong, our operating margin in the first quarter was affected by some known and some unanticipated headwinds. Richard will discuss these items in more detail during his remarks.","Turning briefly to the economy, the U.S. economic outlook has improved over the last few months and the growth is expected to move slightly higher for the remainder of the year. Consumer confidence is at a 15-year high and the labor market has tightened. Economists have included additional growth in their forecasts from the administration's efforts to modernize trade agreements, reform tax policy, and upgrade infrastructure. We support efforts that boost trade, remove unnecessary regulations, and stimulate real GDP expansion.","Overall, global economic forecasts are largely unchanged with economists still projecting faster expansion in the near term and an accelerated pace of global trade. We're already seeing those trends at work in our results in Europe and in Asia.","While the economy is showing positive momentum, at UPS, we're focused on generating growth by expanding our capabilities in ways that fully leverage our network. For instance, we've announced the construction of two large highly automated regional hubs during the quarter. These projects will add nearly 2 million square feet of capacity in the Salt Lake City and Dallas areas.","UPS has 23 global modernization projects in the works. These investments, along with other network optimization and data connectivity initiatives, are part of our broad strategy to use technology to add capacity and to improve our operating performance.","We also use technology to enhance the customer experience at UPS, and we're excited about the recent successful launch of our new ups.com website and the related digital marketing capabilities. These capabilities enable us to present relevant problem-solving information combined with the UPS shipping offer to existing and prospective customers via the web. We expect to provide customers a more personalized experience while growing incremental revenue.","Given our significant investments in rapidly changing technology, UPS is creating a new Advanced Technology Group comprised of leading IT and engineering experts. The Advanced Technology Group will be responsible for the research, testing and development of new innovations and the application of those technologies. They will also help us strengthen collaboration with technology companies and academic institutions to bring the best solutions to UPS.","We will advance the use of the latest technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve customer service and make operations more efficient. I'm really excited about the potential of this group to transform our company even further to the benefit of our customers and to our investors.","Beyond technology, we're also adding to our service portfolio. We're making great progress rolling out our new U.S. Saturday ground operations. In addition to the three cities tested in 2016, we've recently started operations in 15 metropolitan areas, including the three largest markets: New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago.","One of the many benefits for our customers is the ability to tender ground shipments to UPS on Saturday and have the package arrive on Monday. The initial results have been promising. New shipments picked up on Saturday have been balanced across our product line and we remain on plan to expand coverage across nearly 4,700 cities by the holiday season later this year.","Another example of how we're upgrading our service portfolio is the expansion of our dangerous goods shipping capabilities. We now accept more than 400 new commodities in our global air network and more than 300 additional products for ground shipments across Europe.","As we expand our portfolio, we're also improving our service levels to provide customers with the most timely service available. We've shortened delivery times all across our intra-Europe ground network. In fact, we're cutting a full day out of our delivery times between more than 350 cities in 26 countries.","Over the last year, we've improved transit times for virtually the entire ground network, serving the 28 EU countries plus Switzerland and Norway. These enhancements are clearly driving forward our business in Europe. In fact, we achieved another quarter of double-digit gains in European cross-border shipments, and UPS' total export growth rate is the highest we've produced since 2010. Our international business continues to lead the industry while growing market share around the world.","Turning to the Supply Chain & Freight segment, the integration of Marken continues to show very good progress. The business opportunities and customer acceptance have been outstanding. The pharma industry recently recognized the Marken and UPS by ranking us number one in clinical trials logistics. Together, these actions demonstrate the commitment UPS is making to grow our business throughout the world. While we've been making great progress, we plan to announce additional strategic moves in the coming weeks.","During the quarter, UPS was once again named as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies by the Ethisphere Institute. Customers and investors alike should know their reputations are being protected by a company with high ethical standards.","Before I turn it over to Richard, I want to take a moment to recognize an elite group of UPSers. We now employ more than 9,300 drivers who have each driven at least 25 years without an accident. That means that nearly 1 out of every 10 UPS drivers have qualified for the UPS Circle of Honor. That is an incredible accomplishment and testament to our training and the quality of our people.","I want to express the gratitude of our entire company for their outstanding representation of UPS and congratulate all UPSers that work behind the scenes to ensure we safely navigate in the communities we serve.","Now, Richard will provide more details on our results. Richard?","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Thanks, David, and good morning everyone. UPS produced strong first quarter revenue growth of 6.2% and adjusted for currency, we were up 7.5%. Top line improvement was balanced across all three segments.","Looking at the highlights of the quarter, earnings per share came in at $1.32, up almost 4% over last year. Total operating profit was almost $1.8 billion and currency-adjusted operating profit was $1.9 billion.","The U.S. Domestic segment improved package yield in all products with solid revenue growth. International delivered excellent results, with double-digit growth and contributions from all products and all regions. And finally, Supply Chain & Freight had a remarkable quarter, growing both top line, tonnage and shipments by producing higher operating profit.","Core performance in the business was slightly ahead of plan. However, some known and some unexpected headwinds affected bottom-line performance in both the U.S. and the International segments. Let me make a few comments on the effects of these items before covering the quarterly highlights.","As previously disclosed, the currency hedge transition weighed on International results in the quarter. To provide additional transparency, we've included an enhancement to the currency-neutral web schedule, including operating profit on a currency neutral basis.","Currency impacted operating profit in the quarter by $119 million in the segment and we still anticipate a drag from currency to be about $400 million for the full year.","Net fuel was a drag this quarter on operating profit as well. The fuel surcharge for January was based on lower fuel prices in November of 2016. This timing lag created an almost $30 million shortfall in the U.S. Domestic segment.","The actual fuel prices increased from November. In early February, we reduced the lag between revenue and expense from two months to two weeks. This mitigates net fuel timing issues moving forward.","Startup expense for investment projects and service enhancements will continue to weigh on operating profits for the remainder of 2017. However, as new areas of the country come online for Saturday delivery, new revenue will begin to offset deployment cost later this year.","Also notable during this quarter were the irregular growth rates across the months. Specifically, there was a pause in consumer spending activity in February, likely driven by a number of factors including some weather and the delayed income tax refunds.","And lastly, with the adoption of the new accounting standard for stock awards, we recorded a tax credit this quarter. This process will be a first quarter only annual tax event. In February, we outlined this change in our 10-K and at the Investor Conference.","Now, let's turn to the details of each segment. U.S. Domestic revenue was up 5% to $9.5 billion. Revenue per package increased 2.4%, with yield growth in air and ground products. Higher fuel surcharges this year added approximately 50 basis points. We are continuing to develop and will implement initiatives around surge pricing to ensure revenue is properly aligned with cost to serve throughout the year.","In volume, our average daily volume was up 2.6%, led by air products as Next Day Air and Deferred both grew by approximately 4%. E-commerce demand drove the continuing shift in product mix. B2C shipments increased about 7%.","On the commercial side, B2B shipment growth improved quarter-over-quarter, but remained down slightly on a year-over-year basis. We are seeing signs of rebounding activity in many of the industrial production sectors. However, brick-and-mortar retail customers continue to adjust their business model to service more online purchasing and many are closing stores. As they move through this transition, UPS is investing in solutions to take advantage of these shifting market trends.","Turning to our operating costs, we were affected by fuel and operating penalties associated with 17 major projects currently under construction and the expansion of 15 major metropolitan areas through the deployment of Saturday delivery. And lastly, we had several late winter storms. We put the combined effect of these items to be around $85 million and estimate about 60% of that are onetime in nature. Given these headwinds, operating profit was $1.1 billion.","Looking now at the International segment, total revenue increased almost 5% to $3.1 billion and was up nearly 11% on a currency-neutral basis. Exports jumped more than 14%, with strong growth across regions and products. Export gains in Asia, Europe and the Americas were all around 15%, and Europe cross-border shipments increased more than 15%.","Non-U.S. Domestic shipments were up nearly 11%, driven by double-digit growth in Poland, Italy, and France. Importantly, we are seeing faster growth in both the established and emerging markets of the world.","Our International portfolio is performing remarkably well. We are creating value for our customers while expanding global solutions with the execution of our investment strategy. The European lane enhancements that David mentioned are contributing to the market share gain.","Operating profit was $529 million, down about 7.8%. Adjusted for currency, operating profit was $648 million, up almost 13%.","This quarter, our results were produced through a balanced approach. First, we had market-leading growth across all products. Second, we had improved network efficiency in all regions of the world. And finally, globally, we continue to focus on creating customer-driven solutions.","Turning to Supply Chain & Freight, it was a great quarter, best first quarter operating profit in our history. We had broad-based improvements across the segment. Revenue increased 13% on tonnage growth and forwarding and UPS Freight. Operating profit climbed 22% and the margin expanded 50 basis points.","Driven by high demand for middle-market customers, the forwarding unit experience around 10% growth in tonnage across all major products as the market conditions improved. Distribution revenue grew at mid-single-digits due to the increased demand from healthcare, retail, and aerospace customers. Operating profit and margin improved significantly over the prior year.","UPS Freight revenue was up more than 8% on LTL revenue per hundredweight gain and tonnage improvements. We are extremely pleased with the progress the Supply Chain & Freight units are making.","Now, let's turn to our cash flow. UPS ended the quarter with $3.7 billion in cash and marketable securities. We used capital this quarter to invest in growth opportunities, fund our pension, and distribute returns to our shareholders.","First, we've accelerated our pace of investments into the business for capacity, capabilities, and flexibility. And as a result, our capital expenses were up to $938 million for the quarter and we're on track to reinvest 6% to 7% of revenue this year as we have guided.","Second, cash from operations was used to take advantage of rising PBGC premiums and lower future operating expense. We advanced our planned and discretionary funding to the first quarter and have no plans for further contributions in 2017.","And lastly, we have distributed funds to shareholders to the repurchase of more than 4 million shares for about $450 million and paid out nearly $800 million in dividends, up 6% per share over last year. This quarter, our effective tax rate was about 32%.","As we disclosed in the 10-K and mentioned at the Investor Conference, we adopted the change in stock-based compensation accounting standard during the first quarter. As a result, we expect our tax rate to be 35% in the upcoming quarters and the effective rate for 2017 in total to be around 34.5%.","Looking forward, we remain committed to the original guidance for this year with earnings per share in the range of $5.80 to $6.10, including about $400 million or $0.30 per share unfavorable impact of currency.","In summary, customer demand for UPS services increased. We are moving forward fast, using our financial strength for our investment and growth opportunities to ensure we capitalize on the expanding market in our industry.","Thank you for your time today. Now, we'll ask the operator to open the line so we can take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. As a reminder, please ask only one question so we may accommodate more callers. Feel free to get back into the queue and we'll take a second question, time permitting. Our first question will come from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. It looks like some very strong B2C growth in the quarter and solid in B2B. Could you speak to what you see in margins in the ground business going forward with this mix shift dynamic that you cited? Thanks.","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Sure. This is Richard. And I think we should start by saying that when we look at 2017, we're early in an investment cycle as we transform the network into the smart global local logistics network.","This quarter, we did have some costs that we weren't expecting and we called those out on both in my talk and in this press release, but there was about $35 million that was driven by almost 5 million square feet of development of new buildings that currently under construction and the Saturday operations.","But when you put all that together, we still expect to have leverage this year. We knew that some of the startup costs would be early in the year. And the other important thing to remember here is that we did see a pause in consumer demand in February. Fortunately, March came right back and we're seeing the same trends in April. So we still expect that what we talked about at the Investor Conference and continues to see slight improvement, we'll continue to see in 2017.","Alan Gershenhorn - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Hey. This is Alan. I just want to add that I think we reported back in the fourth quarter that B2B growth was negative. And while it was still slightly declining in the first quarter, it came \u2013 the quarter-over-quarter results are really big improvement and we saw that across more of the industry segments.","Rich did mention that the brick-and-mortar slowed down, but we've got a great strategy moving forward to bring B2B back to positive. David talked about dangerous goods expansion. We've got some great things going on in healthcare, and certainly, the returns portfolio continues to generate great B2B.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please go ahead.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. I wanted to also ask on the domestic package margin. Richard, you identified I think the $50 million that you said was unusual. If I add that back in, I still get I think something like a 30-basis-point decline in domestic package margin. How would you think about that going forward? I mean, you commented a bit.","Should we model margin improvement in the second quarter or second half in domestic package? And is that cost falling off or volume is accelerating? So I guess just in more kind of perspective on how these domestic package margin may play out this year. Thank you.","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Sure. Tom, as I had mentioned a moment ago, we still expect to see leverage. We knew going in that the startup costs for Saturday would be a little heavier in the first quarter because you have to put the investment in, in order to get the customers to bring in the volume that they need delivered on Saturday. And when we think about Saturday, we're thinking about not just deliveries, but we looked in Saturday operations because we are also doing pickups, which will actually leave sometime in transit for some of our customers.","So when we put the year together, we do see an improvement in margin. We see leverage coming. We did know the first quarter, you would have more of the startup costs. But we also understand that through the year, we're investing to create the network and transform it and we're going to see that happening through the year, but we're also going to see revenue coming in to offset it.","So I would look at the first quarter as being an example of how the margin looks. I would look at it as the dollar amount of investment is something that we will continue to have, but you'll see revenue continue to grow as well.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Thanks. We're going to take a online question here, and this question comes from Jack Atkins. Jack's question is about the Freight Forwarding business. So, Jim, can you give us some color around Freight Forwarding business?","James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Sure, Jack. It's Jim. On the Forwarding businesses, as we kind of opened with some of the opening comments, this is a really good quarter for us in Supply Chain & Freight all around.","Specifically, in the Forwarding business, though, I think most of us would recognize the last couple years have been challenging and I think we used that as an opportunity at UPS to look at the business, restructure a bit, work on some overheads, and take a look at segmentation in the market and go at it differently. And what you saw then in the first quarter was about a year-and-a-half's worth of work and we see it continuing, quite frankly.","We're looking at really strong growth in the middle market that is important for the mix. In that product offering, we've got balance across air freight, ocean and North America as well all growing double digits. So a very, very balanced distribution in Forwarding with bottom-line profitability approaching 20% year-over-year growth.","So, we don't need a bunch of top line growth; we need just the right growth in the model for it to produce in a UPS forwarding unit. And so, we're pretty pleased with the first quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from David Vernon with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking the question. David, I wanted to ask you perhaps a governance question. I was wondering if given the importance of managing this transition and stabilizing the domestic margin, if you and the board had any conversations about creating the proper incentives for management for the employees to actually kind of achieve that target and whether we can expect you to maybe talking about that in the future as far as helping to give investors some confidence that there's more skin in the game in terms of actually executing against what is a challenging transition for the business.","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Well, David, to answer that question, obviously the board and myself, we're always looking for ways to tie in the best interest of the company but also the best interest of the leadership.","And so, our compensation packages are highly oriented towards results. The variable pay is a much higher percentage than it is in many companies, and we feel like that we certainly are incenting the right things.","Now, we look at it on a year-to-year basis because things do change and when they do, we would make those adjustments. But we focus on the top line, we focus on the bottom line. And one thing that makes our company a little bit different is we incent full results all the way down to the supervisor level.","So we have our profit plan and we agree to that. We hold people accountable to it and it goes all the way down to that line supervisor. So, I'm very comfortable that we have it aligned correctly, but thank you for the question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey, thanks. Good morning. Wanted to ask sort of about some of the comments in terms of the investment on the domestic side, and I think the view is that you'll incentivize growth as you're building out the network here. And I guess you also need to get price right, too. So I guess I'm just kind of wondering how you will manage sort of that balance between making sure you get the growth that you're building for, but also managing the price piece of it obviously to make sure that the returns on this new incremental investment are as good as what we normally have expected from you over the years.","Alan Gershenhorn - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Hey, Chris. This is Alan. Thanks for that question. Yeah. Look, I mean I think the pricing actions that we discussed on the last call were certainly visible in this quarter's results and we also generated some good volume growth with Next Day Air up 4%, Deferred up over 4%, and ground over 2%.","The first quarter, U.S.-based pricing came in at the higher end of our 2% to 3% range. And some of the things we're doing, the annual GRI, we broadened the U.S. Domestic DIM divisor from 166 to the 139. The additional handling, the overmaxes, the new fuel surcharge, it's all being managed very, very tightly and well and we're very, very pleased with those results.","I'd also just let you know on \u2013 Richard talked about peak and surcharge pricing that ensures pricing is aligned to cost to serve whether it's peak or in other parts of the year, and we've got a significant focus in that area also. And just a little color there on some of the objectives where we're really looking to set the market expectations for pricing to match the supply and demand.","We're looking to cover the additional costs that we incur in those periods that lead up to and including peak as well as other periods of time where volume surges. And we're very, very focused on maintaining and improving the margins during peak. And then bottom line, always ensuring that we're protecting the integrity of the network for our customers with a great service that they've grown accustomed to.","Thanks for the question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, thanks. Morning, guys. So, first thing, I just wanted to clarify, in the press release in the International segment, when you talk about currency-neutral operating profit, does that suggest that currency is hurting first quarter 2017 results and the base is a lot higher or is it that it helped first quarter 2016? I just want to understand so we know the base to model for next year. So, just wanted to clarify that because I was confused.","And then, more just broadly, can you just talk about the pricing in International and at LTL? Because it looks like really good volume growth in the quarter, but maybe pricing a little bit softer.","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you for the question. It's quite a bit to that question. So, Richard, why don't you start the first? And then, Jim, if you follow up, I'd appreciate it.","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","So the question around the currency-neutral is there is an accounting standard as how you have to state those. And the accounting standard is that you use the last year because that's a published number. And so, what you'll see there is that's restating this year to last year. So for your models, you probably need to talk with Scott, but you would actually probably do it slightly different than what the accounting standard is.","But the most important thing is, is that when you look at the International business, it's really a story of what we've seen the last two years. Jim talked a minute ago about the broad-based growth in Supply Chain and we're seeing the same thing in the International business.","And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Jim to talk about.","James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.","I think, Scott, you also wanted to kind of touch on pricing in Forwarding. I would say that there was an event in the first quarter in the Asia market with about 20% of the capacity coming out of Shanghai market when five air carriers were put down with about 50 segments a day. So that actually allowed us and others to actually tighten up and focus on the margin and the pricing a little bit stronger.","And it also saw business move from forwarding into small package and back and forth. So, with respect to in the first quarter and the pricing in flat environment of Forwarding, I would say it was the best for us in about two years.","Our great margins continue to go way up, the bottom line continues to expand. We'll continue to do that. And we'll talk more, I think, in the upcoming calls about pricing in the small package around peak as well. We talk a lot about that in the Domestic market, but International has a role and responsibility to play there as well and we're evolving and maturing in that segment as well. So we'll talk more about that as we approach peak.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Oh, we're going to take a online question. This one is regarding, can you talk more about Coyote and how the business is growing in the marketplace?","Alan Gershenhorn - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Yeah. This is Alan. So, yeah, Coyote is really continuing to see strong year-on-year double-digit growth rates in loads. The UPS customer base is certainly highly predisposed to the truckload services that Coyote's offering. Service levels are really remaining consistently high.","As I think most of us know, the truckload market remains soft. We are seeing some signs of tightening, but this asset-light model really does provide great flexibility in the up and down cycles.","Synergies are on track. We expect to get about $100 million of that for 2017 and we're seeing them across the board in procurement, backhaul, asset utilization, cross-selling, and some of that's dropping obviously to the Domestic and Supply Chain\/Freight segments.","The last thing I'll say is that we've landed on the European continent with our Freightex acquisition where we're really excited about that. And we've expanded into Mexico also in addition to Canada. So we're really excited about taking the European \u2013 or the Coyote model abroad and things are going very, very well. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Next question will come from Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Great. Good morning. It sounds, David, like you were talking a bit about the accelerated rollout. I just want to understand, are you speeding up the timeframe or is this the same time you talked about back in February in terms of the 17 facilities? And is that something that you could accelerate?","And similarly, on your Saturday delivery, you talked about going from 15 metro areas to 4,700 cities. Is that a hiring move or scheduling for drivers that takes time to roll that out? Thanks.","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","All right. I'll take the first part of the question and then Myron will answer about the Saturday delivery.","The theme of our recent management conference was about going forward fast. And we're looking at every bit of our strategy and seeing where can we ramp up facilities, where can we ramp up implementation of technology in all of our investments.","We feel like the schedule that we have, and we're right on top of that schedule, Rich talked about what the CapEx was for the first quarter and it leads up right to the yearly average. So we're right on plan there. But if we can open up some of these buildings a little earlier, that is our focus.","We're going to do them right. We're going to implement them right. But we're looking in all regards to be able to answer our customers' needs and to do it as quickly as possible. And Saturday Air is a good example of that. We've got a pretty aggressive plan. And Myron, you want to talk about that?","Myron A. Gray - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Yeah. Ken, we're actually on schedule for our deployments. We opened up 40 buildings in the first quarter that impacted 15 major metro areas and we hope to \u2013 well, we will complete over 200 scheduled facilities for Saturday in the back half of this year.","Early adoption from our customers has been extremely positive, but we like to look at it as full Saturday operations. And the combination of picking up on Saturday and delivering on Monday has proven to be a real market advantage for all of our customers. Particularly, when you look at a number of fulfillment houses that are locating closer to their customer base. They're telling us that this added capability is really working very well for them.","So we're pleased with our progress to-date and if we can speed up, we certainly will. Thank you.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question will come from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, I think the Pulse of the Online Shopper reports that EPS puts out are pretty informative, and we've seen recently one of the big-box retailers offered discounts for items online, purchased online that aren't in the store. If a consumer is willing to pick it up in the store, they'll get a discount off of that.","So, just wondering how you see consumer behavior moving throughout your forecast period here and if you expect shippers will start to offer similar discounts to consumers, and if that's something that you expect will kind of help with density and help relieve some of the B2C pressure across all the networks that we're seeing recently. Thank you.","Alan Gershenhorn - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Yeah. Brian. This is Alan. Yeah. I think that one of the takeaways from the Pulse of the Online Shoppers are that the consumers want to get their packages when and where they want to when they're ordering online.","And that program you talk about, the base of that program has been out there for quite some time and now, folks are beginning to put promotional programs around that model and that will drive potentially more ship-to-store type of volume for UPS, which is certainly B2B, which is great business for us.","We're really focused on what the needs and the wants are of these consumers that we can tailor our services for the retailers so that they can win. And that really comes back to our omnichannel strategies which have ship-to-store \u2013 ship-from-store, store-to-store, our returns portfolio, along with UPS Access Points and My Choice. And I think Saturday deliveries and Saturday operations with pickup is just another great example of how we're working to build that e-commerce value stack to make sure that we're capturing share in that particular piece of the market profitably.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Ben Hartford with Baird. Please go ahead.","Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey. Good morning, everyone. I don't know if Juan's on the line. If not, maybe this question is for Jim. But curious about kind of emergence of blockchain technology and any sort of implications it may have for the International business, for Freight Forwarding specifically, and I guess most specifically customs brokerage. I know you guys have a large presence there. So, any perspective you might have on the implications from blockchain either negatively or positively? How you see that developing would be helpful. Thanks.","James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Sure. I would say, Ben, the whole Hyperledger that sits beneath it does have application in many parts of our business. And I think, obviously, we had questions \u2013 David had so far \u2013 about some of the investments and other ones we're looking at and how we speed those up.","There is a rhythm to this, obviously. We are the world's largest customs broker. That's a big business that it needs to be innovated and blockchain is one of \u2013 along with the likes of artificial intelligence, and obviously, we've got the Trade Facilitation Agreement that now has come across under World Trade Organization.","So, yes, it's in there. It's in many pieces of our business, including other parts of Forwarding. We don't want to get too far \u2013 ahead of ours skis here and talk about it today on the call. But I think as it evolves and we put more of it in the market, we'll point to that in the calls and how it's really impacting both customers and the bottom line of business. And I think Rich has a couple comments as well.","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Yeah. When you think about the potential of a blockchain, we see a tremendous amount not just in the areas Jim talked about, but also even in how customers and suppliers \u2013 our customers who are fulfilling transact. And so we do think there's a lot of potential there.","And that's one of the reasons that David actually created the Advanced Technology and Engineering Group is to make sure we stay in front of the latest in technology, figuring out where the best business uses are. Sometimes there'll be many. We may start with one and then apply it differently across the entire network.","So we are watching that very carefully. And between our Advanced Technology Group as well as our Strategic Enterprise Fund, we will find where the best use is, but one of the things we have to make sure is the right and proper controls in the ownership of the data that's there before we can start putting it into the integrity of our systems.","Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","That's great. Thank you.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","We're going to take an online question. This comes from Dave Ross and it's about the International volumes and how we should think about it being related to specific market share gains and the global economy broadly. So, Jim?","James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.","So, David, I guess before I go right to the answer, I want to kind of drop back because I think for us, internationally, this was a pretty unique quarter for us. It was what I consider the culmination of a couple years of work and it's got long runway ahead of it to continue.","We talked a little bit about this at the conference \u2013 I did, specifically \u2013 investment conference in February about the flywheel effect, and that's exactly what's going on in the business right now.","It's the combination of the right investments in the network over the last couple years. We put some new governance models in place to run the business in really good opportunity places like the Middle East and North America. We got new partnership models that are running in our emerging markets and really pretty strong senior leadership cadence in International today. I'm pretty \u2013 very, very satisfied with that.","So we go back to your question on where's the growth, is it economic? Is it the model? I'd say it's 90% model right now in UPS. And the reason I say that is if you look at places like Europe, for instance, we just completed the first quarter and saw over 15% intra-European growth, which is \u2013 where most of that piece of the business stays in Europe. That's not economic; that's just a model producing great, great benefits for customers who are choosing UPS at faster and faster rates than they ever had before.","So we do see it continuing, we've got the emerging markets going forward as well and we had a really strong quarter in both China and all of Asia Pacific, and it's balanced. Really, if you look at across all of International right now, in my 15 years, I've never seen so many double digits in so many places at the same time. And finally, I think we've got in the new governance model in our U.S. North America export operation, it's starting to move like it hasn't in the past as well.","So, I think it's the business model, I think it's leadership at UPS out in the field and also working with Myron's folks in the U.S. as great partners because it has to come in and out of the U.S. at the same time. So, we're pretty pleased with the first quarter and we expect it to continue going forward.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will come from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Danny C. Schuster - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, good morning. This is Danny Schuster on for Allison. Thank you for taking our question.","Historically, you discussed returning about 100% of net income through dividends and buybacks. So just wondering, while you're in your investment phase, what do you think is the more reasonable range to expect? And do you plan to get back to 100% after the investment cycle is completed?","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Danny, this is Richard. I think the first thing that \u2013 when we're looking at the use of capital, we try to think about what's the best use given all the different opportunities in front of UPS to continue to grow the business. So, of course, with our high return on invested capital, our first goal is to reinvest in the business, grow the profits, and for the next three to five years, we did call out a higher CapEx.","We also think it's important to have a strong return to our investors, and we have called out that our dividends are 50% to 55% of net income and that still is a priority. And then we've kind of given you a range on the buybacks between $1 billion and $1.8 billion. And the reason we gave the range was because as opportunities are created, we have to make sure we're evaluating what's in the best interest long term for the investors. Continuing to harvest the return on invested capital, growing the base, creating more value while returning to the shareholders.","So, as we get through this next cycle, we'll see what new opportunities come and we'll make the appropriate decision. And through that process, we'll continue to do what we've always done and that's share it with our investors.","Danny C. Schuster - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for getting me on the call here.","So, David, I guess following up off the response to that question and something you talked about earlier with a balanced top-line and bottom-line focus. We can definitely see in your Domestic business, if we go back four years, I think your revenue is up 15%. If we go up even farther, we can call it 30%, 40% growth. But we're just not seeing it translate into the bottom line.","So, clearly, from our perspective, it looks like there's a very sharp market share focus at UPS. But why not maybe take a little bit more of that top line in price? Why not slow down the volume growth until you can get some of these initiatives in place? I guess just educate us from an outsider's perspective why we should care so much about volume and lower margins today and hope that these investments can drive better returns in the future.","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Okay. Well, I'll start out that question and then we'll go to Richard. But, first, I have to tell you that we look at it a little bit differently than you do. So I appreciate your opinion, but we believe that it needs to be a very balanced approach.","We have talked today and Alan shared that we were at the top end of our range that we're looking at the 2% to 3% of increasing our pricing. But he also talked about the surge pricing and what we're going to do there to make sure that our costs are covered, especially during those high points of the year where capacity is tight. So, I don't believe we're putting less emphasis on pricing. I think that we have wrapped up the emphasis on pricing.","We have also shared with you that we're going to see positive operating leverage in the U.S. this year. We knew that we were going to have some investment costs at the beginning of the year that would not have as much revenue coming in as it will in the later part of the year.","But we really feel the key is we have to be balanced. We have to continue to work on our costs. We want to grow the business. We want to grow it in the right direction and we're putting a lot of businesses in that area, and we're going to make sure that we're pricing right.","So, Richard, I may not have given you a lot of wiggle room, but go ahead and follow up on a couple of the things.","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Sure. When we look at how we're doing and what we're doing today, we are investing in the network and we're not investing in the network for the next quarter or the next year. It's really about generationally and about the long term.","There has been a fundamental shift in how our market has been created for small package. The time period you were talking about, you can go back and you'll see there was a much larger B2B. The number of people buying online was much lower. And so, our market is expanding, but the way people are receiving merchandise is different. And we're preparing this company and our network to make the adjustments for that.","And then the other thing that I don't think we expected to see the last few years was really how slow IP was. Now, we do see IP starting to recover, but we're also balancing that with a lot of brick-and-mortars redoing their model and adjusting.","So, it's really about the investment, getting to $800 million to $1 billion in savings and avoidance we called out. And we think over the long term and as we complete the transformation of the network, you'll see that all of the efforts we put in not only bring back the return on invested capital at the highest in the industry, but the margins are appropriate as we have guided at the Investor Conference as well.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Let's take a online question. We have another question that has come in on what the corporate tax rate of 15% that has been mentioned in the press. So, David?","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","We heard this yesterday and so we're not prepared to quantify what the advantage for us would be. But I can tell you, it would be very, very positive.","And we are a high-taxed corporation. We've told you that we expect our rate to be 35% \u2013 effective rate 35% this year. So we're very encouraged by what we're hearing.","And we know we're early in the process, but we support and have supported for a long time comprehensive tax reform. We certainly felt like the tax rate needed to be lowered. We have competition based in other countries that is paying a much, much less tax rate. And we do believe that a competitive international tax system was extremely important.","So, the initial results we got from yesterday, we felt good about it. We look forward to working with Congress and the administration on this legislation, but we think that it will help American companies be more competitive. We think it will drive jobs, and we're very excited about the potential. So thank you for the question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. Morning, everyone. A couple of questions. First, can you specifically quantify the impact of the facility fire in the quarter? And second, on last mile warehousing, as B2C becomes a larger part of your business going forward, do you see the need to shift your operating footprint and your warehousing footprint to be closer to the customer? And if you could elaborate on some of the initiatives you're taking in your investment plan to do that. Thanks.","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","So I'll take the first part of the question around the fire and then I'll pass it off to Jim to talk about the distribution question.","But Ravi, if you look at what we put out and I think when you see this quarter, we tried to give as much transparency as possible and full visibility to the onetimes, what was happening with fuel as prices change and increase as well as what was going on with the currency.","But at the end, you can kind of pretty much figure that the big change in both the weather and the fire combined was about $20 million, and that could be laid out based on the math that we have there. And those were things we weren't (53:32) at the same time, we had another benefit in the tax that kind of offset that.","But at the end of the day, those two combined kind of wash out. But the fire wasn't something we expected. The operation has made all the proper repairs. The building is back open, and the businesses continue to run in that facility. But it was something that we did feel like we need to call out.","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","And I'll take the second part. This is David and not Jim. But on warehousing and the need for it to be closer, I'll give you a couple of things. First is \u2013 and Alan talked about our omnichannel strategy earlier. And we do believe and especially with some of the brick-and-mortar companies, they're looking at how they can compete with large e-commerce companies. And so, working with us on being able to hit the customer the next day or in two days \u2013 and we've had a lot of good discussions and we believe that we are the best answer when it comes to those retail solutions that's out there.","Another thing, though, that we're certainly seeing progress is these midsized customers, that they really want to be able to compete with that time in transit. They could never build the warehousing in order to do that. So that has been our focus over the last few months and will continue to be is how we can use our available facilities and give these midsized customers very similar coverage to what the larger companies would have, and that would be based on our small package network, but it's based on Jim's distribution and warehousing network. And we see that as a very good opportunity for us and we're continuing to work with our customers in those areas. So thank you for the questions.","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Thank you.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Okay. We're going to take another online question. This question comes out \u2013 some news that came out here this morning, late yesterday afternoon about the Defense Department awarding UPS a contract for services. Alan?","Alan Gershenhorn - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Yeah. Look, we're certainly excited to have been awarded that shipping contract for the next five years. The contract is for small package global shipping and custom services and covers the U.S. Military and a host of other government agencies. And it will commence in the fourth quarter of 2017.","We're actually one of the leading providers to the U.S. government today, and this enables the U.S. government to continue receiving the value they get from those UPS services. And it's also going to provide us with some significant opportunities to grow our business with the U.S. government, while helping them create better efficiencies and value for them and their customers. So we're really excited about that opportunity. Thanks.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","We're going to follow up with another online question about synthetic density and what we're doing to create synthetic density in our business models as we build up these investments.","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Yeah. We've talked about synthetic density before and how it is important to improve the residential stop density, and we've got quite a few initiatives that we're focusing on there. We've seen some improvements and we think there's a lot of potential. So it is something that we talk to our customers about, especially the large shippers, the large e-commerce, the large brick-and-mortar shippers.","So, Alan, do you want to get into a little bit more detail about synthetic density?","Alan Gershenhorn - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Yeah. I would just start out by saying that when you look at really our whole UPS e-commerce value stack, almost everything we're doing there has a component of creating synthetic density, while at the same time, providing great value to the retailers and the consumers that enjoy those services.","We all know about SurePost and SurePost Redirect, and Redirect was up about 10% for the quarter year-over-year, quarter-to-quarter. Some of the other services like UPS Access Point where the shipper from their web portal can direct their consumers to UPS Access Points, both for their convenience or for the retailer to achieve a lower cost, while UPS ends up with a more profitable shipment.","They can also \u2013 on 35 million now My Choice users are redirecting a lot of their packages to these access points and then, obviously, our not in ones, when we miss you at home, we're redirecting those to access points. So that's kind of, like I've said before, the Swiss Army knife of getting consumers' deliveries in a profitable way.","We're rolling out about 300 lockers in the U.S. We've already got 200 of them out there and they're another way for us to make that synthetic density. And you've heard us talk about SDS, Synchronized Delivery Solutions, where the match is created before the package ever leaves the shipper.","And then last, but not least is returns, which we're going to continue to drive. We've just added Optoro to our industry-leading returns value proposition, and that's going to enable customers to optimize the value for disposition of those returns goods.","And then last, but not least is that the \u2013 one-tenth of a piece per stop on delivery density increases our operating profit by $200 million. So we're extremely focused on continuing to drive this synthetic density.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes our Q&A today. Now, I'll turn the program back over to Scott.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","I want to thank everyone for the questions today. We really appreciate it. David?","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","All right. Just a couple closing comments. We're making good progress on our building of the smart global logistics network. We continue to see strong growth opportunities for UPS.","We've just seen great performance in International and the Supply Chain & Freight this quarter. You heard that from Jim and from others. We've made it very clear today that we expect U.S. Domestic to have positive leverage in the quarters ahead. That's going to happen by \u2013 we're going to continue to increase our effectiveness focusing on technologies, focusing on our processes and procedures, but also focusing on our pricing initiatives to make sure we carry those out.","We are transforming and growing this business. We're going to continue to do that, and we have more strategic announcements on the way. And we just like to finish by thanking each of you for joining us on the call. Really appreciate it.

My name is Steven and I\u2019ll be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. Please note, we will take only one question from each participant to accommodate more analysts during the call. Thank you for your cooperation.","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Joe Wilkinson, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.","Joe Wilkinson","Good morning and welcome to the UPS second quarter 2014 earnings call. Joining me today are Scott Davis, our CEO; Kurt Kuehn, our CFO; along with Chief Operating Officer, David Abney; International President, Jim Barber; President of U.S. Operations, Myron Gray; and UPS Chief Commercial Officer, Alan Gershenhorn.","Before we begin, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the company. These anticipated results are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2013 Form 10-K and first quarter 10-Q reports. These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the Securities and Exchange Commission.","As previously announced during the quarter, UPS completed the transfer of post-retirement liabilities for certain Teamster employees to defined contribution healthcare plans. As a result, the company recorded an after-tax charge of $665 million reducing earnings per share by $0.72. In our remarks today, all quarterly and full year comments and comparisons will refer to adjusted results. In addition, we will discuss UPS\u2019 free cash flow which is a non-GAAP financial measure.","The webcast of today\u2019s call along with the reconciliation of free cash flow and adjusted results are available on the UPS Investor Relations website. Just as a reminder, as on previous calls, please ask only one question so that we may allow as many as possible to participate.","Thanks for your cooperation. Now, I will turn it over to Scott.","D. Scott Davis","Thanks, Joe, and good morning to everyone. UPS experienced robust second quarter revenue and volume growth across the portfolio, and we are encouraged to have all three segments improving operating profit, the first time since 2011. Customers choose UPS solutions at an increasing pace confirming the value of our portfolio.","However, our results also reflect the challenge of today\u2019s evolving marketplace and earnings were somewhat less than we expected. The accelerated growth and peak season preparations are driving the implementation costs as well as increased investments in automation and new capacity. David will provide you details on these efforts in a moment.","The initiatives we are pursuing today will enable UPS to provide enhanced solutions for our customers to secure their business and build their trust. At the same time, we\u2019d look for opportunities to improve revenue management, driving more bottom line growth and industry-leading margins well into the future. The expansion of dim weight pricing is a change we\u2019re making to ensure UPS is properly compensated for network consumption.","During the quarter, we saw economies around the world pick up a bit. The U.S. economy did rebound as expected from the weather-related problems in the first quarter. Solid economic fundamentals had driven retail sales higher especially e-commerce. In Europe, the economic outlook has remained steady with growth from larger countries offsetting slower, smaller ones. While growth in Asia remains relatively stable, they are seeing an acceleration of overall exports.","One way to increase economic growth is through pre-trade. Recent efforts by the administration to proceed with a next phase of the National Export Initiative will develop opportunities for U.S. small and medium-sized customers to reach new markets. This platform includes sections on trade facilitation, border clearance reform, free trade agreements and infrastructure investment. Expanding pre-trade agreements will provide employment opportunities here at home.","Speaking of employment opportunities, to support the Joining Forces initiative, we pledged to hire 50,000 veterans by 2018. Military veterans have a long tradition at UPS and bring valuable skills that provide great benefits for our company. Also during the quarter, because of our progress with ORION, CIO Magazine recognized UPS as one of 100 companies that demonstrates excellence and achievement in information technology.","This breakthrough routing technology represents a decade-long effort to develop tools that reduce miles driven, cut fuel consumption and improve the customer experience. Recognition like this is rewarding but more importantly the capabilities we received from this technology puts UPS in a better position to respond to changing market dynamics.","Before I turn it over to David, I want to take a moment to congratulate him on being named UPS\u2019 eleventh CEO. I know he\u2019s excited to lead UPS and I\u2019m confident David will bring his extraordinary passion and commitment to the job. David?","David Abney","Thanks, Scott. I speak for everyone at UPS when I say that we are a better company as a result of inspired leadership you\u2019ve provided. You led the company through one of the more turbulent global economic periods in history transforming UPS into the world\u2019s leading logistics provider. On behalf of the 400,000 UPS\u2019 around the world, we say thank you.","On a more personal note, Scott and I have worked closely for more than a decade. During that time he has been an inspiring mentor and I look forward to working with him as Chairman. As part of the transition, Scott will remain in his current role until September. This allows me to spend most of my time out with customers and employees to better understand their needs and listen to their ideas. From what I have heard so far, I am more encouraged than ever about the future of UPS.","One frequent topic of discussion has been our preparation for peak season. We\u2019ve had meaningful conversations with customers about our plans. These discussions provide the foundation for a joint commitment of forecast volume enabling UPS to better manage how large accounts impact our network. We have made changes to UPS technology that will improve communication with customers. Solutions have been implemented to provide better information on package location and shipment status, ultimately benefitting customers and UPS.","The accelerated ORION deployment is progressing. Now, its reductions have come in higher than planned and we expect to have about 45% of our drivers using the routing technology for peak. The facility automation and expansion projects are moving ahead as expected. Several new buildings and retrofit projects in California and Texas will come on line later this year, providing additional capacity and flexibility.","To increase sort capacity, we are opening about 50 new hub source in existing buildings. This will add 5% to our capacity with minimal capital investment. UPS is focused on staying ahead of the holiday shipment surge that starts during cyber week. We have always had limited operations on Black Friday. However, this year we will expand to a full operating day. While this benefits the network by leveling volume fluctuations, it will drive additional operating costs.","As we look more closely at preparing for peak and the implications of the accelerated volume growth, we have expanded the scope of several projects I just reviewed. Though these projects will weigh on 2014 earnings, they will pay for themselves in the long run. Overall, we are ahead of our peak readiness plan and I am confident UPS would deliver a great peak season this year.","Now, looking across the portfolio, I will provide some details on other strategic investments UPS is making. Here in the U.S. we opened our new automated facility in Laredo, Texas. This is a key location to support the rapid growth along the U.S. and Mexican border. Also in the U.S., we recently opened 36 healthcare-compliant field stocking locations to reduce delivery time for medical device shipments. These sites will provide customers the ability to reach over 80% of U.S. hospital beds within four hours.","In Europe, UPS announced the opening of a new packaged center in Southampton, UK. This 150-car facility nearly doubles the capacity of two other buildings it replaces. Meanwhile in Asia, we opened a distribution facility at the Beijing airport to serve UPS customers hi-tech retail and healthcare supply chain needs. Also in Asia, we added our rail service option for UPS forwarding customers shipping from China to Europe. This low-cost, four-container offering is up to 50% faster than ocean freight and 70% less costly than airfreight.","In Latin-America, we announced a significant expansion of our small package operations in Brazil. The opening of nine facilities will allow UPS to service more than 200 cities in the country. As you can see, UPS has been busy expanding our reach, creating supply chain capabilities and building out our small package infrastructure. These investments are part of our long-term strategy for growth and will improve returns going forward. This will be a parent in 2015 as we benefit from dim weight pricing and operational improvements from ORION.","UPS\u2019 around the world are implementing these innovated solutions to meet customer needs. UPS is positioned to benefit from the continuing acceleration of global trade and the economic growth of emerging markets. I can assure you creating value for customers and shareowners remains a top priority for the senior leadership team at UPS. I look forward to meeting many of you at the investor conference in November where we will share more details on our plans for the future.","Now, I would turn it over to Kurt to update you on the quarter\u2019s results. Kurt?","Kurt Kuehn","Thanks, David, and good morning. UPS portfolio is hitting the mark with customers resulting in global shipment growth of 7.2% and driving revenue up 5.6% to a total $14.3 billion. Certainly the pace of growth exceeded our expectations. However, increased demand for low cost deferred solutions has put pressure on yields and margins.","Second quarter earnings per share increased by 7.1% but was below our expectations. We continued investing in new capabilities and expanding our network, adapting our business today to ensure that we can capitalize on future growth opportunities.","Now for some details on how the segments performed. Starting with U.S. domestic where revenue increased 5.2% to $8.7 billion, driven by a 7% jump in packaged volume. UPS Ground products contributed 8% growth while deferred improved over 5%. Retailers continue to select UPS SurePost for their lightweight residential shipments, accounting for about half of our volume growth this quarter. However, we do expect this growth to slow a bit as we wrap wins from last year.","In addition, during the quarter, a retail customer upgraded its catalog distribution to UPS Ground from the U.S. mail contributing to our ground growth. Beyond B2C, our B2B growth was the highest we\u2019ve seen in several years, primarily due to the retail sector. We also saw improvements in the industrial and manufacturing sectors. Combined, these changes in product and customer mix led yields lower by 2% driven primarily by a more than 60% jump in UPS SurePost shipments.","Operating profits increased by 34 million to $1.2 billion while operating margin decline slightly to 13.5%. A couple of key factors created operating expense headwinds. First, we continued to experience very poor rail performance during the quarter. In order to maintain service commitments, alternative operating plans were put into place. This drove higher purchase transportation expense as well as excess UPS network costs.","In addition, hiring and training costs increased in Q2 due to the accelerated volume growth and the peak-related projects that David mentioned. However, we were able to offset much of the higher costs through improved productivity. Our direct labor hours were up 6% and miles driven were up 4% compared to average daily volume growth of 7.4%. Expense per package declined by 1.7%, a good result but not quite enough to offset the yield decline.","Now for the international business where revenue was $3.3 billion, up 6%. Total shipments increased by 6.6% led by higher export product growth for Europe and Asia. Export shipments jumped 9.1% with Europe up 13% and Asia up about 6%. Non-U.S. domestic volume increased by 5% led by strong growth in Europe. Currently neutral revenue per piece declined 1.7% as our export product yields dropped by 4%.","Strong non-premium growth of 13% continued to outpace premium products although they were also up by 4%. Yield was also lowered by shorter trade lanes as our intra-Europe volume was one of the fastest growing lanes. Operating profit improved by 4.4% to $471 million. However, operating margin did contract 20 basis points to 14.5%.","During the quarter, we continued to experience rapid shipment growth as changing volume distribution patterns developed in Europe. These trends pushed network capacity above ideal levels in a few areas and as a result we were forced to pay a premium for short-term capacity. This contributed to higher delivery and network expenses, ultimately driving in-country costs up by 8.9%.","In the near term, our team in Europe is implementing a number of changes to operations while pursuing revenue management initiatives aimed at improving yields. In addition, we are finalizing our capital investment plan designed to add capacity and improve operating leverage. We are confident in our ability to pull growth through the bottom line.","Looking now at supply chain and freight which performed well this quarter with revenue growth of 6.5% up to 2.3 billion. Operating profit increased 11% and margin expanded by 30 basis points to 7.5%. The forwarding unit experienced substantial revenue growth and expanded operating margin slightly, driven by improvements in ocean forwarding and brokerage.","International airfreight experienced double-digit growth in both shipments and tonnage although the pricing environment out of Asia continued to weigh on profitability. In distribution, customers continue to seek our unique solutions to their supply chain needs. Revenue increased by high single digits lifted by improved demand from retail and healthcare clients.","UPS freight revenue grew 5.5% primarily due to a 4% improvement in LTL revenue per 100 weight. Pricing benefitted from the acceleration of the rate increase and tightening market capacity. The unit improved both operating profit and margins.","Now for an update on our cash position. For the six months ended June 30, UPS generated 1.0 billion in free cash flow. This number was impacted by the transfer of union post-retirement liabilities that we discussed last quarter. Excluding non-recurring items, cash flow improved by over 400 million over last year.","So far this year, UPS has paid 1.2 billion in dividends, up more than 8% per share. We\u2019ve also repurchased 13.7 million shares for approximately $1.4 billion. Looking at our expectations for the rest of the year, UPS growth around the world has picked up and we are investing in capacity and automation today and will provide excellent returns down the road.","The peak preparation efforts that David mentioned like the additional sorts, facility enhancement projects and the expansion of our Black Friday operations will drive costs higher. During the ramp up and implementation, these projects are expected to increase 2014 operating expense by a total of $175 million. This represents another 75 million on top of our original estimates. As a result, we now expect earnings per share to be in a range of $4.90 to $5 a share, representing a 7% to 9% increase over 2013.","We do anticipate a strong second half of 2014 with earnings per share growth of 12% to 17% over the back half of 2013 with all three segments increasing operating profits. In the U.S. treating Black Friday as a full operating day this year will lower reported daily volume growth in Q4 by about 160 basis points. Nonetheless, we expect average daily packaged growth to be a little over 5%, slightly higher than previously guided. Revenue per package is projected to decline by about 1%.","Operating margin is expected to expand to approximately 14%. We also expect to see strong second half improvements in our international results with shipment growth between 4% and 6%. Yields will continue to be challenged by the changing product mix. Operating profit is estimated to grow at low double digit rates with some margin expansion. Our expectations for supply chain and freight remain positive with mid single digit revenue improvements and mid teens operating profit growth.","So as you can see, we are experiencing some growing pains right now. This is a great problem to have as long as we successfully adapt our network and facilities to effectively bring this growth through to the bottom line.","This completes our prepared remarks and we\u2019re ready to take your questions. I\u2019ll turn it back to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question will come from the line of Kevin Sterling of BB&T Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Kevin Sterling - BB&T Capital Markets","Thank you. Good morning. Scott, congratulations on a successful tenure. Wish you the best in the future.","D. Scott Davis","Thanks, Kevin, appreciate it.","Kevin Sterling - BB&T Capital Markets","My question, guys, you continue to talk about the growth in non-premium products continue to outpace premium products. Are we seeing that delta shrink at all as volumes improve across the board, whether it\u2019s international or domestic? And maybe we\u2019re starting to see some customers possibly move back to premium products given a strengthening economy?","D. Scott Davis","Yes, clearly there\u2019s some view of that but in the international, for example, we saw a solid 4% growth in those premium products. It\u2019s just dwarfed by the transport or growth in shipments. I think generally we\u2019re seeing life in all parts of the portfolio although we expect a continued spread where the deferred products and standard products will continue to grow in excess with premium ones, Kevin.","David Abney","It does seem that it has plateaued. I mean over the last couple of quarters we\u2019re not seeing that gap get any bigger, so it feels like or as long as we can see that growth. And if you see some new technology introductions later this year that might help the express also.","Kevin Sterling - BB&T Capital Markets","Got you. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer","Thanks. Good morning. I\u2019m a bit curious about the U.S. on your rail disruption and then if I can kind of throw in a second part and go international and just curious about the China-Europe rail capacity and how much that can ramp to? Thanks.","D. Scott Davis","Yes, I think certainly the rail disruption and the congestion this quarter was significant driving both added expense and creating some real challenges on the service side. I don\u2019t know, Myron, maybe you could talk just a little bit about what we\u2019re doing then.","Myron Gray","Yes, Scott, along with disruptions caused by the rail network what that does is certainly increase the purchase transportation costs in the quarter. And as a result of that, we also has saw a significant increase in hiring and training needs to offset the abilities of the rails to adhere to our expectations on our customers to meet on time commitments. So we\u2019re in a process of adding additional feeder drivers to offset that costs.","D. Scott Davis","Yes. So clearly we\u2019re adapting and adjusting as it was happening and created some challenges, but we have transitioned some of the volume off in the most congested lanes. As far as the Asia to Europe lane, that\u2019s still a relatively small amount right now but we think over the long term it will be an opportunity although certainly some of the disruptions as you cross borders there may be a challenge for a while.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer","All right. Congratulations Scott and David.","D. Scott Davis","Thank you.","David Abney","Thank you.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch","Great. Good morning. If we can talk about your new guidance, the $4.90 to $5, it seems that it\u2019s much larger than the $175 million expense, maybe even over $200 million to $400 million in terms of the decrease. Is there anything going on other than just your increased expenses? And maybe can you talk in the same vein about margins on the e-commerce? Is that changing the dynamics of the margin capability in ground at all or can you maybe just delve into what the margin potential on e-commerce volumes are? Thanks.","D. Scott Davis","Yes, I think, Ken, certainly a portion of the guidance change is the Q2 results. And I think if you factor that out then really what we\u2019re looking forward comes very close to the overall investments and added expense that we\u2019ve made. So, clearly, the challenges of us keeping up and training quickly as part of this ramp up does create some headwinds. But the Q2 contributor to better the adjustment we had some excess cost with the rails and then if you look forward, the primary difference and what we\u2019ve been discussing is just the current investment. So we are looking for a 12% to 17% increase in the back half of the year and I think all of those pieces of the puzzle fit together.","Kurt Kuehn","Ken, we really after the weather in the first quarter \u2013 our last quarter we guided to the bottom of the range which was really 5.05, so I think that\u2019s your starting point.","Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question will be from the line of Mr. David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead.","David Vernon - Sanford Bernstein","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Kurt, could you maybe talk a little bit about the added 175 million, how much of that you guys have already spent? How much remains to be spent? And then David, if you could talk a little bit about sort of how you look at those costs next year and what kind of actions you can take to make sure that those actually come out of the P&L next year?","Kurt Kuehn","Yes. So if you\u2019ll look at the change in our description of the investments as we\u2019ve really dug in and made better forecast, the big amount of the change is going to occur primarily in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re adding operations the day after Thanksgiving that does add expense. Over time it may generate more revenue but the real purpose is to smooth out operations. And then also our IT resources and we\u2019re going to open almost 50 new hub sorts to handle capacity. So the majority of the change in the added expense is in the fourth quarter. We spent about 15% of the total in the second quarter. That will get up to 30% or so in the third quarter and then the residual kick-in in the fourth quarter. David, maybe you can talk a little bit about how this fits together.","David Abney","Certainly can. First, I think the point is that many of the projects and investments that we\u2019re making in this year will provide benefits not only this peak but throughout next year. A good example is the additional IT expense that we\u2019re experiencing. We\u2019re working on 30 different projects and those projects will help us for peak but they also will help us next year and we won\u2019t have that additional expense. So that\u2019s one good example. The second one is running a full operations day on Black Friday. That is an additional expense but what we have to realize is it smoothes out the cyber week volume, allows us to better manage e-commerce demand and some of that costs will be offset by more efficient operations for the following week. And while we haven\u2019t determined exactly what we would do next year for Black Friday, we do expect that we would operate on a pretty extensive basis. And then the wrap up costs for these 50 additional hubs, a lot of the expense is just getting those hubs ready and then getting them staffed. Many of those hubs or some of them will continue to run through next year. Others, it will be much easier to wrap them up next year for peak just because we\u2019ve done all the work this year. So I\u2019d say a considerable amount of the costs would not be in next year\u2019s numbers.","D. Scott Davis","Yes, just to add to that, David, I think as we look at next year we expect OpEx not to be nearly as dramatic for this purpose as we saw in 2014. If something drives that then we\u2019ll have to evaluate pricing at peak season again. If we have to do this again, we\u2019ll have to evaluate how we price at peak season.","David Vernon - Sanford Bernstein","All right. Thanks very much for the time.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Mr. Nate Brochmann of William Blair & Company. Please go ahead, sir.","Nate Brochmann - William Blair & Company","Good morning, everyone. And want to echo my congratulations, Scott and David.","D. Scott Davis","Thank you, Nate.","David Abney","Thanks, Nate.","Nate Brochmann - William Blair & Company","So kind of going on along with that question, but a little bit bigger picture in terms of \u2013 like from a strategic focus, we've kind of been through the decrease from premium to non-premium products and the lower volumes out of Asia and whatnot and then we had the peak season issue where you\u2019re clearly adjusting for; and then we had the rail issues early this year. It seems like, give or take, the overall freight environment and supply chains are so dramatically changing quarter-to-quarter. How do you maintain that flexibility longer term as we get through these different volume swings and different movements in terms of how do you think about the business and how do you have to react to that?","D. Scott Davis","Well, Nate, I think what you\u2019ve seen is us reacting strongly over the last few years. One of the things we are doing to make us more capable to adjust to these changing conditions is reinvesting in the network heavily and focused on IT with data-driven operations, increased automation and a lot of creative applications from the market side. So this has been a part of the transformation that we\u2019ve been talking about for several years now. Right now certainly preparing the network and lowering our variable cost to handle this continued growth in B2C is the midst to the investments we\u2019re making. So, we think we\u2019re on top of this. I mean it doesn\u2019t always come out as smooth as you\u2019d like and clearly we would have liked to have a little stronger quarter. But the demand is there. I think UPS quality and service is great and so we feel very good that we\u2019re building this company for the long term no matter how the market changes.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Kelly Dougherty of Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Kelly Dougherty - Macquarie Capital","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to focus on the international business. I believe you said Europe is about 50% of that. So just wondering how much of your growth expectations internationally are macro-related versus what you\u2019re doing to some internal initiatives, network adjustments, acquisitions, things like that? Trying to get a sense of how the macro environment in Europe might impact the international business.","D. Scott Davis","Clearly the UPS growth is far outpacing any definition of either market or GDP growth in Europe which remains, I guess we would say steady but sluggish. But Jim, maybe you could talk a little bit about what\u2019s going on over there.","Jim Barber","Sure. I would say back to those points is that in this quarter obviously with revenues up at 6 and exports in double digits in some places that\u2019s clearly above any macro environment. We\u2019ll continue to focus in those places like Europe that we\u2019ve talked about on the previous calls. I think going forward though, Kelly, I think you\u2019ll also see more in the emerging markets from us. That\u2019s where a lot of the investments are at this point as well as capabilities like access points that will enable us to continue to accelerate this. So as far as organic versus inorganic, this is just about growing the business as we historically have and we think in all parts of the business right now we\u2019re doing a nice job with growth.","Kelly Dougherty - Macquarie Capital","Is there any way to think about maybe not actual numbers, but the profitability differences between Europe and maybe the rest of the world kind of order of magnitude even?","D. Scott Davis","No. We really don\u2019t break out regions. These regions are all interconnected but certainly we\u2019re pleased to make investments in Europe and do expect to continue doing that going forward.","Jim Barber","We do well in all regions.","Kelly Dougherty - Macquarie Capital","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Ben Hartford of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Ben Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Good morning, guys. If I could circle back to supply chain specifically on the forwarding side, I think you made the comment that \u2013 maybe it was Scott \u2013 that overall exports out of Asia were accelerating. You guys have some relatively easy comparisons from some company-specific efforts but yields overall, you had made the comment as well, still are pressured some. Could you provide some perspective in terms of how to look at the back half of the year within that segment specifically on the yield front given some of the capacity management efforts in Asia across the industry into what appears to be an accelerating export environment, but still a very competitive yield dynamic? Can you provide some perspective there?","D. Scott Davis","Sure, Ben. It sounds like you got a pretty good handle on it. But Jim, maybe you could flush it out a little bit and talk about our look going forward.","Jim Barber","Sure. I think we should start with the fact that airfreight is just one of the products, so we should brokerage North American. It\u2019s really doing well in many, many parts of the business. With respect to airfreight out of Asia, yes, we do see the market tightening. Yes, it is a competitive market. You can see in our growth rates we just talked about that we\u2019re actually bringing new customers on with the capabilities in the network. We are evaluating increases as the market tightens. We\u2019ll do that. We\u2019ll continue forward. We talked about a year ago making sure that we relied less on a couple of concentrations. I think we\u2019ve done a great job across the industries to get us where we are today and we\u2019ll continue to manage that in a very dynamic environment. And of course in the back half of the year oftentimes product launches appear that help us manage through this and balance that as well. So, good stuff coming out of the airfreight business all around.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of William Greene of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","William Greene - Morgan Stanley","Hi, good morning. Congrats, David and Scott. All the best to you.","D. Scott Davis","Thanks, Bill.","William Greene - Morgan Stanley","I have a question on B2C and of course you folks have seen the post office's moves on pricing. Can you talk about how that will affect your efforts and what it means from a dim weight perspective or from a pricing dynamic and the U.S. perspective? I realize B2C is getting to be a big part of the business now, over 40%, so I\u2019m not sure how to think about what dynamics are with the post office if they take actions how it affects you?","D. Scott Davis","Bill, this is Scott. I\u2019ll start off. First of all, it\u2019s not unusual to see our competitors suggest rates. The USPS though really does not offer the same level of service and capabilities that we do at UPS. I think the technology is a differentiator, our integrated service offerings are a differentiator, our guarantees are different. At the same time, we work very closely with the post office. We appreciate their universal service mandate where customers of theirs are customers of ours, but there is some concern as we go forward and how they price competitive products and there is some concern about cross-subsidization that we\u2019re going to be working with the Postal Regulatory Commission to ensure they don\u2019t cross-subsidize the competitive products. An example, I guess, is only 55% of the USPS costs are actually attributable to products. The rest of those costs are institutional costs and only 5% of those go to the competitive products while 20% of the revenue is from competitive products. So there are inconsistencies there that we\u2019re going to work with the Postal Regulatory Commission on and we\u2019ll pay attention to as we go forward. At the same time we\u2019ll go out and compete with the post office.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Mr. Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","D. Scott Davis","Good morning.","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","So I wanted to follow up on pricing and maybe the answer is just the post office, but clearly there are some capacity issues here. You [had them] (ph) in peak. The rails are struggling. I\u2019m wondering why aren't you guys talking more about pricing and getting more aggressive with pricing? And then beyond the dimensional pricing on ground, are there other specific things you can do like that to start seeing some better pricing and to offset some of the mix?","D. Scott Davis","Yes, clearly and certainly the dim weight was a good example of pricing that helps to match our cost to our rates and we clearly look at that. We have said in general that 2014 is the year of investing for the customer and creating unparallel service and that was a higher priority than short-term price issues. But, Alan, clearly you guys do a lot of thinking and activity in this front. Maybe you could talk.","Alan Gershenhorn","Yes. So obviously the market continues to change with the B2C volume making up a bigger concentration of our business and we all see that that results in lower yields due to lighter weights and the mix between the products and the customers that are using those services. We\u2019re continuing to calibrate our pricing models to make sure that we\u2019re aligning to the service that we provide and the price and a long-term strategy remains to achieve that 2%, 3% annual base price increase. Certainly the dim weight initiative that will begin at the beginning of 2015 will help bring us to the higher end of that base rate increase. We\u2019ll also encourage our customers to take a look at their packaging practices and we\u2019re already working with lots of customers in that regard right now so that they understand the impact of the dimensional weight changes. And either way if they change their packaging, UPS gets a nice cost advantage as do our customers or they\u2019ll pay for the size of the packaging.","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","But given some of the cost issues and tighter capacity, you don't see an opportunity to go above 2% to 3% in this environment?","D. Scott Davis","We aren\u2019t looking for dramatic changes. We make sure that over time we are appropriately compensated. Certainly next year will be a little different story than this year. Our primary focus this year is capacity and service. So we\u2019ll talk about that more going forward.","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital","Good morning, everyone.","D. Scott Davis","Good morning, Scott.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital","Scott, congratulations. Hopefully, you\u2019ll get some more time on the golf course going forward.","D. Scott Davis","I\u2019ll give it a try, Brandon. Thank you.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital","David, welcome to the spotlight. I guess my question is going to be a little difficult here, but I mean over the years we've all come to think of UPS as really geared for growth. If you go back talking about how your domestic business should grow around GDP if not above it, well, we\u2019re in that environment now. The last couple of Teamster contracts, we\u2019ve always discussed how they are geared for that incremental growth, the incremental package in the network and now with the deployment of ORION, obviously that could be a game-changer. And yet here we are in our third year of sub double digit EPS growth. I mean is this just a structurally different phase for UPS as we transition away from the previous B2B model to B2C or maybe for the next few years, we\u2019re not going to be able to hit that 10% to 15% EPS growth target that you guys put out a few years ago?","D. Scott Davis","Brandon, I\u2019ll start and then David can certainly add some perspectives. The challenges you highlight are real and we\u2019ve been talking about adapting and migrating our model to profitably grow with B2C volume. If you look at '12 and '13 up until the fourth quarter, we showed expanding margins driven by B2C growth. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s quite as bleak as you\u2019re painting it. And clearly the challenges remain but we think we\u2019re well on those. So we\u2019ll clearly talk about the long term and the future in November a little more. But right now we feel like we\u2019re doing the right things to build for the future. David?","David Abney","What we see now with the accelerated volume trends, we probably should have been investing at a slightly faster pace. We do see changing distribution patterns for customers around the world and we\u2019re wrapping up investments this year by about $500 million primarily in capacity projects. And this additional CapEx is mostly of projects that we already had planned, we already knew we were going to do them. We\u2019re now just simply advancing them from the outer years due to the accelerated volume. So even with this acceleration and capital projects, we still expect CapEx to remain in the 4% to 4.5% range during the next few years.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital","Thank you.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Mr. Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Maybe a question around peak season and the planning. Obviously, the conversations have been ongoing for several months now around customer behavior. And I guess I just want to think without using price necessarily as a strong or blunt instrument around customer behavior in the peak season, how do you sort of adapt and get customers to sort of focus on shipping at the right times when the network has a little bit more flexibility and a little bit more capacity? How are those conversations going in sort of the absence or I guess not necessarily using price as the key tool to adjusting that behavior?","D. Scott Davis","Yes, certainly we said one of the key components of our peak preparation was increased visibility with customers and improve planning the collaboration. Alan, you guys have been on that very much these days.","Alan Gershenhorn","Yes. We obviously have a long history of collaborating and communicating with our customers. But as you said, due to these changing trends the importance of us getting closer to our customers and working joining on collaborative operating plans is the order of the day. So, we\u2019re working with our customers on special weekend operations. One of the areas that we\u2019re working very closely with them on is their omnichannel strategies and whether or not they should be fulfilling from their DCs or fulfilling from their stores. And that certainly helps us manage their business better and also do it at a more effective cost.","D. Scott Davis","One of the parts of our peak planning has been joint commitment sessions with our customers certainly focusing on the highest peak periods and making sure that we have capacity that\u2019s needed. And if there\u2019s volume in excess of that, then there may well be a yield adjustment for that incremental volume.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup","All right, that was very helpful. Thanks. Congrats, Scott and David.","D. Scott Davis","Thank you.","David Abney","Thank you.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Art Hatfield of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Arthur Hatfield - Raymond James & Associates","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and congrats Scott and David. I want to go back to this pricing thing. A lot of questions about pricing today, but it seems like as you've said 2014 is the year of investing for the customer. Is it possible that 2015 is going to be the year of charging the customer? And a couple questions about that as we think about \u2013 as I think about some of the comments you've made today, do you feel like you need to have a clean peak season from a service perspective before you can start to move price? And secondly, is a potential peak season surcharge in the offing for this year?","D. Scott Davis","First of all, we definitely are planning and expecting a clean peak season. We\u2019ve invested heavily this year as we\u2019ve talked about at length. We think we\u2019re prepared. We\u2019re working very well with the customers. So we certainly expect a real strong peak season in 2014. As I said, this year is about investing for the customers. And as I mentioned earlier, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see the level of OpEx required in 2015 that we saw in 2014. But if e-commerce conditions change again in 2015 to drive more OpEx, I think we\u2019ll have to evaluate everything. Everything is on the table and that could include a surcharge to peak in the future.","Arthur Hatfield - Raymond James & Associates","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Jack Atkins of Stephens. Please go ahead.","Jack Atkins - Stephens Inc.","Hi, guys. Thank you for the time. David, it sounds like you\u2019ve had some very extensive conversations with your customers here over the course of the last several months as you assume your new role. I was just curious if you could give us a sense for how you are expecting peak season to unfold both in terms of international airfreight and then on the domestic side, just from your conversations with those customers? Are you expecting to see some tech product launches beyond what we've seen in the past couple of years? Just trying to get a sense for the order of magnitude relative to what we've been seeing call it over the last three, four years.","David Abney","All right. Well, as far as the tech launches, every year to the third and fourth quarter we normally do see tech launches and we expect that that continue again next year. In fact we\u2019ve heard some pretty good indications of that and we have shown in the past where we can wrap up rapidly and we handle these tech launches really as good as anybody could out there. So we look forward to it. As far as the international freight, Jim, as it goes to peak season, I\u2019ll turn it over to you.","Jim Barber","Well, I think the great part about the network and the way we\u2019ve got it set is they launch and both the airfreight side as well as the small packaged side, the network is able to handle that. And as David said, we do have some information about launches coming. We work with those typically a couple of months out to make sure the customers and we satisfy their needs and their consumers. So, I would say to this specific question we kind of see the next couple of quarters similar to the past couple of years and some tech launches coming and our ability to participate in those accordingly.","Jack Atkins - Stephens Inc.","Great. Thanks again for the time.","Operator","We have a question from the line of David Ross of Stifel. Please go ahead.","David Ross - Stifel Nicolaus","Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. Kurt, you mentioned in your earlier comments about changing distribution patterns in Europe and David, you also mentioned that distribution patterns were generally changing around the world. Can you expand on those comments specifically on how distribution patterns are changing for Europe? How well UPS is positioned to handle that? And how those changes of operations or the additional capacity you\u2019re ramping up is looking to address this?","Kurt Kuehn","Yes, I\u2019ll start off at a high global level and then have Jim maybe talk a little more granularly. We are continuing to see transport or shipments, regional shipments grow at a faster rate than trans-ocean shipments. So intra-Europe, intra-North America certainly seems to be a higher \u2013 have a higher velocity and you can see that in our mix change, in our yield change. So, that\u2019s one of the big themes. Europe\u2019s been a strong story for intra-Europe shipments with the convergence to the EU, but we are seeing some areas show a little more growth than others. Jim, maybe you could talk.","Jim Barber","Well, I think it really just comes down to the fact that Europe as a single market is continuing to evolve. Your distribution centers where they are placed there move and as that economy grows and it moves out to the east, the distribution models move with it. The inventories move with it. Our transport or network will support it in a different way, those patterns change and that\u2019s a good thing for us to have our network. I think the investments that we\u2019re talking about quite frankly are more in the hubs now and our hubs are \u2013 the growth patterns you\u2019ve seen in international now are forcing us just like the U.S. continue to force in our hubs to keep that network flowing appropriately and that\u2019s what we plan to do over the next couple of years. So that\u2019s really what\u2019s behind the trade pattern question.","David Ross - Stifel Nicolaus","And does Cologne have enough capacity to handle it as you expected or are there other hubs that need to pop up to kind of supplement it?","Jim Barber","It\u2019s be a great day when we build the next Cologne because it\u2019s got \u2013 we\u2019ve built it quite frankly for about 10 more years of growth and the most recent investment and can continue to scale. We love that investment and it will serve us well for a long time to come.","David Ross - Stifel Nicolaus","Excellent. Thank you very much.","Operator","David Campbell of Thompson, Davis, & Co., please go ahead.","David Campbell - Thompson, Davis, & Co.","Yes, thank you for taking the question. Back to Europe a little bit, there is obviously a lot of economic and political hotspots over there; Russia, the Ukraine, Israel, Iraq. Any impact on your business from any of these disputes, the wars, disputes, whatever you want to call them?","D. Scott Davis","I mean straight up, I would say those business markets for us right now we\u2019re obviously in those markets, I think we\u2019ve done a good job to kind of manage through those and have an operating model that\u2019s flexible and variable depending on what happens. But most of those markets for us are still what we would call emerging markets and we\u2019ve kind of kept back some of the big investments there to be tailored to the trade that we\u2019ve talked about earlier and the way that we\u2019re ready to invest. So at this point, we feel like we\u2019ve adjusted that adequately and results in the international business you can see haven\u2019t been affected at all.","Kurt Kuehn","There\u2019s not much impact. Yes, we still pay attention to what could happen to Ukraine, could that impact Poland or Syria could impact Turkey and those type of things. So we pay a lot of attention to it. So far no damage.","David Abney","From an airline standpoint, we closely, closely monitor world events and make sure that we make the appropriate changes to our air network.","David Campbell - Thompson, Davis, & Co.","And last question is, is your international airlift capacity down? I see that the tonnage is down from last year. Is your capacity down too?","D. Scott Davis","Our block hours are pretty much flat with last year, so maybe slightly down but not much.","David Campbell - Thompson, Davis, & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","D. Scott Davis","Thanks, David.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Mr. Thomas Kim of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs","Good morning. Thank you. I have a long-term question on your Asian network. Based on the aircraft order book, cargo, capacity and passenger belly hold is likely to grow faster than airfreight demand structurally. First off, would you agree with that and if so, do you have opportunity to become or to rely much more extensively on third party capacity? And in that vein, does that mean that you need to expand your freight forwarding capacity much more significantly than what you\u2019re capable of today? Thanks.","David Abney","I\u2019ll start off. Asia to U.S., our network is built around 7.5 trunk routes and that changes a little bit and we watched it closely. It is down 20% from 2011. We\u2019ve also placed larger aircrafts, so that\u2019s one of the things that has helped us in that area. So, yes, especially with the growth of worldwide expedited products, it does give you a lot more options to move the freight. You can hold it to take advantage of capacity. It\u2019s less capital intensive and we can utilize common carriage more for that product and we certainly do.","D. Scott Davis","Just a note I think we did foresee this. That\u2019s part of why we made a big investment into a forwarding capability back in 2001. Thanks.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Rob Salmon of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. With regard to the SurePost growth that we saw in this quarter, could you elaborate a little bit on where that\u2019s coming from and what your expectations are looking forward? It\u2019s been over 50% the past couple quarters and I was hoping to get a little bit more color on that line.","D. Scott Davis","Sure. Alan, you want to take us through it.","Alan Gershenhorn","Yes. So the growth is certainly concentrated but it\u2019s concentrated in one industry and that\u2019s retail. However, it\u2019s wide scale throughout our enterprise customers and also our middle market account. And really what you\u2019re seeing is shipments are choosing UPS because of the array of solutions we provide not just the SurePost product. And as you heard earlier, really all of our air and ground products, our residential products are growing, our commercial products are also growing but certainly SurePost grew with that 60%.","Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank","Thank you.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Ms. Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse","Thanks for taking my question. Just on the cash flow and some of the expense headwinds you have coming through in the second half, I was just wondering if there was any update on your plans to repurchase 2.7 billion of shares this year which I think you outlined in your fourth quarter conference call. Are you guys still expecting around that level?","Kurt Kuehn","Yes, absolutely. Our commitment to shareowner distributions remains unchanged. Actually our CapEx although reoriented more towards ground and technology facilities and vehicles than airplanes remains quite low, so we will be in the 4% plus or minus category. And so, yes, our share repurchase continue. We\u2019re pretty much right on pace for completing our $2.7 billion commitment for this year.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse","Okay, that's great. Thank you.","Operator","Due to time constraints, our last question will come from the line of Mr. Jeff Kauffman of Buckingham Research. Please go ahead, sir.","Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research","Thank you very much and congratulations to both Scott and David.","D. Scott Davis","Hi, Jeff. I got to say that on my first call in 2000, you asked my first question. Today you\u2019re going to ask the last question.","Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research","We\u2019re coming full circle. A lot of my questions have been answered. I just wanted to focus a little bit on the maintenance expense. It\u2019s not your largest expense, but I was a little surprised. It was up 10%, particularly with block hours kind of flat. Did we see any deferred maintenance this quarter from first quarter? Is there any reason why it would be at this level?","Kurt Kuehn","No. The biggest driver of it is just the cycle of aircraft maintenance. Clearly, there is some expense in there as we began during some retrofits and buildings, but it\u2019s really driven by just the normal large B&C checks for airlines, Jeff, and we do expect that to continue for a couple of quarters.","David Abney","Yes, it\u2019s really the aging of some of the new aircraft that we bought over the last few years. They\u2019re in for their first real maintenance check now and that\u2019s what\u2019s driving it. It\u2019s just block hours and a time issue.","Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research","Very good. Well, Scott, please enjoy. Guys, thank you.","D. Scott Davis","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","I would now like to turn the conference call back over to Mr. Wilkinson and panel for any closing remarks they may have.","Joe Wilkinson","Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Scott Davis.","D. Scott Davis","As I said, this is my 14th year of hosting these calls with either the CEO or the CFO and we\u2019ve delivered a lot of different messages over those 14 years. But this quarter believe it or not was our largest domestic volume increase, 7.4% that we saw in those 14 years, so it\u2019s pretty impressive to get that kind of growth. So the markets are moving in the right direction. Clearly, 2014 is a year that we are investing for the customer but we expect an excellent peak season and in the future, these investments will clearly benefit not just the customer but also our employees and our shareowners.","Thanks so much.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. And after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Scott Childress, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.","Scott Childress","Good morning and welcome to the UPS second quarter 2019 earnings call. Joining me today are David Abney, our CEO; Richard Peretz, our CFO; Kate Gutmann, our Chief Sales and Solutions Officer; along with Chief Operating Officer, Jim Barber; our Chief Information and Engineering Officer, Juan Perez; and Scott Price, our Chief Strategy and Transformation Officer.","Before we begin, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements and address our expectations for the future performance or operational results of our company. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2018 Form 10-K and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the SEC.","During the quarter, UPS recorded a pre-tax charge of $21 million or $0.02 per share on an after-tax basis. The charge is primarily from transformation-related activities with the majority allocated to the U.S Domestic segment. In the prior year period, UPS recorded a pre-tax charge for transformation cost of $263 million or $0.23 per share on an after tax basis.","The webcast of today\u2019s call, along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures, are available on UPS Investor Relations website.

We will attempt to answer questions of a long-term strategic nature. Callers are asked to submit only one question so that we may allow as many as possible to participate. Thank you.","And I\u2019ll turn the call over to David.","David Abney","Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, we continued making significant progress executing our strategies. As expected, our transformation initiatives are producing positive operating leverage and improved profit, signifying an important turning point for UPS during 2019. These initiatives combined with the strength of our underlying business and scale of our global network are creating strong results.","We generated more than 3% consolidated revenue growth and greater than 6% growth in operating profit. In fact, we grew profit in all three segments and generated the most profitable quarter in the history of our company. Our transformation is also creating greater efficiency and agility and funding reinvestment in new state-of-the-art solutions. This will enable UPS to capture profitable growth opportunities and an even higher level.","This morning, I will share a few quarterly highlights. Kate will introduce numerous market-leading solutions, focused on driving higher quality revenue growth and Richard will cover the financial details.","Yesterday we announced the latest wave of new services and solutions and there are more coming. These services will provide our customers new levels of speed, visibility, control and market access, especially our SMB e-commerce in healthcare customers. This is an exciting and momentous time at UPS as we leverage the exceptional power of UPS technology and innovation to bring the market new industry first capabilities.","On the efficiency front, our transformation initiatives are enabling a faster, more flexible network. In the U.S., we opened three major automated hubs in the quarter, adding more than 2 million square feet of new highly automated sortation. The modern facilities brought on in 2018 and 2019 along with significant changes were making to our network are improving transit times on key lanes for improved local, national and global customer service.","We're also adding highly efficient aircraft in the U.S and in other major international trade lines in line with shifting volume levels. Between 2017 and 2022, we will add 44 new aircraft, which creates more than 10 million pounds of additional air capacity in the network, the largest air capacity expansion in the industry in recent history.","In fact, this year, we will add the most annual capacity in our multiyear program by deploying a 11 new 747-8 and 767s. And the timing of our actions couldn\u2019t better with the largest e-commerce shippers adopting next day and often moving from our competitors 2-day options to our 1-day services. This structural change is creating opportunities for UPS. Our additional air capacity in modern integrated network offer unmatched flexibility and position UPS will to serve changing customer needs.","In the quarter, average daily volume for UPS Next Day Air search more than 30%, the strongest growth in more than a decade. Our air market share growth is accelerating and we are strengthening our industry leadership. UPS is in a unique position to enhance financial performance as we create new solutions that enable shippers of all sizes to meet accelerated delivery expectations of their customers.","Turning to the trade environment. UPS has long supported free trade making cross-border commerce easier for all businesses. I recently met with top trade officials from the U.S and from China and while I'm encouraged by the commitment of the negotiating teams, we need to see more measurable progress towards a comprehensive agreement.","At the moment, the global business community is facing prolonged trade uncertainty in Europe and elsewhere and forecasts are softening. Global industrial production was lowered to about 1.5% for the year. Additionally, world exports are now forecast to grow at a slower pace than global GDP. Nevertheless, UPS is using the flexibility of our network to help our customers optimize their supply chains and take advantage of continued growth opportunities.","The U.S economy appears to be in better shape with lower unemployment, healthy consumer demand and forecast for improved U.S GDP. The concern for the U.S is industrial production. The IP outlook for the fourth quarter is forecasted to be slightly negative on a year-over-year basis. Regardless of external conditions, our transformation initiatives are making UPS more competitive and more proficient at helping our customers.","The progress in our operations in exciting new solutions we announced yesterday were made possible by three things: our strategies, investments we're making and the execution by our people. I would like to thank our employees worldwide for their tremendous contributions to our success.","Momentum is building. We remain confident. Our strategies and initiatives will drive even stronger revenue quality, create further efficiencies and improved company profitability. We will continue to accelerate our initiatives in 2019 and beyond.","Now I'll turn it over to Kate to share more detail about our new services and solutions.","Kate Gutmann","Thank you, David and Good morning, everyone. Last September at our transformation conference, we unveiled key initiatives designed to generate growth. We are excited to announce the most expensive roll out of innovative new solutions in recent history.","Our customer first strategy targets an optimal customer mix that will yield high quality revenue across all of our strategic growth imperatives. Small and medium-sized businesses, healthcare, international growth markets and B2B and B2C e-commerce. These solutions were created to leverage the expanded automated capacity we have added to our network, which will empower our customers to do more, move faster, and go further.","UPS aims to be an indispensible partner for SMBs. To that end, SMBs can now leverage the breadth, speed and information in the UPS network like never before. First, with growing demand for Next Day delivery, UPS is improving time in transit in any key lanes and across all products in our broad U.S portfolio, beginning in the second half of this year. These faster transit times connect the places where more than 80% of the population reside, enabling faster delivery for all shipments.","Second, beginning in January, UPS will offer customers pickup and delivery services seven days a week. We are expanding our current Saturday residential and commercial pickup and delivery services and adding new Sunday option. As the only major carrier with Monday through Saturday pickup offerings, this service significantly expands our market coverage on the weekends, providing customers added speed and convenience. We plan to efficiently leverage the combination of the UPS integrated network, Access Point locations and UPS SurePost in collaboration with the USPS to deliver this new capability.","Third, we're providing later pickup for Next Day ground delivery, enabling SMB shippers to process more orders in a day, later pickup times are available now to hubs covering 85% of the U.S., solidifying UPS's leading market position in Next Day ground coverage. And additionally, building on the tremendous success of UPS My Choice for Home, we're excited to announce UPS My Choice for Business, available Monday, July 29. Participating companies will join the nearly 60 million consumers worldwide enjoying the benefits of UPS My Choice for Home.","Small businesses will now have unprecedented levels of visibility and control over both their inbound and outbound UPS shipments. Advantages that can enable SMBs to provide better customer service and improved planning for staffing and equipment needs.","Healthcare has long been a priority for UPS and we continue to develop unique solutions to rapidly scale our recently announced drone operations on the WakeMed campus in Raleigh, North Carolina, we created UPS Flight Forward, a subsidiary formed to operate commercial drone deliveries.","This fall we expect to receive Part 135 Certification, the highest level of certification from the FAA, which will enable UPS to complete routine flights beyond line of sight day or night. UPS is leading the industry and intend to stay at the forefront of commercial drone aviation. This certification will pave the way for service expansions to other hospitals and medical campuses in the U.S.","Cross-border e-commerce is growing fast and is a significant opportunity for our customers and for UPS. To help our customers tap into this opportunity with an affordable and easy to use international service, we created UPS worldwide economy. This new service has been designed specifically to enable SMBs to send lower value cross-border shipments using an economical differed service to the top e-commerce markets around the world. UPS worldwide economy is now available in Canada, China, Hong Kong, the U.K and the U.S., with more European and Asian markets coming soon.","And finally, understanding how busy small businesses and consumers are every day, we are dramatically increasing the number and variety of locations that enable access to UPS services. We're excited to announce Advanced Auto parts, CVS Pharmacy, and Michael's Stores are joining the UPS access point network. Collectively over the coming months, these retailers will add more than 12,000 locations nationwide when fully implemented bringing our U.S total to 21,000 locations where consumers can conveniently pickup or drop-off their UPS packages, including returns close to their homes and offices.","We remain the e-commerce shipper of choice, providing unmatched support to meet our customers' needs together with the UPS My Choice for Home app, consumers have broader choice, visibility and control over when and where their UPS deliveries are made. And like with all other access points, UPS attains further geographic reach and greater delivery densities driving increased efficiency.","UPS is the global industry leader with more than 78,000 point of contact, including retail locations and drop boxes around the world. Soon more than 90% of U.S consumers will find an access point location within just 5 miles of their home, offering a remarkable new level of convenience. UPS is poised to capture an even greater share of the fast-growing B2C market, by making pickups and drop-offs close by and convenient for virtually all customers.","In closing, UPS is actively enhancing the customer value chain from top to bottom by leveraging the power of our integrated network, state-of-the-art technology and expanding access point network. We are helping our customers to be even more successful. This rollout of exciting new services along with innovative platforms, like e-fulfillment and Ware2Go are just the beginning.","Many other industry first solutions and partnerships are in development and vision to empower our customers and enhance efficiency in new ways. They\u2019re being enabled and accelerated by our transformation initiatives and the power of the UPS Smart Global Logistics network.","Now I'll turn it over to Richard to move into the financial results and outlook. Richard?","Richard Peretz","Thanks, Kate, and good morning, everyone. We had a good performance in the quarter, driven by our planned multiyear investments, our transformation initiatives and strong execution within a dynamic environment. The enhanced leverage we're building is evident in our performance. All three UPS segments grew profits during the period. Consolidated operating margins were 12%, an expansion of 30 basis points year-over-year.","Today, I will cover performance of the segments and provide an update to our forward guidance for 2019. Let's look at the segments. One of the most notable elements for the quarter was the performance we delivered in the U.S. Average daily volume was up more than 7% with strong growth across all products, both in B2B and B2C.","Next Day volume jumped more than 30% as we seize the market opportunities with large e-commerce shippers who are early adopters of faster delivery to their customers. Our air [indiscernible] are completely automated, plus with the investments we made in our integrated ground and air network, UPS is well positioned to meet the market shift towards Next Day delivery and grow profits.","Reported Next Day yields were lower due to higher growth with large customers and end of day Saver products. The good news is underlying base rates increased 3.4% and air profitability and operating margins improved on a year-over-year basis. Ground volume grew over 4% and revenue increased more than 5%. Base rates for ground also increased almost 2% and although customer and product mix weighed on reported yields, ground showed a solid increase in profitability.","In the U.S Domestic business unit, costs were up 0.5% this quarter, the lowest increase in several years contributing to positive operating leverage in the business. The results would have been even stronger without the startup cost of an additional 2 million square feet of new automated sorting capabilities.","We're gaining efficiency and becoming more agile, enhancing UPS's ability to scale rapidly and to capture market opportunities and generate higher levels of profit. As a result of our actions, total U.S revenue was up 7.7%, operating profit grew 8% to over $1.2 billion and we produced a margin of 11%.","Now let's turn to the international business. In the quarter, we leverage the strength and flexibility of our global network to deliver operating profit growth and margin expansion as the segment adjusted to the challenging trade environment. Revenue quality was driven by disciplined yield management. On a currency neutral basis, revenue per piece for the international domestic increased 5.6% and revenue per piece for the entire segment was up nearly 2%.","Although volumes were down slightly, we're seeing growth in a number of trade lanes. Asia exports are growing to virtually all regions of the world, except the U.S. U.K exports and imports continue to be down on a year-over-year basis, driven by the uncertainty around Brexit. However, UPS is growing exports within the European continent. In the segment, we generated $665 million in operating profit, a record for the second quarter and expanded margins by 80 basis points compared to last year.","Turning to supply chain and freight. We had another strong profit result. We are up almost a 11% as the segment deliver its best second quarter operating profit in the company's history. Operating margins expanded 90 basis points to 8% in large part due to the effective execution of our strategies. Multiple units within supply chain and freight contributed to strong results by leveraging the flexibility of our asset light business.","Looking at the highlights of some of the individual units in supply chain, international air freight achieved robust profit growth on lower tonnage. We generated higher quality revenue, expanded the buy sell spreads and executed prudent cost controls, all of these offsetting the softer demand on the China-U.S lane. Coyote, our truckload brokerage division continues to outpace others in the market. They had another outstanding quarter enabled by productivity gains and optimization actions.","Revenue was down driven primarily by the overall market rates, but profit increased significantly and operating margins expanded. Across the three segments, we're pleased with the progress we are making. Each of these businesses is executing well and showing gains in operating profit.","Now let's turn to the balance sheet. UPS generated $4.2 billion in cash from operations and about $2.2 billion in adjusted free cash flow and that with capital investments of about $2.9 billion year-to-date. We are well on our way to meeting our free cash flow target with potential for additional upside. As expected, we made an opportunistic contribution of just over $800 million to the pensions, resulting in lower ongoing costs and an increase in our funding status.","Our timing was good as long-term interest rates were significantly below the PBGC premiums. So far this year, UPS distributed nearly $1.7 billion in dividends, which represents a 5.5% increase on a per share basis over the same period last year. And we repurchased 4.8 million shares for about $500 million.","Moving to tax. As we work through upcoming filings, there's potential for a favorable benefit that could lower our effective tax rate likely in the third quarter. As a result, we expect our full-year tax rate to be between 22% and 24%. Now before we move to guidance, let me take a moment to expand on Kate shared with you: the new solutions, including My Choice for Business, improvements in transit time and the extended hours pickup and others that activate in 2019 all embedded in this year's guidance.","As we rollout, our targeted weekend operations to expand Saturday coverage and add Sunday in 2020. We will leverage the combination of our highly efficient network, expanded UPS Access Points and SurePost. This brings together the efficiency of our great partnerships, proven technology and utilizes our new weekend driver category to produce higher levels of asset utilization and enhanced services for our customers across all seven days. The actions announced yesterday are part of our broader transformation and are included in our long-term target.","For the remainder of 2019, although external conditions have changed, we are reaffirming our annual guidance. As David mentioned, forecast for world exports and U.S industrial production have been lowered and we remain concerned about the growing headwinds from trade uncertainty.","Working on our favor, UPS has a number of company specific tailwinds. First, positive momentum from the capacity and efficiency trade inside a network, especially in the U.S., as well as new product and services we are introducing. Second, profit gains from the structural movement to more Next Day delivery. Third, the benefits from previously discussed items like the completion of our VRP program, wrapping up currency headwinds from last year among others. And as I mentioned earlier in my talk, we will likely see a favorable tax benefit predominately in the third quarter, which will help offset forecasted headwinds.","Putting everything together, as momentum builds as expected, the results in the second half of the year will be considerably stronger than the first half. Based on our positive momentum and the current economic outlook, we remain on track to achieve our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $7.45 to $7.75. We're making visible progress on our strategy and remain confident that transformation and our other initiatives will produce gains.","And now I'll ask the operator to open the line. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] I will now turn the program over to IRO Scott Childress to start the Q&A segment. Please go ahead, sir.","Scott Childress","Thank you. Let me reiterate what Steven just said. We got a lot of ground to cover today, so callers are asked that submit and ask only one question so that we may get through as many as possible. So our first question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Please discuss your progress in growing share with the small and medium businesses?","Kate Gutmann","Great. Scott, this is Kate. I will take that one. SMB is the key priority within our strategic growth imperatives and they're going well. We handle more SMB business than anyone and we continue to innovate. And the solutions we actually announced were foreshadowed at our Transformation Conference, so the strategy is unfolding as we speak. They\u2019re holistic strategy as we aim to win more business Monday through Sunday meeting all of our customers' needs and making it easy for them. Like the market leading My Choice for Business where we provided unprecedented visibility and control for their inbound and outbound shipments and enhancing our network with faster time in transit in meaningful ways hitting lanes that actually will cover 80% of the population and seven day service expanding Saturday and adding Sunday options to win even more SMB from the four-week. Leveraging the combination of UPS integrated network access point locations and SurePost in collaboration with the post office. We also extend -- have our extended hours Next Day ground service, enabling SMBs and large customers to process orders later in the day and reaching more than 85% of the population. We are also proud of the access point expansion and the partnerships with CVS, Michael's and Advanced Auto. That adds more than 12,000 locations nationwide bringing the U.S total to 21,000 and 40,000 globally. Further helping SMB take advantage of the cross-border trade opportunity, we\u2019ve announced worldwide economy. This is an economical and deferred service designed for their low value cross-border goods and its available in Canada, China, Hong Kong, U.K and U.S with more coming soon. Further with SMBs as well as larger healthcare accounts, we have our drone service staying at the forefront and rapidly scaling our drone operations on the campus of WakeMed and other hospitals to come. So we\u2019re very excited about our SMB initiative and priorities, the strategy that we laid out for you at the Transformation Conference and being able to bring more on to you with details and we remain committed to the strategic growth imperatives.","David Abney","Just a quick recap. This is David. You have to look at all these announcements that we made not as individual projects, but this is a holistic approach to basically enabling small and midsized customers to swing above their weight. And so the focuses on this group of customers so that they can compete with the larger companies that are out there. And the excitement that we\u2019ve seen for this is just incredible and we're very confident that we will continue to serve that small and midsize customer in ways that none of our competitors can do. And this small -- this My Choice for Business is just unique in the industry. There's no one that can match that and we expect the same enthusiasm as we had with My Choice for Home, which is 60 million members and we believe we will get the same kind of attraction with My Choice for Business. Thank you for the question. Let's move on.","Scott Childress","Our next question comes from Ben Hartford of R.W. Baird. Based on global trade trends, do you have any clarity on your stated long-term EPS targets of 5% to 10%?","Richard Peretz","Okay. I will start the question and David will comment as well. First to start, our long-term target are built around different economic cycles. When you look at this year, we call for a year of growth progress. We saw in the second quarter results. And in the second half, we look for even stronger performance, it's driven by many of the factors that Kate and David just covered as well as some of the items that I talked about in my prepared remarks. We are really starting to play offense when you think about the network benefits, what cost per piece is doing as well as the capabilities that we are bringing to the market that are adding to the top line. And it's important to remember embedded in our guidance is all of those items that we called out, that we talked about earlier in the year, strategic initiatives that now we\u2019ve announced. David?","David Abney","Yes, great question, Ben. And I will just say, let's look real quick, obviously there are headwinds and tailwinds, there always are. And -- but when you look just quickly at the second quarter we had our best quarterly performance we've ever had in the history of this company and had positive operating leverage in our U.S business. Our international supply chain and freight businesses had the highest second quarter that they have ever had and this is under dynamic -- under a dynamic trade environment. It is really a turning point in our profitability and we have momentum going into the -- the rest of the year. And when you look our transformation initiatives that we talked about a year-ago are really kicking in and we're getting the efficiencies and the gains. And then you add on top of that these innovative solutions and that will help our customers to deal with all of these changes that we're all seeing and we have a lot of confidence here that in spite of what may or may not happen within trade environment that we can flex our systems, flex our network and that we can continue to take care of the needs of our customers. So we feel confident in the second half of the year and going into next year.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Please go ahead.","Tom Wadewitz","Yes, good morning and congratulations on the strong results. I had to look two, three times when I saw the 30% growth the Next Day. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen a number like that before. So, strong results. How do you think about the greater growth in e-commerce and in, I presumably in that Next Day category, looking forward or continued growth as you saw in second quarter and how that might affect the margin outlook in domestic package? I know you talked about at the Transformation Meeting that mix was a factor and focus more on B2B. So as you had this really strong e-commerce growth, does that affect how we think about margin improvement in second half and 2020 in domestic package? Thank you.","Kate Gutmann","Tom, this is Kate. Thanks for the question. And we do see the structural change in the market, the 2-day commitment to the shift or 1-day commitment drives the air and ground. As we\u2019ve just talked about, that extend the Next Day ground coverage that we do and you see the growth that occurred in both. We believe SMBs are going to follow and they\u2019re going to be empowered by some of these solutions. So the growth while at the levels that caught your attention this morning may not be the same in the future. We do believe the structural change continues and it will be strong growth in the future. Richard, you want to answer margins?","Richard Peretz","So when you think about margin, we do and we continue to call for improvement in operating margin for the U.S business. It's driven by the efficiencies across the network both the ground and the air with the new buildings and you saw what cost per piece this quarter and that 0.5% is among the lowest that\u2019s been in several years and we expect that to continue. We are calling for low double-digit operating profit growth in all three segments for the entire year. And so when you put it altogether, we expect the second half to be well. We do believe that the Next Day Air will continue to grow, but that growth started really in the first quarter if you look at our growth numbers there. It was a little higher in the second quarter. We don't expected to stay that high through the rest of the year. But we do expect to continue to win share based on the solutions we have in the market and will help margins.","Tom Wadewitz","Thank you.","Operator","David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead.","David Vernon","Hi. Good morning, guys. Richard, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about how the investments in service going to seven day speeding up the road network, which I would presume means taking something off the train, putting it onto a truck. How is that going to affect the trajectory of domestic margins in the next year? Is this a case where you guys are taking some of the leverage you would have had in the business and reinvesting it, or should we expect some margin pressure in 2020 against whatever 2019 comes up to be? I\u2019m just wondering about that, that pace of investment and where the -- where it's been funded from?","Richard Peretz","Sure. So let's take those in two boxes, I will go very quickly. In 2019, everything that we said we would start earlier in the year, we talked about strategic initiatives we'd announce what\u2019s embedded in the guidance. The announcement here is the improvement in time-in-transit that starts now. In terms of 2020, what we have is we\u2019ve targeted Sunday operations. It's the combination of SurePost. expanded Access Point and the use of the new part-time driver -- I\u2019m sorry, the weekend driver category. It's all part of transformation and what we committed to reinvest in this business to make it grow even more. And so as we get to 2020 guidance in a few months, we will come out and explain to you how that all plays out, but it was all part of the plans we initially had.","David Vernon","Okay. So nothing incremental to the cost guide then?","Richard Peretz","That\u2019s right. For 2019, it's all embedded in.","Scott Childress","All right. We are going to take a online question here. This question -- we\u2019ve got multiple question, Helane Becker of Cowen and Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Can you give us an update on the transformation initiative? And are there benefits beyond the VRP in 2019?","Scott Price","Yes. This is Scott. Thanks for the question. So as you recall last year, we kicked off the transformation program with the voluntary retirement program and procurement. Those are really just two of the early initiatives that are helping us to reduce our cost to fund both growth and innovation. A significant number of additional cost reduction programs are in the pipeline, focused on modernizing our systems and as well helping us to create the fund to invest both in some of the programs that were announced yesterday, that Kate mentioned, that give us a fearless market-leading position in many customer facing areas as well investing in innovation, like our drone announcement which is just one of many that we expect in the future. We continue to invest those savings both in terms of our investments in growth, but also reiterate our commitment to the $1 to a $1.20 of incremental EPS in 2022. Let me just quickly turn this over to Juan to talk a little bit more about the modernization.","Juan Perez","Thank you, Scott. And absolutely all points connected to technology. We are well on our way in executing our digital transformation and our digital strategy in the company. We continue to make investments in four key technology areas: customer technology, as you\u2019ve heard some of the announcements yesterday and today. Those announcements are supported by technology at UPS. Operational technologies, technology modernization as well as transformation. All of these areas in which we're making technology investment are transformational. And in 2019 we have already gone through multiple back office technology modernization projects. We have made enhancements in our technology to support our four strategic growth imperatives. We will continue to do that. We\u2019ve expanded the use of our operations technology best-in-class operations technology that\u2019s out there. And of course we continue to make investments in advanced analytics. The last point I will make, Scott, is that we\u2019ve a great solid history of effective implementation of technology in our company and we intend to continue to do that.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Ken Hoexter, Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Ken Hoexter","Great. Good morning. Great job on the performance, but can you talk a bit about the share gains? Is this a market share shift that you see from whether it's the post office or FedEx leaving Amazon or just looking at the 30% without a degradation in ground. Is that just a share gain from retail? Is this -- maybe you can detail the speed enhancements in terms of changing patterns -- shifting pattern. Thanks.","Kate Gutmann","Absolutely. Thanks, Ken. This is Kate. And so I would say, first of all, what Richard indicated, we've had growing the air growth early first quarter and beyond. And we\u2019ve it across a broad base of customers and we do expect even more to go. There's a structural change in the market. As I noted, it does drive a 1-day footprint, whether it be air because of inventory placement or ground and you saw that in our 13% ground resi growth. And then the Next day Air, of course, continues to be strong. So we've actually had the wins throughout the last year and we are the air market share leader for the last three years.","Scott Childress","Our next question will come -- it's an online question from Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Do you expect cost per piece to decline outright going forward as efficiency gains continue in your automation investments?","Jim Barber","Hi, Allison, it's Jim. I think, obviously, from a unit cost perspective in Q2, I think the market sees that we\u2019re at a inflection point. And it really did drive operating leverage in the U.S., which has been about four years since the last time we did it in this kind of capacity. Rich talked about the future. We see it going forward, we see the momentum as well. David in his talk, that we continue it forward. There are going to be quarters where we absolutely will drop the unit cost going forward. There might be other ones who would choose to invest some of the transformation dollars and go back and grow the business differently. In the end, it's a combination of revenue per piece and cost per piece that drives operating leverage and we will manage it too going forward and talk about the margins as Rich insinuated in his guidance. So appreciate the question.","David Abney","Yes, as Jim mentioned and do want to recognize the domestic U.S team just did an excellent job the second quarter, bending that cost curve. And as a credit to their execution, to their efforts, it also is reflected by all these investments we've been making in these automated builds and in our strategic imperatives. So a good job there and we expect momentum will continue.","Operator","Scott Group, Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Robert Salmon","Hey, good morning, guys. It's Rob Salmon on for Scott. A quick clarification question regarding the announcements yesterday. You were very clear, we wouldn't see any additional cost show up in '19. Should we also be assuming that the costs in '20 were part of the original plan?. And then from a longer-term perspective, given the changes that we are seeing in the small package market, how should we think about incremental margins in Next Day deferred in ground as we look forward?","Richard Peretz","Yes. So Rob, this is Richard. And first, we haven't actually given any guidance for '20, but what I did say was that when you think about what we are investing in for '20 and beyond, we talk about transformation savings both being saving and accretive to EPS the $1 to $1.20 and part of it for reinvestment. And so when we come to guiding, we will go through that. I think it's really important to think about the second quarter. When you look at the U.S profit growth of 8%, it was almost evenly divided between ground and air, which means that the incremental cost per piece that is coming in is coming in at much lower because of technology, because of structural change in distance and ways and zones. And so we do see incremental profit improving. We also see cost per piece coming down and all that comes together in what we guided for '19 and when we get to '20.","Scott Childress","Our next question is coming from Jairam Nathan of Daiwa. We are seeing new competitors come into the freight brokerage unit. Can you discuss what UPS Coyote is doing in the market?","Jim Barber","Hi, Jairam. It's Jim. I will take that one up. So a couple of things harking back to the acquisition. First, we bought Coyote. First thing out of the gate we saw when we acquired was their service level and that hasn't changed and we believe we've got the best service in the industry and that's just flat competition capability. Secondly, we\u2019re in the protection mode in Coyote. We've doubled the business already. We're headed to tripling the business and competition will continue to force us to invest in new technology, which the team is doing. We\u2019ve already geographically expanded in the Europe. We will keep doing that to grow the business and probably the one I think you should think about the most is that Coyote is the only one in the UPS family. And the synergies that affords us at peak season and then the rest of the year through the cross selling of the portfolio, I don't think the new competitors kind of have that leg up. So we are pretty proud of the acquisition. Thanks.","Operator","Allison Landry, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Ms. Landry, your line is open.","Scott Childress","All right. Well, we will go through an online question. The online question comes from Brian Ossenbeck. Will the new UPS My Choice for Business have a premium subscription service level similar to the home product?","Kate Gutmann","Great. And Brian, this is Kate. So the My Choice for Business goes on the heels of My Choice for Home of course with 60 million strong and customers with higher customer satisfaction than any other part of the business. And so we see that same tie with My Choice for Business. And we will deliver new solutions through that mechanism. We will be focused on the general subscribers as well as the premium. And just as we are doing in the release, you can see unprecedented visibility and control so that customized experience with UPS for these SMB customers really helps to give a deeper connection and we will continue to go further with it and again deliver new solutions through that mechanism.","Operator","Next question will come from Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, guys. James on for Chris. Just wanted to ask about the international outlook and given the macro, should we be thinking about volumes being down across the rest of the year?","Scott Childress","So the international business and the impact on the macro was your question?","Jim Barber","I will pick it up. Look in David's opening comments he talked about the trade picture. It's kind of different coming into this year than we saw it. But remember a couple of things about the international business, as it moves through the globe is that it is both a growth and diversification engine for us. And when you talk about that, you\u2019ve to have the ability to move it as trade move. What you've seen in this really challenging trade environment is that they just recorded record profits again. And so at the very end of the day, yes, there are trade wins, but there's also tailwinds in this world, and when we find those, we try and lean into, we get the network right. We've talked about that second half is going to speed up, that's going to include international. And really at the end and when you say you're going to run this globe's largest logistics network, no matter what happens to the macro, things are going to come and go over time and our job is to move this network to where the customer see opportunity and we believe we can provide it to them. So international continues for a long time in the future for us at UPS.","Scott Childress","Our next question is coming from multiple analysts and the question is, is UPS adding air capacity and are there contingency plans related to a hard Brexit that we've set up?","Jim Barber","So David mentioned in his opening comments our air capacity. We started in the -- back in '17 when we went out and made our statements with the 747-8. Remember though from that position, we talked about a bump in role in the network and moving assets through the globe and where the opportunities existed. So, yes, we're going to move capacity toward it. And remember the flexibility in the way we do it and that comes from a labor contract, that comes from business units, it comes from different products and suites that we offer. We've got a lot of levers to pull and when you can see the Next Day grew like it did in the quarter we just ended, that meant we had to move capacity to it to do it and so we're moving it and we will continue to move it as the opportunities to grow present them self for us.","Operator","Jack Atkins with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Jack Atkins","Hey guys, good morning and congratulations on a great quarter. Jim, a question for you about peak season planning. I guess looking at the calendar, I believe there are six fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year. Could you talk about what you're doing to prepare the network for that? And does that more compress calendar, increase the execution risk as you guys think about the holiday season?","Jim Barber","Look, I think you've got it right on the calendar. Last time we saw a calendar like this was about 5 years ago. And so quite frankly we've been in preparation for this for some time. One of the points most people don't really get right now is with the air growth we've seen right now. We are in peak season air growth numbers right now from last peak and we feel like last peak we prove to the market we could take a step forward and we plan to do it again this peak season. Yes, it's more challenging, but we are stronger and better and our airlines more fit for duty and so are the people that run inside of it. So our ability to do what we're doing right now gives us really strong confidence. The other thing that most people can't see from the outside is when we put our buildings up in '18 to get ready for peak of '18, the majority of those buildings, 80% came online in the fourth quarter. '19, 80% come on in the first three quarters. So we've flipped the model around that we are really going to be fit for duty we feel like for our customers going into '19 peak regardless of really the days that they're presented on the calendar and we will get through it, which is nice.","Scott Childress","We are going to take an online question from multiple analysts. This question comes with the color of our freight forwarding business and the ability towards healthcare in that industry and our healthcare strategies moving forward?","Scott Price","Yes, thanks for the question and very much related to the healthcare initiative, one of our four strategic initiatives in yesterday's announcement on the UPS Flight Forward. As you recall, we\u2019ve an preliminary approval and we've leveraged that at Wake Forest in their Medical Center. That is a single operator who moves goods from one part of the campus to another. Our FAA 135 filing that we\u2019ve made is a very exciting development that with approval from the FAA. And we believe we could be one of the first if not the first fully licensed airlines with the certificate that will allow a single operator to not only do beyond visual line of sight, but also night flight. So we see it as a major opportunity for us to continue to grow share in the healthcare vertical.","Operator","Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer Funds. Please go ahead.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks. Good morning. One of the -- the pursuing international high growth markets was one of the strategic imperatives highlighted at Transformation Conference last year. Could you please discuss the progress there and tie in this the new worldwide economy product that you just announced?. Thanks.","Jim Barber","Sure. I think and right now we've kind of come forward since the Transformation Conference to focus on ten markets. I think given the structure of the call, I won't take you through all of them. Certainly by the way, China will be one of those. We know that that trade lane to the U.S is a bit challenged, but remember it grows in other ways. And so that's what the global network does. So going forward, the year-over-year export also had some issues in it related to cyber last year and the second half will pick back up as we talked about. So look, we're going to continue to move forward in the worldwide economy product. What it really does, it allows us to enter this really fast growing market that we know has been growing six to eight times as fast as anything else over the years and enter a different price point with product set that we haven't really put in our network before. So it is a very big move for us and you\u2019ve seen the way we are going to bring it to market is very low cost way with Incoterms that allow customers to choose. So we are -- we believe that will definitely add fuel into the growth markets as we go forward.","David Abney","Yes, so you should think of this as a complementary service. It's not really something that\u2019s going to take away from our existing express, but it does open up to these marketplaces these small businesses an opportunity for deferred shipping option at much lower cost, which means we are going to see a lot of traction. So we believe this is a very important part of our international portfolio.","Scott Childress","We are going to take an online question. This question comes from Fadi Chamoun of BMO. Can you help us understand more on the U.S Domestic mix both the B2B and the B2C growth?","Kate Gutmann","Yes, good morning, Fadi. This is Kate. So our B2B grew 2.5% and continues the growth sequencing that we've had for the last three quarters. And these solutions actually that we've announced are both for B2C and B2B. I will highlight UPS My Choice for Business. Sometimes folks will think that that is primarily only for the business to the consumer, but in truth, a lot of SMBs are empowered now through unprecedented visibility and control to better address their business customers as well. And, of course, the seven day, we've got the Saturday commercial. And then access points also micro small businesses are one of the largest shippers out of our Access Point locations. UPS Store, of course, having -- they are being located right in their communities and driving a lot of that B2B volume. And then of course our returns portfolio is what I would also emphasize that comes -- returns come with B2C growth and we\u2019ve seen the benefit of that as well. So we are continuing to focus on growth across our products as you saw in this quarter.","Operator","David Ross of Stifel. Please go ahead.","David Ross","Yes, good morning. Just wanted to focus back in on the expansion of the air network in the fleet, adding 44 new planes and 11 this year, really to see how the supply curve matches up with the demand curve. So if you could talk about, I guess, any network changes that are going on as you add the new planes. Are they catching up with existing demand or is it going to kind of is the capacity going to lead and the demand is going to follow at some point?","David Abney","Okay. I will start. This is David answer the question and give it over to Jim. I can tell you that, that our timing could not be any better with the addition of these aircraft. And the flexibility that we\u2019ve whether we want to inform that these aircraft internationally or if we want to bring them to the U.S. So we\u2019ve the capacity. At the same time, this is a very real structural change occurring. And so you just couldn't have that line up any better than it has and now we're taking advantage of that. And Jim, you want to talk a little bit more about the capacity?","Jim Barber","Well, I do think you said it very well, David. In that the 11 that we're bringing on this year, the 11 that we're going to bring on next year of seven fours and seven sixes, it's time for everything. I mean, we spent a lot of time talking about a couple of trade lanes in the world, but we should also focus on what this world is doing crossing borders and growing and our participation in this global network. Remember, everything that we are flying around this world doesn\u2019t end up in the United States of America. There's a lot of South -- South trade that goes involved in this and we can move the assets there. We have the flexibility as we talked about. And when it moves in this case, potentially the structural changes in the U.S., you can move the assets. And of course, it's not all physical, it's also block hours. I would also say that if you look at this year back to the efficiency metric, it's not just about buying more of them. Our block hours were up about 50% as high as our volume in the U.S this year, so that's another efficiency metric. And if you look at our utilization rates, they're higher this year than last year. So we think the timing as David said is really spot on for.","Scott Childress","We are going to take another online question. This is from multiple users. Is the USPS able to handle the additional delivery that with the expanding U.S services?","David Abney","Right. This is David. And I'm assuming just talking about Sunday delivery where we are utilizing our own network, we are utilizing access points and we are utilizing USPS to from a SurePost expansion. And I can tell you that that I personally got -- gotten a commitment from the top USPS that they understand our requirements and the needs of our customers and their outflows are committed to work with us to make sure that this is going to be a very successful offering. So I couldn't be any more confident in our Sunday delivery capabilities, all three parts of the strategy, including the commitment from USPS to perform at the levels we need. Thank you.","Operator","Helane Becker, Cowen. Please go ahead.","Helane Becker","Thanks very much, operator. Thanks for the time you guys. I just have a question about your carbon footprint because you guys are kind of leading edge and sustainability and things like that. And you went with four engine seven fours versus two engine triple sevens. And I'm kind of wondering if you can just discuss the difference between the two. Why the seven fours make more sense for your network than a two engine aircraft would have in the context of keeping your carbon footprint low?","Juan Perez","So a few points on that one. First of all, of course we bought those aircraft based on the efficiency that those particular aircraft bring to the overall network. We believe that they are extremely efficient and that they will continue to help us provide the necessary value to the organization. Now when we look at sustainability it's more than just the aircraft. Sustainability is important to us, we design our buildings, we design our vehicles. We select our aircraft with sustainability mind and especially as we continue to build our smart logistics network, making sure that we do it in a sustainable way is extremely important to us. And we published the objectives for sustainability, they\u2019re widely documented, you can see them. One that I want to highlight is that we\u2019ve said before that by 2020, 25% of our total vehicles purchased annually will be of alternative fuel. We are actually on path to make that objective is the first one that we have in 2020. There are more coming on in 2025, we expect to meet our targets.","David Abney","Yes, just focus a little more on the aircraft size. I want to tell you when we made the decision for 747-8, that was certainly one of the perspectives we looked at and this is very modern aircraft, it has -- it's very efficient. And the big thing you\u2019ve to keep in mind though is the size of this aircraft. And when you put fly one plane versus two, you are going to gain from sustainability all day long. And so the key is to have it utilize to where you are able to do that, eliminate aircraft because you\u2019ve larger aircraft. And excellent question and it was certainly high on our priority list when we made the decision. And we\u2019ve been very pleased with how that has worked out for us. So thank you for the question.","Helane Becker","Thank you.","Operator","That concludes our Q&A today. Now I will turn the program back over to Mr. Childress. Please go ahead, sir.","Scott Childress","Thank you very much, Steven. David, closing comments?","David Abney","Yes, Scott. We are making significant progress in executing our strategies. And from the questions today, I can tell that there's a lot of people on this call that agree with that. Our Transformation initiatives are improving efficiency and they\u2019re enabling newer, innovative solutions like the ones we covered yesterday and there are more to come. So I don't want anyone to think that this is what we\u2019ve for this year and for next year. We\u2019ve a lot of smart people that are having good conversations for our customers and we are going to continue to enhance our service and we are all excited about it. We are becoming as a company more agile and the timing of our investments could not have been any better. The structural change in the market for Next Day delivery is favorable for UPS. It's favorable for our customers and for the consumer, but it is certainly favorable for us. The U.S Domestic segment has good momentum and we are going to continue that momentum. We continue to see growth opportunities in the U.S and also internationally and in our supply chain business. So in summary, we expect strong profit growth ahead and we will continue to accelerate our initiatives and move at a faster pace. So thank you very much for joining us today and appreciate the time.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference call for today.

My name is Stephen and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. And after the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. Please note, we will take only one question from each participant to accommodate more analysts during the call. Thank you for your cooperation.","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Joe Wilkinson, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.","Joe Wilkinson","Good morning and welcome to the UPS third quarter 2014 earnings call. Joining me today are David Abney, our CEO; Kurt Kuehn, our CFO; along with International President, Jim Barber; President of the U.S. Operations, Myron Gray; and Chief Commercial Officer, Alan Gershenhorn.","Before we begin, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we\u2019ll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the company. These anticipated results are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2013 Form 10-K and 2014 10-Q reports. These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the Securities and Exchange Commission.","In our remarks today, all quarterly and full year comments and comparisons will refer to adjusted results. In addition, we will discuss UPS\u2019s free cash flow which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The webcast of today\u2019s call along with the reconciliation of free cash flow and adjusted results are available on the UPS Investor Relations website.

For those registered, I'll look forward to seeing you at the conference. And for everyone else, the event will be webcast and available on our website.","Now we'll turn the call over to Dave.","David Abney","","Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our third quarter earnings review. Before I get into the business results, I want to take a moment to express my personal sadness about the tragic shooting that took place at one of our facilities in Birmingham, Alabama. We\u2019re a close knit team at UPS and this incident has touched all of us. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family and loved ones of those involved. The safety and well being of all 400,000 UPS-ers is a high priority for us and I\u2019m extremely proud of how our people responded to this tragedy, especially those in Birmingham.","Now I would like to discuss our third quarter results. Balanced performance from all three segments delivered a record third quarter for UPS. Earnings improved 14% over last year to $1.32 per share. Total shipments increased 6.9% to 1.1 billion packages, the most ever in a non-peak quarter. The strong performance for the small package team provides momentum as we head into the fourth quarter.","Overall, the global economic outlook has been mixed with primarily good news coming out of the U.S. and Asia while disappointing reports have recently surfaced in Europe. Trade between countries is a primary catalyst for economic growth. As part of my participation on the President\u2019s Export Council, I just returned from a visit to Poland and Turkey where we discussed practical ways to increase U.S. trade with these two important countries. UPS is a strong advocate for free trade agreements such as the trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific trade pacts currently in negotiations. The key to advancing such trade agreements is the passage of Trade Promotion Authority. This legislation gives the administration the ability to negotiate trade agreements and present them for an up or down vote. We urge Congress to take action on this critical legislation.","Looking more specifically at UPS, current market trends have provided a favorable environment for growth and we have been active this quarter enhancing our portfolio and expanding our capabilities. Earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of i-parcel. This cross-border e-commerce company facilitates the globalization of online retail. i-parcel dramatically simplifies cross-border trade by helping businesses localize their website, providing consumers in over 100 countries a seamless buying experience from the U.S. and UK based retailers. Cross-boarder e-commerce sales are expected to triple by 2018 to more than 300 billion. We are excited about the unique capability this acquisition brings to advancing the UPS global retail strategy.","We also announced the expansion of two solutions aimed at enhancing the consumers' experience. Following a successful U.S. launch, UPS My Choice is now operating in 15 additional countries in Europe and North America. International consumers can now receive the personalized home delivery experience that 11 million U.S. members currently enjoy. Also, we expanded the UPS Access Point alternate delivery network to New York and Chicago with more U.S. cities to follow. By the end of 2015, we plan to increase the number of locations from 12,000 in Europe to more than 20,000 worldwide. This is a great example of how UPS continues to implement innovative ways to increase B2C profitability and improve the customer experience.","In addition to these new solutions, UPS continues to invest around the globe. We announced new locations in Poland, expanded our forwarding and distribution networks in Myanmar and Thailand, while opening facilities in Mexico and Canada. Here in the U.S., we have increased network capacity to support our growth. These enhancements benefit UPS throughout the year and continue to prepare us for peak season. In a moment, Myron will take you through our peak plans and expectations.","We\u2019re continuing to invest in our network enabling UPS to capitalize on sustained growth. Let me assure you, UPS is ready for the opportunities and challenges we expect to face this year.","Now I would to turn it over to Myron.","Myron Gray","","Thanks, David and good morning. UPS has been preparing for peak season 2014 since December 26th last year. We\u2019ve made significant investments in new technology as well as both permanent and temporary capacity. The improvements we\u2019re making will produce benefits for UPS far beyond this year\u2019s peak season. Our people have been working hard to get everything ready for the holiday volume surge that typically starts during Thanksgiving week. This year the National Retail Federation is forecasting a 4.1% increase in total retail sales, a full 100 basis points higher than 2013. More importantly for UPS, online retail sales are expected to jump between 8% and 11%. This continued surge in web-based sales is not only fueled by online retailers, but also by the rapid adoption of omni-channel solutions. In fact, according to a survey conducted by Hay Group, 47% of retailers will have an omni-channel strategy in place compared to only 14% last year. These trends create opportunities and challenges for both retailers and for UPS. That\u2019s why we've focused on increased collaboration with our largest retail customers.","Agreements on shipment volume during peak season are critical to meeting both customers and UPS's expectations this year. During these discussions, customers have expressed their confidence in our ability to meet the peak season needs. At UPS, we\u2019re gearing up for this growth. We\u2019ve added a full operating day on Black Friday in the U.S. and are bringing 49 additional hub sources online.","In time for peak, we\u2019ll have 47 new, expanded or temporary facilities around the country. This added capacity provides the flexibility to handle higher volumes more efficiently. For example, we\u2019ve opened expanded facilities outside Los Angeles and two in the Houston area. We also announced the opening of two new buildings in the fast growing Dallas market. North Bay, our first retrofit automated hub, will be operational in November. We\u2019ve also made improvements to our two largest facilities, Worldport and our Chicago consolidated hub adding sort capacity and unload doors. In addition, UPS has invested in the development of approximately 30 new technology solutions. These applications will improve package visibility, volume forecasting and customer communications.","The UPS network and technology systems are ready for the wave of shipments we expect this peak season. In fact, for the month of December, deliveries are projected to increase 11% over last year. If current expectations are too optimistic, we will make adjustments to align network capacity to lower demand.","Before I turn it over to Kurt, I have been visiting UPS facilities across the country, talking to our people. I walk away even more convinced of the great skills and passion our employees have. We\u2019re well prepared to handle the holiday surge and provide world-class service to all industry sectors. UPS is ready for peak.","Now we\u2019ll turn it over to Kurt to discuss our results. Kurt?","Kurt Kuehn","","Well, thanks, Myron and good morning, everyone. After three tough quarters in a row, it\u2019s great to be discussing positive results again. In fact, revenue growth was the highest we\u2019ve seen in three years, up 5.7% over the third quarter of 2013. Global shipment volume of more than 17 million packages per day was 6.9% higher than last year. Operating profit increased 8.3% with growth across all segments. Operating margin expanded 40 basis points to 13.7%, our best non-peak results since 2007. Earnings per share of $1.32 were up 14%, aided somewhat by a slightly lower tax rate. Overall a solid quarter across the board.","Now I\u2019ll take you through the segment details, looking first at U.S. domestic. revenue increased 5.3% to 8.7 billion resulting from a 6.9% increase in daily packages. E-commerce continues to be the catalyst for growth. However, B2B shipment gains of 3.4% were the highest we\u2019ve seen in several years. Operating profit of $1.3 billion was 7.8% higher and margin expanded 30 basis points to 14.7%. Revenue per package declined 1.5% as product and customer mix changes offset base rate improvements. The primary reason for the yield reduction was the more than 50% jump in UPS SurePost volume. Total cost per package decrease by 1.9% leading the positive operating leverage. Several factors drove our cost per piece lower. We benefited from improvements in productivity, wage rate deflation and reductions to workers' compensation expense. These gains helped to offset the additional peak related projects and excess cost created by continued rail disruption.","Now looking at our international segment. Total revenue improved 5.5% to $3.2 billion. Daily shipments increased by 6.7% with all regions of the world showing solid growth. Operating profit was up more than 10% to 460 million and margin expanded by 70 basis points to 14.5%. Local revenue and cost initiatives contributed to the margin expansion, while favorable currency and fuel prices also added to the bottom line. Average daily export shipments jumped by 9.4%, the result of robust growth out of Asia and Europe, up 16% and 14%, respectively. Volume from Asia to both the U.S. and Europe benefited somewhat from high-tech product launches at the end of the quarter.","Non-U.S. domestic shipments improved by 5% with Canada, the UK and Italy leading the way. Revenue per package currency-neutral declined by 1% as a result of a 3.5% yield reduction in export products. High demand and shorter trade lines and product mix continued to pressure yields and offset base rate increases. Non-premium products grew by 16%, while our premium products grew by 5%.","Turning to supply chain and trade. Revenue improved 7.4% to $2.4 billion with gains from all three business units. Operating profit of 215 million represented a 7% increase and operating margin was the same as last year at 8.9%. Forwarding and distribution revenue increased 7.4%. Forwarding benefited from higher air freight tonnage primarily in the government and high-tech sectors. In distribution, increased demand from retail and health care sector customers added to revenue gains.","Our forwarding operating profit was down. The spread between third-party providers and customer rates out of Asia continued to pressure operating profit growth. Distribution operating profits improved as growth offset investments in acquisitions, technology and new facilities. UPS freight revenue was 7.9% higher due to LTL shipment increases of 4.7%. Both operating profit and margin improved and ground freight pricing growth has contributed to these positive results.","Now for an update on our cash position. Through the first nine months of 2014, UPS generated 2.8 billion in free cash flow. Adjusted for one-times items, free cash flow was 4.6 billion. The company has paid 1.8 billion in dividend so far in 2014, representing an 8.1% increase per share. UPS has also repurchased nearly 21 million shares for approximately $2.1 billion. Year-to-date capital expenditures reached 1.4 billion and we do anticipate more than 1 billion in additional CapEx in Q4 as a significant number of projects will be completed in the fourth quarter.","Looking at our expectations for the fourth quarter, as Myron told you, we expect to see higher demand for UPS services and we are ready for the increased volume. In the U.S., we expect average daily volume to increase between 5% and 6%. Yield should be down about 1% as a result of the continued SurePost product gains. Operating profit is expected to increase 11% to 13%. As we previously mentioned, we expect approximately $115 million in additional operating costs in the fourth quarter due to Black Friday operations, temporary capacity additions and the ORION implementation costs.","For the international segment, reported growth rates are projected to slow in Q4 as a result of a number of large wins late last year and the addition of one extra U.S. operating day this year. Average daily volume and total revenue are expected to grow between 3% and 4%. International operating profit is expected to improve by 10% to 12% over the fourth quarter of 2013. In supply chain and freight, we expect mid to high single-digit revenue growth with similar operating profit gains. Our tax rate is forecast to be 35% for the fourth quarter.","So in summary, UPS produced solid performance this quarter and we\u2019re maintaining our full year guidance for earnings per share to be in the range of $4.90 to $5. We look forward to sharing our outlook for 2015 and beyond when we meet in New York next month.","This completes our prepared remarks and we\u2019re ready to take your questions. I\u2019ll turn it back to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question will come from the line of Mr. David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead.","David Vernon - Sanford Bernstein","","David, could you talk a little bit about how the profit profile or the contribution from B2C growth has been changing over time and whether it\u2019s reasonable to believe that the steps you guys are taking are making that business a little bit more attractive at the margin? Just trying to get a sense for how the profile of that business has changed over the years.","David Abney","","Well first, I\u2019ll you that it\u2019s certainly a journey. And we have seen our B2C business grow and we\u2019ve announced that it\u2019s up to 45% this year. One of our focuses though has been, to prepare for this trend, a lot of the technology that we have implemented has been focused around not only B2C, but B2B. So ORION is a good example of that, hub automation again is another example. But then, Alan, in just a minute, will talk about some of the expansions we\u2019ve made in products that will not only reduce our costs, provide better service, but will also help us adjust to this changing trend even more. So, Alan?","Alan Gershenhorn","","First, I\u2019d say that you guys know that most of our growth these past few years has come from B2C and overall profits and margins have improved. And along with creating the value for the retailers and consumers, obviously achieving acceptable levels of profit is absolutely central. And if you take a look at all of our newer services and solutions, they\u2019re all designed to drive down cost by improving stock and\/or delivery and pickup density economics. So you've got SurePost and SurePost redirect that improves delivery density and lowers delivery cost. UPS My Choice, which I think David mentioned, launched in 15 more countries helps us reduce those unsuccessful delivery attempts. And then obviously UPS Access Point, which right now most of what we\u2019re doing there is delivering to the Access Point after the first delivery attempt, but the ultimate goal is to have shoppers be able to pick Access Points right from the retailers' website get it directly to the Access Point or UPS My Choice customer directing it directly to the Access Point and that obviously changes residential stops into commercial and improves delivery density.","Operator","Question will come from the line of Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs","","I was wondering if you could elaborate and share your thoughts on the potential impact of Amazon sort facilities for the coming quarter and how is it affecting your planning around the peak season? But also more importantly, as Amazon focuses increasingly on not just sort facilities, but obviously the fulfillment ability, how that sort of shapes your views on CapEx going forward?","Kurt Kuehn","Well Thomas, we don\u2019t comment specifically on any specific customer. But clearly, we\u2019re working very closely with all our major shippers. And it\u2019s an evolving market and UPS is continuing to adapt to that. But the suite of capabilities we have we think continue to make us a tremendous player in this space and we\u2019ll continue to.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital","","I want to talk about pricing, because obviously you have a unique service here along with your peer as you go into peak season. It sounds like you've put a lot of preparation in delivering a better service outcome. But I think historically you\u2019ve talked about 2% to 3% as your avenue for core price gains. Can you talk about where that's been trending this year and what you hope to do? And I know you're going to provide guidance later at the analyst meeting, but just longer term where do you hope to get that price and what are the aspects that are going to drive that gain?","Kurt Kuehn","Well clearly we pride ourselves on being very disciplined over the long-term on pricing and this year the priority has been added capacity, meeting customer needs and having the superior quality we\u2019re known for. I\u2019ll turn it over to Alan a little bit to talk about the revenue management process and the rate announcements we\u2019ve made recently.","Alan Gershenhorn","So first, I think we all know that the market continues to change with B2C volume making up bigger concentration of our business and that is really driving down the lower yields due to the lighter weights in shifts and product and customer mix. As you know, we stick to that 2% to 3% annual base price increase. This year we have been much closer to the 2%. Next year, we plan to take that up. Certainly the rate change we just announced at 4.9% for ground and air, as well as the DIM weight initiative are great examples of addressing the yields due to shifts to the lighter weights.","Operator","","The next question will come from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Please go ahead.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup","","Another question on the guidance, particularly for the fourth quarter. When you think about sort of last year and some of the expenses that you had that were specific probably to that year and you think about where it might -- looks like it\u2019s trending this year, it feels like the implied growth is sort of on the low end. I\u2019m trying to get a rough sense to sort of how you guys are thinking about it, whether there is implied conservatism baked in there or if we\u2019re thinking that sort of the dynamics of this holiday may be different than ones in the future. I guess I just want to get a rough sense of maybe how you guys are thinking about incremental margins around the holiday, because it would seem that that guidance number is a little bit on the light side?","Kurt Kuehn","","Well, there is a lot of noise in the comparisons for Q4 this year and last year. And if you peel those back a little bit and look at some of the extraordinary events that happened last year and what we\u2019re doing this year, it makes a little more sense. We are looking to spend approximately $115 million in peak and project related expenses in Q4 and so that does reduce the year-over-year increases we\u2019d be seeing otherwise. But if you take that out, I think you\u2019ll see that there is a -- we\u2019ve got a good core margin approaching 15% and a solid improvement. So this year is focused on capacity and capabilities and we do think we\u2019ll have a good profit quarter, but we are spending some unique expenses this year to make sure things happen.","Operator","","Our next question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch","And just wanted to follow up, it sounded like you mentioned, David, earlier some sort of cap on volumes as you moved into peak season with some of the large customers. Can you talk about that, talk about how the discussions have gone as you prepare for the peak in terms of ensuring that you can get your kind of next day and second day delivery done around kind of that potential cap that you talked about?","Kurt Kuehn","","Ken, this is Kurt. I\u2019ll link this one together that, really this is a twofold process. We have a control tower process for peak. And I\u2019ll have Myron talking about the operational alignment on that and then Alan talking about the customer alignment. So Myron, maybe you could start off on our operational connectivity this year.","Myron Gray","","So Ken, early in the year and all of this year we've been working very closely with the high impact customers to assess what they think their volume needs are going to be for the fourth quarter. So we have worked them to determine their shipping needs as well as we've implemented new technology that will give us a view into what their shipping patterns are. So if they exceed the projected volume quotas that they have given us, then we have an advanced opportunity to go back to them and mute what they\u2019re giving to us. And this control tower will be managed by senior leaders in the organization. So I\u2019ll give Alan an opportunity to address that.","David Abney","","Before he does, I want to just talk a little bit more about this control tower, and this is certainly a byproduct of the increased visibility that we\u2019re going to have this year. So we\u2019re going to have a much better idea of not only our volume, but of the planning process. And this control tower will also allow us to do just the opposite. If we see that we have capacity on a certain day and we\u2019ve got a key customer that wants to give us more than we forecast, we have this visibility, we make that decision and we will certainly take that additional volume. And it can be the same way for us for other shippers that need to surge one way or the other. So good visibility, good planning, it allows us to make decisions on a day-to-day basis and we see it as a real capability to be able to take care of our customers\u2019 needs. Alan?","Alan Gershenhorn","","I will just add quickly that the collaboration with the customers this year as well as the forecasting tools that we have in place is unprecedented. The primary focus is on delivery reliability with the customers. Again, they talked a lot about this control tower, it\u2019s made up of engineering, ops, sales and revenue management and we'll assess capacity and we\u2019ll determine rates and surcharges as needed. But the primary focus here is on network reliability and then after that, certainly what we get paid for, right volume at the right price.","Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch","Just so I understand what you\u2019re saying, have you ever said that\u2019s a cap for a customer before? Is this a new thing or is this a regular kind of ongoing thing or is this changing how you operate in terms of taking business?","Kurt Kuehn","","Ken, I think the best way to look at it is it's a refinement and we\u2019ve increased visibility and increased collaboration, both internally and externally. So we\u2019re moving forward. Thanks.","Operator","","Next question will be from the line of Mr. Art Hatfield of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Derek Rabe - Raymond James","This is Derek Rabe on for Art. As we exit the peak season and head into 2015, obviously coming off a strong year of investment into the network in 2014, how do you feel like the network will be from a capacity perspective coming off of the peak season? Will there be a lot of excess capacity that would need to be fielded such that we'll see some pressure on pricing coming out of the peak?","Kurt Kuehn","I can speak to that. Clearly, we\u2019re seeing continued growth. This is not by any means just a peak issue or fourth quarter. So we\u2019ve shown some of the strongest growth both domestically and internationally we\u2019ve seen in a while. So this is not by any means to say speak season event. It\u2019s just we\u2019re talking about peak right now, because it's that time of the year. But we think that the changes in e-commerce and omni-commerce are here to stay.","David Abney","And you have to remember that some of the capacity that we\u2019re putting on this peak is temporary affordable capacity that we can turn on and off with any of the major hub expansions or modifications will be utilized throughout the year.","Operator","Our next question will be from the line of Mr. Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley","","I was curious if you can share a couple of data points with us. Maybe where is B2C running so far this year? Where do you think it will be in the fourth quarter? But probably the most important question is really where does that max out? How high does this number go as a percent of total? How do you think about that?","Kurt Kuehn","Bill, it will be talked in quite a bit about the long-term outlook in a few weeks, both on, as David said how we\u2019re adapting our operating model, as Alan talked about how we\u2019re enhancing service to be profitable. We were about 45% B2C in the U.S. in the third quarter. Certainly, that number is continuing to grow, although we\u2019re seeing, as we\u2019ve mentioned, good strong robust growth in B2B as the industrial base of the U.S. picks up. So more to come on that. We\u2019re not making any forecast right now, but clearly we\u2019ll be talking about the long-term in a few weeks.","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley","It\u2019s materially higher though in the fourth quarter, is that right?","Kurt Kuehn","Yes.","Operator","And we have a question from the line of Mr. Jeff Kauffman of Buckingham. Please go ahead.","Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research","","I want to ask you a little bit about Kiala or I guess UPS Access Point as we call it. What did you learn as you expanded it in Europe and how -- other than just being a place where customers can get packages on a more convenient basis, what role do you see it playing here in the U.S. and how do you think it affects you financially, whether it's lowering the cost of delivery, whether it's resulting in a different revenue yield? How should we think about Access Point as it rolls out within the U.S.?","Kurt Kuehn","It\u2019s a great question. Jim Barber was there to help implement when we did our first acquisition at Kiala and so he helped to establish that. And Jim, why don\u2019t you talk a little bit about what we\u2019ve done and what we\u2019ve learned?","Jim Barber","","Jeff, I mean I think the value of that investment in the U.S. will be very similar to what we had and continue to develop in international. Effectively, it has seven or eight different value points, of which I am not going to over all of them on the line. We\u2019ll do that in New York when we\u2019re with you. But it does create different economics in a B2C or retail package that we think help both the customer and UPS to scale the investments and go forward. So we love the investment and I think New York you\u2019ll see the same thing that we see today.","Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research","As this rolls out though, I guess as I'm thinking about it from a modeling perspective, is it more of a cost-reduction opportunity for you in terms of reducing the amount of failed deliveries or is it more of a revenue opportunity for you in terms of an easier delivery front to the customer? How should I think about the financial impact?","Jim Barber","Let me start and I\u2019ll take both sides and give it to Alan for a little bit more color as well. It\u2019s both, to be honest with you, it allows the B2C economics to move much more towards a B2B set of economics, so you\u2019ve got the cost side of it as well. But from a revenue perspective, it allows different pickup origin points and access points for customers which gets into the revenue management side as well. And I think Alan will add a couple of points to that.","Alan Gershenhorn","Every delivery angle is better economics, whether we deliver it directly to the access point or we deliver it out to the \u2013 to send again to the consumer\u2019s house. The way I would think about access points and we\u2019ll talk about this more at the investor conference is in totality with the whole ecosystem with UPS My Choice and now even i-parcel, so we\u2019re the only ones with an Access Point and UPS My Choice network on two continents and now with i-parcel, we\u2019re going to be able to enable domestic retailers in the U.S. and the UK to basically have access to consumers in over 100 countries around the world and those consumers will be able to shop seamlessly just like they\u2019re shopping in their own country.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Kevin Sterling of BB&T Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Kevin Sterling - BB&T Capital Markets","","Maybe switching gears here looking at the international sector, we saw a very good tonnage and shipments, but I think you still highlighted you're still seeing some yield pressure. As we look at that, what do you think is putting more pressure on your International yields? Is it the growth in non-premium products still or maybe the strength you're seeing in some of the shorter-term trade lanes?","Kurt Kuehn","It\u2019s really both of those, Kevin. But I\u2019ll let Jim talk a little bit to some of activities going on in our International Express business.","Jim Barber","So it really is both of them. I mean if you saw the growth rates, we had some very, very strong export growth rates and some reasonable domestic growth rates as well in the middle single digits in some of our bigger countries. So the combination of those put pressure on the yield. But ultimately the job is to match the network to the yield and create operating margins and leverage and continue to invest in the network. So we\u2019re comfortable with that. We told you last quarter we had the mix improvements in Europe where you can start to see those economics comp sequentially across the quarters and we\u2019ll continue to do that. So it\u2019s a combination of the yields and obviously the operating efficiency in the network.","Operator","","We have a question from the line of Mr. Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","Just a small question. Can you help us think about the impact of fuel and currency in the quarter? Not sure if they were small helps or big helps or what. And then maybe how you\u2019re thinking about those two items in the fourth quarter?","Kurt Kuehn","","Fuel was a slightly positive for the international, not much on the domestic side. Currency clearly has been very volatile. Fortunately with some hedging, it actually was a little bit of a support in Q3, although as we look at Q4, our comps year-over-year for currency, especially the euro, will be a drag. So both of those were a mild positive for this year, but we do expect some currency headwinds as far as profits are concerned in Q4.","Operator","","And we have a question from the line of Ms. Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse","So I wanted to ask about your guidance for SCS for the fourth quarter in terms of mid single digits, high single digit revenue and operating profit growth. If I think about the guidance you gave for 3Q, you had called for low double digits for operating profit growth and it came in somewhat less than that. And as I think about the fourth quarter last year, the comps were pretty easy. So I was wondering if you could maybe provide some commentary on what\u2019s going on there.","Kurt Kuehn","","I think we\u2019re pretty pleased with the progress of most of the segments there. The distribution group is continuing to show solid growth and upper single digit margins. UPS Freight is on a controlled growth strategy with improving margins. The international air freight has been the primary challenge. And we did see a pick up in demand and tonnage, but the market is such that still our sell rates and revenue generation are not able to offset some of the increasing rates at Asia. So, a little bit of a classic margin squeeze, it wasn\u2019t severe, but it was a challenging quarter and we expect that that will mute results a little bit in Q4, although clearly Jim and his team are doing a lot of work on broadening our base for forwarding. Jim, do you got any thoughts on that front?","Jim Barber","","I would say it's one of those issues that with tonnage and shipment fuel growth in the middle teens, that\u2019s a good problem to have. It says our customers like our solutions, they like the fact that we\u2019re connecting their supply chains across the globe. The buy\/sell rates we have moved very quickly in the third quarter. We talk about this a number of times over the quarters and internally we've kicked off an internal work team to look forward over the next couple of years to look at how we do this and make sure that our speed and flexibility changes to the environment and we look at other value drivers to get to other customers to kind of change the mix in the network as well.","So again, we\u2019ll probably talk about this as well in New York. But it\u2019s an area that we think there's a good opportunity for us to improve going forward and we plan to do that.","Operator","","We have a question from the line Mr. Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar","I\u2019d like to ask about purchase transportation, which looks like it moved up a bit faster than revenue, up 15% from last year. What\u2019s behind this? And related, have you had to shift volume off of rail to truck the past couple of quarters to maintain the service you want for your customers?","Kurt Kuehn","","We did see a big increase in purchase transportation, very similar to what we saw in Q3. And the factors there are multiple actually, because there is a lot of different moving parts in that. The biggest one clearly is increased forwarding expenses. I said we did see a large increase in tonnage, double-digit tonnage, which does drive up the PTE. In addition, our SurePost product that has rapid growth, that\u2019s where the payments for third party show up. So the growth in that is included in that. And some of the international expenses for delivery for the final mile show up there with outside contractors.","So it\u2019s a number of issues. We are certainly seeing some inflation in the over-the-road rates. And as we mentioned in the second quarter, we have taken some volume off the rail and that does show up and driving some increases in purchase transportation. So a lot of moving parts, some of it driven by revenue growth and some in some other conditions.","Operator","","And we have a question from the line of Mr. Ben Hartford of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Ben Hartford - Robert W. Baird","Just wondering if you could provide any sort of update in terms of where you are with regard to the appeal with the EC\u2019s decision, the interpretation of market dominance that stemmed from the TNT bid. Are you expecting any sort of final resolution here in the coming months?","Kurt Kuehn","","No, we think that's still a long ways off. And as we said, our primary purpose of that appeal was just to avoid having a precedent set that creates a very narrow definition of the market. So that\u2019s an important one, we think, because it may be used in other areas more than this specific transaction.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Mr. Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer","You guys have addressed your flexibility for the seasonal peak. I'm just curious delving into the hiring capacity, since last year, obviously, you ended up hiring a lot more seasonal folks than originally planned and the number above what you did last year. Could you address just on the human capital capacity your abilities to flex there?","Kurt Kuehn","We have stated that we expect to hire 90,000 to 95,000 this year in the U.S. and that\u2019s against an actual hiring of about 85,000 last year. So it is an increase, but not totally out of the range. Myron, maybe you could talk a little bit about how we manage that.","Myron Gray","We have experienced to date no issues with bringing on additional personnel throughout the U.S. But in addition to that, our capacity to train has been enhanced by adding additional Integrad training sites across the country. We have added five additional Integrad sites that should ease the burden of training additional employees. And as we ramp up throughout the peak season, we foresee no issues at all.","David Abney","I think one significant difference between last year and this year is last year we had to reactively near the end of peak try to put on a lot of extra employees. This year we\u2019ve got increased volume going into peak. And because we have such better visibility in forecasting, we\u2019re actually putting these people in place a little bit earlier and they are trained and they\u2019re ready to go so that when peak does fully engage, they will be able to pull their weight. So much more of a proactive view this year versus reactive.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Mr. Rob Salmon of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank","","David, you had talked a little bit about Europe earlier. Could you give us an update in terms of what the trends you are seeing month-to-date in October? And then, Kurt, as we look out to 2015, can you give us a sense of how the movement of the euro will impact the P&L and to what extent you've already hedged at this point?","Kurt Kuehn","I\u2019ll start off with the hedging. We have gone out a couple of years actually on the euro, although last year we were at about a 136 and our hedge is at about 133 for the fourth quarter. So we\u2019re in decent shape going out for the next couple of years, but it depends where currencies move and the volatility does create some challenges. So I\u2019ll let Jim maybe talk a little bit about the trends in the business he's seen.","Jim Barber","As some of the opening comments alluded to, we have a fourth quarter that\u2019s going to wrap over some big wins in the fourth quarter last year. So that will actually kind of dampen some of the growth, but the growth is fine. It\u2019s exactly where we plan it to be. It\u2019s controlled growth that\u2019s a combination of continuing to invest in the network and the revenue management practices that you can see starting to come true. So we\u2019re off to a good international peak as well and we plan to continue to manage that as such. So fourth quarter looks good so far.","Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank","So have you seen any deceleration with some of the reports of weakening in Europe?","Jim Barber","Well, with regard to the economics of Europe, that\u2019s one thing, but I think if you look back over the years, the economics there versus the way UPS performs don\u2019t actually have that big of a correlation. We continue to go in and with the brand where it needs to be, invest in that market and we\u2019ll continue to do so.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kelly Dougherty of Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Kelly Dougherty - Macquarie","","If you could give us a little bit more magnitude on the growth you're seeing on the B2B side, also if you're seeing more activity in B2B outside of retail. I know that's been the key driver for you guys before, but some of the other companies that have reported have talked about growth being more broad-based. So wondering if you're starting to see that yet in B2B volumes outside of retail.","Alan Gershenhorn","As Kurt reported there, our B2B growth has been the strongest this quarter at 3.4%. And while you do get some nice B2B growth out of B2C or retail which is really part of our overall B2C strategy, we\u2019re seeing much more broad-based growth. Industrial manufacturing is certainly growing much stronger than it has and our solutions are really resonating in that area and our sales and solutions teams are winning.","Kelly Dougherty - Macquarie","But then, should we start to then -- can you help us think about what the operational leverage -- you finally seem to have B2B coming back. Is there any way to think about what that does from a profitability perspective?","Kurt Kuehn","Well certainly if those trends continue, then it\u2019s good news because it increases the density and just helps the network overall. We do think that there is an industrial renaissance of sorts in the U.S. And so as low energy and other advantages that the U.S. has continue, that does bode well for balancing our network. So we\u2019re -- nothing specific right now, but clearly we\u2019re pleased to see some of the revitalization.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Ms. Helane Becker of Cowen. Please go ahead.","Helane Becker \u2013 Cowen & Company","I just wanted to -- had this question. With respect -- today, in today\u2019s Wall Street Journal, your pilots took out a full page ad. I thought it was kind of surprising to me because I\u2019m not sure what message they're trying to send. And I\u2019m just wondering what you\u2019re -- if you can comment at all without necessarily negotiating publicly what your takeaway from that is.","David Abney","","Well, first, you just have to consider that we are in negotiations. And the big thing that I would want you to take from that ad is the quote that they remain committed to delivering your holiday in 2014. That\u2019s what they are paid to do, that\u2019s what our contract covers that they would do and what\u2019s what we would expect them to do and we appreciate the fact that they made that commitment. But we\u2019re going to continue to negotiate in good faith and we\u2019re going to do what\u2019s right for the company, we\u2019re going to do what\u2019s right for our pilots. And we\u2019re not going to discuss the specifics of negotiations here, because we think that it\u2019s best left at the bargaining table.","We just want to remind everyone that we are covered under the Railway Labor Act, so these contracts do not expire. They become amendable and the contract term stay in force. The National Mediation Board, the IPA and us asked the NMB to get involved in the negotiations and they did so six months ago and they are now controlling the pace and timing of those negotiations.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Mr. David Ross of Stifel.","David Ross - Stifel Nicolaus","UPS Freight, I wanted to talk about that for a second. The tonnage accelerated in the third quarter, looked pretty good, while yields decelerated. The first half of this year, you had flattish volumes, but yields were up 3% to 4%. What was driving that? Was there an increase in bundling activity in the third quarter or another change in the market approach?","Kurt Kuehn","","We\u2019ve been very strong results on the yield front if you look over the last couple of years, so some of that is really just wrapping some of the industry leading improvements we've seen. But I'll let Myron talk a little bit about our continuing focus on the middle market and leveraging our connectivity to grow the business profitably.","Myron Gray","","The Freight group continues to see steady improvement year-over-year. But as we've professed before, they will continue to see opportunities for growth. We have a continued discipline growth strategy focused on profit and not necessarily market share. We\u2019ll focus on the middle market customers utilizing our ground sales force as well as the continued expansion in technology that we'll utilize to seek growth with. So we expect to continue to see steady improvements in our Freight Group.","Operator","","Our next question will come from the line of Bascome Majors of Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna","I want to follow up a little bit on an earlier question on pricing and specifically around the peak. So if e-commerce growth does continue at this double-digit pace going forward and the customer behavior doesn\u2019t drastically change about wanting the packages coming to the door, when do you start to invoke price as a primary lever in driving margins higher around the peak? And maybe talk a little bit about what sort of future approach is to peak season pricing you\u2019re seriously considering today.","Kurt Kuehn","","We\u2019re certainly watching closely market dynamics and we do overtime convinced and sure that we\u2019ll be able to get paid for the value we create, although this year the priority was on enhancing our capabilities. We do price for peak, in some cases anyway and I\u2019ll let Alan talk a little bit about that. But we prefer to set long-term contracts with customers and then adjust around that. But Alan, maybe you could expand a little bit about the conditions in which there is peak pricing?","Alan Gershenhorn","","So certainly as we look at our customers' forecasts and what we agreed to on a year around basis as well as peak, there is some variability in what a customer wants to give us. Certainly there is always the opportunity to put in some sort of a peak surcharge for that additional business. And I think that your comments are certainly something that we\u2019re taking a very close look at. We've got to manage this business on a year around basis and we certainly understand that peak season is becoming more and more of a step up phenomenon and we can\u2019t build a network, or as Kurt always says, we can\u2019t build a church for a day.","Kurt Kuehn","","So more to come on that front.","Operator","","And due to time constraints, our last question in queue comes from the line of Mr. David Campbell of Thompson Davis & Company. Please go ahead.","David Campbell - Thompson Davis & Co.","I just wanted to delve in a little bit into the same-day delivery business. This is a business that seems to be, by Google and Amazon and other companies, accelerating. How does that impact UPS? Doesn\u2019t it take business away from Next Day or Ground business as people get more and more deliveries the same day?","Kurt Kuehn","","That certainly is generating a lot of press. Other than drones, I can't think of anything else that seems to grab the headlines. There are some markets where that same day is an important element and we\u2019ll talk about this at our investor conference. But we think that the majority of Internet shopping anyway happens late afternoon and evening and that the real hotspot is going to be local next day delivery and that\u2019s something we\u2019re working very closely with a number of brick and mortar retailers on to be able to fill from stores that have inventory in that metropolitan area and make deliveries the next day. That\u2019s where the bulk of the demand is, that\u2019s where the economics make sense. So more to come and we\u2019ll be talking about this at our investor conference. So thanks for your call.","Operator","I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Wilkinson.","Joe Wilkinson","Thank you, Stephen. I appreciate all the questions today. We look forward to seeing you in the investor conference. And I\u2019ll turn the floor over to David Abney for final comments.","David Abney","Thanks, Joe, and thanks to all of you for participating in my first earnings call as the CEO. And the results discussed this morning represent the effort of more than 400,000 UPS-ers and they\u2019re working very diligently to develop, test and implement new technologies and they\u2019re really making good progress. And we have set high expectations and our people are really excited and they\u2019re ready for the upcoming challenge. I am confident that they will make a real difference.","You can see we\u2019re adapting to the rapidly changing marketplace. The growth opportunities are many and we look forward to reviewing them with you during the New York conference. We\u2019ll update you at that time on our long-term strategy and of course I am looking forward to share my vision for UPS at that time. So, thanks again for joining us and have a good Friday.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations first quarter 2013 earnings conference call. [Operator instructions.]  It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Andy Dolny, UPS treasurer and investor relations officer. Sir, the floor is yours.","Andy Dolny","Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Scott Davis, our CEO, and Kurt Kuehn, our CFO, along with Chief Operating Officer David Abney, International President Dan Brutto, President of U.S. Operations Myron Gray, and UPS Chief Sales and Marketing Officer Alan Gershenhorn.","Before we begin, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the company. These anticipated results are subject to risks and uncertainties which are described in detail in our 2012 Form 10-K report. This report is available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the Securities and Exchange Commission.","During the quarter, we reported a $36 million after tax net gain related to our attempted acquisition of TNT.  This is made up of two components, a $213 million after tax currency gain from the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary and a $177 million after tax charge for the termination fee and other transaction-related costs.  These adjustments resulted in an after tax benefit of $0.04 per share.  Ignoring the impact of this gain, diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $1.04.","In our remarks today, we will refer to UPS first quarter 2013 results excluding these one-time items. We believe this is the most accurate picture of the company's performance. ","Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures and free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, are included in the schedules that accompany our earnings new release.  ","These schedules, along with the webcast of today\u2019s call, are available on the UPS investor relations website.  Finally, as a reminder, our goal is to allow as many as possible to participate on today\u2019s call.  We weren\u2019t able to do that last quarter.  So, please ask only one question, and then get back in the queue.  And, for those of you who like five-part questions, don\u2019t be surprised when we select which part to answer.  Thanks for your cooperation.","Now, let me turn it over to Scott.","Scott Davis","Thanks, Andy, and good morning.  We entered 2013 in an environment of global uncertainty, yet confident in our strategies and ability to execute.  UPS delivered another quarter of growth, reflecting the management discipline and earnings consistency you have come to expect.  ","The U.S. domestic business continues to expand margins, a testament to the ability of our integrated network and operations technology to serve the fast-growing B2C market profitably.  We continue to raise the bar, differentiating our service in unique ways.  Just last week we deployed a new enhancement to UPS My Choice, allowing our 3 million subscribers to upgrade to UPS Ground from Surepost, increasing their visibility and improving time in transit.","Although the international supply chain and price segments are facing macro challenges, we are adapting our strategies to keep UPS on the path to long term growth.  In emerging markets, B2C and industry specific solutions like healthcare have enormous potential and UPS continues to invest in them.","For example, during the quarter UPS became the first global express delivery company to have wholly owned operations in Vietnam, a dynamic, export-oriented economy.  This investment reflects our growing commitment to emerging markets, which will generate the bulk of global growth in coming decades.","In addition, leveraging the [unintelligible] business to retail model, we launched UPS access point locations in the U.K. to better serve the growing European B2C market.  We expect 1,500 locations there by the end of the summer.  Continuing this B2C strategy, in May we will begin recruiting partner stores in Germany, and expect to have more than 2,000 by the end of the year and more than 4,000 by the end of 2014.  ","And most recently, we announced the acquisition of the medical logistics company CEMELOG.  We expect the transaction to close in June.  It will add about 250,000 square feet of dedicated healthcare space in Budapest, Hungary, and enable UPS to further offer customers expanded access to regional expertise, reaching new patient populations.  This is yet another piece of the comprehensive capabilities we are building for our healthcare customers across Europe and the world.  ","While expanding capabilities, UPS also remains dedicated to collaborating with policy leaders around the world to promote global trade and support our customers\u2019 growth initiatives.  For example, in the important U.S. to Canada trade lane, the recently increased customer ceiling for low value shipments will enable faster clearance of goods.  Also, talks were launched on a transatlantic trade and investment partnership, an opportunity to increase trade between the U.S. and E.U. member states.","UPS sees the strengthening of this relationship as a way to improve U.S. and European economies.  Speaking of economies, although the U.S. economy is poised for growth, it has been restrained somewhat by the tax increases and sequestration implemented during the first quarter.  This will be a drag on 2013 GDP expansion, with current expectations for about 2% growth.  However, we expect the small package market to grow faster than the economy.","Around the globe, the Euro Zone remains sluggish, but UPS volume continues to show steady growth, again outperforming the economy.  In Asia, uncertainty has increased.  After a strong fourth quarter, China\u2019s GDP and industrial production growth appear to have slowed a bit.  ","Regardless of the mixed economic recovery, you can be sure that UPS will remain focused, execute our strategy, and deliver consistent results.  As I wrap up, there are a few items I want to address related to our most important assets, our people.","First, representing all UPSers, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to Dan Brutto, president of UPS International, who is retiring after 38 years of service.  Under Dan\u2019s leadership, we\u2019ve introduced innovative services and technologies to help solve the needs of our customers.  His contributions will have a lasting impact on future generations of UPSers.  Dan, we wish you well in retirement.","The international business will be in good hands with Dan\u2019s replacement, Jim Barber.  Jim began his UPS career in 1985, and has been a senior executive on the international management team since 2004.  Most recently, he served as president of UPS Europe.","Continuing on the topic of dedication and service, in March UPS demonstrated our commitment to the mission of supporting those that serve our country.  UPS already employs about 25,000 veterans and members of the National Guard and Reserve.  As a result of our participation in the Joining Forces program, there are 25,000 more American veterans whom we plan to make UPSers over the next five years.","Lastly, I want to provide an update on our labor negotiations.  UPS and the Teamsters have made significant progress.  We have resolved the most important issues in the contract, and are optimistic that we\u2019ll reach a deal very soon.  We are eager to move forward, working in unison with all our employees to deliver unique, innovative products and services that help our customers prosper and enable UPS to deliver superior and consistent results.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Kurt to cover the financials.","Kurt Kuehn","Thanks, Scott, and good morning everyone.  The first quarter exemplifies how the UPS business model delivers earnings growth in a mixed global economic environment.  The U.S. domestic business continued to perform well, while the international and supply chain side effects faced some challenges.","Let\u2019s review our results by segment.  In the U.S. domestic, January started out of the gate fast, with the post-holiday season fueling first quarter results.  Strong demand for UPS Ground products led to daily package volume growth of 4.4%, increasing operating profit 9% and expanding operating margin by 70 basis points.","As expected, we did experience increases in pension and healthcare costs, although this quarter they were mostly offset by reduced worker\u2019s compensation expense, the result of ongoing improvements in our safety programs.  ","UPS results continue to be lifted by ecommerce, as omnichannel strategies are playing a bigger role.  And increased focus by traditional retailers on using their brick and mortar locations as distribution sites is creating more pickups at retail locations for ultimate residential delivery.","As we noted last call, B2C growth and differentiated products like our returns portfolio produced surprisingly strong January volume levels.  However, daily package growth for the remainder of the quarter came in pretty much as forecasted.","Revenue in the U.S. segment increased 3.3%, with balanced daily package growth across all products.  UPS base rate pricing remains consistent and in line with our long term objectives, although it\u2019s not fully apparent in our reported yields.  ","The ground revenue per piece increase of 1.5% reflects the continuing trend of higher growth in both our lighter weight B2C products and our returns portfolio.  Air revenue per piece was impacted by reduced fuel surcharges and changes in both product and customer mix, but overall the U.S. domestic is adapting successfully to the explosive growth in ecommerce.","Through the use of proprietary technology, systems can now seamlessly merge UPS Surepost packages with other UPS packages at the point of delivery.  This and other enhancements like UPS My Choice are helping to expand margins and at the same time empowering consumers with tools to better manage their incoming shipments.","Now let\u2019s cover international.  Export volume per day grew nearly 4% in the quarter.  Asia exports were up about 8%, European exports increased about 3%, while the U.S. was up just slightly.  On a currency neutral basis, export yields, down 2.5%, continue to be pressured by lighter weight packages and an increased reliance on non-premium products.  ","We expected operating profit to be flat year over year.  However, currency and fuel created a headwind of about $30 million as we ended the quarter $17 million below last year.  As expected, comparisons were negatively affected by the timing of Easter, resulting in fewer local operating days on a year over year basis.  In order to address current conditions, we are implementing a number of programs to bring in country costs in line with yield growth, generating positive operating leverage.  ","In the UPS Air network, past changes we\u2019ve made provided benefits.  During the first quarter, our international block hours were down 2.5%, although our exports grew by 4%.  We also responded to customers\u2019 needs with air service enhancements in Panama and Malaysia.  And keep in mind the UPS network efficiency is a long term trend.  In fact, since 2008, international volume has grown significantly while block hours have remained flat.  ","Moving on to the supply chain and freight segment, frankly it was a tough quarter.  Revenue grew just 1%, as increases in UPS freight and distribution were nearly offset by a decline in forwarding.  Profit in the segment was down $23 million, although we did maintain a respectable operating margin of 6.5%.","Keep in mind that last year we did have a very strong quarter and benefited from the sale of a surplus facility.  As a result of overcapacity, the forwarding market remains under pressure, especially in the trans-Pacific trade lanes.  UPS Asia air freight tonnage and yields were down and we had an overall 9% decline in revenue.  Cost containment and growth in our ocean business could not make up this shortfall.","In the distribution business, UPS\u2019s integrated services, global reach, and specialized capabilities supported a revenue increase of about 10%.  The healthcare segment remains a growth engine, although margin expansion was limited by the deployment of technology and investments in infrastructure, including new healthcare facilities in both North America and Europe.","At UPS Freight, shipment and yield growth, combined with productivity improvements, helped grow profits and expand margins.  However, profitability in this business unit is still not where we\u2019d like it to be.","Now let\u2019s review our financial strength.  UPS generated $1.4 billion in free cash flow this quarter, after capital expenditures of $453 million.  In the quarter, we paid $572 million in dividends, an increase of almost 9% per share.  In addition, we repurchased 12.2 million shares for approximately $1 billion.","In February, reflecting confidence in our cash outlook, the board of directors reauthorized UPS\u2019s share repurchase program for $10 billion, and we are on track to achieve our target of $4 billion for 2013.  We anticipate an average share count of about 952 million shares for the second quarter.","Lastly, let\u2019s discuss guidance.  Even though there are some mixed economic signals, we are reaffirming our full year guidance for earnings per share of $4.80 to $5.06.  As you\u2019ve just heard, the first quarter results were a little better than we\u2019d expected, due to the strong January in the U.S. domestic segment.","However, we anticipate that that benefit will be pretty much offset going forward due to the negative trends in global freight markets.  As a result, in supply chain and freight, we are reducing our full year guidance for revenue, and are now expecting low to mid single digit growth.  We anticipate operating margin of approximately 8%.","To give you some shape on the second quarter, we expect low single digit earnings per share growth.  In the U.S. domestic segment, operating margin and profit should be relatively flat, due to the continued headwind from pension expense and the significant benefit last year from the fuel surcharge lag.  Keep in mind, as we get beyond the second quarter, we expect profit growth and margin expansion in the segment.","In supply chain and freight, we expect operating profit will, most likely, be down on a year over year basis, but for international, we anticipate both profit growth and margin expansion over last year, as we see some pull through from our continued network optimization and in country initiatives.   ","So to wrap it up, UPS will continue to work hard and adapt, demonstrating the power of our business model across a wide range of economic conditions and changing market dynamics.  Therefore, we\u2019re maintaining our guidance and anticipate full year earnings per share to grow 6% to 12% over 2012.","With that, we\u2019d now like to open the call up for your questions.  ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.]  Our first question will come from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays.  Please go ahead.  ","Brandon Oglenski \u2013 Barclays","I wanted to ask about your domestic profitability and how, even with the change in UPS My Choice, being able to ship Surepost packages to your ground network, how is that increasing the efficiency for you guys and the profitability outlook for the segment?","Kurt Kuehn","The My Choice is kind of a win-win situation.  It\u2019s a positive for customers in that it gives them control, and it\u2019s a positive for our operation, because it allows us to pre-notify customers that packages are arriving.  Myron, maybe you can talk a little bit about how that\u2019s helping operations.  ","Myron Gray","In a previous call, we talked about how technology has continued to enable us to adapt and adjust and keep strong margins.  One recent one that we spoke about was residential consolidation, where in the fourth quarter we were able to adjust and approximately 15% of our Surepost packages were then redirected with a UPS driver, which certainly enhanced our customer experience and allowed us to continue reduce cost.","Kurt Kuehn","So we\u2019ll be continuing to leverage technology to both delight customers and maintain our economic profitability.  ","Scott Davis ","The real focus there is just increasing density, and we\u2019re doing a very good job of increasing density on the B2C.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Kevin Sterling of BB&T Capital Markets.  Please go ahead.  ","Kevin Sterling - BB&T Capital Markets","Kurt or Scott, maybe you could just touch on the type of trends you\u2019re seeing, particularly on the international package side in April?","Scott Davis ","I\u2019d say generally the international package volume flows have picked up in the fourth quarter last year and really carried through the first quarter, and we expect some of the same going forward the rest of the year.  The big change in the middle two quarters last year we had negative trade flows.  ","This year we\u2019re seeing, we think, global trade growing faster than global GDP.  And we saw both in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter strong growth out of Asia, upper single digit growth, both to the U.S. and to Europe.  So those trade flows were very weak last year.  They\u2019re better this year.  ","So on the package side, we feel pretty good.  The international air freight side, while the tonnage is growing slightly, still way too much capacity, and the yields are weak.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan.  Please go ahead.  ","Alex Johnson - JPMorgan","Good morning, it\u2019s Alex Johnson on for Tom.  So congratulations on the healthcare acquisition.  Just was curious if you can give us an update maybe pro forma, you talk a lot about healthcare.  What is the mix of healthcare in your business and kind of what is the growth rate that we should be thinking about?","Kurt Kuehn","We\u2019ve seen healthcare in aggregate grow double digits now really for the last several years, since we targeted this in an initiative.  One of the things we like most about healthcare is that it does fully utilize really the entire breadth of the company.  ","On the distribution side, we\u2019ve got 1 million square feet of healthcare compliant space.  We\u2019ve developed healthcare compliant forwarding with cold chain capabilities and re-icing at airports and all kinds of good stuff.  And then our world-class small package network with things like delivery intercept and proactive notification, we can maintain high quality oversight.  And even our UPS Freight group has benefitted from it.  ","So it\u2019s a very diverse and broad set of products, and that\u2019s one of the things that keeps us so excited about it, is it allows us to bring the entire breadth of the company for customers\u2019 benefit.","Scott Davis ","We see really the next 10 years\u2019 growth similar to the last 10 years.  And CEMELOG really is just another piece of the puzzle that\u2019s going to help us in Central and Eastern Europe.  We\u2019re very excited about it.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Art Hatfield of Raymond James.  Please go ahead.  ","Arthur W. Hatfield \u2013 Raymond James","Just a real quick one.  Kurt, in your guidance, you had commented on a bunch of different things, but I thought I heard you say that you expected low single digit growth in EPS in Q2.  Did I mishear that?  And if so, can you correct me, what I should have heard?","Kurt Kuehn ","Right.  No, we do think the second quarter will show profit growth, but it will be in the low to mid-single digits.  The internationals we said we expect to see a good strong bounce back.  Supply chain is still facing some challenges.  And there\u2019s a bit of a year over year comp issue on the domestic side, where second quarter of last year, on the domestic side, we had some benefits, variable comp reductions and some of those things.  But in general, we\u2019re still cranking along just fine.  We just wanted to give you guys a little bit of the quarter to quarter shape.  ","Scott Davis ","We had a fuel benefit last year too in the second quarter, right?","Kurt Kuehn ","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch.  Please go ahead.  ","Ken Hoexter \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Kurt, I have one question, but 12 parts.","Kurt Kuehn ","That gives me lots of choices then.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","You were talking about the growth of ecommerce, and a lot of announcements about same-day deliveries from some of these etailers, or the potential of it.  Maybe you can address the potential for UPS to participate in that market, or if you\u2019ve got trials or anything.","Scott Davis ","I\u2019ll start it off and then maybe let Alan kick in.  But we certainly have experimented with this, with certain customers.  I think that\u2019s what it is right now, an experiment, trying it out.  I\u2019m not sure yet the economic feasibility is going to be there for this to be a big service ongoing.  But Al, you may want to dig into that a little bit?   ","Alan Gershenhorn","Yeah, I think same-day is really going to be a niche offering that\u2019s out there.  The real story is about omnichannel.  We\u2019ve got about 25 or more major retailers that are either using or moving to the UPS omnichannel solutions.  ","And it\u2019s really about leveraging UPS\u2019s shipping and visibility technologies.  It helps enable a seamless connectivity between the retailer\u2019s website, the fulfillment warehouses, the brick and mortar stores, and the consumers and returns.  For the retailer, it enables inventory optimization and less markdowns, and for the consumers, it enables faster click to deliver times and greater access to retailer inventory and a broader variety.  ","So that\u2019s really one of the big stories that\u2019s driving ecommerce and why customers are coming to UPS.  ","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Christopher Ceraso of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.  Please go ahead.  ","Christopher Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","I\u2019m wondering if you guys are having any issues with the FAA and air traffic control disruptions because of sequestration.  Is that having productivity impact on your U.S. business at all?","Scott Davis ","We\u2019ll have David respond on that.","David Abney","You know, so far it\u2019s had very limited impact, and we have been working with the FAA and working with the Department of Homeland Security to make sure that continues.  We do disagree with furloughing of the air traffic controllers, and we also disagree on certain closing of night operations.  We think there are more efficient ways that they can cut cost that will not impede commerce.  And I think that more and more people are agreeing with that as we go through.","Scott Davis ","It sounds like maybe some breakthroughs overnight too, so hopefully we\u2019ll see some corrections on that in the near term.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein.  Please go ahead.  ","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein","When you think about the capital budget kind of looking forward from here, what types of projects are you guys prioritizing either internally or from an organic perspective?  What should we be thinking about from a uses of capital outside of the increased buyback going forward?  ","Kurt Kuehn ","Clearly our top priority for capital deployment is to grow the business.  As you know, our physical capabilities, our aircraft are in great shape, and we have limited need for replacement assets.  So we\u2019re very focused on growth capital.  You saw some examples of that in our announcement with the purchase of the CEMELOG healthcare company, so that\u2019s our top priority, and we\u2019re going to be opportunistic around the world really to build the platform in emerging markets and other areas.","Scott Davis ","I think emerging markets is an area we\u2019re going to invest in.  You saw us buy our partnership out in Vietnam, we\u2019re 100% owned in the Vietnam in the quarter.  There\u2019s more opportunities like that as we go forward.  And like the previous question, global B2C gives us lots of opportunities.  We\u2019ll see areas where we can make investments and new acquisitions to help enhance that product.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Kelly Dougherty of Macquarie.  Please go ahead.  ","Kelly Dougherty - Macquarie","Just wondering if you can give us some color on the scenarios [unintelligible], the high versus the low end of guidance, and maybe what you\u2019re thinking about from a macro backdrop to get you to one end or the other for the full year?","Kurt Kuehn ","Certainly the overall global economic environment will be a huge driver of it.  Domestically, we\u2019re fairly confident that the U.S. economy will be stable, if unexciting.  Internationally, the trade flows have been very volatile, and so we have to stay attuned to that.  So I think the broad economic environment would be the biggest single driver of the variability, although the other is certainly the attitude of the consumers as B2C becomes a bigger part of our business.  Then growth in that environment becomes increasingly important.","Scott Davis ","I think the way we talked about it earlier too is international air freight market, while the percentage is growing slightly, we\u2019d like to see that get more balanced with capacity.  Dan, you may talk about it.  It\u2019s a challenging market right now.","Daniel Brutto","Yeah, right now, certainly out of Asia, there\u2019s more capacity, so customers are taking advantage of obviously spot rates.  I think we still have the best option for our customers in that we can move some of that freight into our own aircraft to fully utilize.  And right now certainly our margins are up because we\u2019re fully utilizing our aircraft.  We\u2019re still running a 13.1 margin in the difficult marketplace, and that\u2019s primarily internationally, because of the utilization of our own aircraft in this hybrid model where we can move in our forwarding business when we need space on our aircraft and move it back when the market expands.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Sterne Agee.  Please go ahead.  ","Jeff Kauffman \u2013 Sterne Agee","I want to follow up on an earlier question.  You\u2019re announcing a healthcare acquisition every other quarter.  We talked a little bit about Kiala in the beginning of the quarter.  Could you help put together the whole mosaic for us in terms of what you\u2019re doing in Europe, what you\u2019re doing in healthcare, and kind of what the bigger picture looks like down the road in terms of how this helps drive shareholder value and earnings?","Scott Davis ","I think those are two of the big areas that we\u2019re going to continue to expand in.  We know the global B2C market is going to grow at a ferocious pace for the next couple of decades.  And there\u2019s just lots of opportunities.  The U.S. is leading the way.  And certainly we\u2019re leading the way with answers to that marketplace with My Choice and other offerings.  But Europe, the percentage of business that\u2019s B2C is starting to grow.  Asia will grow at a very fast pace.  ","So we just need to put together the pieces of the puzzle to fill out the customer needs.  And we\u2019re doing that, we\u2019re doing that in the U.S.   We did it with Kiala in Europe.  We\u2019re taking some of the Kiala applications to other places around the world, and we\u2019ll utilize that.  So lots of opportunities.  Dan?","Daniel Brutto","Yeah, I would say on the whole healthcare, we\u2019re building out primarily on the backs of our customers that are forcing us into other areas of the world, and CEMELOG\u2019s a great example of that.  Many of our large multinational healthcare customers have requested certainly that we get into areas such as Central and Eastern Europe.  We also opened up in Australia.  I\u2019m going to be at a ribbon cutting for a building later this month in [Hang Jo], China.  ","So as our healthcare expands throughout the world, we will follow where our customers\u2019 needs are.  Many of those needs are in emerging markets and certainly we\u2019ll set up a platform to serve them around the world in those areas.","David Abney","And you know with the acquisition of CEMELOG, we now have over 6.5 million square feet dedicated to healthcare and that is spread out throughout the world.","Scott Davis ","And we\u2019re in the early innings in that.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citi.  Please go ahead.  ","Christian Wetherbee \u2013 Citi","Maybe quick question on B2B.  Just kind of curious how B2B volumes trended during the quarter.  What do you think about the outlook for the rest of the year?  Do you see that coming back at all as you move out into the second half of 2013?  ","Kurt Kuehn ","B2B volume remains fairly sluggish, and so that\u2019s an area that clearly we are hopeful that the industrial base of the U.S. catches fire a little more.  We think there are some fundamentals.  The other thing we are seeing is that the omnichannel that Alan referred to actually, when it\u2019s done well, does drive B2B volume.  Because in effect your forward stocking inventory in the stores has to be replenished.  It shrinks shipment sizes, and so the state of the art retailers are now actually doing more frequent deliveries to stores to keep inventories balanced.  ","Scott Davis ","And the segments we saw the growth in the last couple of quarters were retail and [fire] and some healthcare.  And manufacturing we think that for B2B primarily it has been weak and still negative.  And even though we see a Renaissance in manufacturing coming in the U.S., it\u2019s not quite there yet.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Justin Yagerman with Deutsche Bank.  Please go ahead.","Justin Yagerman \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","You referenced ecommerce returns in the release, and just wanted to get a sense of how that business is growing, and really how the economics compare to the original leg of that trip.  Is it better?  Worse?  When you think about the final mile, obviously the customer is bringing that to you, so I would think that there might be better economics there, but just kind of curious how you guys think about that.","Kurt Kuehn ","It is certainly an area that we\u2019re very focused on.  We\u2019ve invested a lot of money and technology to create a very comprehensive set of solutions for retailers.  Alan, maybe you could talk a little bit about it.","Alan Gershenhorn","As you heard earlier, the vast majority of our growth was driven by ecommerce in the first quarter.  And easy returns are obviously an important part of driving consumers to shop online at a retail website.  And we\u2019ve got a very robust portfolio that provides maximum efficiency, visibility, and control for the retailer.  And returns are essentially, like you said, a B2B move that\u2019s created by B2C.  Most of the time, these returns are dropped off by the consumer at a UPS drop box or at a UPS store, so you have very dense pickups and then you obviously have very dense deliveries back to the retailers.  And I would just add that our returns are up about 10% year over year in the first quarter.","Scott Davis ","As you know, Justin, dense is good.  ","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of William Greene of Morgan Stanley.  Please go ahead.","William Greene - Morgan Stanley","I wanted to follow up on Scott, some of the comments you made on working with some of these ecommerce retailers on same-day delivery.  Some of the questions I get asked, though, are whether these same retailers are going to try to build a network that doesn\u2019t incorporate the current parcel carriers in ways that they could actually end up being a competitor.  Can you just comment, how do you think about that risk?  And how do you address it?","Scott Davis ","Well, we always evaluate risk, and we always look to how we serve our customers the best way possible.  We certainly evaluate that.  I think it\u2019s very difficult to replicate the network that UPS has built over the 105 years we\u2019ve been around.  So while we\u2019re not complacent, saying there\u2019s not better solutions out there, we\u2019ll continue to invest in the technology and have the best offering out there.  And right now, we\u2019re working very closely with all the large customers you\u2019re talking about and providing the solutions.  Alan, you work with it every day.  Any thoughts?   ","Alan Gershenhorn","I\u2019ll just say that maybe even to the earlier question about what we\u2019re doing with B2C and retail and healthcare, we\u2019ve got a very focused strategy on the industry segments where we\u2019re seeing most of the growth in the opportunity, and certainly the retail and healthcare are two of those.  So we\u2019re very focused on creating solutions for both brick and mortar and etail only retailers out there.","On this whole omnichannel, getting back to that, what the retailers really like about the UPS solution, in addition to the networking of the technology for shipping and visibility at all their stores, is the one driver pickup.  UPS can come in there at the end of the day, or really any time during the day or evening, and pick up all their ground, air, and their Surepost packages and provide, in the local area, next-day delivery for them.  So we do think we\u2019ve got a real advantage there.","Kurt Kuehn ","I think Alan highlights it there.  We think the real issue will become more next-day fulfillment rather than same-day.  Although clearly we will help customers do whatever they need.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Benjamin Hartford of Baird.  Please go ahead.  ","Benjamin Hartford \u2013Robert W. Baird","","Can you guys maybe provide a little bit of perspective on the weakness and the declines in the tonnage market that we see within freight forwarding and the weakness out of Asia that\u2019s expected relative to the growth of 8% in the international package segment, specifically the daily export volume growth?  The divergence has been there several quarters, but I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s anything specific to what you guys are doing that\u2019s causing that divergence.  Are you parcelizing more freight, putting it into the export volume market?  Is there something else going on that would help characterize that discrepancy?","Daniel Brutto","First, I would say that there\u2019s overcapacity out of the market primarily in Asia because of the [belly] space that the 777s have allowed, so you\u2019ve now got upsized newer planes that have belly space.  So at this stage of the game, that would be one issue.  That would describe kind of the price pressure.  ","The second issue is that manufacture out of Asia is not what it was.  Things are lighter, so there\u2019s not as much freight.  Last year, if I look at comps last year, there was a couple of big releases on the technology side that drove up freight.  Those releases did not occur in the first quarter of this year.  Going forward, we think that that\u2019s probably going to continue for the short and medium term.  ","On the other hand, an area that doesn\u2019t have overcapacity is ocean, and our ocean business is very robust.  In fact, on the [less than a] container load, that business is up over 26%.  For the first quarter we added 300 more destinations as of February.  So we think that that\u2019s certainly not going to make up the variance in international air freight, but we think that that\u2019s a good product that we put in the market.  ","So all in all, we think that it\u2019s going to be a little rocky road for at least the next quarter in international air freight until the manufacturing gets back and the capacity in the marketplace gets back to more normal.  ","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Nate Brochmann of William Blair & Company.  Please go ahead.  ","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company","Just to follow up on that question, and I think that\u2019s kind of a provoking thing, a little bit longer term.  Certainly, like you say, the manufacturers kind of a little bit weak, and a lot of that\u2019s probably tied to consumption near term.  But longer term, how do you think about the international air freight market in terms of how much of the pressure today is cyclical versus secular in terms of how far down the curve are we on these lower package weights, or the ship from air to ocean, or just a change in behavior as it relates to maybe some U.S. [near shoring].  Just kind of wanted to get your bigger picture thoughts on where we stand with all that.","Daniel Brutto","I would say that the whole idea of innovative products is always going to continue, and those products are going to require air freight to move those around the world.  As the world shifts, and we look at what\u2019s manufactured in China, now we see a lot of that manufacturing going down to Vietnam.  After Vietnam it could be Indonesia.  After Indonesia, India.  ","So we\u2019re very bullish on the fact that there will be manufacture all around the world.  Global trade will certainly increase, although it\u2019s been a little choppy here for the last few quarters.  And that will require air freight.  And that\u2019s perfectly in our sweet spot.  ","The other thing that I would say is when the market does contract, as it has, we have our own air fleet.  So we can move freight into our air fleet.  When the market picks back up, we\u2019ll move that same freight and serve our customers through the use of flying on other folks\u2019 planes.  So we\u2019re very bullish on the future about air freight continuing to be a big part of our portfolio.

Please go ahead.","John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets","Quick question, just to follow up on the B2C discussion, can you just talk a little bit about the ecommerce customers that you\u2019re working with, how much success are you having in making UPS the sole shipping option for that retailer versus just being thrown up as one of a portfolio of companies that offer the service to the end customer?","Kurt Kuehn ","Certainly it\u2019s our goal to differentiate, and I think we think we\u2019ve done a great job with that, being out a year and a half ahead of our competitors with something like My Choice.  So that\u2019s the ultimate solution to that.  But Alan, any other thoughts on that?  ","Alan Gershenhorn","Certainly something like UPS My Choice is out there to drive consumer preference.  It\u2019s extremely relevant to both our retailers and our consumers.  And unlike our competitor, most of our residential packages get delivered by a UPS driver.  Scott mentioned I think in the opening that our My Choice consumers now have the option to initiate a Surepost upgrade to UPS ground residential service.  So now essentially all UPS residential deliveries, whether they\u2019re air, ground, or Surepost, are eligible for My Choice delivery options.  And that\u2019s really the power of the UPS integrated network.  ","The other point I\u2019d make is that the offerings like Kiala, which is now being rebranded as UPS Access Point, that we have over there in Europe, that also begins to create that preference.  And you\u2019ll see UPS Access Point branded on the retailer\u2019s website and consumers able to pick that particular service under the UPS brand.  So we\u2019re very focused on establishing both consumer and retailer preference for UPS services, really through value creation.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Peter Nesvold of Jefferies.  Please go ahead.  ","Peter Nesvold - Jefferies & Company","I was hoping to clarify the guidance.  For the year, the midpoint implies about 9% EPS growth.  If I look at the first [two] results, and take into perspective the second quarter outlook, it seems to suggest that you have to grow kind of 12-14% in the back half of the year to hit the midpoint of the range.  And clearly the year ago comps are easier in the second half.  Would the acceleration in growth year over year be primarily on the easier year ago comps?  Or is there something that sequentially you should see more than a normal seasonal uplift?","Kurt Kuehn ","We\u2019ve been seeing, historically, Q4 get stronger and stronger, as B2C plays a bigger role.  And so that is part of a seasonal evolution to where we\u2019re seeing that happen.  We do have an extra working day in Q3.  The international group\u2019s got a lot of initiatives that are being rolled into place.  Air network, we\u2019ve done a lot of adjusting to, and now that we\u2019re doing a number of things on the in-country cost.  ","So your arithmetic is correct.  Absolutely.  We\u2019re maintaining our full year guidance, and we do expect to see stronger and stronger results as the years go on, based on all those factors.","Scott Davis  ","I think particularly forwarding.  We had a good start to last year on the forwarding side, and had a bad finish.  And we expect to have good comparisons on the forwarding side second half of the year.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Trahan.  Please go ahead.  ","Scott Group - Wolfe Trahan","Hoping for a little bit more color on some of the mix and [trade down] issues going on in international package.  Is there a way we can think about what percent of package now internationally is these non-premium products and where do you think it goes?  And maybe along those lines, what can you do to mitigate the impact of that, or maybe even change the customer behavior?","Kurt Kuehn ","I\u2019ll let Dan expand a little bit, although you do have to be careful, when we talk about non-premium products, against a lot of our competitors, those are still time or day definite, what would be considered express products.  So we do offer a broad portfolio and we\u2019ve seen customers move up and down.  So I wouldn\u2019t put too strong a point on it as a long term issue.  ","Daniel Brutto","I guess just to expand a little bit, we call a non-premium product our trans-border product in Europe, which for us is very profitable and growing very well, even in a tough European economy.  Our premium product, Worldwide Express, I think worldwide we\u2019ve seen some trade down for customers to use our Worldwide Expedited product.  But by all means, we\u2019re very successful in our standard product.  Their profitable, they\u2019re strong, and we\u2019re confident that the Worldwide Express products will come back as the world economies strengthen over the year.","Kurt Kuehn ","And I think maybe just to put a final point on it, UPS\u2019s success has been on finding cost effective yet profitable ways for us to meet the customer\u2019s needs when they do need to trade down.  So we\u2019re not trying to upsell, we\u2019re building an integrated network, and if the customer gives us an extra day to get the product somewhere, we\u2019ll take advantage of that, either through leveraging other forms of transportation or taking advantage of that from an economic perspective.  So give us a little time to adapt, and the integrated UPS network will continue to generate high returns.","Scott Group - Wolfe Trahan","Do you think there\u2019s more of that to go, though, in terms of more shifting to some of an extra day kind of business?","Andy Dolny","Scott, I think we made it pretty clear.  We\u2019ll move on to the next question.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of David Ross of Stifel.  Please go ahead.  ","David Ross - Stifel Nicolaus","","UPS Freight saw very nice tonnage per day growth in the first quarter, taking market share.  Can you talk about what drove those gains, and what still needs to be done to get back to your target LTL margin level?","Kurt Kuehn ","I\u2019ll let Myron talk to that.  ","Myron Gray","While we did experience continued growth in our freight segment, we continue to be disappointed in that business unit.  We\u2019ve grown it by offering integrated solutions for that customer segment, and we\u2019ve continued to expect slow but steady growth in the freight group.","Kurt Kuehn ","Clearly the technology that UPS has integrated has been a real differentiator on the market side.  Having shipping systems, the visibility systems, pick up confirmation.  The ability to have a.m. guaranteed deliveries, all of those things that we\u2019ve been so successful with in our package environment is differentiating us on the freight side, although as Myron says, we\u2019ve still got some work to do to get the margins up to our targets. ","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer.  Please go ahead.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer"," ","In U.S. domestic, congratulations on your 70 basis points of operating margin expansion.  Could you speak to the stronger driver being B2C or B2B?  Just a little more elaboration on that?  And was weather much of an impact in U.S. domestic in February or March?  ","Kurt Kuehn ","Well, given my executive privilege to pick one, I\u2019ll let Myron talk a little about weather.","Myron Gray ","Fortunately this is pretty much an all-weather business, and we have the ability to adapt to changing situations and the U.S. operating unit has done a very good job of making those adjustments every year.  In terms of B2B or B2C, as we spoke earlier, the technology that we\u2019ve deployed has just continued to enable us to adapt to changing business, whether they\u2019re heavyweight packages or small B2C retail customers, and continue to expand margin.  So we feel very confident about our abilities moving forward.","Kurt Kuehn ","Myron is being humble this was one of the hardest quarters in recent history for weather and operations.  Just continued storms, just about everywhere, and even April we\u2019re suffering with the floods a bit.  But they managed to execute really well in that environment.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar.  Please go ahead.  ","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar","","Normally we thought of Europe as representing about half of your international business, quite material even with the current standalone network.  Would you share your observations on the evolution of consumer shipping trends in the two markets, U.S. versus E.U., at these different stages of adaption and recovery, perhaps also including the B2B B2C split?","Kurt Kuehn ","Clearly we\u2019ve seen tremendous evolution and innovation in both areas.  We do think that Europe is migrating very quickly, perhaps at a little earlier stage as far as the maturity of the market.  I know Dan, you could talk to that.  ","Daniel Brutto","I would say Europe is probably three to five years behind the U.S. in the whole B2C, depending on what country you\u2019re in.  I think there are some countries in Europe, such as France, U.K., are moving a little quicker, and I think that\u2019s primarily the reason we bought Kiala, because technology and turning a B2C into a B2R is very important for us to be successful, so we\u2019re certainly, from an operational standpoint, and a customer standpoint, preparing for more B2C growth in Europe.  We think there will be some acceleration and certainly we are preparing operationally, and through our technology, to take advantage of that when it comes up.","Scott Davis ","To Dan\u2019s point, we\u2019re over 40% B2C in the U.S. right now and probably our biggest countries in Europe are maybe 25% B2C.  So that gives you a flavor for where they are at this point in time.","David Abney","I was just going to add that our early adoption of having trans-border services throughout Europe has certainly paid significant dividends over the years, and how we\u2019re connecting the countries, and certainly in the B2C market, with solutions like Kiala and other ones to come, our ability to network those countries so that shoppers can shop in any country and receive it back in their home country is going to be a really advantage for us, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Jack Atkins of Stephens.  Please go ahead.  ","Jack Atkins - Stephens","","If we could kind of go back to the freight forwarding business for a moment, you talked about the challenges you\u2019re facing there.  Could you maybe comment on the profitability trends you\u2019ve been seeing on a per-shipment basis?  We\u2019ve heard of increasing competitive pressures from other forwarders in this market, especially in the trans-Pacific.  I\u2019m just sort of curious if that\u2019s part of the headwinds you\u2019re facing and if so, how do you address that?","Daniel Brutto","I would say the profitability in the air freight has obviously been squeezed.  I think a lot of customers, because there\u2019s overcapacity in the market, have gone out with spot rates and outside the contract, just because of the capacity that\u2019s in the marketplace.  We see that continuing at least for the next quarter, but think that it will get back to more normalcy at the end of the year. ","On the other hand, our ocean profit has been doing very well.  Not enough to make up the international air freight, but this premium [less than a container load] ocean product we think is very successful.  We have a supplier management.  Again, we couple technologies so a customer can, instead of getting a whole container load, get less than a container load.  We have a great road network in the U.S. that we can feed and accelerate the time that the ocean shipment actually gets into the U.S. market and even the European market.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Helane Becker of Cowen Securities.  Please go ahead.  ","Helane Becker - Cowen Securities ","This is going to be a really easy question for you.  Does your guidance for the rest of the year include any changes in compensation or productivity as a result of the Teamster contract being concluded?","Kurt Kuehn ","No, we\u2019ve really not factored in anything dramatically different.  We\u2019ve kind of trended as if the ongoing numbers were similar to previous trends in our basic guidance.  And maybe Scott can talk a little bit on the status of the contract negotiation.","Scott Davis ","I think we\u2019re quite pleased with the progress to date on the contract.  We\u2019ve told our customers that we want to get this done earlier than usual.  The Teamsters agree it\u2019s important for our customers to get it done.  We\u2019ve taken on the tough issues, issues like pension, issues like healthcare particularly.  We\u2019re very close to getting this thing done.  And we feel good about the outlook, but we\u2019ll hopefully have something to announce before you know it.","Operator","Our next question will be a follow up from the line of Mr. David Vernon of Bernstein.  Please go ahead.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein "," ","Dan, you had mentioned the capacity issue on belly space.  I guess I wanted to get your perspective on the main deck freighter capacity in the trans-Pacific.  With rates being where they are, you\u2019d think that that capacity would start to come down.  We know Fedex took its service down.  You guys did some belt tightening.  Are you starting to see any of the main deck freighter operators in the trans-Pacific respond to that lower rate environment?  And if not, how long do you think that will take?","Daniel Brutto","As of this point, there are, outside of some Chinese carriers such as [Jade] that have got four 7400s sitting on the fence at [Chen Zin], there is a lot of talk.  I know Cathay has certainly talked about it.  There\u2019s been some large carriers that have talked about if the rates continue to be low, obviously we had a situation in 2009 where you saw some folks take down some aircraft.  It\u2019s not at that stage yet.  I would say from the UPS standpoint, we\u2019ve taken 10% of our capacity year over year out of the trans-Pacific lane, and that\u2019s also 20% down from the first quarter in 2011.  So I think everyone is adjusting more frequencies today instead of taking whole planes down.   ","Operator","Due to time constraints, our last question will be a follow up from the line of Ms. Kelly Dougherty of Macquarie.  Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.","Kelly Dougherty - Macquarie ","I just wanted to see if you could give us a sense, obviously with the 70 basis point improvement in the U.S. domestic business this quarter, how much more do you think you can improve in that business, given the B2C mix, but then some technology and other initiatives you guys have in the works?","Kurt Kuehn ","Clearly we set out long term targets at our investor conference, of margins of 14%-15%.  We\u2019re making good progress towards that, and there\u2019s no specific numbers other than that I\u2019m going to share with you, although you\u2019re seeing great changes, you\u2019re seeing innovation driving both customer satisfaction and improved margins.  And we\u2019ll keep investing deeply in operations technology.  There\u2019s a lot more good stuff to come on that that we\u2019ll be sharing with you.  So there\u2019s still more to come, and I think we feel pretty good on the business overall.","Operator","That concludes our Q&A session for today.  Now I will turn the program back over to Mr. Dolny.  Please go ahead sir.  ","Andy Dolny","I\u2019m going to turn it over to Scott.","Scott Davis ","I think we got off to a good start in 2013, but as you probably detected from a lot of our answers, we\u2019re still constructively dissatisfied.  We want to do better, and we expect to do better as we go forward.  But since this is Dan\u2019s last call, I\u2019m going to let Dan Brutto have the last word today.  Dan?","Daniel Brutto","Thanks, Scott.  It\u2019s been a great 38 years with UPS, starting in Chicago in 1975 when we were essentially just a ground delivery company.  And what a journey it\u2019s been to now be an international company serving 220 countries and territories with air products, freight boarding products, distribution products, brokerage products.  So it\u2019s been an outstanding run.  The foundation of UPS is solid, we have a great management team, and I\u2019m very confident Jim Barber and our international team will lead us on to more growth and certainly better opportunities with our great customer base.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise, and after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. Please note, we will only take one question from each participant to accommodate more analysts during the call. Thank you for your cooperation.","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to our host, Mr. Andy Dolny, UPS Treasurer and Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.","Andy Dolny","Good morning and welcome to UPS fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Scott Davis, our CEO, and Kurt Kuehn, our CFO. Along with Chief Operating Officer, David Abney, International President, Jim Barber, President of U.S. Operations, Myron Gray and UPS Chief Sales and Marketing Officer, Alan Gershenhorn.","Before we begin, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we will make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the Company.","These anticipated results are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2012 Form 10-K and 2013 10-Q reports. These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Although there were no adjustments to fourth quarter 2013 results, there was a mark-to-market pension adjustment that reduced fourth quarter 2012 diluted earnings per share by $3.15. As a result, in our remarks today all quarterly and full year comments and comparisons will refer to adjusted results. In addition, we will discuss UPS' free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure.","The webcast of today's call along with the reconciliation of free cash flow and adjusted results are available on the UPS Investor Relations website. Finally, please ask only one question so that we may allow as many as possible to participate on today's call.","Thanks for your cooperation. Now, I will turn it over to Scott.","Scott Davis","Thanks and good morning. I would like to start my comments today by saying UPS fourth quarter results fell far short of our expectations. However, I do want to reinforce that the core business strategies of UPS remain sound and appropriate for the future.","Given the compressed calendar between Thanksgiving and Christmas, UPS knew this holiday season will be one of the most challenging ever. Shipments produced by e-commerce significantly exceeded even our most optimistic forecasts as more and more Americans shopped online. In addition, we experienced a much later peak day than expected as purchasing decisions by consumers shifted closer to Christmas.","The surge in volume and inclement weather strained our network causing delays. We took extraordinary measures and deployed additional people and equipment, placing a greater emphasis on service and cost, yet we did not meet the service standards the UPS historically does at Christmas. Moving forward, UPS will make the necessary investments and operational improvements to ensure we effectively manage peak demand in the future.","Looking at U.S. Domestic fourth quarter results, clearly, we are not satisfied. At UPS, we conduct a thorough review of peak performance following Christmas, and this year I can assure you we would identify a number of areas to improve and in a moment David Abney will take you through them.","Turning to the International segment, UPS experienced operating margin expansion on strong growth in export volume. In Supply Chain and Freight, challenges in forwarding negatively impacted results. Reflecting back on 2013, let's start on the economic front. U.S. business activity was constrained by political uncertainty in Washington.","Now, on a positive note, Europe began to emerge from recession. Also, cross border trade improved in 2012, express shipments out of Asia remains sluggish. Looking specifically at our business, two themes were prevalent in the marketplace. First, e-commerce continues to evolve at a rapid pace, not only here in the United States, but around the world.","Second, customers put greater emphasis on cost rather than time in transit. UPS has and will continue to adapt our business model and service portfolio to meet their needs. Throughout the first three quarters, UPS adjusted to these market dynamics. We managed our network efficiently, produced an operating profit growth and margin expansion. Clearly, in the fourth quarter, we did not anticipate the magnitude of volume growth and results suffered.","Looking at 2014, economists around the world are forecasting a slightly brighter outlook. In the U.S., projections call for a stronger GDP, up 2.7%. While in the Eurozone, GDP is expected to grow 1.2% off a relatively flat growth year in 2013. The outlook for Asia calls for continued solid growth with China standing in line with last year about 7.5%. More importantly, global exports are projected to slightly outpace global GDP.","Another prospect for economic development is the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement passed just last month. To expedite the movement of goods globally by decreasing red tape and promoting more efficient supply chains. While areas remain where additional progress is necessary, this agreement is proof that debate and compromise can produce tangible results. History has shown that economic development benefits from free trade and more should be done to encourage it.","As I stated at the opening, I am confident in our core business strategies. In the area of operations technology, UPS is ramping up hub modernization efforts. We are seeing the benefits from telematics and route optimization and as a resulted the company is expediting the rollout of Orion. These investments will help UPS become more efficient and responsive to customer needs.","In addition we are accelerating how UPS data can be used to improve our application of analytics across the network. These models not only of application within our operations but also across our entire business. Serving end consumers around the world, B2C is a critical part of both our heritage and our future and by far the most rapidly changing. We have lead the industry with innovations such as UPS my choice, UPS Access Points and Omnichannel solutions. While we have accomplished a lot, there is still much more to do.","Regarding industry specific solutions, we have enhanced our healthcare capabilities such as the introduction of UPS Temperature True Saver and UPS Proactive Response. In addition, we will add to our already 6.4 million square feet of healthcare distribution space with several openings planned worldwide in 2014. In the emerging markets, in order to focus on the potential of India, the Middle East and Africa, we structurally separated those markets from Europe in 2013 and established a dedicated team to focus on growth. Expect to see increased investment by UPS in the next year.","Before turn it over to David, I would like to thank UPS-ers around the world for their exceptional efforts under some fairly difficult peak season conditions. The lessons learned from peak will enable UPS to improve the customer experience, network efficiency and capacity management. We recognize and hold in highest regard the vital role we play in linking 1.1 million shippers to their 8 million customers every day.","Now I will turn it over to David.","David Abney","Thanks. As Scott mentioned, UPS has been working around the clock to determine how to improve peak operations and service performance, ensuring we do not have a repeat of 2013. I am leading a team of senior UPS executives with deep experience in all areas of the business. We have identified areas for improvement and will make the necessary adjustments to our operating plans. This is the first step in an ongoing process.","Let me begin by providing insight into the major issues that impacted our operations which can be categorized into three main areas. First, e-commerce shipments far exceed peak projections starting with a strong cyber week. Typically volume slows the following week but this year it continued to rise. In fact on eight days during December U.S. delivery volume exceeded our previous company high which was set in 2012. Additionally delivery volume per day during peak was up more than 14% a growth rate almost twice what we planned. Second, last-minute promotions by online retailers drove extraordinary volume growth leading up to Christmas. This helped create the latest peak day ever for UPS, six days after it was expected.","Another indication of the growing acceptance of e-commerce, there were more than 70 online retailers promoting guaranteed next-day delivery on purchases made as late as 11 PM on December 23rd. Finally, weather events throughout the country, especially in the Southwest further contributed to network disruptions.","Operations in Texas and Oklahoma were shut down for three-and-a-half days following the ice storms there. Stranded volume became a priority and UPS responded, deploying over 1,000 team members to the area. Ultimately, we had our planned that was based on a very optimistic level of e-commerce shipment growth, but actual results came in significantly higher.","When the network is stressed to those levels it becomes vulnerable, add to the wave of last-minute online orders, along with significant weather disruptions and processes starting to break down and errors occur. Unfortunately, that's exactly what happened.","Now, let me share how we would prevent this from happening again. We have identified four key areas that UPS must address before peak season next year. First, UPS volume forecasting methods were challenged. The paradigms for planning no longer apply due to the rapidly evolving marketplace.","The first step, we will begin with increased collaboration with high impact customers to further develop predictive models that incorporate changing consumer behavior and sales promotions. With a better understanding of the impact, these customers we have on our network, UPS will be prepared to make the necessary adjustments.","That brings me to the second issue we need to address. UPS network capacity. We are in the process of identifying ways to enhance the throughput of our network. We will make appropriate investments such as facility expansions, process automation, job simplification and the acceleration of the technology implementations.","For example, we plan to expedite the progress of updating our legacy buildings with automation to streamline the thought process. This multiyear undertaking will pay dividends for years to come. In addition, to improve the efficiency of our delivery network, we are expediting the rollout of ORION. This technology has improved UPS routing efficiency.","As a result, we are accelerating the rollout and we plan to have 45% of the driver rout using the technology by the end of 2014. To do this, we are adding approximately 200 additional dedicated resources to the ORION team, bringing the team headcount to almost 700.","One final element of capacity management is to better manage the impacts certain customers have on our network during peak. The goal is to ensure we can meet both, customer expectations and our financial objectives.","A third area for improvement is timely and accurate visibility of shipments. As more customers work with UPS to optimize their supply chains, a growing number of trailers were dropped at our facilities with limited visibility to their contents.","We will collaborate with customers to obtain package visibility on all trailers before arrival. This will improve UPS tracking and exception reporting and is critical to provide accurate visibility to our customers. Lastly, improved communication with our shippers and receivers is needed.","UPS must enhance our processes and standards necessary to ensure timely and accurate communication, especially during periods of peak demand and network disruptions. Along with improve visibility for our customers, new package exception codes will be rolled out to improve tracking messages ultimately providing more clarity on shipment progress. In addition proactive notifications will make it possible for our customers to adjust their plans. So clearly our entire team is intensely focused on using the learnings from this peak season to ensure we are prepared for 2014. We have recognize that the UPS brand is a valuable asset to be protected. The steps I just mentioned will allow UPS to build upon our reputation for reliability and service quality.","Now Kurt will take you through the details of the quarter and guidance for 2014.","Kurt Kuehn","Thanks, David. As already noted, fourth quarter results fell short of UPS expectations. For the first time in years, UPS did not achieve the typical benefits that we have seen from operational efficiency. As evidenced, compensation and benefit expense increased 7.5% on a daily package volume growth of 6%. Also additional costs were incurred to react to the unprecedented level of volume growth as we attempted to meet service commitments.","Now I want to review the business segment results for the quarter. In the U.S. domestic, the challenges that David reviewed were detrimental to the segment's financial results. Operating profit declined $178 million and margin contracted to 12.9%. The U.S. incurred unplanned expense this quarter to handle the volume surge. This included hiring and training costs, overtime hours and additional weekend operations. Thousands of extra ad hoc trailer moves drove purchase transportation costs up. In addition with 85,000 seasonal employees, UPS productivity declined driving of 6.2% increase in direct labor hours. Clearly, we didn't operate as smoothly as we normally do.","The estimated impact of the peak season efforts increased operating costs by $125 million to $150 million. Also revenue was lowered by approximately $50 million in service refunds for missed delivery commitments. UPS did experience strong daily volume growth of 5.6% led by our deferred and ground products. Revenue per piece declined 1.3% as base rate improvements were more than offset by lower fuel surcharges, a 34% growth in UPS SurePost and the service refunds that we mentioned. During the period, the benefits of our route optimization efforts, though, were obvious as miles driven increased a little more than 2% compared to the daily volume growth of 5.6%.","Looking now at international results. The segment demonstrated continued momentum during the quarter with revenue gains of 5.3% driven by 8.8% package volume growth. Operating profits rose 7.6% to $537 million and operating margin expanded 30 basis points to $15.9 million. Operating profit growth would have been up over 12% when excluding negative currency comparisons. Export daily volume jumped 9.5%, the largest year-over-year gain we have seen in some time. UPS experienced robust demand in Europe, driven by e-commerce, capitalizing on the capabilities of our recently expanded hub in Cologne. In addition, transborder daily volume increased over 18% during peak. Non-U.S. domestic volume increased 8.2% with Poland, Italy and Canada leading the way.","Now turning the supply chain and freight. Total segment revenue declined by 5.8% directly related to our freight forwarding business unit. Operating profit was flat overall at $171 million as improvements in distribution were offset by declines in forwarding and UPS freight. Operating margin overall expanded 30 basis points to 7.4%. UPS freight forwarding revenue declined as international air freight experienced decreases in both tonnage and revenue per case. On a positive note, our brokerage in ocean and forwarding groups both demonstrated good growth and improved profitability.","In distribution, mid-single-digit revenue growth resulted from improvements in healthcare, retail and UPS mail services. Operating margin expanded slightly as the business unit continues to absorb cost for technology and healthcare facility expansions. ","UPS Freight, LTL revenue increased 2.3% as a result of increased LTL tonnage and pricing improvements. Revenue per hundredweight increased by 1.6% this quarter as pricing remained stable.","Now, for an update on our cash flow for the year. UPS generated $5.3 billion in free cash flow during 2013, converting over 120% of net income to cash. This was after making capital expenditures of approximately $2.1 billion. Also during the year, the company distributed over $6 billion to shareowners, including dividends of $2.3 billion and share repurchases of approximately $3.8 billion.","Looking now at 2014, UPS expects to make share repurchases of $2.7 billion. This will result in over 2% net reduction in outstanding shares and reflects the company's long-term philosophy of returns to shareowners. Capital expenditures are expected increase to $2.5 billion.","Our allocation of investments will be meaningfully different this year, with much less devoted aircraft. This will be offset though by additions to vehicles and operating technology as well as over $500 million of increased investments in capacity expansion and hub modernization.","The combination of a slightly improved economic environment and our execution of UPS core business strategies gives us confidence in our 2014 guidance of earnings per share growth of 11% to 16%. We expect the tax rate of 36% in 2014, higher than reported in the first half of last year.","Regarding guidance for the segments, U.S. Domestic average daily volume is expected to grow between 3% and 4%, moderately above 2014 GDP estimates. Revenue should improve at a slightly faster pace than volume. Increases in base rate rises will remain steady between 2% and 3%. However, they will continue to be masked by customer preference for non-premium products, including continued growth in UPS SurePost.","Operating margin is expected to be around 14%. Due to higher discount rates, total pension expense will be reduced by approximately $180 million. The majority of this will be reflected in the domestic segment. However, the savings for this segment will be offset by higher healthcare costs. In addition, implementing the network improvements that David described will increase cost by well over $100 million, while providing payback for years to come.","We expect the positive momentum in the International segment to continue in 2014, with export average daily volume growth between 4% and 6%. Revenue is expected to improve at a slightly slower pace than volume as non-premium export products continue to outpace premium. Operating profit is forecast to grow between 12% and 14%.","For the Supply Chain and Freight segment, UPS expects mid single-digit annual revenue growth. Operating profits are expected to grow at a low-teen rate with margin expanding to approximately 8%. In the first quarter though, revenue and profit growth will be relatively flat to last year, due to the challenges in our international airfreight. As we look at the first quarter overall, earnings per share growth will be slightly below 10%, due to the higher tax rate and the continued headwind and supply chain and freight.","In summary, the outlook for 2014 at UPS is positive as improving global economic conditions and the explosive growth of e-commerce provide optimism at UPS. We are going to take the challenges that we faced in the fourth quarter to serve as a springboard to improve our service levels and our productivity going forward. As a result, UPS expects earnings per share to grow within a range of $5.05 to $5.30.","With that, operator, please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Ben Hartford of Baird. Please go ahead.","Ben Hartford - Baird","Scott, I wonder if you can just continue down the path on guidance. Obviously when results were previewed earlier this month, you were looking for 10% to 15% earnings growth. I acknowledge it was a preliminary number. Now the range has taken up slightly, but the buyback is being reduced. You are making infrastructure related investments, which I think are appropriate, but when we do think about, it looks like the core assumption is greater than expected. Can you talk about some of the drivers there? It sounds like the cadence is for accelerating improvement through the year, but you can talk about the decision to take the full year guidance up, even with the buyback that is coming down slightly for 2014?","Kurt Kuehn","Yes, as we dug through took a little closer look at the momentum of the business units, sharpened our focus on the investments we were going to make and took a hard look at that, it looks like a very competent range that we have got. I will make one comment, though, and that is that the buyback is in line with what we been communicating. Clearly 2013 was a catch-up year because we had the held back in 2012 on repurchases but that 2.7% gets us right in the line with the $8 billion or so that we had committed to three years ago. So at least for the numbers we have provided and I think the communication that buyback is right in line.","Scott Davis","Ben, I would add also that, the thing we feel good about, 2014, is we see strength in all three segments. It has really been since 2010 that we saw balanced growth at all three segments. We have had some weakness in cross border trade in 2011 and 2012. We see that improving in '14. Supply Chain & Freight is going to show good growth in domestic. It has performed quite well for the last several years, with the exception of fourth quarter '13.","Ben Hartford - Baird","That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tom Wadewitz - JPMorgan","Good morning. So I understand, obviously it's a little bit disappointing in terms of just that there is some of the operational issues but it is the high cost problem to have that much volume coming in and I suppose you could say, maybe there is a silver lining in terms of highlighting the customers that there are constraints on the network and perhaps the value of your network. So I guess what I want to ask you is, do you think this provides an opportunity to guys get more value from the customers in terms of pricing? And if so, what type of timeframe would it take to see that come in?","Kurt Kuehn","Well, Tom, I think David did a pretty good job of walk through how we are going to approach next peak, but clearly as a team we are going to evaluate many options to make sure we don't ever repeat the 2013 peak. Now I would say it is safe to say that we are going to evaluate every alternative out there. We haven't made all the final decisions as of this point in time that we know we need to manage the impact customers have on us during the peak. But the overall objective for us, we have to meet customer expectations and we have to meet our financial objectives. So over the next few months we will make more decisions in this area.","Scott Davis","And clearly, Tom, the top priority is adding capacity and investing in this growth business. So we are happy to do that.","Tom Wadewitz - JPMorgan","And is there any impact on the pricing dynamic? I am really to ask about pricing and whether it is in your positive effect on pricing from what happened?","Scott Davis","Well, that is something we are evaluate as we are really early on this process. David is leading this committee to evaluate next peak. Every thing is on the table and that will be one of the things that will be on the table to look at.","Tom Wadewitz - JPMorgan","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays","Hi, good morning, everyone. I want to talk about what was that, seems to be a pretty good outcome in your international segment and if I look at your guidance, I actually think you are guiding to up the margins for international. So can you talk about how the mix has changed on the export front and within the continent in Europe and what you are doing to drive those better profit outcomes or at least expectations for better profit outcomes in 2014?","David Abney","Yes, clearly as we have been saying over the last couple quarters, we are improving momentum. Each quarter has gotten stronger and stronger. As we get past the currency headwinds we are looking for great things to come out of the international segment. So I will have Jim Barber fill you a little more on Europe and what's going on there.","Jim Barber","Okay. So, Brandon, I think the core underlying response has to be that that network in Europe for us continues to perform very, very nicely. You heard in some of the opening comments, the expansion of Cologne. We could see the benefits of that through peak season. We have also continued to enhance the ground network and quite frankly put some new solutions in the market for some of our global customers that are really driving the growth today. That's a lot of what underpins some of the growth you see today and then we will valuate going forward what's next. But effectively, that network in Europe continues to mature and pay long-term benefits for all investment over the years. So we absolutely see that continuing and you can see in some of the countries where the investments we make some two, three years ago continue to pay off today. So we are very bullish on that.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead.","David Vernon - Bernstein","Good morning, guys. Kurt, when you mentioned the guidance for domestic, you talked about $100 million of extra cost. I am assuming that's OpEx. Could you talk a little bit about the nature of that and whether that's going to be kind of a one-time addition for the year as you are rolling out ORION, and it may come back a little bit or if it's going to be just an added level of spend within the operation to keep the network little more resilient.","Kurt Kuehn","Certainly the lion share in 2014 will be operating expense that's involved in the rapid expansion and one-time costs, so we don't see this as a major structural cost addition, but clearly there are some things we are going to do teeing up the teams, having 700 people deploying ORION and other things are going to accelerate both, cost but should provide great benefits in the years to come.","Maybe I could have Myron talk a little bit about ORION and why we are doubling our bets on the pace of rollout on that.","Myron Gray","Good morning, David. As you heard David Abney alluded to earlier, we actually saw a great benefit from ORION at peak season. While ORION grew almost 6%, our miles driven were down to 2%, so we are going to ramp up our ORION team and move the total number of drivers deployed from just over 10% to up to 45% for this year.","Along with that, David also alluded to the hub modernization project, which actually kicks off this coming Friday in North California, so we are looking forward to this investment yielding dividends for years to come.","David Vernon - Bernstein","Excellent. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Good morning. Scott, I guess, I want to come back to Tom's question on the pricing. I guess, when you talk before about better managing certain customer impact on the network, just given that you have kind of kept stressing the financial objectives, if we are going to see e-commerce continue to push that peak season later and later and obviously December 23rd, it sounds like that's about as latest you can physically get with your physical network. It is the [answer] have to be that you raise pricing incrementally until that peak day to alter customer behavior to move it earlier in this season or is there something else you can do. I guess, I just want to understand, does it have to be price or are there other things you can do to handle that level of an increase the last minute.","Scott Davis","Clearly, Ken, it doesn't have to be price, so we are going to look at all the alternatives. Obviously, we are trying to move shipments forward doing earlier pickups. It is something that will help us. We as you would expect spend a lot time with customers, and since the peak season working with them. The Omnichannel is becoming more prevalent every day. I work of several brick-and-mortar people who were evaluated next year perhaps that are having their big sale the 23rd on the website. People will do it in the store that will allow people to go in the store and pick it up, so in other words you get 50% off in store 40% off on the website. There is a variety of alternatives out there that could change it.","We know that there is still going to be an issue. I mean, every year there is going to be e-commerce is bigger at Christmas, so we have got to adapt our systems, so I think it's all the above. Alan, you may want to add some?","Alan Gershenhorn","Yes. I would just say that there is tremendous amount of planning that goes on between us and certainly our largest customers, but we are going to need to take that to a whole new level to ensure that we are keeping our promises and they are able to keep theirs, so I think [heard] from David earlier and what our customers are looking for right now is commitment and insurance that we will take the necessary actions to make sure this won't happen again and that's really where our focus is right now and you heard some of the things that David was talking about in terms of capacity management, visibility and investing in the business to make sure that we are going to handle the business. Again, part of that is better communication with our customers, so that we are very well aligned in terms of being able to make the service that their customers expect.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Kurt, can I ask you for a little bit more color on how to think about the impacts in the fourth quarter from each one of these items, so when we think about the challenges from the peak and the resources you had to deploy last-minute and the weather, if you try to tease it out, what do you think the right level of earnings would have been. Would it have been the original guidance, or is the mix you are sort of going to repeat? Because, I am not sure how to think about what core earnings - like things got better, but maybe the cost have to repeat in ways in the fourth quarter that we need to keep in mind as we model going forward. So any color around kind of how to think about those buckets would be helpful.","Kurt Kuehn","Bill, certainly, it's something we have looked at very closely and you know we did have a significant amount of excess cost somewhere between $125 million and $150 million. Plus, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, about another $50 million of service refunds that lowered revenue. So we certainly would have been within our guidance without those conditions. When the network gets stressed and there is that much of an increase after years of fairly modest growth, clearly some weak areas showed up and that did snowball for us. So clearly, the fourth quarter was a tough one for us. If you look at the October, November, October was pretty much on target. We did see November a little below our plans but I think that that's primarily the issue of the later Thanksgiving and the fact that the holidays started later. In fact, if you recall I even mentioned in our last quarterly call about both the risks and the opportunities of a compressed peak season and for better or worse we ended up seeing opportunity with tremendous compression of demand but the risk of operations, especially with some of the incredible ice storms in the Southwest that was really the worst area for us. So we are putting this one in the history books. I think you heard David give a sense of our absolute determination to learn from this and to create flexibility and capacity. We are substantially increasing our investments in our facility modifications. Myron mentioned hub modernization. That's something we are very excited about. The technology has come long ways and we can, we think, very effectively retrofit a number of our buildings. In fact, maybe I could have David talk just a little bit about the technology and why we are feeling like this is a great time to invest in it.","David Abney","Yes. This technology is something we have been utilizing. The difference now is that the capacity, so the speed of the technology and the footprint is such that it will now fit into our existing footprint. So real excited about that. Myron mentioned the first one in North Bay in California but there will be others that will be progressing right behind that one. But you know, there's other things we are doing to increase capacity too. We are automating more of the small sorts and increasing input capacity in some of our main transit hubs and we are doing facility expansions on some that we already have the books. We are just speeding up and a lot of job simplification where we can do next generation small shorthauls where it takes some of the intellectual capital out and it allows us to make changes more as this peak when we had some of those most fluctuations and changes we had to make.","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Christian Wetherbee of Citi. Please go ahead.","Christian Wetherbee - Citi","Hi, thanks. Good morning. Just on the back of the last question, just trying to think about the core operating of the business or co-operations and profitability of the business. Post what we saw in the fourth quarter of last year, does the dynamic of profitability would indeed see some sort of change at all when you think about what ultimately the volume potential of this segment of your business could be? Does that skew things, either more positively or negatively when you look at it? It would seem, based on the guidance, where all the puts and takes that maybe there is an assumption of slightly less profitability in B2C but just want to make sure I understand.","Scott Davis","Yes, I think generally we feel good about the direction of B2C. You have seen the progress UPS has made over the last two or three years in improving the margins in the B2C business. We are going to use this technology to help create density in the area of B2C. So I think this is an outlier for what you saw in December of this year. Again we have been through over 100 successful peaks and this is an outlier. You will not see another one of these hopefully for the next 100 years at UPS. We have a lot of intensity there. But I feel good about the direction of B2C and what we are doing with technology to improve the profitability there.","Kurt Kuehn","Yes, and certainly its not only about B2C. We are investing and creating a wide array of capabilities for healthcare, for technology, you name it and a lot of the investments we have made create flexible network are paying dividends there. So as always, we have got a great array of different customers and the B2C clearly was a challenge in December but we feel pretty good going forward that the mix of business will be profitable.","Christian Wetherbee - Citi","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Justin Yagerman - Deutsche Bank","Good morning, guys. I am just trying to walk through the cadence of how things have transpired over the last couple of quarters and now making sense at where we are, so I mean back half of last year was clearly a story of profitability being masked by pension and currency.","It sounded like when you were giving your guidance that healthcare slipped in there as a problem. I know that you guys took steps to kind of mitigate some of that increased inflation that you were expecting in the back half of last year, so I would be curious how that's playing in. Obviously this difficult peak also played in, so I guess I am trying to get a sense of what you think underlying growth looks like for '14 when you strip some of that stuff out.","Are you just being conservative in terms of the underlying growth of the overall business? Because it puts you well below kind of run rate when I do all those puts and takes. Then when I think about the decisions that you made last peak and how those inform earnings growth this year, so it feels like to have another year where you choose servicing the customer over profitability in terms of capping volumes to make sure that as shareholders get the growth that they need as well, so I am just trying to understand.","I mean, maybe '15 or you guys are good at what you do, you are able to translate that into very profitable growth and I think that's what a few of the questions before were trying to get at, but it doesn't sound like you are confident in that for '14, so I know there is a lot of there. I am just trying to get a better sense of how you feel about the cadence of the next kind of 24 months here.","Scott Davis","Great. You have given me a wide array of choices to pick which question I am going to answer, Justin. I think, we are seeing '14 as a year in which we are going to absolutely address the issues that popped up in the fourth quarter, so that is job one. There is no question.","We are going to spend extra money operationally. We are going to accelerate investments and we are little cautious about exactly how the next peak turns out. It is another compressed holiday season although we get one extra day.","On the other hand, we are not in any way anticipating or forecasting in a major problem, so is the balance right now more on reinvestment and refinement of the network? Absolutely. Hopefully, all of this will come together and we will have great results going forward, but we are happy to reinvest right now and accelerate some things that have been on the drawing board. As a result, yes, 2014 is a little muted in the domestic side anyway compared to where it might have been, but will be a passing phase.","Kurt Kuehn","Yes. As that reflect back on the 2012 or 2013, frankly that the primary headwind excluding pension expense and currency was international air freight. We had some challenges, cross-border trade grew less than GDP last year, little bit better in 2013. Forwarding side, international freight forwarding was weak due to too much capacity. We try to see those things level out in '14, so I feel pretty good.","As I said earlier I feel good about the balance. That we see a good domestic, we see good international package and we see good supply chain and freight performance in 2014. 11% to 16%, again, is back up in our long-term target area where it should be the margins of kind of what we told you a couple years ago in our long-term targets, but we have room for improvement. Unfortunately, we can't keep all the pension benefit this year because of healthcare cost.","David Abney","Just one thing I want to react to, Justin, and this is David Abney, but I don't want to speak from the cross functional theme and we are still early in the process, where we have made a lot of progress in identifying all of the contributing factors and we are also are much further along than I thought in putting the answers together, what we need to do to ensure the 2014 is not going to be a repeat of 2013, so I thought I heard just a little indecision that in your voice about how we would do for 2014.","We believe, we don't believe. We are very confident that we have a plan put in place that's going to take care of the volume on 2014. We are not hoping that maybe it comes indifferent, but it's not only about capacity it's about increasing our forecasting methods with our customers. It's about improving visibility and it's about the communications back and forth with our customers, so the overall plan and as Kurt said earlier, there will be some operating costs into this year but it's going to pay dividends in years to come and when you increase the funnel, you increase the capacity then that takes care of a lot of challenges that could come in the future.","Justin Yagerman - Deutsche Bank","All right. Thanks a lot. I appreciate the answers, Kurt.","Operator","Our next question will be from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","Hi, thanks. Good morning, guys. So I wanted to ask about the buyback expectations. I know it's in line with what you guys have been talking about and it looks like you are using about 100% of the free cash flow for buyback and dividend but I guess I am just wondering why you don't feel comfortable being more aggressive in sort of ease into that $6 billion plus of cash. I guess, there is something you are saving that for? So Scott, are you any more and less hopeful about finding a better place for that cash this year?","Scott Davis","So Scott, I do think that we have been consistent with our distribution policy and again we are going to have big shareholder distribution in 2014, as you said over 100% of net income, is the plan. But we still do see opportunities to reinvest in the business. As I talked about earlier, there's lot of opportunities for us in the healthcare arena, in emerging markets as we go forward, in the B2C area. So I think there will be a mixture of acquisitions as we move forward.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Kevin Sterling of BB&T Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Kevin Sterling - BB&T Capital Markets","Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen, and I hope you survive in the deep freeze of Atlanta.","Scott Davis","I have, as a matter of fact, a story to tell you. I slept in the floor of a hotel lobby the night before last. Pretty glamorous being a CEO.","Kevin Sterling - BB&T Capital Markets","Kurt, I think as you talk about some of your network enhancements for this year to deal with the growth of e-commerce, it sounds like a lot of infrastructure enhancements. So I think you indicated you guys weren't really going to invest in your aircraft fleet. So does that mean, as we get into the peak season, you will continue and maybe rely more on outsourced providers of aircraft during the holiday season? Am I thinking about that right?","Kurt Kuehn","Well, it will be a slight increase but we did take a number of 767s this year completing our multiyear purchase. So we are in great shape as far as air capacity. We always have to rely on third-party to top off the excess demand during peak. So that won't be dramatically different, but no, we are in great shape. We have got, by far, the youngest fleet in the industry. We will, at least for the immediate, the next several years, don't anticipate needs for any aircraft purchases. So that's part of why we are in such good shape cash wise and are happy to now begin to reinvest in some of this hub modernization and automation.","Scott Davis","And they are all saying, you don't build a church for Easter. It's a little bit way it is for airplanes for December 23. You really can't buy an airplane just for one day. We will manageable this properly. We lease aircraft where necessary and we will make sure we have proper capacity.","David Abney","With those eight additional 767s, the number of leased aircraft was not a primary factor at WorldPort. It was much more about unload doors for trailers that were coming in and that is something that we can certainly correct.","Kevin Sterling - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay, great. Thanks for your time this morning. Scott, I hope you get to sleep again in bed tonight.","Scott Davis","You got it. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Nate Brochmann of William Blair & Company. Please go ahead.","Nate Brochmann - William Blair & Company","Good morning, everyone. Hi, Scott, by the way, we really appreciate the dedication. I am pretty sure of their value by sleeping on the floor so that's got to drop right through the bottomline.","Scott Davis","I think it was a good deal. Yes.","Nate Brochmann - William Blair & Company","We are spending a lot of time, obviously talking about the domestic challenges and a little bit of time in terms of a lot of the opportunities in Europe. Obviously, some of that network adjustments seem to keep going on in terms of Asia to U.S. Could you guys feel that you are well balanced there and as we get maybe a little bit of a slowdown in the emerging markets that everybody is worried about recently? Does that impact your vision on global trade and how you allocate your resources or where the growth comes from?","Scott Davis","Jim why don't you go ahead and talk a little bit about the areas outside of Europe.","Jim Barber","Sure, so I guess, and the last question we talked about the network and this question, they are very linked responses. First of all, we like our assets that are out there but when you get back to some of the opening comments about Bali, what's going on now and where these trade agreements are going to us, one of obligation, just to be able to take a look at these networks. I am really specifically talking about Asia now in the Americas. To align those to where the puck is going, so it doesn't necessarily mean new asset, but it might mean redeploying them in different ways based upon what the consumers are telling us and our customers from across the globe, so we are in the middle of that piece of work right now. We are very happy with our networks and the way they are performing. You can see that in some of the results, but we also think we have to keep one step ahead based on where these trade agreements are going and some of the decision these countries will make in the next couple years.","I think that the fact that as you look at 2014, solid growth is projected for the developing world, developed world I should say, so the United States and Europe, and I think that also bodes well for UPS.","Looking at almost 8% to 10% increase is consensus for the U.S. this year and the global economy the same, so I think as you get into more stable I just wouldn't call it robust economy, but a more stable economy. See in Europe and U.S. strengthens is going to help us a lot. (Inaudible), so we are going to continue to invest in emerging markets, big part of our future, but for the short to medium-term developed world going - good for us.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Helane Becker of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Company","Thanks very much. Hi, guys. Thank you very much for the time. Most of my questions have been answered more than once, so thank you very much. I just had one thing I wanted to understand. When you talk about having to hire people kind of at the last instance, I am not sure I understand the timing of that. When do you bring on those additional people to handle the extra volume.","I mean, I sort of think that those 1,000 or so people you move to the Southwest, coming from other parts of the company, but as you got closer to the peak, how do you really get those people from or how does that work, so could you just explain that one for me?","Scott Davis","Certainly, hiring that number of people in the span of a month-and-a-half or so is a big challenge, especially when we have to react late, but Myron can talk a little bit about the joys and challenges of bringing on such a large workforce.","Myron Gray","Helane, it's like a delicate ballet. We are constantly assessing where the volume is and bringing all resources to meet those challenges. As has been talked about many times, we actually added 30,000 people above where we planned.","Let me also allude to the fact that we believe that our operating strategy is sound, and remind you that through the first three quarters of last year, we were able to balance average daily volume with ours and have the appropriate spread, so we are bringing on these people as needed and it's a challenge because you had a 16% increase in our peak day over last year, but we believe that those are good peak season jobs. We got all the required people in place on time, but were [by] a significant storm that we saw, not only in the Southwest, but the Midwest and Northeast, so I think we are in good shape.","Kurt Kuehn","Helane, on the economic impact of that, there is a point of diminishing returns and trying to bring that many people on and have them be productive quickly clearly was one of the drags in the quarter, especially when we had to get so much more because of the volume increase, but those are great jobs. Many of us started as the company as Christmas hires myself included.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Company","Me too. Although I am not with you anymore I could do that in college.","Kurt Kuehn","Great. Hopefully, we worked too hard.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Company","Yes. I would say so.","Kurt Kuehn","Okay.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Company","Thank you.","Kurt Kuehn","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of David Ross with Stifel. Please go ahead.","David Ross - Stifel","Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. Why don't you just a little bit rising healthcare costs. You mentioned, they are going to eat up most of the pension benefit expected for 2014. I wanted to see if that $100 million rough increase in healthcare cost is expected every year through the new union labor agreement or if it's one-time for some reason. It can't be all due to any back problems comes with sitting on the floor.","Scott Davis","That's not work-related any way. No. The biggest impact is and we have talked about this than in prior calls that certainly the rollout of some of the additional parts of the Affordable Care Act is adding over $100 million for us, so that's the biggest one-time issue. Of course, healthcare inflation is an issue that is certainly a concern for many of us. So that's been an area also that's been discussed and are in our discussions with our employees but the biggest impact is some one-time additional expenses with the added cost per head and some of those things that's driving up costs for a employee intensive company like UPS.","Scott Davis","In this year, we saw more, in 2014 more of it, because of things like the reinsurance fee per employee that you didn't see last year. So I think it is going to be quite as dramatic as you move forward.","David Ross - Stifel","Okay, so one time step up in cost but not just one time cost that is going to go away next year.","Scott Davis","One time step up in cost. Right.","David Ross - Stifel","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Thomas Kim of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs","Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to ask you with regard to your net exposure to foreign currencies and if you could share a little bit about the UPS sensitivity to a potential 10% change in some of those currencies? Thanks.","Kurt Kuehn","Yes, we are actually pretty well hedged for 2014. So for the major currencies of the Euro, the Pound, the Canadian Dollar, we have got spreads in place pretty well with the floor not to far off where the markets are today and some upward potential. So that is a different story than last year. One area that presents some challenges though is some of these emerging market currencies are showing quite a bit of volatility. So that is a little bit of a risk to us but it is likely to be offset by the benefit in the developed markets that we are seeing.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer","Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to clarify what's implied in guidance specific to the U.S. domestic, you mentioned $125 million to $150 million added cost that is a weather, incremental hires, seasonal hires mix and the $50 million of service refunds and then I think you just answered, the $100 million is above that. So is what's implied in your guidance that you are going to have about the same seasonal staffing next year and just if we can hone in a little bit more on that, please? Thanks.","Scott Davis","No, we do not expect to have to hire that many people. I mean a part of that was the catch-up and the challenges of some of the unexpected volume. Looking at the peak for next year, there is one additional day in the period. Christmas as a day later. So the volume that builds up over the weekend in the late surge will be a little smoother. So, hopefully we do hire a lot of employees because of good robust demand but as I said, there is a point of reduced benefit as some of the stresses hit the network that caused us to hire more people than was optimal. So we would expect to have less hiring this year unless there is just incredible growth beyond the current expectations.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer","Thanks. And that increases predominantly, Orion, the $100 million?","Scott Davis","For the added cost for this year, you would see acceleration of Orion. It is some of the operating changes as we are automating buildings. It is a number of things. IT expense will also be involved as we make some investments especially collaborating with customers to get detailed package information even on trailers that haven't reached UPS yet. So it's a laundry list of things that we will be working on to enhance our capabilities and ultimately make us more productive and streamlined.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse","Thanks for taking my question. Based on the acceleration of the Orion rollout, is it fair to assume that you can complete the full implementation to all of the U.S. drivers by the end of 2015? And I was wondering if you could give us some broad parameters for how to think about the cost savings, once the initiative is fully rolled out? For example, you said, each driver was able to drive one less mile per day per year, what would that mean for annual cost savings? Just trying to get some broad strokes on that.","David Abney","Yes, the time line, and there will still be several more years that we will be ramping well through 2016 for the full rollout of Orion. It is a major undertaking. In general, as a ballpark number, saving a mile per day per driver generates about $50 million of reduced operating expense for the company. And as we get a little farther along then we will fill you in more on the very specific experience that we are seeing because we are getting better and better at doing it and the benefits are kicking in quicker. So this is a net investment year, though as we ramp up and next year will also be a year with significant velocity. So it's a little early for us to lock in on any specific external targets, but so far so good on that front.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse","Thanks. Fantastic. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Cleo Zagrean with Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead.","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital","Good morning. Could you please share some insight into freight forwarding? What happened this quarter versus the market and maybe make some of the comparison as to the outlook for '14. Thank you very much.","Scott Davis","Sure. I will have Jim talk about that.","Jim Barber","If you look at forwarding, a couple of quarters ago I talked about concentration in a couple of verticals as well as military. We said, we needed to change that obviously in a business like UPS doesn't change in a dime and so we take a prudent approach to that. We have worked through that in the last couple of quarters.","We feel like the first quarter, as the opening comments alluded to, will be the wraparound for us. Two-fold will be nice growth quarters for us in both, tonnage as well as revenue quality, so we have been working through this. I would say that on the international air freight side, but there's three other pieces to that business that we feel like are performing very nicely. That being the North American forwarding piece, the brokerage piece and our Ocean Freight business and we built for a couple of years, so we feel like we are turning the corner on it along with the small package side and you will see that the as each quarter rolls out in '14.","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital","Any specific guidance in terms of growth versus market? How do you expect your positioning to change compared to last year?","Jim Barber","Well, I would only say, the guidance we have put out is pretty solid and we will stick with that in each quarter. we will kind of update as we go.","Kurt Kuehn","Yes. We are looking for a mid single-digit revenue growth for the segment in aggregate and margins of about 8%, so we have got a lot of good stuff going on, the ocean is performing very well and we are helping customers find that balance of ocean and air forwarding, so that you should see more good stuff coming from that.","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital","Overall, the headwind from industry overcapacity, would you see that easing or how do you see it trend compared to last year.","Jim Barber","Yes. This is Jim. We have to move on. We have others on the line, so we are running out of a little time here, so we will save that for our individual call.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research","Thank you. I got a question on cash deployment. You basically have one times your EBITDA and debt on the books maybe a little less. Historically $6.5 billion is that the right amount of cash for you guys to keep on the books is probably closer to the $2 billion to $3 billion range?","I heard the answer, we are thinking of making some acquisitions, but the number of acquisitions I can think of that require that much cash is a very short list. Why aren't we thinking about continuing to share repurchase or continuing to plough more of this cash back to investors?","Scott Davis","Well, Jeff, we continue to talk about that, and the balance sheet we do show about $5 billion at year-end 2013, so we did deploy quite a bit of cash as we said over $6 billion to shareowner's last year. We will continue to look at that.","Clearly, we are here to do what's right for investors and customers and we will continue to look at that. We are basically fulfilling our commitment of returning at least 100% of net income to shareowners and the discussion of whether to accelerate when to accelerate that, that clearly is something that we talk about frequently, so for now we will keep doing what we said we would do and living up to our commitment, so you guys can anticipate and if there will likely be time to impress, we get even more aggressive.","Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research","Okay. Thank you.","Operator"," I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Dolny.","Andy Dolny","Yes. I will turn it over to Scott for some closing comments.","Scott Davis","Thanks, Andy. Before we go, I want to just take a minute to recognize one of our team members who was participating on our final earnings call. Andy Dolny has announced his retirement after almost 32 years as a dedicated UPS-er. Those of you on the call have come to know him in his investor relations role over the last several years. And as I speak, the rest of our team, in thanking Andy for his wonderful service to our company, he keeps our meetings quite interesting and he always represents the investors' perspective well.","Andy, all of us around this table and obviously UPS will miss you and we thank you for your contribution. By the way, Andy will be in the office for next several weeks. I am sure he will be in touch with most of you before he leaves.","With that, thanks so much for listening to the call today and we will talk to you next quarter."],"21212":["United Parcel Service, Inc.

My name is Steven and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. And after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Scott Childress, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.","Scott Childress","Good morning and welcome to the UPS first quarter 2019 earnings call. Joining me today are David Abney, our CEO; Richard Peretz, our CFO; along with Chief Operating Officer, Jim Barber; Kate Gutmann, our Chief Sales and Solutions Officer; our Chief Information and Engineering Officer, Juan Perez; and Scott Price, our Chief Strategy and Transformation Officer.","Before we begin, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements and address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of our company.","These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2018 Form 10-K and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations Web site and from the SEC.","During the quarter, UPS recorded a pre-tax charge of $123 million or $0.11 per share on an after-tax basis. The charges resulted primarily from transformation-related activities. The webcast of today\u2019s call, along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures, are available on UPS Investor Relations Web site.","Unless stated otherwise, financial performance discussed today will refer to adjusted results. Webcast users can submit live questions during today's call. We will attempt to answer questions of a long-term strategic nature. Callers are asked to submit only one question so that we may allow as many as possible to participate.","Thank you. And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to David.","David Abney","Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will share results from the first quarter and update you on our transformation progress. I\u2019ll also discuss the strength that\u2019s building in our strategic growth imperatives and share our views on the external business environment.","During the first quarter, we executed well on our strategies and are bending the cost curve, creating momentum for future quarters. All business units generated improved revenue quality and successfully executed cost management strategies while building on high levels of service.","As our smart global logistics network becomes even more flexible, I\u2019m pleased to say that we are achieving the efficiency goals we expected by automating more of our network.","As we open new highly automated facilities we remain confident that we will achieve our goal of 30% to 35% efficiency improvement when compared to more traditional buildings. With the progress we have made we are reaffirming adjusted diluted EPS guidance in the range of $7.45 to $7.75 for 2019.","Turning back to our results, we achieved another quarter of consolidated volume growth, generated high quality revenue and expanded network efficiencies for improved financial performance. Supply chain and freight delivered outstanding operating profit highlighting the agility and power of our asset-light business models.","International achieved record first quarter profit and increased volume, currency neutral revenue per piece and operating margins and the U.S. domestic segment generated improved revenue quality and grew average daily volume across all products, led by our air services.","More customers in retail and manufacturing are demanding faster delivery times. Building quality growth from SMB customers is one of our strategic growth imperatives. We continue to see solid yields, led by customers in healthcare and those engaged through our digital marketing programs.","In addition, returns with SMB grew by double digits driven by strong holiday e-commerce returns that lasted into February and March. UPS is the industry leader with innovative return solutions that enable our customers to reduce complexity and deliver a positive customer experience.","Looking forward, our aim with SMB is to anticipate and quickly respond to the changing needs of our customers. Creating solutions that are easier to use, easier to understand and quicker to implement will increase our share of high-quality volume and revenue from this key market.","To that end, we recently introduced UPS e-fulfillment, our new platform that gives more insight and control to SMB shippers selling across multiple marketplaces and Web stores. Our solution allows them to streamline order fulfillment, inventory management and UPS shipping. In the coming months, we plan to launch other new platforms and innovative solutions along the value chain to further grow SMB revenue.","We continue to recalibrate our network to strengthen our market position in the fastest growing economies around the world, which is another of our strategic growth imperatives. We see ongoing growth potential internationally with the middle market outpacing the enterprise segment, especially in B2B.","As the trade environment changes, we regularly identify opportunities to adjust our network for increased efficiency and flexibility. For example, we\u2019ve recently announced the deployment of new aircraft to service major trade routes between Hong Kong and Europe. These larger aircraft enable growth on this important trade lane and unlock greater efficiencies and capacity within our global network.","Serving the needs of the healthcare industry is another important growth strategy for UPS. We are accelerating the launch of the innovative solutions for the most complex and most urgent healthcare needs. We\u2019re particularly excited about our latest announcement.","A few weeks ago, we made history with the first FAA sanctioned use of a drone for revenue flights when UPS and our partner Matternet successfully delivered medical samples across the WakeMed hospital campus in Raleigh, North Carolina.","UPS continues to operate multiple daily drone deliveries at WakeMed eliminating transit delays for time-sensitive medical samples. This solution opens the door for how drones can be used to improve transport services in hospitals and other large campuses around the world.","Turning to the external business environment. Forecast for global growth are not expected to be as strong as 2018. However, the economy is still growing and creating opportunities. We\u2019re seeing continued growth in areas of the world less affected by the trade relationship between the U.S. and China or by the uncertainty surrounding Brexit.","The flexibility of our smart global logistics network is uniquely tailored to help customers adapt to changing trade dynamics, minimize supply chain disruptions and deliver high quality growth for UPS. Forecast for the U.S. economy in 2019 remain in a growth mode but at a slower pace.","Importantly, consumer confidence continues to be strong bolstered by a healthy job market and low inflation. But signs are mixed with industrial production forecast to soften in the back half of the year.","UPS is well positioned to benefit from consumer and macroeconomic trends as we are focused on attracting higher quality revenue and share growth. Our unmatched and diverse portfolio of services and increasingly agile network help our customers counterbalance the effects of macro trends.","Before I close, I want to congratulate the 1,436 UPS drivers recently inducted into the UPS Circle of Honor. We now have more than 10,000 drivers that are accident-free for 25 years or more. Congratulations to each of you for your achievement and thank you for your commitment to safe driving.","UPS is on a structured path to enhance performance, create the future of the company and take advantage of growth opportunities. We remain steadfast in successfully executing our transformation initiatives.","We made great progress in 2018. 2019 is a year of continued transformative investment in facilities and technology in our smart global logistics network which enable even greater efficiency. 2019 will also be a year of high-quality revenue growth as our transformation efforts will free up resources to gain share in the most attractive markets.","Now Richard will take you through our financial performance for the quarter. Richard?","Richard Peretz","Thanks, David, and good morning. Let\u2019s begin the first quarter call by talking about our strategies initiatives that are driving additional network efficiency and flexibility and are having a positive impact on our revenue quality.","We see additional opportunities for growth across the segments in all of our businesses combining our expanded portfolio of services and flexible integrated network to continue to deliver unmatched value to our customers.","I\u2019ll begin with a summary of our consolidated performance and highlights from each of the segments. In the first quarter, our earnings per share was $1.39. This includes $0.23 of expected year-over-year headwinds we had previously guided.","Additionally, we experienced some unexpected impact from severe weather of about $0.07 earnings per share. Considering this, performance of the U.S. domestic segment was just above our plans.","We had good cost control in the quarter and limited the increase in cost per piece growth to about 2.7%, including an impact of fuel of about 30 basis points. In addition, we made positive gains in revenue quality.","International performance in this dynamic environment was strong. In fact, we expanded operating margins by improving currency neutral revenue yield and leveraging the flexibility of the network.","Supply chain and freight outperformed our expectations with great execution to generate outstanding gains in operating profit. We achieved the highest first quarter profit in this segment\u2019s history.","Now I\u2019ll turn to the segments and give you greater detail. In the U.S., weather impacted all three months of the quarter and was a drag on both the top line and the bottom line results. Nonetheless, volume and revenue for all products grew in the quarter.","Average daily volume growth was led by the air services at nearly 8%. Total revenue quality improved on a year-over-year basis driven by continued growth in B2B volume and gains from smaller customers that we targeted with digital engagement strategies.","UPS ground revenue per piece increased almost 3% driven by the balance in growth in B2B and B2C deliveries that we saw this quarter. While air volume was up, package characteristic, customer mix and weather lowered revenue per piece yields. Overall, we continue to make progress in transitioning to a higher quality revenue mix from targeted growth industries like healthcare, manufacturing and e-commerce.","On the expense side, investments in our network are starting to payoff, reducing growth in expense compared to recent periods. As a result, the U.S. domestic segment achieved its lowest unit cost growth in many quarters.","U.S. domestic operating profit was $694 million. We estimate that weather diminished this quarter\u2019s operating profit by about $80 million impacting operating margin by about 70 basis points. We are making progress with our investments in the U.S. as the new automated facilities brought on line in late 2018 delivered increased efficiency to the network.","Now let\u2019s take a look at the international segment. We delivered strong profit results by facing headwinds from the changes in global trade and significant prior year growth. International delivered its best first quarter operating profit of $612 million in part due to the efforts of managing cost tightly.","High growth in export daily volume in the first quarter of last year created tough comparisons. On a two-year stack basis, international exports achieved volume growth of nearly 12% led by Europe and the Americas.","Europe\u2019s growth was primarily driven by interregional volume while the results were impacted by the uncertainties around Brexit as well as revenue management initiatives we implemented on low yielding volume.","Asia also delivered positive volume growth driven by gains on virtually all lanes except the Asia to U.S. trade lane. On a currency neutral basis, revenue per piece improved by 2.2% for export packages and 3.9% for international domestic. These improvements were driven by Asia and the Americas through disciplined yield management and specific actions we took to ship customer mix.","Most importantly, operating margins expanded to 17.7% when compared to last year and on a currency neutral basis margins expanded to 17%. Our results were a great balance of three things. First, our ability to help customers adapt to the changing conditions. Second, our efforts at flexing our global network. And finally, our success in controlling costs; together enabling great improvements in our bottom line results.","Now let\u2019s look at the supply chain and freight segment. The strong execution of our strategy which includes many asset-light services enabled supply chain and freight to expand its margin by 150 basis points on lower year-over-year revenue.","The segment delivered excellent financial performance. Operating profit jumped more than 24% to $211 million. Profit contributions were broad among the units with particular good results from forwarding.","Looking at the individual business units, the forwarding unit as a whole contributed terrific execution of cost management strategies. International air freight revenue was down in the quarter primarily on outbound lanes from Asia due to the slow recovery of the Lunar New Year. However, the teams successfully expanded the buy-sell spread both sequentially and year-over-year resulting in stronger profits.","Additionally, Coyote truckload brokerage proactively adjusted their strategy due to the current capacity in the market. By continuing to deliver high-quality service to our customers, market rates on purchased transportation expense were down for the quarter.","In response to the changes in the market condition, Coyote implemented a disciplined approach to cost management, leverage the use of technology and continue to focus on high quality loads to produce outstanding profit growth.","For UPS freight, improved revenue quality and growth in middle market segments drove unit increase in revenue per hundredweight up by 5.4%. Overall, the supply chain and freight team delivered robust profit to the company by leaning in on our asset-light model to tightly control cost which helped offset volume and revenue softness.","Now let\u2019s turn to the balance sheet. UPS generated $2.3 billion in cash from operations and about $760 million in free cash flow during the quarter and that is with capital investments of about $1.5 billion which mainly support network enhancements.","We are on track to meet our free cash flow target of $3.5 billion to $4 billion in 2019 with potential for additional upside produced from our working capital initiatives. It should be noted as part of transformation we have adjusted the seasonality of free cash flow based on our working capital initiatives that we implemented throughout the last year.","In fact, payments from the fourth quarter of 2018 have shifted somewhat into the first quarter of 2019. We saw the benefits in the fourth quarter of 2018 and we expect this pattern to continue moving forward.","UPS distributed $867 million in dividends which represent about 5.5% increase on a per share basis. Over the same period last year, however, we purchased 2.4 million shares or about $250 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 23%. We expect our tax rate will be between 23% and 24% for the rest of 2019.","Now moving on to guidance. As a reminder, our transformation charges are not included in guidance. 2019 is a year of investments in our network and executing our strategies to improve operating costs and deliver higher quality revenue growth despite uncertain conditions.","Full year EPS is expected to be in the range of $7.45 to $7.75 as we had previously announced. We view 2019 as a year of real progress with operating profit growth in all three segments up by low double digits.","Turning to quarterly guidance. We want to help you better understand our plans and how they unfold across the year. For example, last year we brought over 90% of our new U.S. capacity online during the fourth quarter, but this year we expect to bring nearly half of our new sort capacity online by the end of the third quarter given us the ability to deliver more benefits in the second half of the year.","We optimized our plans to enable us to open about 30% of our new capacity for 2019 within the second quarter. In comparison during the same period last year, no new facilities were opened. The year-over-year expense related to the opening of these new facilities will affect second quarter results and will provide benefits throughout the remainder of the year.","Total operating profit should grow in the mid-single digits and adjusted EPS is expected to be relatively flat to last year, largely due to the planned pension financing costs which sit below the line.","Third quarter EPS is expected to be elevated due to a variety of material tailwinds including one additional operating day worth approximately $60 million to $70 million of profit. Additionally, we expect benefits from first, the automated facilities that come online this year along with the escalating efficiencies from the 2018 investments in facilities.","Second, the year-over-year international benefits from 2018 commodity headwinds that should not repeat. And finally transformation gains from programs like the voluntary retirement plan that hits its full run rate in July. The combination of these positive items will lift EPS to around 28% of the full year guidance midpoint.","In summary, during the first quarter we made progress in our plans and each business unit demonstrated gain in our strategies which improved efficiency and revenue quality. And our investments in our smart global logistics network are starting to pay off providing enhanced productivity and more real-time flexibility. As the year unfolds, we expect to expand margins and improve profits as we build on our momentum.","Thank you. And now I\u2019ll ask the operator to open the line. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","As a reminder, please ask only one question so that we may accommodate more callers. Feel free to get back in the queue and we will take a second question if time permits. I will now turn the program over to our IRO, Mr. Childress. Please begin.","Scott Childress","We\u2019re going to take an online question starting off here. This question comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please share your view of the U.S.-China trade dynamic and its influence on global trade in your business?","David Abney","All right. Thanks, Scott. This is David and then I\u2019m going to hand it over to Jim to talk about some specifics. UPS, like most other U.S. multinationals, we certainly advocate for fair and balanced trade. And the China-U.S. trade uncertainty is prompting softer industry forecast in the region. We certainly encourage leaders of the two countries to find solutions that support increased two-way trade but also by ensuring many U.S. companies have access to export to China. Our customers have \u2013 some of our customers have adjusted their supply chains using the flexibility of the UPS global network to adapt to changing trade dynamics. And Jim, I\u2019m going to ask you to talk about a couple of specific instances.","Jim Barber","Okay, David. Thanks. So I think David hit on it a couple of times on this uncertainty word and I think that\u2019s an issue when you run a global network that you got to balance and deal with. With regard to China specifically, David also talked about in his opening remarks our addition of one of the 747-8s from Hong Kong into Europe. We still believe in China. We\u2019re going to trade in and around China and how China evolves in the world we\u2019ll move our network to support it. Keep in mind we\u2019re still bringing the 747-8s and very specifically as well I\u2019d like to add that the position of our South China hub in the Guangdong province connecting to Hong Kong, connecting to the other growth markets really continued to power our APAC network across the globe. In fact this quarter that we just finished, we actually had 3% more express on our airplanes out of APAC than we did last year in the same quarter for the U.S. and 2% more to Europe. So we adjust the network, we get the utilization rates right and we\u2019re putting the right volume in the right network and we\u2019ll continue to adjust as trade develops in the world in front of us. So I appreciate the question.","Scott Childress","We\u2019re going to take another online question. This question comes from multiple people including Ben Hartford at RW Baird. Given UPS\u2019 recent introduction of marketplace shipping systems, can you give us an update on where to go and the other initiatives?","Scott Price","Thanks for the question. Scott here. So as we announced last year, e-commerce is one of our four strategic imperatives for growth. It\u2019s focused upon supporting B2B growth as well improving our profitability of B2C e-commerce focused on the SMB segment and supporting marketplace growth. We\u2019ve announced a number of important initiatives. I\u2019ll quickly cover two in the B2B and then pass it to Kate for one recent announcement on B2C. So Shopify and Ware2Go are both in early stages of their rollouts but progressing well, in line with our expectations. They both provide unmatched experience for our customers in the B2B and the segment SMB. Shopify is one of the new shipping integration solutions. It covers 1 million SMB companies with its webshop tech solution serving mainly B2B and B2C type merchants. And overall we have added over 100,000 new customers to UPS with this tool. Ware2Go which we announced just last year is progressing very well. We call it the Airbnb of warehouse and fulfillment. So it\u2019s progressed now. The platform allows online technology that matches excess capacity of warehouse to merchants who are looking for transparent inventory and fulfillment and final mile through UPS. Initially this is focused on serving B2B customers. We have a lot of interest from warehouses around the United States and are quickly building a national two-day fulfillment network. I\u2019ll now pass it to Kate to talk about a B2C initiative.","Kate Gutmann","Thanks. I\u2019ll start with the customer. Small medium-sized customers really needed help with managing the complexities of bringing their product to market as they brought it through different channels and marketplaces. So UPS e-fulfillment which we announced recently actually connects them to 21 marketplaces through just one easy UPS login. We bundle the fulfillment and transportation services and give them two-day time in transit which helps them better compete in the market. It also opens up opportunities for us as a company in different revenue streams. So this along with what Scott covered has given us a wide array of offerings for the customers and we have additional exciting new products coming soon.","David Abney","Yes. So all of these products that Scott and Kate talked about and then the ones in the future that Kate kind of inferred, all of these are about giving our small and mid-sized customers a platform to really punch above their weight. So it allows these smaller businesses to actually compete with larger e-tailers but without having all the infrastructure and the costs that would burden them. So this is really where we can give them an alternative solution. It is a big focus of our SMB imperative and we\u2019re really excited about it and have gotten excellent participation and feedbacks so far. So thank you for the question.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Tom Wadewitz. Please go ahead.","Tom Wadewitz","Yes. Good morning. I wanted to ask you about your view on domestic package and kind of how you think things will play out this year? Your second quarter guidance is \u2013 flat earnings is different from what the Street has been looking for, but I don\u2019t know if that reflects any change in your view of how domestic package is going to perform during the year or if that\u2019s just kind of a timing difference the Street didn\u2019t recognize? So just wondered if you could talk about that and also about visibility to improvement in domestic package margin if you look at the second half? Thank you.","Richard Peretz","Sure, Tom. This is Richard. I\u2019ll start the question and then Jim will talk a little bit about it. If you look at the actual guidance we do see 2019 as a year of real progress. The quarters are changing a little bit, but they were in our plans that way. We wanted to make sure that you had the right visibility and understanding with transformation. The quarter\u2019s changed because we\u2019re opening new buildings in the second quarter that drive benefits in the second half of the year. In the third quarter, we\u2019ve got those new buildings. We see escalating efficiency in the buildings we opened in late 2018. We have the extra work day. We have the commodity tailwind versus last year and we have the DRP, a full run rate in the third quarter. Those are all good proof points of why the year sets up well and the second half operating profit growth will lead to the double digit operating growth that we expect for 2019 in U.S.","Jim Barber","Tom, it\u2019s Jim. Let me add something to what Richard opened with and just to remind you that this year \u2013 when we came out of the gate, we said 2019 in the U.S. is about creating operating leverage. And you can start to see that in the first quarter if you look at the cost structure. To remind you of a couple other points that are beneath that and we think are important. First of all, hand-in-hand with that comes our service. Our service is at very high levels relative to the competition and even for ourselves over the last couple of years. We\u2019re pretty proud of the service and by the way that leans into cost as well, because if you do things right the first time it\u2019s actually cheaper and we provide the customers the great service. We\u2019ll keep on the revenue quality. Kate and others will talk about that as we go forward. The transformation [non-ops] [ph] is coming through. The efficiencies are coming through. We\u2019re focused on almost 80% of our network touching automation by the end of this year which is very good going forward. Remember, we got 323 ground Saturday operations running in full flight this year and you just keep going and then you\u2019ll hear more in the future about peak season. So for us as we move forward and to the margins Rich talked about, you should start to see us perform better and better and better on operating leverage in the U.S. and that\u2019s our commitment to our shareholders this year.","Tom Wadewitz","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Ken Hoexter","Hi. Good morning. If I could just follow up I guess digging into that a little bit further. Can you talk about the cost of those new centers, maybe the magnitude? And I guess in that vein, I just want to understand. I know Amazon\u2019s always a topic of discussion but they\u2019ve been getting bigger and bigger in sourcing and we\u2019ve heard from whether New England Motor Freight or XPO that they brought business in. Is that any part of pulling volumes in as to why ground was up less than call it GDP levels in the quarter? Is any of that starting to have an impact or is that related to other items?","Richard Peretz","So I\u2019ll first talk a little bit about the unpacking of the guidance and the revenue and let\u2019s actually start with the revenue and then David\u2019s going to talk a little bit on the second part of your question. When you look at the revenue especially in the U.S., what we see is underlying growth about 4.5% but we recognize we had weather and operating day change as well as the movement of Easter. So the organic growth was strong. When you look at what we\u2019re doing in opening new buildings we\u2019ve called out in the past as we open buildings, we do have certain startup costs that go into those buildings. By opening that 30% in the second quarter to total 50 by end of the third quarter, what we\u2019re really doing is making sure that as we move into the fourth quarter the efficiency gains that we\u2019re seeing right now in the new buildings, we\u2019re also seeing in this year, in the second half of the year as we especially go into third and fourth quarter. Those startup costs are around things that you would expect as we hire and train people, as we put in the last bit of supply tools and needs, things like that. So those were all part of what we put into the second quarter, what we expect out of the third quarter and fourth quarter. It\u2019s very deliberate in the third quarter and you see benefits from these new buildings as well as the other things I\u2019ve called out. And with that, I think that kind of tell you about why guidance and why we believe 2019 will be so well. And I\u2019ll turn it over to David.","David Abney","Yes, Richard. When it comes to Amazon, we have to remember a very large company. They in-source and out-source different portions of their transportation network. As they grow they continue to change and add those vendors. We do not believe that there\u2019s been a decrease in our volume levels due to them making a switch from one company to another. We still have a mutually beneficial relationship with Amazon and we feel that while we continue to focus on serving their needs that there is so much more to e-commerce than Amazon and we also have shared how we\u2019re focusing on working with these other companies, SMBs and so we\u2019ve shared that at the end of last year and it\u2019s just a continued focus on improving the revenue quality. And we\u2019re going to continue to do that. Thank you for the question.","Ken Hoexter","Thanks, Dave. Thanks, Rich.","Scott Childress","We\u2019re going to take a live question or an online question. This question comes from a multiple of analysts; Fadi Chamoun from BMO, Kevin Sterling from Seaport and Chris Wetherbee from Citi. The question is can you discuss the regional demands of what you\u2019re seeing in the international business related to Europe? And any dynamics that you\u2019re seeing from the customer side in that marketplace?","Jim Barber","Let me start and then I\u2019ll give it to Kate too. Certainly as we mentioned a minute ago, the trade setup for this year has changed a little bit than we saw coming in, but that\u2019s our job to adjust to that. So we\u2019ve got situations in all the regions that we\u2019re adapting our global network. Out in Asia as I talked about a minute ago with David, it\u2019s moved. Keep in mind what I didn\u2019t mention to you at that time is that our block hours are down. So that\u2019s how we end up creating operating leverage. Ultimately Rich talked about the margins and we talked about the movement of that. When you really get behind international and how we are on maturity, we\u2019ve got great options to continue to grow no matter what products our customers chose from us. They\u2019ll migrate between products based upon their needs and growth aspirations. Our job is to get the network right. We did manage some customers, as Rich talked about, some low yielding ones in Europe this quarter that kind of mask some of the results and puts some of that intraregional growth in the mid-single digits. Absent that, you look to the bottom line profitability of the margins, it was a really good quarter for us and we plan to continue that. I\u2019ll ask Kate to add a few comments to that.","Kate Gutmann","I\u2019ll just add that for the 14th consecutive quarter we did see export growth in our international regions. And also as Jim mentioned before, in Asia as an example more express on the airplanes and again exports in Europe continuing. So we are \u2013 our portfolio allows the customers to trade up and down and many are doing some of each. Thanks.","Operator","We have a question from the line of David Vernon. Please go ahead.","David Vernon","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the time. I have a general question on revenue quality. It looks like the top line came in a little bit lighter certainly than the Street was expecting and I think in your commentary also maybe there was a little bit of a lighter start to the year on revenue. Can you talk a little bit about how maybe core price or shipment weights have been shifting particularly around the express and the deferred products where the RPU was kind of down a little bit year-over-year and that\u2019s just kind of a surprising result? I would just like some added color on the mixed trends within express.","Kate Gutmann","Yes. Hi, David. This is Kate. I\u2019ll take that. So overall we improved the revenue quality. And again I\u2019ll just note the changes that or points that Richard made on weather impact and the underlying performance, that also impacts revenue per piece. But ground RPP was actually at 2.9% in the U.S., strongest quarter we have had first quarter growth in four years. And then if you look to your question, we had above market air growth rates which we actually saw a broad base of customer usage; small and medium-sized business, healthcare related as well as of course retail. And yes, to the question on mix, we saw more saver growth specifically within nexAir [ph] product and that can impact revenue per piece as well as a shorten zone which impacts that, but it\u2019s just less of a flight path that the package takes. So that\u2019s \u2013 obviously we do continue our focus unchanged and remain committed to both quality revenue as well as maintaining market share. Thanks.","David Vernon","Is there any sort of metric around distance neutral, weight neutral pricing that you guys kind of track or can talk to, to help us kind of understand that?","Richard Peretz","So we do look at that and over one quarter doesn\u2019t define how that product is moving. Generally speaking if I take the last four quarters combined, the characteristics haven\u2019t been as pronounced as this quarter. But I think you have to also remember weather has an impact. Because when you start having weather impact, your small and medium-sized customers lose that day of business where your larger customers when it gets to customer mix can move it around the country and avoid the weather. And we saw some of that in the numbers this quarter. If it\u2019s appropriate at the right time, if it\u2019s really changing, we would give you that color as well.","Scott Childress","All right. We\u2019re going to take an online question. This online question comes from Scott Schneeberger over at Oppenheimer. Please address the progress in your recent completed of automated facilities and can you provide an update on ORION, NPT and the other technologies you\u2019re bringing online?","Juan Perez","Good morning, Scott. Juan Perez here. Thank you for the questions. Let me start first with the first part of the question related to automation. A couple of parts to that question. In 2018, to your point, we opened 22 new or retrofit automated facilities globally. That represented an addition of about 5 million square feet globally; 4 million in the U.S., 1 million in international and we ended up opening a number of regional sortation facilities that provided great benefit to the organization this past peak and we continue to see that now in Atlanta, Salt Lake City and a couple of other parts of the organization. In 2019, we will be bringing on an additional 20 new or retrofit automated facilities globally. That will also represent roughly 5 million square feet or 400,000 packages per hour of automated sortation capacity in the organization. And these expanded automated facilities are in Tennessee, in California. We\u2019ll have some in Kentucky and Ohio as well and we\u2019ll go to Germany as well this year. Now looking at the benefits of that technology, certainly we\u2019re seeing significant improvement in our productivity in those automated facilities as they continue to reach maturity. The second part of your question related to some of the operational technologies we\u2019ve implemented, we are on track on getting the expected benefits of our ops technology. They\u2019re all part of the smart logistics network strategy that we\u2019ve defined in the organization. We\u2019re already in deployment of ORION DIAD navigation in almost 10,000 drivers across the network, seeing significant benefits in terms of miles reduction related to the technology. When it comes to EDGE, the EDGE initiatives are in deployment. We\u2019re now seeing improvements in consolidation of operations, reducing expense, work simplification. And lastly, as we look at the future we continue to find other opportunities to continue to improve our network. We\u2019re well on our way on our small package [ph] initiative. That is going to provide great benefit to UPS in the years to come, new automation solutions as well. And by the way I don\u2019t want to forget about this. We\u2019re also very excited about the types of customer technologies that we\u2019re bringing onto the mix. New solutions that we\u2019re deploying today but as Kate alluded earlier, we\u2019re also building new solutions to support our customers across the network. Thank you.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Scott Group","Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys. So I wanted to go back to the third quarter guidance if we could. So, Richard, second quarter you\u2019re guiding to mid-single digit profit growth and it looks like implied for the third quarter now is like mid-20% profit growth. I get the operating day gets you like 4 points of extra growth, but can you bridge the rest? Like is there any way to quantify the commodity tailwind you\u2019re talking about and the headcount reductions you\u2019re talking about? Can you put some numbers around that so we can get a little bit more comfort with that guidance? And then maybe it will be helpful if you can sort of directionally talk about third quarter by segment if you can?","Richard Peretz","So, Scott, I think the first thing is and let\u2019s knock out the easiest one first. We called out a specific number around commodity FX headwinds in the third quarter principally driven by the Turkish lira last year that lost something like 60% during the third quarter and came back a lot of it in the fourth and we called that out as well. In terms of the work day, we\u2019ve given you the information on that. And then the VRP full run rate is also something we gave the range, annual savings in the low 200s and so now we get a full quarter of that run rate. So those are all very specific dollar amounts. And then what you look across the international business separate from the commodities, you also are wrapping the benefits we saw from some market activity based on some cyber attacks that occurred with one of our competitors. And so this first and second quarter we\u2019re still wrapping that year-over-year, but in the third and fourth we don\u2019t. And then in supply chain and freight we continue to see the benefits we\u2019re seeing in this quarter we do expect to continue to see mid-double digit growth there as we called out in the first quarter. So third and fourth quarter are better returns and they\u2019re better returns for very specific reasons that we have set out both in the U.S. because of what we\u2019re doing today. I actually mentioned that the third quarter earnings per share should be about 28% of the annual guide number that we called out earlier in the year.","Scott Group","Thanks.","Scott Childress","We\u2019re going to take an online question. This question comes from Allison Landry over at Credit Suisse. She wanted to ask about the growth rates of B2B and B2C. Last quarter, we called the growth rates out. Can you provide an update this quarter in the growth rates on the B2B side?","Kate Gutmann","Hi, Allison. This is Kate. I\u2019ll take that question. So B2B growth as you noted was strong and the best first quarter growth in several years as well as we saw similar rates of growth with B2C, so a nice balance between the two. When we look further into it, we continue to enhance our leadership position in B2B and our solutions are resonating with healthcare customers, for instance, hospitals and labs and seeing the growth there throughout all of the segments. And then also in retail extensive returns, shipments going through say the UPS Store and our other access points to distribution centers and return centers grew quite well. So we continue to focus on growing both and just will continue to fortify the mix that we see.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Chris Wetherbee","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I want to ask a question I guess on free cash flow and CapEx and maybe how you\u2019re thinking about sort of excess cash for shareholders as you move through the rest of the year. So I think Richard, you mentioned that the cadence of free cash flow is changing to some degree. The guidance is the same. You\u2019ve mentioned that there\u2019s potential upside from working capital initiatives. I guess when will we have a little bit more confidence or color around the ability to maybe see some upside there? And then how do you think about sort of CapEx this year? Is the cadence of CapEx changing? Do you think that there\u2019s potential upside or downside to what the guidance you\u2019ve given us, just want to get a sense of how you\u2019re thinking about all of that?","Richard Peretz","Sure. So I think the first thing we look at is, UPS generates strong operating cash flow. We think 2019 will be another good year. Last year, we started doing initiatives around working capital and we saw that benefit. Those working capital initiatives, we have additional ones on the list that we\u2019ll continue to complete and as we complete those, we will share the results and a go-forward look at that. Now, you did hit on this permanent shift. And what that means is we actually have better cash flow in the fourth quarter going forward because of the long-term value of the transformation initiatives we put in place. But most importantly as we do see upside potential, we\u2019re implementing initiatives. And as they come through, we\u2019ll start sharing that a little bit more. In terms of the CapEx side of it, our CapEx really is about improving the efficiency of our network and at the heart of that is both the technology and the buildings that we\u2019re creating. So this year, we expect to spend about $7 billion, we spent $1.5 billion in the first quarter which is right in line with where we expected and we\u2019ll continue to lean into that. We talked about this year level being about where we just talked about a moment ago, and it\u2019s really about driving efficiency and lowering costs in the network over the long term and we do expect and we are seeing some of that now, and we\u2019ll see even more of it in the second half of the year.","Chris Wetherbee","And no real change to the way you think about the long-term CapEx I guess through the next couple of years. Your guidance range as a percent of revenue, that hasn\u2019t changed?","Richard Peretz","Well, I think we\u2019ve given you guidance for that \u2013 we\u2019re in the middle of the three-year process. And at the appropriate time and we continue to look at that and evaluate that, we\u2019ll come back to you with the right numbers.","Scott Childress","We\u2019re going to take an online question here. This question comes from Helane Becker over at Cowen Incorporated. How is the economy looking from your perspective? And can you speak to pockets of growth that you\u2019re seeing?","David Abney","Yes. Helane, this is David. Let\u2019s start with the U.S. And U.S. forecast reduced slightly. There was a few mixed signals but we still see growth and we see opportunity there. So starting out with what\u2019s driving the economy and the solid consumer spending and inventory replenishment. And so we\u2019re certainly focused on those two areas. When I said mixed, the manufacturing activity has slowed a little bit and we\u2019re predicting a little bit lower industrial production in the second half. And while that\u2019s small, the percent of increase has been reduced for 2019. Still plenty of opportunity there and that\u2019s where our e-commerce strategic imperative is focused. And then we\u2019ll switch to the global economic environment. It remains in a growth mode, slightly slower pace. And in Europe, the Europe GDP has been lowered for 2019 in part because of manufacturing slowness. And then Brexit of course remains a risk. We certainly have plans in place to handle however that turns out, but \u2013 so we are prepared to assist our customers. In Asia, China is still strong, maybe not as strong as in previous years, but Jim talked about some of those opportunities we see there, including into the U.S. and from the U.S. to China, but also China and the rest of the world. And so there is a lot of developments there that sometimes gets lost in the China-U.S. discussion. So that\u2019s where we see the economy and we think that it gives us plenty of opportunities to focus and to apply our strategic imperatives. We feel good about the economy for the rest of the year.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Allison Landry","Thanks. Good morning. Could you tell us how much the efficiencies from the facilities that opened up last year helped first quarter domestic margins or cost per piece? And when would you expect the productivity benefits from the automation and new store capacity to begin to outpace the startup costs from the newer facilities? And is this something that could occur by the end of this year? Thank you.","Richard Peretz","So, Allison, we are in the middle of really three years of opening some large amount of additional capacity. The timing across quarters is going to be a little different because what we\u2019re seeing is the benefits are apparent. Our cost per piece ex-fuel grew about just under 2.5% and if you adjust to weather, it\u2019s actually around 2% growth, which is the lowest it\u2019s been in several years. That\u2019s principally driven by the efficiencies that we\u2019re getting out of the network. We now have somewhere between 55% and 60% of eligible volume going through automated facilities. That will keep growing. We\u2019ve called out not only the facility automation, but we\u2019re in the middle of implementation of the ORION 2. And I\u2019m actually going to hand it off to Juan to talk a little bit about it. But it\u2019s all part of what we laid out is our margin growth and getting to double-digit operating profit growth for the U.S. for 2019.","Jim Barber","So, Rich, I\u2019m going to take it from Juan, because I think \u2013 I want to package it together with some of what Juan mentioned on the first time he spoke. I think it\u2019s important to remember that we went into transformations. You hear Scott and us talk a lot about non-op and procurement and the other benefits. But make no mistake, because we invest in this network and put the capital in, there are efficiency gains that are material in this business that will come through between now and this run rate of 2022 as we go forward and they are not insignificant and we are in the early innings of that. 2018 peak was step one. You start to see the cost mitigate in Q1. And the leverage we\u2019re talking about in this pivot year is there\u2019s a material piece on the cost side, it\u2019s not just revenue quality and you\u2019ll see that unfold as we go quarter-by-quarter-by-quarter, Allison. And it\u2019s in all facets of the business, that\u2019s the thing is when you get the hub and spoke opened, back up, the efficiencies come, on the inbound side, in the hubs, in the network, on the road, then you put ORION and you put EDGE and you put all the other technology Juan talks about, it is material. And as we go quarter-by-quarter and we actually put this on paper for you, I think we\u2019ll do a really good job of laying out for you more and probably in a cost per piece example than we are right now in the first quarter.","Scott Childress","We\u2019re going to take a live \u2013 an online question here. We\u2019ve got multiple analysts asking about the drone program that we launched and some of the activity that we\u2019re doing around these innovative solutions.","Scott Price","Yes. Thanks for the question. Scott here. We\u2019re really very proud to have the very first FAA sanction use of a drone for routine revenue flights, which as David mentioned, took place at the WakeMed medical campus. That certification from the FAA is very important and we\u2019re really pleased to see that they\u2019ve quickly began to embrace other opportunities with subsequent approvals. But we\u2019re early in the process in the United States. We announced yesterday that we have launched a continuation of a 13,000 program that we had launched in Rwanda taking medical samples across the country. And today now in Rwanda, 30% of Rwanda\u2019s blood supply are done through these drones. So we will continue to see in the United States opportunities to expand this to campuses, in particular focusing upon healthcare. The economics, we do see in the future to be positive and we will scale these and see that the opportunity to reduce our costs on these type of campus programs is quite positive. There\u2019s a supporting platform value to this as well. Juan?","Juan Perez","Great. Thank you, Scott. We\u2019ve learned a lot through our tests with drone technology, one-off drone solutions are not scalable. To complement our already robust delivery network with drone deliveries requires an effective ecosystem of solutions. So what we\u2019re doing for that is we\u2019re bringing the great expertise we built over the years in analytics and operations research to be able to do a few things to support these ecosystem. The first one is, we\u2019re using analytics to identify how to best utilize this technology. We\u2019re applying operations research expertise to determine how to maximize the value of this solution within the network that we already have, which is very efficient. And lastly, we definitely believe that these are required to have a solid approach to optimizing the value of this technology in the future and we believe we have that.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Brandon Oglenski","Hi. Good morning everyone and thanks for getting my question in. I want to come back to the longer-term CapEx outlook because I think at prior events you guys have spoken about spending in the 8.5% to 10% of revenue range for the next few years. And I really want to put that in the context of these facility investments you\u2019re making. I think in the past, you\u2019ve said that you have somewhere between like 30 to 35 major package health facilities in the U.S. I was wondering if you could update us on just how many of those have actually been updated with the automated technology. And then what is the outlook over the next couple of years for how many should get retrofitted looking forward?","Richard Peretz","So, Brandon, this is Richard. I think on the CapEx side, I\u2019ll take that part. And then I\u2019ll have Juan talk a little bit about the actual buildings. But on the CapEx side, you\u2019re right. We talked about a three-year peak of CapEx and then it\u2019s moderating down. We\u2019re still on plans for that. It\u2019s just a little early to give you what we\u2019re going to do in 2020 and 2021. But we continue to look at different options and alternatives based on the flow of packages and really the benefits we\u2019re getting out of these buildings, which are slightly better than we originally thought even. So it\u2019s a little too early to give that but at the same time, what we\u2019ve guided in terms of three years and then coming down, that moderation will occur. And at the appropriate time we\u2019ll give a better feel for that. But I\u2019ll turn it over to Juan to talk about the actual buildings.","Juan Perez","Sure, Richard. Close to 60% of our planned building automation projects by 2022 are already completed. That\u2019s on the large building automation type projects. And as David alluded earlier, we\u2019re already seeing the types of benefits that we get from these automation in the network. Close to 65% of our small sort automation projects that we targeted by 2022 are also completed. And in both scenarios, we\u2019re actually on track to get to the targets that we defined to have solid automation across our network to provide benefits to the organization.","Operator","That concludes our Q&A session for today. I would now like to turn the program back over to Mr. Childress. Please go ahead, sir.","Scott Childress","Thank you very much, Steven. So we\u2019ll leave with closing comments from David.","David Abney","So as you heard during the call, UPS is adding innovative solutions and using technology to enrich our integrated network. Our transformation initiatives are improving efficiency and revenue quality. And we\u2019ve made good progress this quarter in a dynamic environment.","Strong execution in supply chain and international. U.S. domestic investments are driving momentum. Our built facilities are coming online earlier this year creating earlier benefits. And we continue to see growth opportunities that Kate has talked about earlier.","So in summary, we had a good start to the year and we have momentum to embrace our future performance.

Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to announce another quarter of improved profitability and strong cash generation. This quarter, earnings per share increased 23% to $1.94. Throughout the enterprise, UPS is executing strategies for targeted global growth and improved operating efficiency that create value for shareowners. Once again, this quarter, the International and Supply Chain and Freight segments reported exceptional performance, generating double-digit growth in revenue and operating profit. The U.S. Domestic segment realized above 6% revenue growth, driven by yield improvement across all products. While operating profit is not currently where we want it to be, there are several initiatives underway to improve the bottom-line results and, clearly, the segment will also benefit as we advance our transformation strategies.","This quarter, we made further progress on our transformation initiatives, which touch all aspects of our business. These initiatives will drive greater operating efficiency, improved returns and continued growth in key targeted segments. As part of transformation, we launched a Voluntary Retirement Plan in April and participation levels met our expectations. This program is just one of a number of initiatives to be launched under our transformation strategies. We look forward to sharing additional details about our plans in September.","We had several other significant accomplishments during the last few months. Recently, UPS and Teamster leadership reached tentative master agreements covering employees in our U.S. small package and freight units. In addition, we reached handshake agreements on local supplements, covering most U.S. employees. The parties are working hard to finalize the remaining locals. These contracts reward UPSers for their contributions to our success. They also enable the business to remain flexible to meet customer needs, increasing shareowner value.","We recently added more efficient capacity in UPS' European network by opening two large automated facilities in London and Paris. These key locations will support continued growth across Europe and provide UPS's highly efficient network, with more than 70,000 packages per hour of sorting capacity. And in the U.S., we'll soon open our second largest domestic ground hub in Atlanta. At full capacity this year, it will sort over 100,000 pieces per hour, more than double the hub sorting capacity we added all of last year. The new hub will begin operations over the next couple of weeks and it incorporates the latest automated sortation and network control technologies. It is a showplace of UPS's network capabilities being deployed in several new regional hubs.","Finally, we reached another milestone by surpassing 50 million UPS My Choice members, adding a staggering 12 million new subscribers over the past year. UPS's customer-facing technologies provide consumers with more convenience and options, building stronger relationships with end users and enabling more efficient deliveries. Our pipeline of innovation, built around My Choice and other customer-facing digital platforms allows UPS to offer new services and create more value for our customers. In addition, we continue to strengthen our leadership team, welcoming Kevin Warren to our company as the Chief Marketing Officer. UPS will clearly benefit from Kevin's wealth of knowledge and broad business perspective.","Turning to the external environment, the global economy remains healthy despite some emerging discord around trade. Current global and U.S. real GDP forecast call for annual growth to remain at or above 3%. In the U.S., the economy is benefiting from tax reform and reduced regulations, helping to drive positive consumer confidence and higher retail sales. The outlook for the industrial economy remains solid despite recent volatility in the U.S. dollar. Conditions are also favorable in other parts of the world. In Europe, positive fundamentals and the Central Bank stimulus remain in place, helping to offset concerns about Brexit and other issues. And in Asia, recent economic reports show growth continues to be strong, with China leading the way, despite rising trade-related concerns.","UPS has long supported the advancement of free trade principles. We're advocating for future trade discussions to produce balanced and fair agreements for all parties so that cross-border commerce is easier for businesses of our sizes. While we expect continued growth in global trade, we're closely monitoring the changing trade landscape. UPS customers can count on the flexibility of our network and scope of our business model to help them adapt to changing dynamics. No matter the outcome, we are well prepared in the event rising tensions impact our cross-border business.","Before I turn it over to Richard, I want to recognize the efforts of the entire UPS team as we move through transformation. The company has a long and effective history of transforming itself to capture new market opportunities. I especially want to acknowledge those UPSers who have accepted the VRP. We appreciate your contributions, and wish you the very best in your retirement.","In summary, we are confident that our core business strategies will enhance growth and improve our efficiency. UPS remains the industry's leader, with the highest margins in return on invested capital, as well as producing excellent free cash flow. Thanks for the time today. Now, Richard will take you through the quarterly results. Richard?","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Thanks, David, and good morning. UPS produced strong revenue as pricing and targeted growth initiatives drove improvement in top line results across all three business segments. The company's performance was in line with our expectation and positions us well to achieve our full year financial targets. In the second quarter, earnings per share increased 23% to $1.94. Total revenue was up nearly 10%, and we continued to see good balanced growth across all segments.","One of the highlights of the quarter was the improvement in both the U.S. and international revenue per piece. Simply put, we are taking pricing actions to better align our cost to serve with the value we create for our customers. As a result, yields expanded in each of our major products. International and Supply Chain and Freight segments both recorded strong performance with solid growth and expanded margins. At the same time, the U.S. Domestic segment advanced network projects that will improve the efficiency and service. Overall, we're making good progress in our initiatives and we're energized about the opportunities that lie ahead.","Now for the segment detail. In the U.S., revenue increased 6.3% to $10 billion. The revenue gains were driven by higher yields and good growth. Average daily shipments were up 2.6%, led by Ground and Next Day Air. Year-over-year comps for Deferred Air were tough this quarter. However, over the last two years, we're up nearly 9%. While B2C continues to outpace B2B, we're seeing positive trends from several industry verticals, including the manufacturing, technology and automotive sectors. Average revenue per piece increased 3.6%, our best improvement in the last few years.","Pricing initiatives and higher fuel surcharges more than offset the headwinds and mix. Base rates accelerated to 3.3%, reflective of the recent pricing actions we've taken. U.S. Domestic operating profit totaled $1.1 billion, and operating margin was at 11%. As expected, higher pension expense and project related costs weighed on the segment's results this quarter. As David mentioned, we're bringing on substantial capacity this year which is driving additional expense. Looking forward, the efficiency gains from these projects as they come online, combined with the transformation initiative, will improve U.S. performance.","Now turning to the International segment, which continued to deliver outstanding financial results due to the broad UPS product portfolio and superior network. Revenue was 14% higher and Export shipments per day were up about 10%, with mid-teen gains in the U.S.-to-Europe trade lanes. We're also experiencing robust inter-regional growth in both Asia and Europe. Our network improvements across intra-Europe continued to deliver outstanding results. Those investments in new capacity, automation and speed have allowed us to enhance transit times in thousands of lanes. In fact, about 80% of our cross-border ground volume is delivered in one to two days. As a result of favorable product mix and disciplined revenue management, International currency-neutral revenue per package increased 3.8%. Operating profit jumped 15% to $654 million, resulting in this segment's highest second quarter profits ever. On a currency-neutral basis, we've produced 14 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth in operating profit.","Now let's look at the Supply Chain and Freight segment. Total revenue was up 16% with solid growth across all business units. Operating profit increased nearly 17% to $247 million, the highest profit for this segment ever reported. Forwarding revenue jumped 23%, driven by higher tonnage and improved pricing. International air freight and Coyote truckload brokerage led the business unit with high top line and bottom line growth. The distribution and logistics unit drove revenue up more than 9%, on higher demand for health care, retail and manufacturing sectors, all contributing to good profit gains. The unit expanded warehouse capacity by more than 1 million square feet in the second quarter.","UPS Freight revenue climbed 13%, as LTL revenue per hundredweight elevated 7.4% which includes about 280 basis points of increase from fuel. The unit remains focused on serving middle market customers and improving yields. Overall, we are pleased with the Supply Chain and Freight segment's performance this year. The team across all the major business units are executing on their strategies, and we're seeing great results. In fact, operating profit has grown 43% in this segment over the last two years.","Now, turning to the balance sheet, where UPS generated $4.4 billion in free cash flow in the first half of this year, despite CapEx of $2.8 billion. This quarter free cash flow gains were driven primarily by an improvement of about $900 million in net working capital. We're adopting a more global approach to our working capital and accounts payable. This represents one of the many procurement deliverables within UPS's transformation initiative. We're improving the efficiency of our working capital that ultimately contributes to our industry-leading return on invested capital. As a result, we are raising our free cash flow target to $5 billion, the top of our original range.","The company distributed $1.6 billion in dividends which represents a nearly 10% increase per share. And we repurchased 4.4 million shares for just over $500 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter came in about 23%, due primarily to favorable state and local tax legislation enacted during the second quarter. As a result of recent U.S. tax reform, both the U.S. Treasury Department and certain states are still defining their tax regulations and our rate is subject to change as these items become final. Currently, we still expect our tax rate to be between 23% and 24% for the remainder of the year.","Now turning to guidance, looking across the remainder of the year, we're well on our way to achieving our financial targets and we're reaffirming our 2018 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $7.03 to $7.37, an increase of 17% to 23% over 2017's results. In the third quarter, we expect to produce EPS growth towards the top of our previous range of 22% to 26%. For the fourth quarter, we expect to have a good peak season. However, the calendar works against us with two less operating days in December. At the same time, we're bringing on significant capacity, adding planned cost to the fourth quarter, and opening several large new facilities before peak that will provide benefits going into the future. As a result, as previously guided, fourth quarter earnings per share growth is expected to be in the mid-teens.","As a reminder, the new transformation initiatives are not included in our guidance. Looking forward, we remain confident in our ability to balance the transformation of the organization, increase yield, and ultimately deliver improved financial return for our shareholders. We look forward to meeting with you in September to discuss the transformation initiative that we've begun to lay out for you today. Thank you, and now I'll ask the operator to open the line. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Our first question is an online question, it comes from Chris Wetherbee of Citibank. Can you give us a sense of scope of the transformation plans beyond the VRP, does it include operating methods, approach to pricing, and capacity?","Scott Price - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Thanks, Chris, for the question. This is Scott. The VRP was the first step in our transformation process. We think of transformation in two ways, both cost and growth. It's a framework by which we are reexamining our way of operating, and so, of course, it would include operating methods, pricing and capacity. In September, when we have our New York conference, we'll share a little bit more detail around how cost leverage, reducing our non-operating cost, procurement, working capital and those growth initiatives all come together to a pretty substantial multi-year program. Thank you.","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","This is David. Just want to add a little bit to that. And Scott Price was brought into this company to really help us to transform, and he also is coordinating our strategy, and we have made a lot of progress in this area. You will certainly hear about it at the later meeting. But what's equally impressive is the way that UPSers in general, our people have really taken to the need to continue to transform our business and, with Scott's leadership, very happy with what we've seen so far.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","We have another online question. This comes to us from multiple analysts on the Street, and let me just \u2013 have you seen any impact for your international business related to the trade and the tariffs?","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Okay. This is David, and, yes, there is a lot of interest based on the number of questions that were submitted about this. I can tell you that we've seen no significant impact at this time. Now, are we closely monitoring the trade landscape? We absolutely are. Are we having more frequent discussions with our customers about if this continues what they may or may not need to do. So, if these trade war continued or these actions continued, there would always be some exposure or risk to our business. But that exposure is very much limited and the reason that it is, is because we really see it as our duty to utilize our flexible global network and our broad portfolio to help our customers adapt to any changing trade dynamics. And I'm going to ask Jim if there's anything he wants to expand here, but I think it's a key point that you need to remember when you think about these headlines.","James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.","This is Jim. Let me add two points to that. First of all, because there's some other online questions that get at growth in international, and specific trade lanes and obviously we've got the U.S. to China discussions going on and many others, but the other obligation, as David talked about to growing this business, is to lean into other emerging markets that we haven't really gone deep into. And quite frankly, if you look at our growth in the second quarter, Southeast Asia happens to be one of those markets where we're growing in a very different pattern right now.","So as trade patterns shift, yes, we have obligations to keep moving the network. We do that obviously through the typical pattern of bid cycles. We also have the advantage of the products, as David pointed out as well. So, we can balance our Forwarding with our small package and the bid cycles to go forward and make sure that that's just part and parcel of running a global express network. So, as David said, we'll keep a close eye on it and monitor it and keep the business growing no matter what happens to the trade patterns.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Tom Wadewitz, UBS. Please go ahead.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. Good morning. I wanted to ask you about price and volume in Domestic Package. You saw some slowing in the pace of growth in Domestic Package volume in second quarter. My understanding is there may have been some pricing actions that were taken. So just wanted to see if you could help us to understand what pricing actions you took and how we might think about the kind of volume outlook relative to what you're doing on price and maybe kind of how far along you are on pricing. Thank you.","Kathleen M. Gutmann - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Thanks, Tom. This is Kate. I'll take that question. And I'll start with the volume side of it. We continue to see solid volume growth. If you look at the two-year stack for both the first quarter and second quarter, it's over 7%. Do note that Easter moved between the quarters which I think is the impact you're referring to, but we continue to see that solid volume growth and across all sectors, healthcare, industrial, as well as consumer goods.","Tied to the pricing actions, we also saw strong pricing this quarter with U.S. base rates up 3.3% without fuel. And in the quarter, to your point, we implemented more pricing actions, really focused on oversized and large residential packages which drive higher cost to serve. And just as an example, LPS, the two-year stack on pricing action, has been 18.5% because of that cost to serve and we, in July, added a length dimension, so a length over 96 inches as well as Residential Delivery charge as well. Just as two examples. So, we are seeing those as specific targeted rate actions. We do not see an impact on volume, and we continue to see solid results in both areas. Thanks.","Operator","We have a question from the line of David Vernon, Bernstein. Please go ahead.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning. I know you guys are kind of in the process of finalizing the labor agreements and outside of kind of specific numbers, can you give us a sense for how the addition of some of the part-time driving rules is going to effect the business, like, what impact it could have on things like overtime rates, driver productivity, and how we should expect cost to grow going forward once, assuming that the contract has been released out there is ratified?","James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.","David, I'll start, anyway. This is Jim. Look, I think this isn't really the forum to be doing forward forecasting, given the contract is not ratified yet. I think what I'd rather just update you on is where we are and when the time is right, we'll walk you through all of that, obviously. But we absolutely feel like we're in a pretty good place right now, because, at this point, really, we have tentative agreements on the National Masters in freight and package and we are just a handful away of the locals and the supplements, and we really believe that kind of the timeline, which I think we all do is important is in early August, we believe the Teamsters will get the communication and begin the process to a ratification and the voting process. So after that all concludes, I think would be the more representative time to talk about the final details of the contract and how that might play into any financials going forward.","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Yeah, until that point, just want to emphasize that we're fully aware that our people, and especially our drivers, since they're the ones that see our customers face-to-face, they are our ambassadors to our customers, and one of our goals in this contract is to reward our people. We absolutely feel that's important. We also believe that we have to have the flexibility to respond to our customers' needs and that if we take care of that, that we can not only ensure that our existing employees are enjoying those rewards but we can set the foundation for the future so that the generations of UPSers can continue to enjoy those benefits. So, we've got multiple goals that we wanted to get accomplished, and we are pleased with the progress. But this contract has got to be ratified. So let's get that ratified, and then we will go from there. But thank you for the question.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","We have a online question from Ravi Shankar of Morgan Stanley. The first half free cash flow of $4.4 billion implies a much lower second half. Can you walk through the timing of the cash flow generation through the year?","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","And this is Richard. Good morning, Ravi. I think the important thing to remember is throughout time, UPS's free cash flow had seasonality to it. And what I mean by that is obviously in peak season, we have more spending and then we collect those revenues in the first quarter of each year. So, we always naturally have a seasonality that doesn't allow for free cash flow to be as linear as our CapEx spending or the rest of our expense spending goes. But that being said, when you look at the free cash flow and the improvement in working capital, it's really driven by specific activities around transformation and what's happening in both procurement and payables. And it really goes to the strength of UPS in terms of generating a lot of free cash flow.","That all being said, we continue to work through these initiatives, think there's more to come, and so we're real comfortable, given all the facts, that moving up from the $4.5 billion to $5 billion, all the way to $5 billion, is that the success of our working capital improvements are showing up on the bottom line. Thank you.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","We're going to take another online question. This question comes from the line of Dave Ross. Can you add more color on the International Package growth, how did Asia do, why were the U.S. and Europe strongest for UPS in the sector?","James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Dave, it's Jim again. Let me talk about it. I started to touch on it a second ago as well is, if you look at it, we did highlight obviously communication U.S. to Europe. To get at that, that obviously is both ways, we commented over a few calls over the last couple of years about our focus on the U.S. a few years ago in a relaunch of that trade lane because we didn't feel like we were performing outbound in the U.S. at our highest levels. The team has been put together, it has been in place three years, and we are seeing our highest growth in the U.S. in many, many years, and we know we're winning share in the U.S. That's driving the outbound leg.","Coming back home, obviously, those investments we talk about in Europe, yes, they drive growth intra-Europe but they're driving it right back to the U.S. as well, so those two trade lanes I think are easily identifiable over the kind of years of investment. But as I mentioned a second ago, Southeast Asia now, our emerging market strategy is kicking in to play here. We're having some new countries grow as well, Eastern Europe and the Nordics is performing very nicely for us. So it really is moving kind of across the world right now. But that U.S. to Europe trade lane I think is powered by a number of investments in human capital and capabilities the last couple of years.","Operator","Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Good morning. Can you talk a little bit about on the domestic margin side, what's in there from the facilities cost given the near 200-basis point decline. How do we start framing the opportunities you have to improve margins? And within that discussion, I don't know if, Kate, if you can return on the pricing, is that driven by the renewed peak season surcharges or is that more, I don't know, Richard, on the facilities cost side?","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Yeah, so I'll start and I think Kate will then pick up on the second part of the question. But I think when you look at the U.S. margin and, underlying margin is being muted by both the change in the pension and the discount rate, and then the operating cost penalty, that's really about what's going to happen in the future. When you think about new buildings and we've been talking about almost 400,000 pieces an hour expansion going into the second half of the year in our network, it is about a 15- to 20-week process to get a building all the way up to a full run rate. And so you've got these start-up costs, you've got training, you've got management costs and so that plays into the results. We know going into next year that it really is about improving yield. It's about these new buildings and running at full capacity, once the initial start-up period is over. And it's also about layering in some of the transformation initiatives. They all will drive better margin improvement. And with that, I'll turn it over to Kate to talk a little bit about the specific pricing.","Kathleen M. Gutmann - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Thanks, and Ken, tied to the pricing just to expound a bit on the mid-quarter changes that we did, those did kick-in immediately, and as for instance, Over Max which are the packages outside of our weight and size limits, we changed the publish rates for each day throughout the year so not just peak to $650 published. And then on top of that, a peak season surcharge would kick-in. Again, these larger packages drive higher cost to serve and we need to ensure that the alignment with the value we have to our customers makes sense. But also we had other actions as I mentioned on the large packages, we did address correction so all of those are the mid-quarter.","And then to your question about the peak season surcharge, as you know, UPS was the market leader in implementing that. It is similar to last year, though with an increase at the residential products are the ones on certain days and weeks that will have the peak season surcharge and then larger packages throughout the whole period. And we did notify our customers of the peak surcharges in January so that they could better prepare this year. So we see a balanced approach, both throughout peak as well as non-peak period. Thanks much.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Our next online question, we've gotten a few questions around peak, and so we know you've been planning for peak season all year. Do you see anything different about this year versus last year and even in the prior years?","Juan R. Perez - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Yes, very good. Thank you for the question. And the statement around peak planning being an all year round process is absolutely correct. This starts right as we are working on the current peak. Richard mentioned that we have two less operating days in December versus last year. We are working through other plans to adjust for that particular change. So that's something that is different. We are adding significant sorting capabilities, online this coming peak, we will have in excess of 350,000 packages per hour of additional sorting capabilities this coming peak season, and that will definitely help.","We're also planning to hire additional seasonal helpers. We are planning on introducing better technology again to facilitate the movement of packages across the network, two applications that come to mind are the mobile delivery app that simplifies the onboarding and the delivery of packages for all the seasonal helpers we bring on, and also the use of technologies such as Dynamic Sort Instructions that once again, make things easier for people to be able to sort packages across the network. By this peak, our Saturday operations will be at full deployment, and that will further help us smooth out the volume throughout the peak period creating additional capabilities. So multiple enhancements and improvements this year.","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Okay. That was Juan Perez. He's our Chief Information and Engineering Officer. And then there was another part of the question, Kate, do you want to address?","Kathleen M. Gutmann - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Absolutely. So with the collaboration with our customers, that continues and has been a key component, especially during peak season which is a market constrained period on certain days, and we continue to work with our customers on joint strategies to smooth demand. And when I say that, I mean moving volume into lower lighter days, and many of them are identifying self-gifting that goes on that they're able to modify transit times with. So it benefits all, leads to higher service, and also less overtime for their DCs so they can staff more consistently. So these long-term relationships we have with our customers really lends to that collaboration.","James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Let me add one point, it's Jim, to what Kate said, which is service. Is that, it's not lost on us at UPS that we're constructively dissatisfied with our service levels the last couple of peaks. And so all the things that we're investing in also have to culminate in better service for our customers, and we plan to deliver that as well.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Our next online question comes from Brian Ossenbeck at JPMorgan. What interaction have you had with the U.S. Postal Service task force in information that they're expected to release in the next month?","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Okay. This is David. First, let me emphasize, we have a unique relationship with the Postal Service. We're a customer, they're a vendor, we're competitors, and we support a healthy and viable USPS. We are concerned, have been concerned about funding for monopoly products that are supporting competitive products, and we believe that is one of the issues that the postal task force should be addressing. They're going to be addressing multiple issues.","We have certainly been involved with them, and just like we have with other entities about what we believe should happen here, and we do feel like that they're actively addressing the issues. We have no idea what their conclusions are going to be. At the same time, there's a very important piece of legislation that's coming across, the STOP Act, and its original focus is about preventing opioids and other illegal substances from coming into the U.S. The STOP Act would impose the same high import standards that the companies, integrators, and other companies would be \u2013 do impose and make sure that all the foreign post follow those same guidelines as it comes into the U.S. It has been approved in the House, the same bill, a mirror image, is being addressed in the Senate, and the Administration has indicated that they would support it if it goes through the Senate. So a lot of things happening on postal reform, a lot of headlines, our focus has really been on the facts and making sure that we provide the information that we feel we need to do. So thank you for the question.","Operator","Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Please go ahead.","Chris Wetherbee - Citi Investment Research","Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to come back to transformation again, sort of think about, if you think there will be \u2013 I guess may be a bigger picture about the timing of it. Do you think there will be impact to 2019 beyond the VRP or how should we think about sort of the timeframe that you're sort of targeting here, the multiyear effort, one, three, five years, any color would be helpful?","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","This is Richard, and I think the first thing is everything you said is about right. We're going to cover in the conference in September a little broader picture of what it is that we're going to accomplish, similar to what Scott had talked about, in answering a previous question, but also what that means over the multiple years kind of where we think this is headed financially as well and what it means to each of you and to our investors. So I would say stay tuned, the September's conference is really strictly about transformation and the journey we're on and what it is going to mean long-term.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jack Atkins at Stephens.","Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.","Can you expand on the factors behind the strong top line growth within your freight boarding operation and how much is market driven versus individual company initiatives?","James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Jack, it's Jim. And then Kate is going to add on with me here. Obviously, you kind of talked about top line and bottom line. Rich mentioned in his opening the supply chain two years, the bottom line has grown by 43%. A couple of business units I think worth kind of going through real quick. Our Forwarding business, quite frankly, last quarter, the revenue was up 23%, that's three quarters in a row of double-digit and really it's about the dynamic changes we're making over the years really focused on customer experience, winning in the middle market, Kate will talk about that as well, and continuing Forwarding revenue management initiatives.","We don't talk much about Coyote, the acquisition we made about three years ago. It's performing very nicely quite frankly. They continue to really lean into truckload brokerage with great service. Last quarter their revenue grew right at 40%. So that's a pretty impressive number obviously in a business like that. And they continue to expand geographically heavy into the south border between the U.S. and Mexico when we expanded the business into Europe.","And then finally, logistics before I hand it over to Kate, really great quarter, almost 10% revenue growth, profit growing at 25%, many industries, healthcare obviously leading the way for us, post sales doing well, and, quite frankly, in that business, we have a pipeline and logistics now we haven't seen in many years to keep it going forward. So that's kind of some dots on the map before I hand it to Kate.","Kathleen M. Gutmann - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Thanks, and Jack I'll just expound on the Forwarding middle market reach and success we've been having. We, through our sales force and solutions group, have been able to really penetrate into the middle market supply chain, so not just their U.S. small package strictly, but also where they're sourcing their product and movement throughout the whole supply chain. So I think as cross border trade has developed as well as more off-shoring for product sourcing, we're finding a greater need in that small and medium sized business which, again, ties very well to the way we approach the market. And then the revenue management, we've streamlined our processes so it adapts to the market more quickly, and we've seen a lift from that as well. Thanks for the question.","Operator","Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks so much. In International, could you please discuss customer demand for premium products and help us think about the Export yield growth on a go forward basis?","James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Well, I guess maybe Kate and I will talk about it together, again. It's Jim. Look, I think obviously we've talked a lot over the years about Europe and the investment there, and you know, how you define premium is interesting in a discussion like this. We consider our trans-border standard product in Europe a premium product because of some of the capabilities we've added but we're talking about double-digit export growth for many, many quarters, in lots of segments and sectors, and lots of geographies. So the demand is there. That's obviously what tied us into the airplane acquisitions and those agreements, we really hadn't any capacity since 2013 and since that time our volume has grown by 30% if you call it in the premium and Export segments. So the demand is there, the world wants it, customers want it, and we continue to support that with our infrastructure and service. Kate probably wants to add a few things as well.","Kathleen M. Gutmann - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Yeah. Just to add we've nearly doubled the export average daily value \u2013 volume rather over the last 10 years. And as Jim mentioned, we're seeing a correlation with the faster time-in-transit, you have seen the impact of Europe now being UPS the fastest on the ground and in the air. We're also the earliest to deliver throughout the world with our Express products and very much seeing lift with Dubai and our fastest time-in-transit there as well, so going into more and more of these emerging markets. So that is absolutely a driver tied to that. And then I'll reinforce cross-border trade is expected to have 5 times the GDP growth in the future and so the opportunity in front of us is as exciting. Thanks.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","We've got a online question and it's really about, what actually is transferrable between the international and U.S. in terms of best practices and strategic planning.","James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.","So this is Jim, again. I'll start and if David wants to obviously add or anybody else, the answer to this question, quite frankly, comes from being back in the U.S. after 15 years of International in my career and having completed really the first quarter with the team. So framing it within that perspective, I would say there is a lot of similarities. Now, the business models, quite frankly, are different, but the timing of where we are and the way that at least I certainly and the team are looking at this is that we had similar issues in Europe in 2013 and 2014 when we needed to add capacity and add capabilities and speed and we did that in Europe, that's when we announced the $2 billion investment. You've seen that play out. We're 70% of the way through and you've seen what that has done in that piece of the business. So here, in the U.S., obviously, it is just bigger.","I just want to make sure Juan has given a few comments, I want to size one of them specifically, and that is if you look at 2017 for us and what we added with the CapEx, we added about 53,000 pieces an hour of sort capacity and about 700 car positions, and I'll stay out of the automated small sorts. This year, we're adding 7 times that capacity this year, so 350,000, that's what's in Rich's guidance numbers going forward to continued investment. Takes a little bit of time to catch that going forward, but the efficiency is there, 30% to 40% more efficient than these buildings, so going forward, that's kind of the way we look at this, and a lot of what we learned in International, the things that we are able to bring back and it's both operational and Kate talks about revenue management and pricing and all of that is matching all that together to really drive the margins.","And my first quarter coming back, I can, quite frankly, tell you, I'm very confident we can do that. We know where we are on the journey. We know where this quarter is and where it's going to come, and we're pretty confident you'll be able to see this all come together in the near-term, so.","Operator","Matt Reustle of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Matthew Reustle - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking the question. Just to follow up on free cash flow a bit. It sounds like the working capital improvements are driven primarily by improved payable terms. I mean should we think about that as a structural improvement for your cash conversion? And I know you haven't given a formal 2019 guide, but would it improve that 2019 guide with the changes?","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Yeah, Matt, this is Richard. And absolutely we're looking at this working capital improvement as we're on a journey, there are certain commodities and contracts that you can do in a very efficient, very fast paced. There are other geographies and other contracts that is part of a negotiation process. So we see this as something that really is going to be the foundation of improvements for net working capital in the company, just as we always managed our DSO on the receivable side, it's really putting a lot of discipline and a lot of consistency around the world using the same methodology, and it all started when we, with this transformation initiative, and I think it's something that will pay dividends not only this year but going forward as well.","Matthew Reustle - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","We're going to take an online question here. This comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer Research. And it's a clarification. When do you anticipate achieving the full run rate savings from the VRP initiatives?","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","And I'll take that question as well. And I think the thing that you have to remember here is that what's going to happen with transformation on the voluntary retirement, is it's a staggered departure and it's really about business continuity as well as the planning that we had started for peak season as we were developing this. So it's really over the next 10, 11 months that we'll see the future retirees leave UPS. So what happens is the full run rate really occurs, call it, post June of 2019, but we'll start seeing more people leave as we get further into the calendar, and as a result, of course, the savings will start building up. When we get to 2019 guidance, we'll give you a little bit better picture. But suffice it to say that when we look at the NPV of a project like this, we did have a $263 million charge, but the annual run rate savings is $200 million, which is very positive, and when we come together in September, we'll talk about these kinds of things in a little bit more detail.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Our next online question comes from Brian Ossenbeck from JPMorgan. What functionally do the new hubs have aside from increasing automation and are you able to build out to handle more oversized or heavy goods throughout your hub networks?","Juan R. Perez - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Yes, this is Juan again. Thanks for the question, Brian. In any new facility, we keep implementing new technology and we continue to take advantage of any new data, any new capabilities that we can use in those facilities. Just to give you an example, we keep implementing state-of-the-art automated small sorts to process our small sorts more effectively. We keep implementing advanced irregular package systems in our facilities. And something that is different from what we used to do in the past is we're leaving room in these new facilities to be able to implement future innovations in automation, things such as robotics and, of course, additional advanced irreg processing systems that can be ready for UPS at different points in time. And, of course, Richard, you have a couple of other points to make?","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Yeah, and I think the other important point is that when we look at the investments we're making against the return on invested capital, we're maintaining the industry leading invested capital returns of between 23% and 28%, and that's all layered in with the capital guide that we've given you really for the next few years and it's about what technology is doing to the operations and how that helps to improve the operating margin that we see going long-term.","James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Let me add one thing. This is Jim. I think that another way to think about it, obviously, within an integrated network like UPS, is it's not one unique discrete piece of technology, it's the connection of all of them together, and when Juan talks about, and we'll talk next year as we get together and go forward to the next guidance of projects like EDGE and NPT and the next phase of ORION and how that connects to all of the pieces of technology, I think that's where the synergies come together in our network that might be different than someone else's network with similar technology.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Our next online question comes from the line of Ben Hartford, R. W. Baird. Please provide perspective on likely outcomes from the EU Court siding with UPS that challenged the attempted acquisition of TNT. Does the decision change UPS's acquisition or operating strategy?","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Okay. This is David. We are pleased that the advocate general's opinion that was released this morning supports our position which, of course, has been that we do not believe that the UPS TNT merger should have been blocked in the first place. Now, we understand this is a non-binding opinion by the advocate general, and we'll await the final decision of the European Court of Justice, we believe later this year. What's really important, though, is from the point of that decision, we made a commitment that we were going to continue to invest in Europe. We said we were going to invest $2 billion, and we are 70% or so of the way through that investment. It has paid off. Jim just spoke earlier about the success that we're having in Europe. And we are very dedicated to growing our business in Europe. We think it is a real strength of our network. And that part will not change based on any decision. So thank you for the question.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Our next online question comes from Kevin Sterling of Seaport Global. As you take additional aircraft, do you think you will have enough capacity for what appears to be a robust peak season and we have to charter aircraft and the timing of the delivery matching the demand in the marketplace?","James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.","So I'll start and then obviously some others may chime in. The aircraft and how we run peak season is just the normal part of peak season planning. I do want to go back to, and we should have the capacity, obviously, to meet the demand, Kate and her team do a great job of connecting with the customer so that we can really forecast that which is becoming, in this world today, it's a very different world than we grew up. So forecasting the demand, getting it right, where it's going to come from is a very important part of the process.","I mentioned a little while ago that we hadn't added aircraft in some time, even though our Express and International businesses have grown. The nice part of where we are right now is we've got six 747-8s in the network now. And remember that a part of that plan all along has been the cascading of aircraft back into the U.S. Typically, that tends to be MD-11s. At times, it can be 767s. By the end of this year we'll have nine of the -8s in play and we're going to have three new 767s in play as well. So the timing of that, with the least aircraft at peak and the cascading we feel like supports obviously this peak season. But remember, this is a multiyear. We're going to do this for the next years to come, continuing to take 6-8's every year and a number of 767s to keep the capacity aligned with the demand.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Our next online question comes from Ravishankar of Morgan Stanley. It looks like Amazon is taking further steps to expand its in-house logistics. Have you seen or do you expect to see any impact?","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","This is David. First, it's not uncommon for large companies to make decisions to insource or outsource portions of their transportation network. So this certainly did not surprise us. It absolutely increases their supplemental growth capacity. We also believe that \u2013 and they'll have to speak for themselves, but that existing partners remain a very important part of their business model. So we closely monitor all of our customers, especially our larger customers, and any competitor announcements. We're not going to be na\u00efve or ignore things that people or entities are doing. We really evaluate all market moves, and the impact that it'd have on our core business, and we feel very comfortable in our ability to compete in our core businesses and we just think the UPS value proposition is very difficult to match, and we will continue to be the best-in-class e-commerce vendor of choice, and so that's really our view here, and thank you for the question.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","We're going to take an online question. This question comes from us from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Do you project the recent rally in oil prices could push some customers to trade down their volume services in the future?","Kathleen M. Gutmann - United Parcel Service, Inc.","So Brian. This is Kate. I'll take that question. Actually, we see more of a tie to business models with our customers and inventory placement, and that typically drives their selection of service. Oftentimes even within their inventory they'll have different valued items and some of those are marked for higher premium services than ground. So no, we don't believe this will cause a shift and do know that there is fuel surcharge on both the air and the ground products. Richard?","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Yeah, and I think it's important to remember that earlier this year we did make some \u2013 I'm sorry, earlier last year, we made some changes to take into account the volatility of fuel into pricing and actually what you see in the last two or three weeks is fuel price has actually come down again and you see it almost right away in our pricing with our customers. But, the fuel surcharge is designed to protect against price changes. It impacts our LTL business, it impacts our small package, both ground and air. And there has been volatility in price and really we're making those adjustments in real-time and so it helps both our customers and it helps UPS to make sure that our actions are aligned and we're changing the \u2013 as we're purchasing in real-time, the effect it has on both the cost side and the revenue side.","Operator","That concludes our Q&A for today. I would now like to turn the program back over to Mr. Scott Childress. Please go ahead, sir.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","We appreciate your time today, and David, your closing comments.","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","As you can tell on this call, and I think on other interactions with UPS, that we are in a new phase in our investment cycle. The Atlanta hub and other projects have begun opening, adding new capacity and capabilities, and you also are starting to see some early transformation initiatives. VRP and the way that we've affected the cash flow, we look forward to sharing more details on our multi-year transformation plans on September 13. We think that will be a good session. UPS continues to see strong growth opportunities as we help our customers with value added supply chain solutions that cover the strategy. We are successfully executing our strategies that benefit our customers and our shareowners.

At this time, we would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations fourth quarter 2017 (sic) [first quarter 2018] earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. And after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Scott Childress, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Welcome to the UPS first quarter 2018 earnings call. Joining me today are David Abney, our CEO; Richard Peretz, our CFO; along with Chief Operating Officer, Jim Barber; Kate Gutmann, our Chief Sales and Solutions Officer; our Chief Information Officer, Juan Perez; and Scott Price, our Chief Strategy and Transformation Officer.","Before we begin, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements and address our expectation for the future performance and results of operations of our company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2017 Form 10-K and first quarter 2018 Form 10-Q. These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the Securities and Exchange Commission.","The webcast of today's call, along with the reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website. Unless stated otherwise, discussions today regarding full year financials will refer to adjusted results. Webcast users can submit live questions during today's call. We will attempt to answer questions of a long-term strategic nature. Callers are asked to submit only one question, so that we may allow as many as possible to participate.","Now, I will turn the call over to David.","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. UPS achieved first quarter earnings per share of $1.55, up 17%. Demand for our services remained strong, with total revenue up more than 10%. The International and Supply Chain units maintained a strong pace, producing double-digit growth in operating profit. These gains helped offset headwinds, including severe weather conditions that weighed on bottom line results in the U.S. Top-line results in the U.S. were strong, with revenue up over 7%.","While we're making progress on the strategies we've shared with you, there's more opportunity for greater returns to shareowners. To capture this potential, we've embarked on a broad transformation of our company. Every part of our business is in scope, and we're moving quickly into a new phase of transformation. We will create greater efficiency throughout our back office and administrative areas, and generate savings through Global Procurement. We're streamlining internal systems and processes and driving improved performance throughout the organization. We will also better align resources to new and emerging growth opportunities.","Yesterday, we announced a voluntary retirement program for eligible U.S. employees. This is the first of many initiatives to reduce cost and improve efficiency in our business. To accelerate our transformation, Scott Price joined UPS as Chief Strategy and Transformation Officer. We also recently announced several senior management changes. Jim Barber was named Chief Operating Officer, with broad responsibility for the operations of the business. We know the secret to our success is in coordination and alignment across our business as we move deeper into transformation. The timing was right for Jim's new position, and he will play a critical role, along with Scott, in ensuring we take full advantage of all the benefits from transformation. Following my remarks, I've asked Jim to comment on his new role.","In addition, during the quarter, we appointed Nando Cesarone as President of International Small Package and George Willis President of U.S. Operations. We are also advancing our global smart logistics network. In fact, we're bringing online additional network capabilities around the world, including more than 400,000 pieces per hour of highly efficient sort capacity this year.","In coming weeks, we'll open new hubs in London and Paris, and this summer, two large regional hubs in Salt Lake City and Atlanta. Operating leverage in our business will improve as we significantly expand our capabilities this year and beyond. Our superior network and operating strategies are enabling UPS customers to take advantage of free trade around the world. UPS supports fair trade agreements like the modernization of NAFTA and other pacts that will make cross-border trade more predictable and easier for businesses of all sizes.","We continue to believe there is a win, win, win for all three countries in an updated NAFTA agreement, and we're encouraged by recent events. Other headlines about trade agreements with South Korea, the reemergence of TPP and trade with China, provide real opportunities to the global economy and to improve standards of living.","Now turning to recent economic forecast. The overall economy is expected to remain strong throughout 2018, with consumer spending and business investment driving economic growth in most markets. Global GDP is projected at about 3.5% in 2018, the fastest expansion since 2010. Strong growth is expected in both Europe and Asia. In addition, worldwide exports are anticipated to grow more than 4.5%. In the U.S., expanding industrial production and retail sales growth is being driven by healthy fundamentals and competitive tax policy. UPS is well-positioned to benefit from this positive outlook.","Before I turn it over to Jim, I want to take a moment and recognize the amazing accomplishments of some extraordinary UPSers. In February, we published our annual list of drivers, who've joined the UPS Circle of Honor. For the first time, we have more than 10,000 drivers around the world who've remained accident-free for 25 or more consecutive years.","In addition, I want to take a moment to recognize a true UPS partner, Myron Gray, for his many years of valued leadership. Myron has made a material impact on UPS during his 40 years, and we wish him the best in his retirement. As we look at the rest of the year, our key transformation initiatives are moving forward. The economic outlook remains positive, and we're sharply focused on executing our growth strategies. Considering the scope of our transformation, we now plan to host a conference in the next several months to give you more details on our new multiyear initiatives and their financial benefits.","Thanks for your time today. Jim?","James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Thanks, David. I'm absolutely excited about my new role, and it's good to reconnect with the U.S. operations. I spent the first half of my career learning, leading and executing in the U.S. and have had the great opportunity to integrate those lessons across the globe over the last 15 years working internationally. More specifically, let me take a moment to review the International and Supply Chain segments, where we're generating great returns for our shareowners.","The results this quarter were robust, double-digit growth in revenue and operating profit. Clearly, this is not where we started in 2014. We've made long strides, and it has taken a lot of hard work and execution by the entire team. Last year, we finished at over $3.2 billion of operating profit, up significantly over where we started, even with the currency headwind, and we're enjoying the benefits from our continued momentum. These results are based on straightforward plans: build sustainable foundations; make the business models more efficient and flexible; and focus on the right growth strategies.","As we look ahead, the pace of business is accelerating, and we are transforming our entire business to connect global buyers and sellers in new ways. We are advancing the capabilities of our global smart logistics network, and this year marks a major step up. We start bringing online new regional hubs, and begin the initial rollout of dynamic ORION as well as Network Planning Tools. We also continue to implement technology projects within the EDGE program. All of these items will drive greater operational efficiency.","Additionally, we're identifying new multiyear transformation projects that bend the cost curve further, making us even more efficient. While all segments will benefit from the new initiatives, the U.S. Domestic segment will enjoy the largest gains as we move faster with transformation.","The future of UPS is being designed to create a more flexible and agile company, and at the same time, enhance our ability to better serve customers. But make no mistake about it, our plans are built on better managing our customer value proposition based on how buyers and sellers consume our integrated networks and our services. We can take the best lessons learned from our International and Supply Chain segments to speed the pace of improvement in all parts of our business.","At a high level, we will continue to follow a straightforward approach to drive execution. Already, many actions are underway, and I look forward to helping drive strategic plans across all of the business units.","Thanks for your time today, and now I will turn it over to Richard.","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Thanks, Jim, and good morning.","As we look across the enterprise, revenue increased more than 10%. Volume growth was strong and product yields expanded. We made $1.55 earnings per share in the quarter, about where we expected. We had strong performance in both the International and Supply Chain & Freight segments, while the U.S. Domestic underperformed, primarily due to difficult weather conditions and some expected headwinds.","Also this quarter, UPS adopted the new FASB accounting standards that shifted items on our income statement. A presentation of the changes can be found in our IR website. We've also added a new section in the web schedules to give investors clarity on the pension changes. For the quarter, the pension accounting change resulted in $285 million of net benefit moving from operating profit to non-operating profit.","Now for the segment detail, in the U.S., revenue was $10.2 billion, an increase of 7.2%. Revenue for all products grew in the quarter, with air expanding faster than ground. High demand for UPS Next Day Air and Deferred Air services was in part driven by e-commerce shippers seeking faster delivery option.","Average daily shipment volume was up 4.6%, with improvements across multiple industry segments, including retail, healthcare, and manufacturing. Reported average revenue per piece increased 2.6%. Base rates increased over 2.5%, with improving trends through the quarter. We continue to identify opportunities to better align pricing to reflect the value creation and cost to serve. As planned, we are implementing additional pricing action on packages with unfavorable characteristics later this year.","Also in the quarter, winter storm activity made working conditions difficult in parts of the U.S. In fact, we experienced weather disruptions in parts of our network during 10 of 13 weeks this quarter. And as a result, we incurred additional operating expense as well as lost revenue. We estimate the impact from weather was a drag on operating profit of about $85 million.","There were also three expected headwinds: first, the continued deployment of Saturday operations; second, the network project yet to come online; and finally, pension expense related to the lower discount rate this year.","In 2018, we are in the first year of a three-year peak capital phase. While we are incurring startup costs today, not all the network benefits will be realized this year, as most of the buildings come online in the second half of the year.","Now looking at the International segment, we are executing unique revenue and growth strategy, leveraging our portfolio to extract the most value. Reported results were outstanding. Revenue and operating profit grew at 15%. On a currency adjusted basis, this is the 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit operating profit growth. Global export shipments per day increased about 12%, with the strongest growth in pan-European cross-border and Europe-to-U.S. and U.S.-to-Europe trade lines.","Also two less days due to the timing of Easter in the local countries impeded export and domestic shipments, and growth was impacted by about 250 basis points. International revenue per package remains firm, with good growth in both export and domestic products. It's due to our superior portfolio and network enhancements that we've invested in. Operating profit increased 15% to $594 million, with all regions contributing to the gain. We had our highest first quarter operating profit, with industry-leading margins at almost 17%, another proof point of the potential upside and momentum in our strategy.","Now, let's look at the Supply Chain & Freight segment. Total revenue jumped 16%, with gains across all business units. Operating profit increased more than 14% to $170 million on top of an over 18% increase in profit last year. Forwarding revenue jumped 27%, as pricing strategies and high-quality service, along with positive market conditions, drove significant improvements over the prior year. Tonnage gains were in the mid-single digits in both international and the North American air forwarding units.","Coyote, our asset-light truck brokerage division, continues to produce significant market gains in the U.S. and are making good progress on their global expansion. The segment's focus on profitable middle-market growth and the ability for customers to ship across our portfolio produced great results, and we expect good momentum moving forward.","Now, let's turn to the balance sheet. We produced strong first quarter free cash flow of about $2.6 billion, a hallmark of UPS, and we're well on our plan to meet our target of $4.5 billion to $5 billion in free cash flow this year. The company distributed $840 million in dividends, which represents nearly a 10% increase per share. We also repurchased 2.2 million shares for just over $250 million. Capital investments came in, as expected, at $1.5 billion as we gear up for deployment and bring several major facilities online in the back half of this year. The benefits from these investments, new multiyear transformation efficiencies and expanding pricing actions position UPS well to continue to achieve our return on invested capital targets of 23% to 28%.","Now, let's turn to taxes. Our effective tax rate came in at just over 19%, due to the annual vesting of stock-based compensation that lowered the rate by about 2.5 percentage points. Also in the quarter was the resolution of discrete tax items for just over $25 million. Currently, we expect our tax rate to be between 23% and 24% for the remaining three quarters of 2018.","Additionally, the U.S. Treasury Department is still defining the tax regulations, and our rate is subject to change as items become final. Further, our cash tax rate should be in the mid- to high-teens during the next few years. This year's rate will be pushed even lower, as benefits from the pension funding will put our rate in the mid-single-digits.","Now turning to guidance. As a reminder, the new transformation initiatives are not included in our guidance. We're well on our way to achieving our financial targets for the year, and we are reaffirming our 2018 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $7.03 to $7.37, an increase of 17% to 23% over last year's results.","2018 is a busy year, with several external and internal moving parts. We felt a closer look at the quarters would be helpful to add clarity. Looking across the remainder of 2018, we anticipate earnings per share growth to be the highest in the second and third quarter in the range of 22% to 26%. Performance in the business is anticipated to be good in the fourth quarter, but will be somewhat offset as the U.S. calendar works against us, with two less operating days in December. Prior year tax benefits are not expected to repeat, and as we open new facilities before the peak season. As a result, fourth quarter earnings per share growth is expected to be in the mid-teens.","We're off to a solid start, with great results in both the International and Supply Chain & Freight segments, helping offset the severe weather impact in the U.S. As we look at the rest of the year, our plans are set. We're growing the business and driving initiatives that increase shareowner value. We look forward to meeting with you in the coming months to discuss the transformation initiatives that we've begun to lay out for you today.","Thank you. And now, I'll ask the operator to open the line. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","I will now turn the program back over to our IRO, Mr. Childress, to start the Q&A segment.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Thank you. We're going to take an online question here. We've got a question from Jack Atkins from Stephens. And Jack's question is about the recent management changes. And can we discuss the appointment of the COO in particular how these changes will improve the business in the next three to five years?","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","In fact, Scott, we had another question that kind of ties into management. You want to give management structure changes, maybe paraphrase that and also who asked the question.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","That was from Brian Ossenbeck. And Brian's question was about U.S. operations and Scott Price's appointment from an external standpoint on to the UPS management team.","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Okay, so both of these questions are about management structure and changes, so I just thought it made sense to answer them together, this is David Abney, of course. And first, I'll start with Scott Price, we brought him in as outside hire to our management committee in December of this year. We did that for a couple of reasons. We knew that we were going to advance our transformation initiatives and just felt like we wanted someone that had been through this before. Different company, connecting industry that we could gain from his expertise, at the same time, he could gain from ours, so very happy to have hired Scott and got him in place.","And we knew that Alan Gershenhorn was going to be retiring as Chief Commercial Officer, so we added strategy to Scott's transformation responsibilities. And that's how we divided that position. So Alan is Chief Commercial Officer with 38 years with UPS, decided to retire, and Alan did exactly what we had asked him to do, which is really focus on the growth and growing the company. And he's done a great job of that so much so that it has placed some challenges on some of our growth plans. So, we've been able to ramp up those growth plans. But real happy for what Alan has been able to do for us.","And then made the decision, I thought the timing was absolutely right with the way things were going to, I asked Jim Barber to take further responsibilities as most people in this call know Jim had been the President of International for a good four or five years, has just done an excellent job.","With transformation going to be a part of the future, just felt like that needed someone that was going to accelerate the implementation of our operating initiatives. We needed to I thought better coordinate and align across our business units because more and more of our business is crossing those business units. And I wanted to make sure we didn't have any silos and felt that this was a way to do it. And I also expected Jim from the operations side to play a big role with Scott in this transformation of UPS.","And then because we promoted Jim, that left us with the International position open, we promoted Nando Cesarone, a Canadian that we've worked throughout the world, and has worked closely with myself and Jim for many years. And then, we also had Myron Gray retire, which just did an excellent job for us. And we had George Willis, who is a very experienced UPSer that not only has worked throughout the U.S., but he's worked in the corporate office, he's worked in the UK, a wide, wide range of experience. So, those are the moves that we have made. They're all geared towards the future, all towards the focus.","And Jim, I'd like to turn it over to you, just talk a little bit about how you see your new role.","James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Okay, I'd be happy to, David. Thanks. So, let me, I guess, reinforce a couple of points. First, extremely excited about this new role. Also, with George and Nando to come into their places, it just continues to talk about the depth of the partnership at UPS. So, really excited to have them in their new roles as well. David just mentioned the great job Alan has done in growing the business, and it really kind of points me back to the international piece of my background.","I think there's a couple of points that we've gone through the last four or five years. Many of you would recall that we were on the verge of a merger with TNT that actually kind of held up our capital expenditure plans for a number of years, then we announced in 2014, the $2 billion expansion. That piece of work aligns very nicely to what's going on in the U.S. for us right now. At the same time, we had to re-gear the network in Asia, and the intra and intercontinental air networks in the international business for the last couple of years. That seems to be very much correlated to, obviously, our U.S. So, those type of learning specifically is where I see us coming back to the U.S. and adding that into the COO role going forward.","I guess three or four quick points to punctuate David's comments of coordination and alignment, because I do see that job as very much about that. First, across the business units, is very key today. Intermodal and how products move and supply chains crosses business units, we think we can do a better job in the years to come to harmonize and align those. The other thing obviously is we start to transform the announcements we've had yesterday and today and will continue to talk about as it gets you to the place of getting the right people and structures in place to really drive maximum value creation. And I'll be involved in helping coordinate that which Scott and the rest of the team launch going forward.","I did make the point about value creation in my opening talk that needs to be reinforced, because that is key, especially in the U.S. business, for us to drive continued value. And ultimately, I think you could boil it down to the fact that my job will be to help say yes and no to the right value creation growth opportunities within the units and across the units in the years to come. So I appreciate that, David, the opportunity.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","We're going to take another question here. This question, we've got three questions in. Brandon Oglenski from Barclays, Keith Schoonmaker from Morningstar, and then, JPMorgan, Brian Ossenbeck. And the question is, we've seen some of your early indications of the company's transformation initiatives. And what are the areas of focus for the company and is there any timeline that you can share with us?","Scott Price - United Parcel Service, Inc.","So, thanks for the question, and let me start by saying that I'm very excited to be part of UPS and part of this transformation. And we've focused our initial work across two categories, foundational and modernization initiatives. We continue to rapidly evaluate and benchmark all aspects of our business and organization. This is not just focused on operations as David said. This is a very broad program. We're identifying a lot of opportunities that are going to create multiyear value, and they're both cost reduction programs, but as well sources of growth moving forward. We started fast, we started with cost, as David mentioned. Yesterday, we announced our first foundational cost initiative, which was a voluntary retirement program, a VRP. It's a cost action that's focused on increasing efficiency and reducing cost through addressing initially span and layer opportunities in the organization. And David also mentioned a second foundational program, which is to drive procurement value through the scale of UPS.","These are really just the beginning of what is going to be a very extensive program. We believe transformation will benefit all aspects in all segments of the business. UPS Domestic will also experience, if not many, maybe potentially even most of the greatest gains. We're moving fast, building broad support within the company. And as Richard mentioned, we'll be sharing more details at an upcoming conference. Thank you.","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","This is David. Great job explaining that, Scott. Really, the reason that it's driving the pace of transformation is just the fact that the pace of change in business is accelerating so quickly. And we feel like that we have to respond and we have to respond with a sense of urgency.","This transformation that Scott talked about is going to generate efficiencies throughout the business. It's going to accelerate growth and it's going to create shareholder value, which is what this is all about. So we're very excited about the start of this. We've got some very good initiatives that's going to make a difference, and there's more to come. And as mentioned earlier, we will have a conference in a few months, and we'll be able to give you a lot more of the details at that time. So thank you for the question.","Operator","Our first online question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, good morning. David, or maybe it's for Richard, if we could dig into that a little bit when you detailed the transformation initiatives large picture, I just want to understand. Is there a dollar value you can talk about? Are you talking about just automation? Is that the reason for the voluntary head count reduction? Is that just part of the upgrades to automate, or can you talk about scale or put a dollar value on it? Can you give us some parameters of what you're doing there?","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Ken, this is Richard. I'll start and then I'm going to pass it to David. There is no change to guidance right now. But as Scott and David mentioned a minute ago, this is a multiyear, multi-phased approach. And as this is finalized, you saw the first action. We'll come together and talk about it in the next several months. But at this point, it's really not just about this year. It's really about the future as well.","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Okay. And, Scott, do you want to add to it?","Scott Price - United Parcel Service, Inc.","I think, Ken, that we're being very thoughtful in how we're going to sequence initiatives that will both be an opportunity for just foundationally reducing cost like our voluntary retirement program, but also future investments that will help create modernization of our overall process. So the combination of those two, we'll be able to share a little bit more detail at the upcoming conference.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. Richard, I wanted to ask you a little bit of a bigger picture question on cash available for return to shareholders. If you look at the business the last five or so years, not a lot of growth CapEx going in, but about $15 billion going into the pension. As you think about the outlook going forward, assuming no dramatic shift in economic activity, assuming no dramatic shift in the interest rate environment, do you think that the burden on cash from operations from pension contribution is still going to be high?","And I guess I'm wondering. Should we be expecting that the cash that's available for distribution to shareholders, even with higher spending, is that going to be at a higher run rate level than we've seen in the past five years or a lower run rate level? I'm just trying to get a sense for how investors should be expecting the cash returns from UPS to change as the pension requirement and funding goes down and the CapEx goes up in the business.","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Sure, David. I think the first thing to remember here is that UPS has always had a philosophy of making sure we give a good return to our shareholders. We increased our dividend this year almost 10%, and we're almost 50 years of increasing or seeing the dividend grow. And so that's an important hallmark of UPS. Another hallmark of UPS is investing in the business, and you've heard some of our plans both for the aircraft and the buildings, and that's really about the growth. And we've had such good growth in revenue on an almost $65 billion to $70 billion company.","That being said, what's going on with pensions today, we did make a decision last year to fund a very large contribution, and it was opportunistic. And it was opportunistic because we took a tax deduction at 35%. Given the current environment today, we don't expect that we'll have more contributions in 2018. And if discount rate changes, that also changes our need to think about funding. And I can tell you right now, we also have \u2013 the discount rate impact is up 50 basis points since the end of the year. And that 50 basis points changes the liability or decreases the liability by a few billion dollars. So we don't expect that we'll continue to fund pension in the way that we have. But Congress made it easier for us to think about funding versus paying the PBGC premiums.","And that does bring you to the free cash flow, and you can see that for the quarter, we were at about just over $2.5 billion of free cash flow on a plan of $4.5 billion to $5 billion, and we're well on our way. And we recognize that part of the benefit we got was getting the refund at 35%. But we still see free cash flow growing over the next few years as all of the initiatives that we've talked about around transformation, the smart logistics network, and then the improving yield that we'll continue to drive will all create better or more free cash flow. Thank you.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","All right, thanks. And maybe just as a very short follow-up, is there a chance that there could be some asset monetization as part of the transformation initiatives? Is there going to be any review of the asset base looking for opportunities to maybe reduce some surplus real estate, things like that?","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","So historically, we've always looked at that. It's not just about transformation. But we tend to buy assets based on what we need and not really inventory excess assets. So I don't see that as a big piece of transformation, but as I said, annually we're going through that process every year, really in the springtime, to think about it and see if there is anything there.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","All right. Thanks a lot for the time, guys.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","We're going to take an online question. This question comes from Scott Schneeberger. And we got a number of questions on the topic. Please discuss how UPS strategically views balancing volume and price over the next two to three years and the potential to exceed the 2% to 3% base rate that we've talked about.","Kathleen M. Gutmann - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Thank you for the question, Scott. It's important to clarify that we don't have a ceiling of 2% to 3%, but rather have a strategy of continuously looking for pricing initiatives which align our revenue to our cost to serve and as well as the value we create for our customers. As an example of that, international currency-neutral revenue per piece increased 3.6%, and U.S. in the two-year stack is up 6% with multiple months above 3%.","We also address characteristic changes and the cost to serve them. Large Packages, for instance, have had an 18.5% increase over the two years and Over Max which are the packages outside of our weight and size limits but still get into our network increased 350% over those two years. So we will continue to work on base rates and increase throughout the year as planned. Thanks so much.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Our next question is coming from Keith Schoonmaker from Morningstar. And basically, we've got a couple of questions here about the performance of international. Keith's question specifically is the firm announced strong investment in Europe over the last few years of $2 billion. What have you really accomplished to date and what remains?","James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.","This Jim. I'll take that one obviously. I think a point I'd like to start with is that while Europe is obviously performing very well for us, one of the points we've continued to make over the last couple quarters is that probably the biggest benefit to how international is performing today is the balance in it. So it is growing everywhere. It's very balanced and the network is continuing to create additional flywheels as we go forward.","Specifically on Europe to the point, I mentioned it a few minutes ago, we've chosen Europe in late 2013, early 2014 that we needed to and invest in it just like the same way we're looking at the U.S. network right now. We also looked at our capabilities and we saw our Transborder network needed to be upgraded. We did that in waves through 2015, 2016 and 2017, both ground and air. The specific $2 billion investment, we're about 70% of the way through. This first quarter, we've opened a couple of new buildings. On the back of that as we expanded the network, we've introduced new services in Turkey, Express Services, and so we \u2013 big buildings and it has been mentioned previously will come online this year in Paris and Canada. Bielefeld is going to have a big one coming on as well as London.","So like I said, about 70% of the way through, all of it continues to create value. You can see it in the growth numbers and the margin numbers. And we feel like a lot of those learnings certainly transport back to the U.S. investments we're making here as well. So appreciate the question.","Operator","And we have a question from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey, thanks. Good morning. Let me come back to pricing for a minute, and maybe sort of mix it in with the transformation initiatives I guess, when you think about the first to pricing and sort of addressing some of the mix shift dynamics between B2B and B2C in the domestic business, how far along do you feel like you are on that process? And then should we expect meaningful sort of changes in your approach to market on the pricing side as part of the transformation initiatives?","Kathleen M. Gutmann - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Thank you, Chris. This is Kate. And, yes, as part of transformation, as a part of our ongoing strategy, with the characteristic changes in the marketplace, we absolutely are taking a keen focus on aligning even further cost to serve with pricing to make sure that we get compensated for the value we're delivering.","And to that point, we're also creating solutions such as synthetic density with those changing characteristics to convert B2C, for instance, into B2B packages. Access points is a good example of that as well as we are the market leader in returns. And that goes hand-in-hand with B2C and as you know is a high density delivery address. So both through the pricing as well as the solution set, we are addressing the changing characteristics in the marketplace. Thanks for the question.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","We've got a question. This question comes from Dave Ross at Stifel. And he's asking for preliminary thoughts on the ongoing Teamsters negotiation, granted they would do you expect to have a contract completed before the termination of the contract July 31?","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","This is David. I'll take that and then Jim, since you have labor, if you want to add anything to it. Our agreement expires August 1. So far we've held six week-long sessions. There's been progress made on several non-economic matters, and we are confident that we can reach an agreement that would reward our employees but also keep UPS competitive in this changing world that we live in that has both traditional and non-traditional competitors.","So we really don't negotiate through the media. So although incorrect information comes out, we certainly correct that. But we have the right people negotiating on our end. I think that the more successful UPS is, the more that we can hire additional Teamsters and the better jobs that our people will have. So just like any negotiations, there's give-and-take, there's good days and bad days, but overall I feel confident that we certainly can reach an agreement.","James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.","This is James. I'd just add a couple of points to reinforce what David said. Remember we have shared objectives here. It's to create jobs and have career opportunities and serve customers, and that's been going on for many decades. I think the uniqueness of what comes into play now as well is the pace of change and the need for continued flexibility to be adaptive. And so working together with the Teamsters that will be some of the highlighted areas we go forward and get done, and hopefully get it done in the short order. But I think David's points are very right on the point about how the negotiation will transpire going forward, so.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Tom Wadewitz. Please go ahead.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Yes. Good morning and thank you. David, just a question for you. It really from the outside seems that UPS, under your leadership over \u2013 I don't know \u2013 the past year or maybe longer is taking more aggressive steps than you have in the past. I think we can look at that in terms of the pace of change at the management committee level, a higher CapEx budget, more aggressive investments, you've got the transformation initiatives. So from the outside, it does appear that you're taking a pretty aggressive approach.","My question is, is that something that we should view as driving potential improvements in the longer-term performance of domestic package business that this is offensive and we can see margin improvement looking out? Or is this something that is more a reflection of the big changes that are taking place in your core domestic market and this is really necessary to sustain what's historically been a very strong position for you? So, sorry, that's a bit longwinded, but just trying to get a sense is this \u2013 all this change puts you in an offensive position or is it kind of defense versus a rapidly changing market? Thank you.","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Okay, Tom. Thanks for the question. I'll take the first part of it, then I'll hand it over to Richard. And I do agree with the way you position the question. And I think the longer we wait to take on some of these challenges, which are also opportunities, the more defensive position we would be in. We made a conscious decision that we needed to take an offensive position, and we needed to readjust our strategic initiatives, and we needed to ramp up our investments and we needed to \u2013 I'd call it, supercharge the level of change that we are doing in our company. We have this proud company that's been very successful, and we're all glad to be a part of that.","But we issued a challenge to our people, and that was that if we continue to do business the same way we do today, and this was a year or two ago, that we didn't see as rosy a future for the company or for the shareholders as we would if we took a much more aggressive stand that if we charged into the future and that's what you've been seeing as do the last 1.5 year or so. And that's what we will continue to do. Take ourselves out of our comfort zone, address the opportunities that have been given in front of us. Richard, why don't you give a few examples of what I'm talking about?","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","When we look right now, we know that we're in the first year of a three-year, we call it, peak capital. And what you see in 2018 is you're going to get a lot of capacity that we haven't really seen added to the network. And that's all going to come in the second half of the year. So we've got a lot of the upfront expense in our numbers, with the benefits start layering-in in 2019 and in 2020. And that's one of the reasons that we called out specifically that the op expense and the Saturday capability were investments.","We're now looking right now at about 50% of the population on Saturday. A year ago, we were effectively at probably under 3% or 4% of the population on Saturday. So when you look at the op expense, you kind of see things like that going on along with the step-up costs required as you open a building before the building opens.","When we look at the quarter itself, what we recognize is on an apples-to-apples basis, we do see the business about where it was last year. But understand that it's being masked because you've got about $230 million in the domestic that was a credit that is no longer in the operating margin. You've got discount rate change, the weather, along with all these investments. But underlying or masking all of our underlying performance, are these callouts? And we do have a deliberate strategy over the next few years to continue to see benefits, to improve both the margin and leverage, and I think that's coming through the pricing information Kate talked about, the initiatives, both transformation and the smart logistics network, as well as the efficient use of that capital that's coming in. Thank you.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","We're going to take an online question. This question comes from Helane Becker from Cowen. And her question is as you think about the investments you are making for the long-term, are you confident that you're getting ahead of the growth?","Juan R. Perez - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Good morning. Thanks for the question. A couple of things that we wanted to mention on that question. First, we're very busy building capacity and capabilities to support growth and continue to build out our smart logistics network. To support that growth, we're building not only regional hubs, but we're also modernizing facilities. We're bringing more automation into play. We're increasing capacity, all with good return on investment. Just to give you an example, in 2018 alone, we will be opening 18 new or modified facilities, and we will also be increasing capacity in our small sorts with the opening of multiple small sorts.","In total this year, we will have an additional new 5 million square feet of sort capacity, and that's not only for the Domestic side. We're also building out for International 1 million square feet in places like Paris, Eindhoven, and Montr\u00e9al. And I would say here in the U.S., places that definitely need that capacity, like Atlanta, Phoenix, Salt Lake City, Kentucky, Florida, they will all some good necessary capacity. We have more projects coming in line in 2019 and 2020. And we will continue to review trends to make adjustments as needed. Thanks for the question.","James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.","I want to add a point. This is Jim. Real quick on the point is that as we build capacity, there are some key priorities that we have to keep in mind, and that is that what goes in the networks have to be right for the network to drive the right ROIC. We've talked about that concept here this morning. And we do think, by the way, as package sizes are changing across global supply chains, it's where some of the unique opportunity exists to start going across business units, and leverage the power of our supply chain business next to our express business, next to the domestic businesses. So yes, it's about capacity, but it's also making sure that the right products are going in the right networks at the right price points to drive the ROICs and our shareholders' return, and we're confident that a lot of this transformation is going to take us there.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Let's take another online question. This question is coming from Jairam Nathan from Daiwa. His question is, do you see Amazon extending its presence in your sector through Ship with Amazon initiatives, and is that a lingering issue for the industry?","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","This is David. It's very hard to predict what Amazon or any other of our large shippers are going to do. And we make sure that we evaluate any market moves, whatever impact it would have on our business, and then we monitor and we react accordingly.","When it comes to e-commerce, we really feel that we are the vendor of choice. It's a fast-growing opportunity that we're best-in-class and our network is scalable, difficult to match because of the density and our diverse customer base.","And when it comes to the B2B side of the business, we can talk about B2C so much that we sometimes just don't mention the fact that we are the largest shipper of B2B. It is right in our sweet spot. And we work with all customers, large and small, and marketplace and traditional retailers, and we will continue to do so. So we think we have a good relationship, mutually beneficial relationship with Amazon, but we're open for business for all retailers, big and small. And thank you for the question.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Matt Reustle of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Matthew Reustle - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to touch on your guidance for free cash flow in 2018. I know there are some one-time items in there. But when you look at what's coming on in the back half of the year, it seems like you should have some pretty good operating momentum into 2019 and obviously beyond. So is it achievable to hit that $4.5 billion again in 2019 and 2020? Can you talk on a little bit of that, of how much operating momentum you'll have, and how that will translate into free cash flow?","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Matt, I think the first thing to remember is that $4.5 billion to $5 billion we did call out that the tax helped us, and that's one of the reasons we've had actually the best free cash flow we've seen in more than a decade for this quarter. That being said, we do see improving impacts from the different initiatives, but the timing is slightly off, and it's just a little too early for me to tell you exactly how 2019 and 2020 will \u2013 but I will tell you that if you take 2017 as a reference point and 2018, we'll be closer to 2018. But I just can't give you enough information yet because we're still finalizing some plans on some of the transformation as well as other strategic initiatives we have that we need to vet out before I give the guidance on 2019.","Matthew Reustle - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Understood, thank you.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","We're going to take an online question. This question comes from Dave Ross of Stifel. His question is, when do you get the 747-8 start entering the fleet? Will they compete in the airfreight market at all or just focus on UPS International Package? And then, how many are growth versus replacement aircraft?","James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.","That's from David I think. So it's Jim. Let me field that one. It's a couple of questions in there all together. I'll try and package it. They started entering the fleet late last year in 2017, to this quarter, five. All of them began their life, if you will, out in Asia. But remember, this is all about growth, capacity in a cascading effect all back into the United States to upgrade our aircraft. At this point, they're not taking aircraft out. We have to adjust as life goes forward.","But I can tell you a couple of things. Obviously, we know about the efficiency and the great benefits the 747-8s bring into the network. With five of them in here, now we connect the network, and we've also been able in the first quarter to launch our first direct flight 747 from Louisville to Dubai as part of the addition of the networks, which is great. All of the 747-8s are managing to run at about 95% utilization across this network, so the timing couldn't be better.","Filling out this year, we're all done with this year. Looking forward, we should have nine new ones come into fleet, a mix of 747-8s and 767s. The concept of what you use them for, you use them for the right revenue per plane that makes it work, and that's usually a blend of obviously the Package business. We put some freight on them when it's right, and at other times, we'll put other mix on them. But in general, that very much aligns to the strategy and across the entire global network. It starts in Asia, but really ripples through the whole network. So that's how we are, David?","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Jim, you did mention first, daily flight to Dubai. Could you talk a little bit more about that and tie it into this Expo 2020, our plans?","James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Absolutely. When David asked me to step into the international position a few years ago, one of the white spots we saw on the map was the Middle East. We knew we had just kind of our model, had not really put our brand where it needed to be. So in 2014-2015, we launched the Indian subcontinent, Middle East and Africa piece of the business. It typically now is the fastest growing piece of the network across the globe. At the same time we saw great value and some of the partnership opportunities we signed on with Expo 2020. As the official logistics provider, our partnerships and customer collaboration have continued to grow over the last four or five years.","And we felt like the time was right here in the beginning of 2018, giving the trade connections and our growing U.S. export business to put a direct flight in. And so we picked up a day. Our customers are excited about it. As much as that, the connection inside of the Middle East now expands itself and we are able to actually pull business out of the other geos into the Middle East. So we're really excited about that, and that connection from Louisville direct to Dubai is just the next step as we move towards 2020.","Operator","Next question will come from the line of Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Supply Chain & Freight is growing very nicely right now. Could you just address some of the strategic moves you're making there to take advantage of the good environment? And also address maybe some of the things you're doing on the expense side to address that specifically? Thanks.","James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Sure, Scott. This is Jim again. That, with many of the other initiatives started three or four years ago, where we looked at our distribution business, our supply chain business. Coyote was not in the network yet, Marken hadn't come on yet, but we knew that it also needed to be essentially to certain extent transformed. It ties into the work now that Scott, and we've talked about here this morning, but we needed to really start to lower the cost base and be very selective about getting the right mix in those businesses.","Oftentimes, it meant middle market, different geos, different verticals. We always had the health care business as one of our key strategic verticals and we've kind of stuck to our knitting quite frankly. We've continued to add to them. We'll talk about that more perhaps in a couple of months. But the last two points I'd like to reinforce as well as some of the acquisitions that we've made, obviously, David talked about the growth that Alan brought to us the last couple of years.","The acquisition of Coyote you are seeing start to manifest itself on the supply chain. Marken came on a little while ago in the health care space as well. It's doing very, very well for us and the supply chain segment for us, it continues to have different capabilities, very much aligned to the strategy. And they like the International Package business and certainly the U.S. going forward continue to optimize themselves and grow and become more material in the portfolio. So we're excited about that as well, and transformation will continue to fuel the supply chain segment. So, appreciate the question.","Operator","I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Childress. Please go ahead, sir. That does conclude our Q&A.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Thank you for joining us. David, I'll turn it over to you for closing comments.","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Okay, thanks, Scott. We have, as you can tell, expanded the scope of our transformation. The new multiyear initiatives will make UPS more efficient.

My name is Steven and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise and after the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Joe Wilkins, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.","Joe Wilkins","Good morning and welcome to the UPS first quarter 2015 earnings call. Joining me today are David Abney, our CEO; Kurt Kuehn, our CFO, along with International President, Jim Barber; President of U.S. Operations, Myron Gray, Chief Commercial Officer, Alan Gershenhorn and Richard Peretz, Corporate Controller and Treasurer.","Before we begin, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the Company. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties which are described in detail in our 2014 Form 10-K. This report is available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the Securities and Exchange Commission.","The webcast of today's call along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures are available on the UPS Investor Relations website. And just a reminder, please ask only one question so that we may allow as many as possible to participate.","Thanks for your cooperation. Now we'll turn the call over to David.","David Abney ","Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our first quarter 2015 earnings review. We will talk in a few moments about the CFO transition announced this morning, but first, we are going to review the quarter. ","I am pleased to report UPS produced solid performance across all the segments. Earnings per share increased more than 14% led by International. This segment continues to demonstrate positive momentum as our unmatched integrated network generates high returns and significant value for customers around the world.","The US Domestic segment performed as planned. Our actions on revenue management and pricing drove revenue per piece higher during the first quarter. The pace of volume moderated as we chose to forego some lower yielding opportunities. And in the Supply Chain and Freight segment, revenue and operating profit improved over last year as all three business units made progress. ","The first quarter\u2019s results demonstrate that we are on track with our core business initiatives, both for the remainder of 2015 and for our long-term financial targets. Last year, at the Investor Conference, we outlined five key investment areas. These include improvements in capacity, efficiency and our strategies for growth markets. ","In addition, we\u2019ve detailed our industry-specific focus and the One UPS initiative. We are moving forward in all five areas. In terms of greater efficiency, we improved productivity and operating leverage during the quarter. Investments in hub automation and route optimization projects are on schedule. ","In fact, we expect the accelerated deployment of ORION will reduce a 100 million miles annually once fully implemented. We are on plan to complete 70% of driver routes by the end of this year. To support the core business initiative of expanding industry-specific solutions, UPS enhanced two services to assist healthcare customers. ","We introduced our new Temperature True Packaging service which includes expert consultation and exclusive packaging options. These shipping containers are pre-qualified for use in our network and designed to fit our customers\u2019 budget and risk requirements. ","Next was the expansion of our international special commodities program to 20 new destination countries. This allows UPS customers to ship biologic samples and specimens to more than 50 nations. These solutions will provide growth opportunities with new and existing healthcare clients. ","Our third initiative is capitalizing on growth markets. As demonstrated by our International segment, especially the strong growth that we continue to produce in Europe. The multi-year investments we\u2019ve made there have positioned UPS to extend our ten plus years of near double-digit growth rates for the region. ","Another great example of a growth opportunity for UPS is the online retail. To strengthen our position as the e-commerce shipper of choice, we are expanding the access point network, our unique network of retail locations that both improves the consumers\u2019 experience and provides better stop economics. ","In January, we increased the US footprint to include the more than 4400 UPS store locations. In May, we will add non-UPS store locations in the Boston, San Francisco and Washington DC metro markets. These expansions will bring the total access point locations to more than 20,000 by the year end. This unique channel is a key component of our global B2C strategy. ","As I reviewed at the Investor Conference, combining the many capabilities of UPS to meet customers\u2019 supply chain needs is the foundation of our One UPS strategy. To increase awareness, we began a campaign to highlight the breadth of services that differentiates UPS in the marketplace. ","The tagline says it all. We are UPS, and to customers, we are united problem solvers. This play on our name and the entire campaign invites shippers to experience the can do, customer-centric, problem-solving culture of UPS. ","The goal is, both the new customer acquisition and deeper collaboration with existing shippers. These five investment areas are key to achieving our financial targets. ","I want to reinforce that UPS is intensely focused on creating and enhancing long-term shareowner value. This will be achieved by providing differentiated solutions delivered by highly skilled UPS. ","Our belief in both the UPS business model and the execution of our strategy was conveyed by the recent 9% dividend increase. We have a 46 year history of providing UPS investors an increasing or stable dividend. When combined with share repurchases, we expect total returns to shareholders to exceed 100% of our net income again this year. ","This quarter clearly affirms that we are moving in the right direction and on track to achieve our financial objectives. ","Now, Kurt will take you through the details. ","Kurt Kuehn","Well, thanks, David and good morning. The first quarter results show good progress across all segments. The US performed well and is successfully implementing a disciplined pricing strategy. International continues to produce strong momentum with a balance of growth, pricing and operating performance, and Supply Chain and Freight achieved solid results considering the turbulence created by the port disruption. ","As David mentioned, UPS earnings per share improved more than 14% over last year. Digging into the numbers, the impact of currency and fuel price changes have made comparisons to last year complex. But we\u2019ll try to make it clear as we move through the segment results. ","Let me begin with the US Domestic segment, which reported revenue gains of 3.8% as a result of volume growth and improved pricing. Average Daily Package volume increased 2.4% driven by Deferred Air growth of more than 12% and UPS SurePost gains of 7%. ","Shipment growth rates were a little bit slower as the company chose not to pursue some lower yielding contract renewals. During the quarter, we saw balanced growth in both B2B and B2C shipments. Revenue per package increased 1.3% as base rate improvements overcame about a 200 basis point reduction in fuel surcharges. Ground yield was up 3.1%, primarily due to the dim weight change and other revenue management actions. ","Operating profit grew 11% to more than $1 billion. Margin expanded by 70 basis points supported by productivity improvements. Direct labor hours grew at a slower pace than volume. ","Now for the International segment, which continues to make substantial gains around the world, revenue on a currency-adjusted basis increased 2.4% over last year. International operating profit was up 14% to $498 million. ","Margin expanded 280 basis points to 16.8%. Volume growth, pricing initiatives and the benefit from the lag in fuel surcharges, all contributed to margin expansion. In addition, our currency hedging strategy also aided results. ","Daily shipments were 4.6% higher led by export products up 6.7%. This gain was driven by impressive growth in Europe, up more than 9% and we expect strong volume growth there to continue. Base rates improved across all regions and products, although they were masked by currency and changes in product mix and about a 300 basis point impact from lower fuel surcharges. ","Mix shift changes continued as trans-border volume grew faster than intercontinental shipments, and deferred products continued to outpace express products. ","Now, turning to Supply Chain and Freight, which performed about as expected. Revenue increased 1.3% to $2.2 billion driven by growth in distribution in UPS Freight. Excluding the impact of currency, revenue increased by 4.2%. ","Operating profit increased to $151 million and margin was 6.9%. The Forwarding unit improved operating profit and expanded margin over the same period last year. Congestion at West Coast Port terminals created challenges for many ocean freight customers. But the multi-modal flexibility of the UPS portfolio allowed customers to accelerate their ocean freight or re-route to non-affected ports. ","Looking at distribution, where revenue was up at a mid-single-digit pace. This unit continues to deliver top-line growth as more customers in the healthcare and retail sectors seek out our industry-specific solutions. ","Continued investments in technology and infrastructure pressured margins. UPS freight revenue increased by 2.3%. LTL shipments per day increased 3.5% over the prior year period. LTL revenue per hundred weight increased by 1.1%, but was negatively impacted by almost 500 basis points due to lower fuel surcharges. The unit is focused on providing mid-market customers with broader solutions and technology they value. ","Now for an update on our cash position. The company generated $2.4 billion in free cash flow continuing our strength and providing flexibility to fund our growth projects. Regarding share under distributions, in addition to the dividend increase that David mentioned, the company repurchased more than 6.7 million shares for approximately $680 million. ","As we look at our 2015 guidance, the first quarter did come in little better than anticipated with some help from fuel. Remember, as I said on the last call, first and fourth quarter\u2019s earnings growth would likely be higher than the year\u2019s average, while comparisons for the second and third quarter will be below the year\u2019s average. ","Basically though, the 2015 quarterly results should return to the more typical UPS annual profit distribution. US Domestic volume growth should increase about 3% with revenue growing at a slightly faster pace. ","We expect base rates to be up approximately 3% at the top of our typical target range. However, lower fuel surcharge revenue will continue to weigh on reported yields. And last, our International revenue on a currency-neutral basis is expected to be up 2% to 3%. ","In summary, our full year earnings per share guidance is unchanged as $5.05 to $5.30, up 6% to 12% over last year. ","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to David. ","David Abney","As you know, UPS issued a second press release announcing the retirement of Kurt Kuehn and the appointment of Richard Peretz as CFO. Kurt has served UPS for nearly 38 years and has been the CFO for the last eight. I have come to relying on his leadership and support over many years. ","I\u2019ve also worked with Richard in previous assignments, especially when we were on the front-lines of expanding UPS\u2019s International footprint. He has broad financial leadership experience and operations and corporate across many aspects of the finance area. ","He is well prepared to take on this elevated responsibility. Kurt will be with us as CFO until July 1st in order to assist Richard and the UPS team with the transition. An important part of that transition will include visits with investors for Richard to gain further insights into our company and markets. ","Following the Q&A period, I am going to turn the phone over to Kurt for closing remarks, but now, I\u2019d like to introduce, Richard. ","Richard Peretz","Thanks, David for this opportunity and thanks, Kurt for your support throughout my career and now, as I enter this new role. I am looking forward to the challenge and I am honored to be part of the team leading this great company for the future. I\u2019ll soon be hitting the road with Kurt and the IR team. I am intent on listening and learning and then integrating those perspectives into my own. ","I\u2019ll save my comments for future meetings after I\u2019ve spent a little more time adjusting to the job and the new responsibilities. Kurt?","Kurt Kuehn","Great. Congratulations again, Richard. Richard and I\u2019ve worked together for more than 20 years on many of the most important company developments throughout our shared history. I think he will learn that he has tremendous ability to simplify complex business issues and develop a sound financial perspective, even on the most difficult transactions and issues. He is a capable leader who is ready to take on the critically important job of guiding the company\u2019s financial strategies and leading the financial team. ","And I can\u2019t hope but note, Richard that since this is your first appearance on an earnings call, it will also be your easiest. I am still going take on point on answering questions for this quarter, but Q2 will be yours and with David\u2019s leadership and the rest of the management team of course to help. ","David, I\u2019ll turn it back over to you. ","David Abney","Okay, operator, let\u2019s\u2026 ","Kurt Kuehn","Wait, wait, let me do this last one, okay. ","David Abney","Okay, Kurt. Be my guest. ","Kurt Kuehn","Okay, great. Okay, operator, it is my pleasure for the last time to say, we are now ready to take questions on the quarter. Please open the lines. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Your first question will come from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead.","David Vernon","Thanks for taking the question and congratulations to both Kurt and Richard. ","Kurt Kuehn","Thanks, David. ","David Vernon","Little bit about pricing, can you talk about the progress and results that you guys have seen and implementing dim weight in the Domestic segment and provide any kind of additional insight into customer feedback on peak pricing initiatives that were discussed last call?","Kurt Kuehn","Sure, the \u2013 clearly, you can see on our reported yields that even with the headwinds of fairly substantial fuel surcharges, we showed substantial gain. So, the dim weight is one piece of that. Alan, maybe you could talk a little more about the revenue management more ahead. ","Alan Gershenhorn","Yes, Kurt. Pricing has been a real positive story. We are certainly proud of our sales and marketing team discipline and the value selling. As you can see, we were 200 basis points better than last year\u2019s year-over-year growth rate with even a much larger fuel drag. So the impact came at the high-end of our expectation range and certainly the dim weight along with other revenue management practices contributed to that. ","Also on the call, previously, Kurt\u2019s and I believe David\u2019s comments, they talked about us not renewing some lower yield in customers. Switching to peak real quickly, we\u2019ve got a comprehensive strategy in place that\u2019s already begun to increase the revenue from customers that urge during the peak season and then also drive additional operating expenses. ","Price increases again it can be generally applied to the residential products and other high cost areas, but they will vary by customer and those revenue initiatives are already built into the guidance. ","David Vernon","Thanks, just as a clarification, as far as the number of customers that are paying a dim weight, are there a large \u2013 is there a large percentage of shippers that maybe gotten a waiver and that\u2019s going to be out there in the future? Or can you give us a sense for kind of what percentage of customers actually took that dim weight charge in this year? ","Kurt Kuehn","Yes, David, we\u2019ll save that for the next questioner. Let\u2019s move on. ","David Vernon","All right, thanks. ","Operator","The next question will come from Mr. Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Please go ahead.","Tom Wadewitz ","Yes, thank you and, Kurt, congratulations to you. I\u2019ve worked with you for a long time, remember back when you are Head of IR and it\u2019s really been a pleasure working with you over the years. So, congratulations on the retirement and Richard, congratulations to you as well. ","Kurt Kuehn","All right. ","Tom Wadewitz ","Let\u2019s see. So, I think, I want to ask a little bit more on the pricing, the strategy, how much is this change in terms of the yield management that you would expect affecting going forward? Are we going to hear more about yield management and turning away business and perhaps even acceleration in pricing from what we\u2019ve seen in first quarter? Or is this more of a one-off where it was a particular piece of business that was kind of a one-time thing? ","Kurt Kuehn","No, I think, we are pursuing a consistent revenue management strategy. We have talked last year that following peak season, we were going to migrate and to being more price disciplined. And so, this is not a one-time issue. It\u2019s just a continuation of our strategy. ","David Abney","Our revenue management initiatives certainly are gaining traction. We expect that to continue, but we have to remember, this is a multi-pronged strategy. I mean, yes we are working on pricing initiatives and especially along peak season lines, but we are also focusing on creating unique solutions for our customers that brings additional value. ","And then of course, focusing on operating efficiencies that would give us the results we want to. So, it\u2019s a multi-prong strategy and it\u2019s something that will be throughout the year. ","Tom Wadewitz ","Thank you. ","Operator","The next question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Ken Hoexter ","Great, thank you and good morning and I\u2019ll let go that, congrats Kurt, it\u2019s been great working with you for almost 15 years and welcome to Richard. If we could just jump over to International a bit, you\u2019ve posted a increase in profitability up about 280 basis points on the margin. ","Can you talk \u2013 you talked a lot about the cost, David on the Domestic side, and what you\u2019ve put in place. But a big upside, I think surprise on the International side. Can you kind of walk us through where \u2013 what cost kind of you focused on there or was it more of the volume side or was it the cost side that enabled that increase? ","Kurt Kuehn","Well I think, you\u2019ll - I think it\u2019s a blend of all of those, but Jim, why don\u2019t you take us through the quarter? ","Jim Barber","Sure, I would appreciate the question. I think it is a blend. I think if you start in Europe, you\u2019ve heard us talk for a couple of quarters about the growth there and some of the challenges we had and the Group has done a great job over the last couple of quarters to put that into the network and you also heard us discuss the expansion of the network in Europe in investment, that\u2019s starting to payoff as well and some of the operating efficiencies and I think the other big one for us in the quarter is out in Asia. ","Even with some of the slower growth, I think the team has done a very good job to cut the network and balance what\u2019s going into the network and I would say, those are the two biggest drivers especially in the Inter-Asia network and the European network as well to drive the numbers this quarter. ","Ken Hoexter ","Thanks, I appreciate the insight. ","Operator","The next question will come from the line of Kevin Sterling of BB&T Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Kevin Sterling ","Thank you and, Kurt, let me say my congratulations as well on your pending retirement. I\u2019ve enjoyed working with you over the years and best of luck to you. ","Kurt Kuehn","Thanks. ","Kevin Sterling ","Maybe, can you guys talk a little bit about some of the trends you are seeing in April? Particularly, on the International side and in LTL, are you still seeing some benefit from the West Coast Port diversions and congestions? ","Kurt Kuehn","Yes, I think a lot of that\u2019s cleared up. I don\u2019t know, Myron, any particular trends on the LTL side do you think are notable?","A \u2013 Myron Gray","On the volume. We are seeing the same thing happened in April that we saw in our first quarter with stable improvements we expect that will have 3% to 3.5% growth and freight market moving forward. So no particular issues there. ","Kurt Kuehn","Yes, barring a little labor disruption on the ports, of course, given the latest guidelines, yes.","Kevin Sterling ","Okay, thank you. ","Operator","The next question will come from the line of Mr. Art Hatfield of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Art Hatfield","Hey, thank you. Me likewise, Kurt, congrats and it\u2019s been great working with you. Glad that you finally decided that you had enough of us. ","Kurt Kuehn","No. And it was a full dose. ","Art Hatfield","I am sure. Going back to the comment on your pricing strategy, real quick and being more disciplined, can you talk a little bit about what you see in customer actions that when you decide to walk away? ","I mean, what\u2019s your kind of history with that? Do you see customers coming back to you after a short period of time when you do something like this asking you to come back as they miss the service? And really are they ultimately going to see higher pricing in the long run and why would they allow you to walk away from them at this point in time? ","Kurt Kuehn","Yes, that\u2019s \u2013 certainly, pricing decisions are complex and it depends a lot on the relationship and the nature of the volume that\u2019s being entered to it. But, Alan, if you could talk a little more about our approach? ","Alan Gershenhorn","It really all comes down to, I think what David talked about the balance as well as the value that we are creating for the customers. So, we are very focused on creating value for the specific industries that we are targeting and yes, in some cases, we do see those customers come back. But I just want to reiterate that we are firm in our strategy to further align the revenue with the cost throughout the year including peak season. ","David Abney","You know, and I think, I\u2019d probably word it just a little bit different than maybe on the question, as far as walking away, I think it\u2019s more that we do choose sometimes not to pursue some of these lower yielding contract renewals. But we are constantly working with our customers on how we can add value and how we can optimize our network for them. So it\u2019s not like we just walk away. We try to give options and we try to show the value. There are some cases that we choose not to pursue. ","Art Hatfield","Right. Thanks for your time this morning. ","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Bill Greene ","Yes, hi there, good morning. Kurt, congrats again. Wish you all the best. Richard, congrats, by my condolences. So, I wanted to ask a little bit more of a broader question. Of course, we\u2019ve seen FedEx take action in Europe and they will spend sometime absorbing TNT now integrating it. Can you talk a little bit about how you see the broad global landscape now after that change? ","Obviously, in the interim, you will try to win I am sure some share in Europe. But, does this make other aspects of the world, other areas of the world more attractive? Should we think more about growth in Asia given the changing playing field in Europe? Can you talk a little bit about how you see that evolving? Thank you. ","David Abney","Certainly, I can, first, I\u2019ll just remind everyone that the FedEx, TNT deal that is complex deal and we expect that regulatory agencies will be as stringent on this deal as they have been on previous deals. Then when you talk about opportunities in Asia. Obviously, Asia and emerging markets were always pursuing those opportunities. ","Let\u2019s don\u2019t forget the fact that that we have experienced just great returns from our Europe markets and we certainly don\u2019t expect that to change. Over the last ten years, our Europe export average daily volume has more than doubled and we\u2019ve previously announced a five year capital deployment plan that\u2019s approaching about $2 billion. So, we are adding capacity. We are expanding our capabilities. We have a real good business in Europe and we expect it to continue to grow and we are as excited as we have been at any time about Europe. ","Bill Greene ","Thanks. ","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of David Ross Stifel. Please go ahead.","David Ross ","Yes, good morning gentlemen. Just to follow-up on the question regarding Europe. The exports are certainly strong driven by the weak euro, but domestic Europe was also up year-over-year. Can you talk a little bit about the overall European market, what you see in terms of the European economy right now and going forward? ","David Abney","Jim? ","Jim Barber","Sure, David, the \u2013 I guess, I\u2019ll just hit on trade flows real quickly. The kind of the balance of the network certainly at this point with the strength of the dollar, we are seeing a move of imports to exports. Europe is a big piece of that. We kind of right now after the first quarter have a gap of about 6% between growth of imports and exports. We\u2019ll balance that. ","We have to balance the network. We\u2019ll look at how we rate export and import rates across the world, but that\u2019s just part of the normal running of the business. The domestic in Europe, specifically, that just is a continuation of the investments over the last decade as David referenced. We continue to do that and invest in some of those. The acquisitions we\u2019ve made over the previous years help us grow. So, the solutions that are in place will are paying off and they will continue to pay off going forward. ","Operator","We have a question from the line of Ben Hartford of Baird. Please go ahead.","Ben Hartford ","Hi, good morning guys. Jim, I guess, I am interested in the comment that you had made of a better balance in Asia and I am curious about your perspective as it relates to outbound Asian Air Freight post-Chinese New Year and as we look into 2Q and 3Q with the US West Coast situation presumably normalizing, do you expect further cuts or would the next step be to add incremental pet capacity in that trans-stack lane and just outbound Asia generally, as we look into 2013 there has been \u2013 2015, there has been a lot of debate about a demand to outbound China here year-to-date. I am interested in your perspective there.","Kurt Kuehn","So, if I look at April, compared to the first quarter, it continues on and remember in the Freight segment, we are kind of in that transition we have a very targeted growth plan. You can see that in some of the numbers coming through. So you will see lower growth, more targeting of the freight that\u2019s in the network. We\u2019ll continue that. ","The West Coast Port stoppage in the first quarter gave us some lift, that\u2019s mitigating as we speak. But we have to balance that network obviously with the small package network. Chinese New Year, we had a really good new year this year. We had some great alignment of the network to the volume. ","That will continue and so it\u2019s just a continuation in our minds of balancing the right network with the right volume at the right levels going forward and I think the first quarter was a success and we see the same things starting off the second quarter. ","Ben Hartford ","Thank you. ","Operator","We have a question from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Please go ahead.","Prashant Rao","Good morning, this is Prashant Rao in for Chris and congrats to Kurt and to Richard. My question is really on the volume side on Domestic. I was wondering if there is anything \u2013 how much of the volume changes are to be attributed to maybe some seasonal patterns, weather and seasonality a play, any other factors you\u2019d like to call out, maybe in terms of what we are seeing on the Domestic side in terms of volume. Clearly, yields and revenue management are fantastic, but just wanted to kind of get thoughts around the volume side there? ","David Abney","Yes, Alan, if you could?","Alan Gershenhorn","Yes, so, yes, we are actually encouraged by the progress we are making in balancing the volume growth and the yield. We did actually see a dip in the average daily volume in February that aligned with some of the bad weather in the Northeast and other areas of the country. And also some of those pricing decisions not to renew the low yield agreements. ","Prashant Rao","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","And we have a question from the line of Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Scott Schneeberger ","Thanks. Good morning and congratulations Richard, and Kurt. Just following up on that last question, in the first quarter, it sounds like the B2C and B2B were both strong. Could you add a little bit on each please? Thanks. ","Kurt Kuehn","Alan, go on ahead. ","Alan Gershenhorn","Yes, so, for the first time in a very, very long time, our B2B growth was actually a bit stronger than our B2C and as you know, our deferred volumes were also strong and the SurePost while it\u2019s still strong, certainly, year-over-year slowing down as that product becomes more mature. Just keep in mind that this is just a one quarter data and we are still expecting about 3% growth for the year. ","Operator","And we have a question from the line of Kelly Dougherty of Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Kelly Dougherty ","Hi, thanks for taking the question. And so I just want to follow-up on that last one if we can talk about the B2B versus B2C growth. And wonder how you think about, maybe some UPS-specific initiatives, because some of the macro data that's been out recently has been underwhelming from an industrial production or manufacturing perspective. So thinking about how that factors into maybe what you are expecting earlier this year?","Kurt Kuehn","Yes, so, a couple of things. We are very focused on industry-specific solutions that we are building for the hi-tech, the healthcare, the automotive industrial, manufacturers that\u2019s out there. So that we can win more and win faster in those specific areas. ","Certainly, e-commerce though is also driving a significant amount of our B2B growth through returns as well as manufacturers that ship B2B going more into the e-commerce realm. So, it\u2019s really a mix there. So we are pretty excited about the fact that e-commerce is beginning to generate some significant B2B business.","Kelly Dougherty ","Is there any way to separate out, your - I know great that that B2B is growing faster than the B2C at this point. Is there any way to separate out kind of traditional B2B versus what retail might be driving?","Kurt Kuehn","Yes, Kelly, it is becoming pretty blurred these days. So we are \u2013 at this point, we are really not adding anything to that. ","Kelly Dougherty ","Okay, thanks Kurt and congratulations. ","Kurt Kuehn","Thanks. ","Operator","And we have a question from the line of Tom Kim of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Tom Kim ","Thanks very much. I wanted to ask with regard to trading down on International, I mean it was a very impressive performance last quarter and I am wondering to what extent there is actually further opportunities just depending on how trading down may be shifting? Thanks.","Kurt Kuehn","Yes, those trends have been pretty consistent. We have seen our standard and deferred products grow faster than our premium express products for a number of years. So, with our aligned network, it\u2019s not a big deal. One thing though that I guess, I do want to highlight, if you look at the yields that there was certainly some impact from the shift of products, but the biggest issue on yields by far is the currency impact. ","And so, it is \u2013 we do have on Page 3, the schedule of revenue per piece that we\u2019ve always had there. But with Rich coming in as our Treasurer, he decided to give a little gift to you guys and we actually created a new schedule on Page 3 there that shows total company revenue-adjusted for currencies. So, Rich, maybe you could talk a little bit about currencies.","Richard Peretz","Sure. We use hedges to minimize the volatility of currency and now the business to concentrate on the fundamentals of growing the company. Our current hedge strategy is protected through the end of 2016 for all the major currencies that we operate in. ","There are some non-hedged currencies that we saw larger shifts than we have seen historically and that\u2019s because the dollar strengthened so much during this first quarter of 2015. Our strategy is to use a color approach and it really is there to make sure that we are protecting the currency while the business continues to grow. ","Kurt Kuehn","So, that\u2019s really been the biggest issue on reported revenues. The trade-down is a small piece of it, but, anyway, we thought being transparent on just what is happening with currency was an important element there and we are fortunate to have locked in a couple of years worth coverage on the euro and the pound that\u2019s certainly helping to keep the financial results solid for the foreseeable future.","Tom Kim ","Thanks very much.","Operator","And we have a question from the line of Robert Salmon of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Robert Salmon ","Okay, thanks, and Kurt, and Richard, my congrats to both of you guys as well. If I could kind of turn it back the discussion back to the dimensional pricing, can you give us a sense of how much of the full impact that you guys realized in the first quarter? And how we should be thinking about that stepping up as we look out to 2016 and 2017 for some of the longer term contracts that you have?","Kurt Kuehn","Yes, I think one way to look at it, and I\u2019ll let Alan talk a little bit about the contracts, but certainly the initial impact of dim weight has been primarily on the revenue side. But ultimately, we are working with a large number of customers to adjust their packaging, that\u2019s the real intent to this. And so, if anything we have said, the revenue impact will moderate a little over time and the economic benefit of less air in our feeders will come through. ","So, we did see a big benefit in the first quarter and as we work with customers to reduce their costs then that will migrate. And then certainly with some long-term contracts there are some other ramifications. ","Alan Gershenhorn","Yes, I mean, I think it\u2019s a combination of both. So you\u2019ve got our customers that we are working with to get smarter on their packaging which obviously helps us add on the side, but we\u2019ll take the revenue down a bit and then we\u2019ve got some longer term contracts that we\u2019ll be able to capture a bit more the dim weight opportunity going forward. ","What we are looking at this year is that, we already stated that we are at the high-end of the 2% to 3% base rate that we look for and our expectation is that that\u2019s going to continue through the year. ","Robert Salmon ","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Brandon Oglenski ","Well, good morning everyone and Kurt, as well, congratulations, just make sure you watch out for Andy Dolny on the golf course when you're back out there.","Alan Gershenhorn","Right, he is dangerous. ","Brandon Oglenski ","I\u2019ve heard. I can't let you off that easy, so I do want to ask a question on Domestic margins and I guess it's two parts, I hope I'm not cheating on the one question rule here. But, can you first quantify the fuel impacts on margins for us if possible? ","But then, can we walk through the puts and takes here, because obviously you have a pretty strong pricing outlook, but what are the cost additions of the capacity initiatives that we have again, and I know you - I think you have $180 million of pension headwind. Should we still be thinking that margins domestically are going to be roughly flat with last year or even slightly up, which I think was the prior guidance?","Kurt Kuehn","Yes, I\u2019ll let you cheat. It\u2019s because the final farewell question here. And I\u2019ll let margin \u2013 I\u2019ll have Myron \u2013 excuse me \u2013 talk about the margin enhancement activities. In general, just to highlight the impact of fuel a little bit, for the International business, there was a benefit of fuel of about $30 million or so. In general, coverage for fuel and International was not a 100%, so as fuel dropped we got a benefit although the lag accounted for a lot of that. On the Domestic side, actually, fuel was relatively neutral for us in the quarter. ","Traditionally, there is a benefit from the lag as it drops, but with fuel dropping frankly to unexpected levels, our coverage ratio is at the very low end of the fuel curve were not complete and that in effect, offset the lag. We did tweak the curves a little bit in February and so that will be relatively neutral going forward. But, we did not get a material benefit on fuel in the first quarter. So, Myron, maybe you talk a little bit about the margin enhancing activities we are working on. ","Myron Gray","Yes, Brandon, keep in mind that, US Domestic really is a year-over-year comp story as we also have a drag of almost $200 million in pension expense that I want to bring to your attention. In addition to that, as David Abney earlier alluded to, we have made progress operationally on several fronts. We\u2019ve continued to deploy operational technologies. We\u2019ve tightened up our operations from a dispatch perspective and we continue to add capacity in selected markets as well as our hub marked projects. ","David Abney","The first quarter just really affirms that we are moving in the right direction. And that we are on track for our financial objectives and we really had solid performance across all three of the segments. ","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Jeff Kauffman ","Thank you very much and Kurt, best of luck and Richard, really looking forward to working with you. Although I do reflect on the fact that Kurt, you've been promoted a number of times, now you are retiring and I am in the same job. All right. So here is my question, the International growth you talked about 2% to 3% ex-currency, but in the current quarter, you did 2.4% ex-currency. ","And as I look around the world, I am looking at get some big markets for you like Europe that seem to be gaining in momentum. So, can you tell us through your eyes what's going on and how the levers are moving globally? And are there any aspects of the global environment that you were downgrading to stay at this \u2013 at level in terms of your forecast for the year?","David Abney","All right, from a macro point of view and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Jim. But the \u2013 International growth is not expected to be quite as strong as previous estimates. It\u2019s not 2.8% GDP growth versus 3.0%. So the outlook is really mixed at the regional level. In Europe, the growth is estimated to be 1.9%. ","So, previously forecasted at 1.7% and that\u2019s really driven by Germany, and one key point here I think is, for the year, the real UPS \u2013 excuse \u2013 EU real exports are forecasted to grow at 4.8% this year in 2015. So, Jim, turn it over to you to talk about the specifics.","Jim Barber","Yes, I would add probably three quick points to that. One, and then we already touched on one, one is kind of the balance of trade here. And how that plays out relative to some of the currencies moving in the world. I think, you also have fuel in here that is one of those wild cards that we are not sure how that\u2019s going to work We also have to look at a little bit of China slowing in this discussion. ","We can\u2019t forget that at any time. And I think the last part is that, as we\u2019ve gone through this, we have purposely said that we are going to slow some of the growth until our investments catch-up with it and then we\u2019ll fire the engine up faster again. ","So this is kind of one of those purposed slowing to let the investments catch-up, reinvigorate it and keep moving forward. So, we are going to kind of dip it down a little bit from a revenue or a volume revenue. But that will be very targeted in our revenue management activities to do that. So that\u2019s our plan. ","Jeff Kauffman ","Well, thank you very much. That\u2019s my one. ","David Abney","Great.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Scott Group ","Hey, thanks. Morning guys. So, first, Kurt, when you were giving the fuel impacts, I didn't hear you give one for Freight, if you can give that. And then just my bigger question is on Europe and you talked about you've had this kind of sustained track record of growing double-digits and wondering given the FedEx, TNT deal how you think that plays out and whether or not you think that will accelerate in the near-term? And do you think that once the deal closes, do you think you'll be able to sustain double-digit growth in Europe?","Kurt Kuehn","Yes, I am not sure how many questions that was Scott. But we\u2019ll humor you a little bit. Certainly, fuel was a significant drag on reported revenues and Freight, almost 500 basis points. The P&L impact was modest, but not significant, because of the dramatic change in coverage ratios once again as we move down to those levels. David? ","David Abney","We feel real good about Europe this year and we do have a great track record. We are investing heavily to expand our business. But there is a little bit of transition going on with some of the players in the market and we are certainly going to emphasize our message that we have a fantastic service offering. We meet our customers\u2019 needs there and we are going to continue to invest and grow in this important part of our business.","Operator","The next question will come from the line of Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Allison Landry ","Thanks, good morning. ","David Abney","Morning.","Allison Landry ","In terms of the hub modernization, how many of the 30 major US sorting facilities are now automated? And given our expectations for continued strength in e-commerce, whether it's B2C or B2B, do you see any need to further accelerate investments in the network? And within that context, should we read anything into their cash builds during Q1?","Kurt Kuehn","I\u2019ll start with the last piece of that once again. No, the cash build in Q1 is more just typical seasonal from Q4 where we have a lot of receivables coming at the end of the year. For Q1, where our CapEx is usually low that we do see the balance sheet swell. So, if you go back to last year, you\u2019ll see similar trends. ","So, no, we are on track for our guidance of about $3 billion in CapEx this year and certainly continuing to modernize hubs is important. Myron, maybe you could talk a little bit about the status and benefits of that.","Myron Gray","Allison, there is a five-year plan that\u2019s in place to either add capacity or modernize all of our top 30 hub locations. At the end of this year, we\u2019ll have four projects that will be totally completed with adding capacity in two locations and hub models and two others. And certainly they are put in place to increase our throughput and our productivity. ","Allison Landry ","Okay, thank you for the time. ","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Jack Atkins of Stephens. Please go ahead.","Jack Atkins ","Good morning guys. Thanks for the time. So, I guess just, for my question, you're thinking about the US Freight economy, there is a lot of concern out there that we're beginning to see things perhaps slowdown a little bit. Could you give us a sense for what you are seeing in your underlying business in the US? And then, what are you learning in your conversations with your customers as it relates to freight demand for the balance of the year?","David Abney","Okay, first when it comes to the US, the outlook is certainly mixed. I mean there were some recent disappointing employment news in March and we\u2019ve seen IP and the retail data maybe be not as positive as we would have thought. ","There are some headwinds. We talked a little bit about the West Coast Port, don\u2019t know if that\u2019s going to fade away pretty quickly of if this is going to continue. But the strengthening US dollar and the cautious consumer when it comes to spending, but then on the bright side, you see that, ASMO has gotten off to a strong start this year. January over 14% and February, almost that same level. So, I would say that, it\u2019s just a mixed performance. We are focused on maintaining our strategies and I think it was a good solid performance for the first quarter. But there are some headwinds out there. ","Jack Atkins ","Thanks, again.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of David Campbell of Thompson Company. Please go ahead.","David Campbell ","Yes, hi. Thank you, Kurt. Congratulations and thanks for all your help over the years especially at our analyst conferences. I wanted to ask you about the West Coast Port disruption in the first quarter, I couldn't tell whether that was a help on the Cargo revenues or International shipments or both?","Kurt Kuehn","Yes, I think, depending on which segment of the business you talk to they, that are enjoyed it or struggled with it. So, Jim, maybe you could talk a little bit about the West Coast disruption in general and how that impacted results.","Jim Barber","Sure, I think that, David, I think it\u2019s in all segments. I think, from a Cargo perspective, our first quarter was very big, no question about that. That was up heavy double-digits and that actually runs through obviously the impact of the small package network we had trade-ups from \u2013 into the Air segment from our Freight business and we also had some moving into small package business. ","So I think, Kurt has framed it at somewhere between $5 million and $10 million impact to the first quarter. As a lift in total, we don\u2019t see that continuing long-term. Therefore, we kind of pull that out, but that\u2019s kind of the impact from this segment. ","David Campbell ","Okay, thank you very much. ","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Bascome Majors of Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","Bascome Majors ","Thank you. So to follow-up on David and Rob's questions on the Domestic dim weight implementation, can you give us a little color on how much of the portfolio that you\u2019ve got on the dim weight schedule for 2015? And whether that's a two to three year implementation to get to 100 or close to 100 or kind of how you see that playing out from a delayed gratification perspective for some of these customers over the next year or two?","Kurt Kuehn","We are not sharing specific numbers, but Alan, maybe you could talk about the general approach.","Alan Gershenhorn","No, again, so, all of our \u2013 so all the packages in the US package portfolio are now dim weight eligible. So it really becomes a question, we are talking about really is, what\u2019s under the covers in the contracts and I think again, you are going to see what the work that we are doing with our customers to improve their packaging to reduce the size of their packages will probably be an offset to some of the gains we get from contracts expiring and being renewed with stronger dim weight language.","Operator","And our last question in queue will come from the line of Helane Becker of Cowen. Please go ahead.","Helane Becker ","Thanks very much operator. And gentlemen, thanks for the time. Kurt and Richard congratulations. Kurt, I will miss you. And I look forward to working with Richard. Just a question on the tax rate, given how big your International opportunities are - is there an opportunity to lower your tax rate at all by shifting revenue around the world?","Kurt Kuehn","Well, unfortunately, we are not a manufacturer that has a lot of discretion, Helane. So, certainly, we continue to look at our tax structure in the very high statutory rate of the US is a drag on US companies. And certainly, we are a great example of that. So, David constantly ask me that question and we do what we can. But, to some extent, we are a business where you have to operate where the volumes are. So there is not a tremendous amount of discretion. ","But, as the International business continues to grow and we expand across the globe, that does have a somewhat beneficial effect that lowers it slightly, but still in the main \u2013 the majority of that does get hit with the US taxes. That\u2019s why we are big proponents of a more rational US tax platform and that would be a good step for us and help us compete more effectively across the globe.","Helane Becker ","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. David Abney. ","David Abney","Okay, and thanks for your questions. I think as you can see today that, our answers were really focused about creating unique solutions to our customers to create more value on our pricing initiatives and obviously on increasing our operating efficiency. ","But now, we are going to cut it a little bit short today to give Kurt a chance to say a few final words before closing out the call. Like many long time UPS employees, Kurt began his career as a package car driver, while in college and progressed quickly through management. ","Whether working on international growth, expansion into the industry segments or integration of several strategic acquisitions, Kurt has contributed exceptional judgment and fresh perspectives. His partnership character and capacity to find solutions has helped UPS advance through many challenges while remaining true to the needs of our customers, shareowners, and employees. ","Kurt is just a great example of a business executive first and a finance executive second. I appreciate his thoughtful candor and welcome his knowledge and broad perspective. While I\u2019ll personally miss Kurt as a partner and as a friend, I am happy to also announce Rich\u2019s appointment. Richard has been with the company nearly 34 years. I believe he will contribute the right mix of experience and new thinking to help UPS continue to attain profitable growth. ","So, Kurt, it\u2019s all yours. ","Kurt Kuehn","Well, thanks, David and thanks for letting me get the final word here. But now it\u2019s been a wonderful career at UPS and I\u2019ve been privileged to tackle a number of major projects working for this great company. ","Certainly, the one event that comes to mind is when I first met many of you on the call, which was our IPO in 1999 and got the unique opportunity to be UPS\u2019s first Investor Relations Officer after a history of 92 years as a private company. ","I was a bit overwhelmed at first, but was extremely proud to represent this great company as we migrated from the private company we were to the public markets and would like to thank a number of you on the call there for your professionalism over the years have given us the benefit of the doubt and helping us communicate the UPS story. ","There have also been a lot other highlights along the way and in every case, my recollections will be strongly enhanced by the memory of working with such a great team that we have here at UPS. I\u2019ve had the great fortune from starting as a package driver to assuming the CFO role back in 2008 to have an incredible breadth of assignments and clearly it\u2019s truly transformed both me and my view of the world. ","And so, I\u2019ve been honored to have served and helped position this company for the future. But I do know, it\u2019s now time to get out of the way and allow more capable executives like Richard to takeover, little younger, little faster, little smarter. He joins a dynamic management committee that has been assembled by David and together, they have both the vision and the dedication that will take UPS to new levels of success. ","As the official old-timer on the UPS team, I am already dreaming about having some leisure time to do some of the other things I love, maybe learn how to play piano, get in shape and certainly work on my ass fishing will be good places to start. ","In the near-term, I am looking forward to seeing many of the participants on today\u2019s call in the upcoming meetings or conferences that Richard and I make visits during this transition. So, thanks to everyone for your well wishes today and I look forward to seeing many of you as the part of our upcoming meetings. ","With that, our call is adjourned.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations' Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Andy Dolny, UPS Treasurer and Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.","Andy Dolny","Good morning. Today, I'm joined by Scott Davis, our CEO; and Kurt Kuehn, our CFO, to discuss the company's results for the quarter and future expectations.","Before they begin, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the company. These anticipated results are subject to risk and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2011 Form 10-K and first quarter 10-Q reports. These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the Securities and Exchange Commission.","In the second quarter of last year, UPS reported a net gain of a $33 million as a result of 2 nonrecurring real estate transactions. These adjustments resulted in an after-tax benefit of $0.02 per share. In Scott and Kurt's comments today, references to 2011 results will exclude the impact of this gain. We believe this is a more accurate picture of the company's performance.","Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures and free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, are explained in the schedules that accompanied our earnings news release. These schedules are also available on the UPS Investor Relations website in the Financials section. As a reminder, any guidance that we provide will not include the results of TNT operations, nor any synergies or post-closing integration expense associated with the acquisition.","As always, today's call is being webcast and is also available on the UPS Investor Relations website. [Operator Instructions] I thank you in advance for your cooperation.","Now let me turn it over to Scott.","D. Scott Davis","Thanks, Andy, and good morning. UPS's second quarter results were driven by the performance of our U.S. Domestic segment. We continue to benefit from the efficiency of our streamlined and integrated network. Our unique portfolio of solutions has allowed UPS to adapt quickly to the evolving needs of e-commerce shippers and do it profitably. On the other hand, our International segment results continue to be impacted by declines in exports from both Asia and the U.S.","Economies around the world are showing signs of weakening, and our customers are increasingly nervous. In the U.S., uncertainty, stemming from this year's elections and the looming fiscal cliff, constrains the ability of businesses to make important decisions, such as hiring new employees, making capital investments and restocking inventories. This will further restrict economic growth.","In fact, this is already evident as June's manufacturing ISM and growth in retail sales numbers were the worst we've seen since 2009. In addition, employment gains have started to slow down, all of which had a negative impact on commercial volume growth. Given these trends, we think current second half economic forecasts for the U.S. are too high and that GDP growth will likely be closer to 1%.","In Europe, the debt crisis lingers on as more countries struggle with austerity measures that are pushing them into recession. Despite this, UPS export volume has continued to grow, although at reduced rates. While economies in Asia are still expanding, expectations have come down in the last 3 months.","Overall, GDP forecasts around the world are declining. Historically, global exports grow at a higher rate than GDP. This is not the case today. In fact, global trade is lagging GDP. This has only occurred once in the past 10 years, and that was during the last recession. We believe this is temporary and that as GDP growth begins to accelerate, a more typical relationship between the 2 will exist.","Though the macro environment gives us concern, we have confidence in our strategy and remain focused on current objectives. One strategy, demonstrating the power of logistics, will be on display during the 2012 London Olympic Games. As the official logistics express delivery supporter, UPS is responsible for the staging the largest peacetime logistical undertaking in the world, providing the warehousing, distribution and logistics to produce the games while delivering 30 million items, everything from tennis balls to goal posts. UPS is eager to demonstrate the industry's most advanced supply-chain capabilities at this year's games and further strengthen our brand in Europe.","Now for an update on our offer to acquire TNT Express. This transaction will diversify our global revenue, increase our portfolio of solutions and expand our geographic footprint. The complementary strengths of both companies will create a customer-focused platform, delivering unparalleled access to the world, while at the same time, enhancing shareholder value.","During the quarter, UPS made significant progress towards completing the purchase, including the announcement of our financing plan and the publishing of the Offer Memorandum. Over a week ago, UPS announced that the review process with the European Commission will move to Phase 2 as there are certain areas that require more time to analyze. We expect to close the transaction during the fourth quarter.","Another recent development I am pleased to note is that UPS and the Teamsters have agreed to get an early start to negotiations. Formal talks are expected to begin soon.","This brings me to my final point. As 2012 continues to progress, keep this in mind: During our 105-year history, UPS has dealt with many different economic conditions and changing marketplaces. And through it all, we have proven our founder, Jim Casey, right. Determined UPSers around the world working together can accomplish anything. I assure you, we'll make the necessary changes to adapt and respond to the current challenges as we've done so many times in the past.","Now Kurt will review our results for the quarter.","Kurt P. Kuehn","Well, thanks, Scott, and good morning. The second quarter results released this morning, which produced earnings per share growth of 7.5%, are solid, considering the change of pace in the global economic environment that Scott alluded to earlier. On a consolidated basis, UPS daily volume improved 2.7%, and operating profit was up 4.6%, with 40 basis points of margin expansion. This points to the flexibility of our product portfolio and the efficiency of the UPS network. We provided UPS customers with solutions needed in this challenging economic climate, and we're able to generate the industry's best margins.","Let's take a look at how the segments performed, starting with U.S. Domestic. E-commerce in the U.S. continues to expand, benefiting the segment. Operating profit growth was up over 12% with margin expansion of 100 basis points. Strong operating leverage resulted from the volume growth, base rate increases and continued network efficiencies. I also want to point out that the quarter did benefit by over $60 million from the fuel surcharge lag.","Daily volume was up 3.5%, driven entirely by B2C. One concern of note was the lower manufacturing ISM numbers that point to lower purchasing activity. This is contributing to a deceleration in our critical business-to-business volume growth.","Air products outpaced ground during the quarter with Next Day Air volume up 5% while deferred increased by 8.6%, driven by growth in our Saver and the residential shipments. UPS experienced gains in Next Day Air letters again during this quarter, reversing a long trend of declines.","Ground package volume was up 3%. Over 1\/2 of this growth was attributable to a 25% increase in lightweight products. Revenue improved a little over 4%. As expected, average revenue per package was up less than 1%.","Yields across all products benefited from base pricing but were offset by faster growth from large customers and changes in product mix. We continue to see rapid growth in lightweight and Saver products, both of which have lower yields. Although they do have lower yields, this volume continues to contribute to our productivity gains.","Average daily volume was 3.5% higher, while miles driven and direct labor hours were up only about 1%, and block hours actually declined. Savings in direct payroll costs were not enough, however, to overcome growth in benefit expense. Health care jumped over 7%, while pension-related expenses were up more than 10%.","Overall, a good quarter in the U.S. Domestic, aided somewhat by the fuel surcharge lag. Importantly, current trends, such as the lack of B2B growth, are concerning going forward. But we are taking the necessary steps, implementing both revenue and cost initiatives, as well as making adjustments to the UPS network.","Now for a review of our International results. Slowing global economies, shifting trade patterns and negative currency translation resulted in a 4% revenue contraction. Double-digit declines in high-yielding shipments from Asia to both Europe and the U.S. produced a notable drop in profitability. That's not surprising considering the infrastructure required to support Asia. We made adjustments to our network during the first half of the year and are implementing additional cuts to mitigate this trend.","Operating profit in the International was down $51 million from last year. Expenses related to M&A activity accounted for a drag of about $15 million. However, our margin is still the industry's best at 15.1%. In contrast to the significant decline in transcontinental demand, intra-regional shipments continue to increase. Overall export volume was up by 1%, as growth in Europe was mostly offset by the declines in Asia that I mentioned.","When faced with today's economic challenges, customers continue to trade down to less costly alternatives. As a result, we experienced faster growth in our transborder standard products and even saw some trade-down from small package into freight.","Non-U.S. Domestic volume was down 3.2%, reflecting yield improvement initiatives in Germany and Turkey. Fiscal austerity measures in Southern Europe contributed to double-digit declines there. But keep in mind that although this is a fairly steep drop in volume, it had only a small impact on segment profitability.","Export revenue per piece was down 3.5%, the primary factor being the year-over-year currency fluctuations. In fact, currency-neutral revenue per piece was flat, reflecting base rate increases that were offset by changes in trade lanes and product mix.","So it's been a challenging environment for our International group over the last 12 months. But during this time, we've implemented various revenue and cost initiatives, including reductions to our network, and we will continue to do so as we are planning another 10% reduction in our Asian air network. This will position us better for the future.","And now for the Supply Chain & Freight segment. Operating profit increased by 3.6%, and margin expanded 50 basis points to 8.9%, the highest margin this segment has seen. Revenue declined 1.6% due to slowing international airfreight demand. Although the forwarding units saw an increase in tonnage, revenue was down as rate per kilo continues to be challenged in the key Asia outbound market. Operating margin was still strong due to effective revenue management and cost controls.","In UPS Freight, revenue growth was flat as improvements in LTL pricing were offset by a decline in shipments. Operating profit and margin increased during the quarter due to productivity gains. Revenue in our Distribution business was higher, primarily from continued growth in health care and UPS lightweight solutions. Investments in technology and infrastructure to support the company's health care initiative did impact operating profit.","Looking now at cash and our balance sheet. For the 6 months ended June 30, UPS generated $3.0 billion in free cash flow, up more than $600 million. Capital expenditures were $949 million, which included the delivery of 6 767s.","So far this year, UPS has paid dividends totaling $1.1 billion, representing a 9.5% increase per share. In addition, we've repurchased 11.3 million shares for approximately $870 million. Regarding share repurchases, we are on track to spend $1.5 billion in 2012, and outstanding share count in the third quarter will be similar to the second. As we prepare to complete the TNT transaction, you will notice that our cash and marketable securities on the balance sheet have reached over $7 billion.","Regarding guidance, the macro environment that we expect in the second half of 2012 calls for slower growth than originally anticipated when we set our initial guidance range back in January. Given this, we now expect 2012 diluted earnings per share of between $4.50 and $4.70. This represents a 3% to 8% increase over 2011.","I do want to take a couple of minutes to provide more insight into the segments, starting with the U.S. Domestic where we see some concerning trends. Average daily volume growth is expected to moderate, reflecting the macro environment. We anticipate some deceleration in premium product growth, and B2B volume is expected to deteriorate further with pretty much all of our growth coming from B2C. As a result, revenue will increase between 1% and 2%.","On a year-over-year basis, comp and benefit expense will be about 1% higher in the second half than what we saw in the first. This is primarily a result of increases in health care costs. The combination of the mix changes and the higher benefit costs will result in operating margin being slightly above what we saw in the first half of the year, but it's still less than last year.","Turning now to International, where daily export volume is expected to grow at a slightly faster pace than what we saw in the first half of the year. This is not indicative of economic expansion but is more a result of beginning to lap last year's slowdown in Asia. As previously mentioned, we have taken the necessary actions like air network capacity cuts and implementing in-country cost controls. And as a result, we anticipate operating profit to grow at a mid to high single-digit pace with more growth in the fourth quarter. Operating margin in the third quarter should be slightly below last year, while the fourth quarter margin will expand on a year-over-year basis.","Regarding Supply Chain & Freight, we expect mid-single-digit revenue gains, and operating profit growth will be in the mid-teens with margins reaching 9%.","For a little more detail on the earnings per share for the second half of the year, we anticipate that in the third quarter, they will be below last year. Let me remind you that in 3Q '11, we recorded a 32.9% tax rate that added about $0.03 per share. Fourth quarter earnings should show solid improvements.","To wrap things up, our first half results have been respectable, with the U.S. Domestic and Supply Chain & Freight segments performing well. However, we are seeing indications of a weakening global economy, creating challenges for companies in the quarters ahead. Of course, we at UPS are prepared to make the right moves in any economic environment to ensure the company's long-term success. UPSers around the world are working diligently to make the necessary changes to our network while providing the service excellence that UPS customers have come to expect.","Thanks for listening this morning, and now Scott and I will be happy to answer your question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Mr. Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I had wanted to see if you could offer some thoughts on the time lag that you would typically experience in terms of taking out cost and adjusting to some of the changes in volume. So if you could comment both on the time lag in your International operations, where I would think things are a little more fixed, and then the time lag with respect to cost takeout in Domestic.","Kurt P. Kuehn","Yes. Great, Tom. I think you're right on target with that. As you know, we've been wrestling and working through the International trends for the last couple of quarters. Frankly, the velocity of the declines, being double digits in Asia both to Europe and U.S., were a little higher than we anticipated, but we have been in the process of making network changes and expect another 10% to come out during the next quarter. So we feel like we've pretty much caught up to the changes in International, and that's why we're actually guiding for profit improvements in the second half of the year. The weakening environment in the U.S. and, most notably, with the B2C trends is a little more recent. Frankly, we began to see that get more notable in the second quarter. So we're a little bit behind as far as the time schedule on that. And so there is probably a quarter, maybe 2-quarter lag for us, really, to fully implement the changes, and that's really the top priority right now.","D. Scott Davis","Now, Tom, clearly, on the Domestic side, the direct labor hours, we react to very quickly as we adjust the workforce. I think what takes us a little bit longer on the Domestic side is also the revenue side of it. So it's not just looking at cost. We have to do things on revenue management side to improve that side of the ledger. I think we're looking at things, looking at account strategies. We need to focus more on the middle market. I think a lot of our growth, the first half of the year, came from large customers. So we have kind of rededicated ourselves to look at the middle market. I think the small and medium-sized enterprises are really not -- are suffering right now with all the uncertainty in the country, but they still have shipping needs, and we'll focus on them.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Kevin Sterling of BB&T Capital Markets.","Kevin W. Sterling - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","You talked about customer behavior changing as they move around the supply chain, trading down to more deferred products. Where are you seeing the largest behavior changes? Is it air to ocean?","Kurt P. Kuehn","No. Probably most notable is within products going from, perhaps, an express to an afternoon delivery, the Saver and our Next Day Air. In Europe, we've seen significant trade down from our transborder express to transborder standard, although we have seen a few structural changes on some of the global exporters, perhaps moving away from express, moving freight movements and then distributing them once they get across the border. Clearly, we have products like Trade Direct to help address that. But this is a period, I think, when we're seeing companies try different things. I don't think it's been hugely material, but there is some mode shift and some speed changes.","D. Scott Davis","Yes. I think the surprising thing, and I talked about it in my comments, Kevin, was this -- the global trade in general. To have exports growing at a lesser rate than global GDP is really unusual, and we think that is temporary and it'll change going forward. But trying to figure out what's going on, I think the biggest driver of that is the slow demand in the developed world. I think there is a lot of people trying to analyze what's going on. But frankly, Europe and the U.S. both have low demand right now, and that's what\u2019s causing those negative numbers out of Asia. The other areas that will be a challenge going forward is U.S. exports to Europe. I think Europe will not be a big consuming country for a while, so the U.S. exports will remain quite weak to Europe.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","On the U.S. Small Package business, I was curious what the trends look like in the quarter, April, May and June. You called out the uncertainty, and it sounded like, to Tom's question, that you alluded to further actions that are going to have to be taken within that business to right-size to what you're kind of expecting volumes on the B2B side to look like in the back half. 3.5% volume felt good, and obviously, there's mix stuff going on there. But did we see any kind of precipitous fall-off in June? Or are you seeing that as we've come into July that's got you guys worried? I'm just trying to get a better sense of where we're going here.","Kurt P. Kuehn","Yes. I think kind of a soft landing maybe is the best way to think of it. We've seen -- we were very pleased and a little surprised that the demand have picked up in the fourth quarter and burned through the second -- or the first quarter. We saw over the course of the quarter, and really into July, just a gradual softening, really, with the B2B being the most notable change. That's why you don't see it as much in our aggregate volumes, because the B2C has continued to be very strong with our service offerings. But I think just kind of this continual moderate slowing in the rate of growth and then into the trends that we're seeing.","D. Scott Davis","Now, Justin, it was clearly -- clearly, our macro concerns start with the fact that we saw lousy numbers in the last couple of months, and ISM manufacturing, clearly, was bad. Retail sales was weak in June. As we get closer to the fiscal cliff, there's just more uncertainty out there than ever. It's hard for me to say how it's going to turn around until we get some policymaking done in Washington. We have a 3- or 4- or 5-year horizon, and people cannot make decisions without that. So I think it's going to get tougher before it gets better. It will get better.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Chris Wetherbee of Citi.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Maybe a question just on Europe, if you could just give us a sense of kind of what the trends were there. Sounds like you had a little bit of growth on the volume side, but I just want to get an overall sense if you are seeing a deceleration in that region as well.","Kurt P. Kuehn","Well, we saw a little bit of a deceleration, although, frankly, Europe continues to be a good story for us. One of the macro shifts, or at least changes in trends, we are seeing is that the intra-regional shipments within North America, within Europe are continuing to show growth. Intra-Asia continues to show growth, and then the intercontinental shipments are a little weaker. So we're clearly seeing trade-down in Europe, so the premium products are not doing as well. But our trans-European shipments on the standard side are healthy. We have seen some declines on the Domestic volumes within the EU, although some of that is just revenue management activities. But we do see the economic declines a little more in our Domestic segment. But Europe's continuing to trade within itself, and that's why we continue to focus on it, to help Europe become more and more efficient.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Ken Hoexter of Bank of America.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Kurt, you mentioned the -- you're looking to decrease some costs. Can you kind of walk us through? It sounds like on the International move, you've made the move to pull out the 10%. Maybe on the domestic move during the downturn, you had kind of shut down some regional facilities. I don't know if they had reopened. What kind of steps can you -- can we expect to make, and what kind of cost leverage should we look for from that?","Kurt P. Kuehn","Yes. I think on the International side, we've really made the decisions in -- and are making the big network changes, although, clearly, there's a tremendous amount of in-country work that can still be done internationally. It's just they're probably 70% to 80% on the way to getting it done. Domestically, I don't anticipate huge network restructuring, although we are looking at our capacity and usage, both in the air and the ground network, to make sure we're adjusting appropriately. We'll be looking at a typical range of costs, looking at initiatives, discretionary spending, really just making sure we've recalibrated the network. And, Ken, if you really look over the last 3 to 4 quarters, we've seen a pretty dramatic mix shift, volume coming from different areas going to different areas. And so we're looking at this as an opportunity, really, to step back and adjust the network and our expenses to match conditions and, at the same time, as Scott mentioned, also to revisit broadly where we are on the revenue and the management of that, both at the account level and also at the product level. So this is the time in which we're going to take a hard look. We've -- we're teeing up a significant number of initiatives to take a look, given this slow patch that we're in right now, to adjust and reposition ourselves to improve our competitiveness.","D. Scott Davis","We're really going to take advantage of the decentralization of marketing, where now we have the marketing teams in the districts who can look at the specific circumstances and adapt to it. So it will help us as we come out of this.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess following up from the answer to Ken's question there. As you go through your account and your products review process, does that mean we're still going to see a lot of the focus on the B2C growth, but maybe some better core pricing on the core business?","Kurt P. Kuehn","I wouldn't lead to any one specific result on that. It's just -- it's been about a year or so since we've really broadened the portfolio and focused on expanding the footprint into the lightweight, migrating into that. So clearly the B2C issues, the product positioning will be important. And then of course, given -- looking at the entire part of the core portfolio will be a part also.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. David Vernon of Bernstein.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Could you help characterize like the -- how much of the reduction in your guidance is from a slowing or less-than-expected recovery in International volumes versus the weakening Domestic picture?","Kurt P. Kuehn","Probably the bigger change in the quarter has been the Domestic outlook. Clearly, the International got a little bit worse than we thought. We thought our export volumes would be up a couple of percent more, and yes, the exports out of Asia really did fall off a cliff. So there were some there, but the more material issue really has been the deceleration in the core Domestic demand and some of the economic conditions I think that Scott has talked about.","D. Scott Davis","Yes, exactly. I think in the second quarter, clearly, International was the biggest culprit. But going forward, I think the challenge is going to be Domestic, and as we said before, just a lot of weak numbers over the last 2 months caused us concern for the next 6 months.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So the outlook has been more affected by the slowdown in Domestic?","D. Scott Davis","Outlook in Domestic, correct, yes.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Ed Wolfe of Wolfe Trahan.","Edward M. Wolfe - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","There is a meaningful step-down in your view, obviously, of the U.S. economy. And I'm trying just to understand, Scott, how much of this is reading the data that you're seeing coming out of the government and how much of this is specific to what you're either hearing from your customers or seeing in your volumes in June and July? And when did you kind of take this step-down in your view of the world?","D. Scott Davis","Ed, I think it\u2019s a combination, as you'd expect. I think, clearly, the recent numbers have been disappointing that we've seen over the last 2 months, but I think it's a combination of doing that and talking to customers. And again, the lion's share of our customers are small business. And you talk to them, they are very much concerned with all that's going to happen at the end of this year, with the fiscal cliff. And we all read the impact if all the Bush tax cuts go away and the sequestration hits. And you could have a 4% impact. Our customers read that. So I'd say it's a combination of the 2. They're -- customers are concerned. They're not going to invest. They're not going to hire people. They're not going to stock inventory with all that uncertainty. I think Bob Zoellick said the other day even, \"We're one debt ceiling deal away from getting this economy going again.\" So we got to get that done.","Edward M. Wolfe - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Is the 3.5% domestic volume throughout the quarter much worse in June than it was in April or in July than it was in June?","D. Scott Davis","Just slightly worse, I think, slightly worse.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Nate Brochmann of William Blair & Company.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I wanted to talk a little bit just on the pricing side. Obviously, there's a lot of uncertainty on the volume. But kind of with some of the trade-down and also just with the worsening kind of outlook for a lot of your customers, how are you seeing the pricing environment in terms of pushing through everything that you would have liked to?","Kurt P. Kuehn","We think the pricing environment remains fairly stable and firm, and if you do dissect and decompose the mix changes and the customer size and all of that, the pricing is stable, and we are seeing positive core pricing and base rate increases. So we're not overly concerned on the pricing environment. Although, clearly, if the economy slows more, there'll be, perhaps, a little more pressure. So I think for us it's more just a broad portfolio review and making sure that we're balanced and adapted to where we are seeing demand and adjusting where we're not.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Can I ask for a little bit of clarification on the comments that you made, I think it was last week, just that UPS does intend to bid on the postal service business, the priority mail contract? I was always under the impression that one of the reasons FedEx had that business was because of the size of their air fleet. Do you have the sort of underutilization in your air fleet that you could handle that? Or would it all go through the ground network? How does this -- I don't sort of know how that would fit into the UPS network.","D. Scott Davis","Bill, I think, clearly, we have the air network and ground network to satisfy those needs. USPS has informed us the intent to solicit bids on these air services for September 2013 forward. We've informed them that we're clearly interested in bidding on that business. Today, we already do well over $100 million of line haul with the post office. We've got a strong, strong international air network, world-class network. We have proven logistics capabilities. We think it fit very well into UPS in the future.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So it wouldn't -- there's no capacity constraint for you.","D. Scott Davis","No, I mean, we'll have to do some adjustments to our capacity, getting a lot of this done in the 2-day network. We can do some things on the ground. So we can make it fit.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Chris Ceraso of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","You mentioned with regard to Asia that it's, in large part, a function of weaker demand in the U.S. and Europe, which suggests that it's cyclical. But are you seeing any things that are more secular? Any kind of relocation of supply chains out of Asia that suggest that even when economies recover, maybe Asia won't be quite as strong as it used to be for you?","D. Scott Davis","I think that's overdone. I think that there's some of that going on, but it, clearly, is not the driving force right now between the -- the gap between global trade and global GDP. So I think we're seeing a little bit of it. But we go out and talk to our customers, you see very few instances where they've actually taken manufacturing and brought it back home or brought it back close to home. I think that's more likely if energy prices were to get to the $150 level. Then I think you look at that again. But I think it's -- there's more dislocation in China going to West China, things like that going on, than there is China back to U.S. or to Mexico.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from the line of Mr. John Barnes of RBC Capital Markets.","John L. Barnes - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just as you've revised down the outlook for the balance of this year, can you talk about just your CapEx outlook as well? And if things were to decelerate further, how much more quickly could you take your CapEx down as well? Or is there things that you could put on hold or cancel outright and kind of reserve that cash?","Kurt P. Kuehn","Yes, John, certainly, we've got flexibility, although, frankly, we're down to only 4% of revenue for CapEx this year, and we have been for the last 3 or 4 years. So we're -- we are at historically low levels. I guess the other element, at least, looking out a couple of years, is we just got another 2 years of major deliveries of aircraft. And then after that, we'll be in pretty good shape, we think, for the medium term, at least. So CapEx, we'll -- I wouldn't imagine dramatic changes, although things like vehicles and some facilities, we can react pretty quickly on. So we're generating very strong cash flow. So right now, that's the least of our worries. As we mentioned, we've got $7 billion in cash and marketable securities. Some of that's offset with some short-term liabilities, but we are focused on building the appropriate balance sheet to be able to close the TNT deal, really, without having to go out and issue any long-term debt. So we feel very comfortable with cash flow. One of the attributes, I think, of UPS that makes us unique is, even in tough times, we've remained extremely cash flow positive. So we'll look at capital expenditures. We will reduce the things that aren't essential. On the other hand, you look at investments like expanding Worldport through the midst of the recession. We're also going to continue to do those things that add long-term value no matter what the economic climate is.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Sterne Agee & Leach.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Could you discuss the currency effects and how it's affecting you both top line and bottom line and what this looks like for the rest of fiscal year?","Kurt P. Kuehn","Yes, Jeff. It is a turbulent period for currency. And although it's funny with us moving towards the TNT closure, we're not sure which way to vote for the euro, frankly. It had a very significant impact on revenue. If you look at -- without currency adjustment, our yields in International were down 2.5%. But if you look on our web schedules at the next page, it shows that if you currency adjust, they were up 2.1%. So that's almost 4.5% impact of currency on our International revenues, and that doesn't include anything on the Supply Chain & Freight. So it is a turbulent period, creating some challenges for year-over-year comps and also for profit planning. We do have some hedges in place that are helping to mitigate the P&L impact, and currency was just a minor negative in the quarter and, frankly, was more or less offset by a slight positive on fuel. So it has not been a big deal so far, although clearly, over the time, as -- if euro stays very low, then there will be some earnings translation impact. On the flip side, we do have a pretty big check to write to complete the TNT acquisition, and a low euro clearly makes that much less expensive in dollar terms.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","No, that's what I was going to ask. I mean, I guess it got about 14% cheaper this quarter.","Kurt P. Kuehn","It's dropped quite a bit. And I think at the time that we announced the deal, it was 1 32, something like that. And so it has dropped almost 10% now, which, certainly, in dollar terms is good news.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. David Campbell of Thompson, Davis & Company.","David P. Campbell - Thompson, Davis & Company","My question is on the Olympics. You talked about that during your presentation, talking in terms of 30 million packages. And when I look at the potential international package count in the third quarter, it comes in around 150 million. That sounds like a big increase. But on the other hand, I didn't see any big revenue growth when you did the Beijing games 4 years ago. So I'm just curious as to where we'll see and will we see the revenue benefit from that -- those gains.","D. Scott Davis","David, you won't see the revenue there. You won't see the volume of pieces. It's a combination and partly sponsorship. We get compensated for pieces of what we're doing there. It's primarily about brand recognition. I think we did a great job in Beijing, where like our brand recognition went up about 33% in Beijing. We want to do the same thing in Europe, and the timing is perfect for the TNT acquisition coming forward. So it's primarily about brand. You won't see it in the P&L.","Operator","The next question will come from the line of Mr. Ben Hartford of William -- or excuse me, Robert William Baird.","Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I just wanted to get your perspective on inventories and the weakness, the volume weakness that you're seeing on the margin here in the United States. Could you provide some sort of characterization on inventories, where we sit today, maybe retail versus industrial? It seems as though industrial inventory's on balance or slightly heavier than one might have expected to end 2Q. Are we seeing inventory reductions? Are we seeing a pause as shippers manage towards very, very tight inventories? Could you provide any sort of context on that?","D. Scott Davis","It's hard to really see the visibility of inventories, Ben. I think it's hard for economists. It's hard for the government to see that. I'm always skeptical on those reports. But I think in general, from us talking to customers, I think inventories are quite low. It's hard to imagine them getting much lower than they are today, I think, across-the-board, both on the manufacturing side and the retail side. Now visibility tools and those technology, that makes it easier to manage inventories, but I would say from our vantage point, inventories are rock bottom right now.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Peter Nesvold of Jefferies.","H. Peter Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Comp and benefit as a percent of revenue, so that ratio has been falling every quarter since 2009, and we're at record levels now. Well, we were at first quarter. This is the first quarter where that percentage was up. It's been the biggest area of margin expansion since the trough in '09. So I guess my question is, are we kind of going into a 1 to maybe 2-quarter transition period where you realign the Domestic and International networks and then we get further improvement in the comp and benefits line as a percent of revenue? Or are we starting to bump up against really where you can -- where you end up maxing out?","Kurt P. Kuehn","Well, that's a good question, because, clearly, there's -- we are seeing, as I mentioned, some headwinds, especially on the benefit side. We have had a couple of years of good experience on our health care. And just in the last, I'd say, 3, 4 months, we've started to see some trends of increasing expenses, increased number of lives handled per employee as perhaps more people latch onto UPS insurance, perhaps if the second working spouse doesn't have insurance, and some increased experience. So that's the most notable cost change, and we did guide that, that may drive domestic comp and ben up almost 1%. So there is some headwinds on that side. Clearly, that cycles a little bit, and we'll -- we're continuing to evaluate that and work on it. Other than that, I think with the continued focused on productivity, the automation of our operations, the information-driven pickup and delivery that we've got and the focus on lightweight, which certainly drives less direct hours, we should continue to see positive trends. So we're able to manage that in line with comp and -- with volume levels. But right now, at least, I think you have the health and welfare expenses. Pension also, is driving over $100 million this year. And so that is an element that, at least, for the next couple of quarters is going to be an outlier.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Helane Becker of Dahlman Rose.","Helane R. Becker - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Just a question on the declines that you're making in the capacity adjustment. So it takes a couple of quarters to bring that down. And then I suppose when things start to turn around, it will take a quarter or so to bring it back. So by making these adjustments now, are you thinking that any downturn is kind of a 4-quarter event? Or how should we think about the potential if things do or when you think things do turn around?","Kurt P. Kuehn","Helane, that's good question. I think you almost have to separate the International and the Domestic. Clearly, we have made some fairly significant reductions in the Asia, capacity to Europe and, most notably, to U.S. There is a lag there for planning schedules and all that. We do think that we'll see some uplift in the fourth quarter though. There are some major product launches coming in the fourth quarter, and at least, we do have some optimism that, that Asia export will pick up then. So we'll plan accordingly. And we can react with ad hoc flights and those things, although they're typically not as efficient. We think in the U.S., this has been a gradual process. And so we're adapting, and clearly, we'll be responsive and flexible if the holiday season comes in stronger than planned. But at this point, we're probably erring on the cautious side.","D. Scott Davis","Right, right. Helane, definitely, in Domestic, we can take them up and bring them down quicker than we can in International.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. David Ross of Stifel, Nicolaus.","David G. Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","On the cost side, Kurt, most of the costs were held in check in the quarter, but the other expenses line item rose over 8% year-over-year. You mentioned that there were some costs related to the M&A activity, but what were the other big contributors there?","Kurt P. Kuehn","Well, one of the things, you do have the credit last year of over $30 million because of the real estate transactions. That's the most notable, and in the other-other line anyway, that distorted things a little bit. Other than that, the network's in pretty good shape. Repairs and maintenance are moderated, little bit of increase in depreciation as we've brought in a number of new aircraft. So the only real notable expenses in the other-other part of it is the last year issue, and frankly, we do have some increased expenses that show up in that line, legal fees and some of those things. So your instincts are right that, that's where some of the M&A expenses show up.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Anthony Gallo of Wells Fargo.","Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","You mentioned the importance of B2C going forward. Would you mind touching on some trends you're seeing there, maybe uptake in My Choice, any changes in package weight sizes and anything you're doing on the productivity front with B2C?","Kurt P. Kuehn","Yes. We're continuing to see just great success on that front. The -- I think we're up over 1.5 million unique My Choice customers now that have shipped over 13 million shipments, and it continues to be one that's -- that there's a lot of interest in, kind of a viral issue. Once people start getting used to these proactive notifications, their ability to redirect shipments and just know what's going on, it has been very well received. So that's been a great product offering from the receiver or the buyer. And then we are seeing increased interest, frankly, by some of the high-quality Internet shippers in helping their customers become My Choice members, because it really eliminates a lot of the where-is-my-package phone calls. So it offers a direct savings to Internet companies in support and also increases satisfaction. So we remain very excited about that. It still is a very unique and distinctive offering, and that is a big part of our value proposition these days.","D. Scott Davis","And that's kind of U.S. focused. We obviously have the global B2C focus, too, and the Kiala acquisition that we announced 3 or 4 months ago is making great progress also. We're continuing to invest in technology there, so we're excited about having the alternative delivery locations available for our customers. So it'll continue to grow. We'll continue to invest in it.","Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Can you put any color on what My Choice does for you operationally? I mean, it sounds like there's benefits for you in there as well.","Kurt P. Kuehn","Yes, there is. There is. The -- one of the most frustrating things for any delivery company is when there's a package that needs to have a signature or monies collected and people aren't home. It creates a disconnect. It drives an additional delivery attempt, an added expense, added miles. So with My Choice, people, A, get a prediction of when the package will arrive. And if they want a different time, they can select that for a premium charge or they can redirect it to another location. So there is a direct operating savings also.","Operator","Our next question will be a follow-up from the line of Mr. Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes. I wanted to ask you kind of a broader question. When we think about Europe as -- seems to be in recession, and if you look at 2013 and 2014 and you think about that TNT acquisition and integration and so forth, is it tougher to be successful in integrating and holding on to business and producing the results with TNT if the European economy is soft? Or given that a lot of your activity is going to be cost takeout, is that actually an okay environment in terms of if you think about complicated integration of putting 2 pieces together?","D. Scott Davis","I'd always pick a strong, growing economy, Tom, if I had my picks. But frankly, I think Europe is not far different from what we thought when we announced this thing back in March. I think it's about where we thought it'd be, so no surprises. We're going to work very well together, I think, and have a customer-focused integration. I don't think what we're seeing right now changes anything. I like a better economy. I like a stronger economy. But the numbers we said and quoted back in March are numbers that will still see as achievable.","Operator","And we have a follow-up from the line of Mr. Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess I just wanted to put some context around the 10% reduction in the Asian capacity. Where were you guys, as of now, relative to plan at the beginning of the year, in terms of level below on that air capacity? And then I think, Kurt, you alluded to the potential for a product cycle on the tech side in the fourth quarter. I mean, how quickly can you ramp back up? And where does this 10% put you in terms of critical mass in that market? And how much further could you go down if you saw things deteriorate? Just trying to get some ideas around this cut.","Kurt P. Kuehn","Okay, a couple of folder -- a couple of pieces to that one. Clearly, things are weaker than we thought when we developed plans for this year. That 10% reduction was not anticipated. We have -- we were reacting to the slowdown that began, frankly, about this time last year. We seem to be jinxed with July business trends. And so we had implemented that first 10% reduction, and most of that was in reduced frequencies, maybe 4 days a week rather than 6, that kind of a thing, in some cases, for cargo and for our deferred products, we can catch up to those during the off days. This latest series of reductions has been a tough decision for us, because we have to adjust our costs. But on the other hand, as many of you have mentioned, with an anticipated product cycle that may drive capacity, we've got to be ready for it. So we had not anticipated those reductions, but we've gone through and we still really -- we've held service fully intact across the continents. So it's not that we've made dramatic changes in customer experience, but we may have gone from 3 or 4 flights from a given airport down to 2 or 3. So once again, it's more reduction in the service frequencies and the number of flights, but we are getting pretty tight. We're taking our network down to -- beginning to get to the -- close to the point where we were at the low time in 2009. So it is -- we're fairly lean right now. On the other hand, given the fact that we do expect to see some uplift in the fourth quarter, we're in position for that, making sure we have the assets and can react accordingly. On the tech side, yes, we do expect product launches. We've talked to some of the major OEMs then, so that's all built into our plans, and one of the reasons why, frankly, we are looking for stronger profit improvements in Q4 as compared to what will likely be a challenging Q3. Especially with Europe in August and the weak conditions in Europe, we think this will be a pretty soft August.","Operator","And we have a follow-up question from the line of Mr. Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to see if we could get just some broad commentary on the upcoming Teamster's negotiations. So if we think back to the last contract that you signed, it sort of had this aspect of, look, there are some pretty big changes that we've made here to gain on productivity, but then, of course, we went into a downturn, and it didn't get the volume growth we expected. So I think -- and you can correct me if I think this is a wrong characterization. But I think, perhaps, it didn't get the quite the savings you expected. Are there any sort of changes in how you'll sort of approach the ask this time around? Or is it more kind of a let's keep going down this path, because we think, eventually, we will have an upturn and get the volume growth and the productivity?","D. Scott Davis","Bill, I think that the good thing is that the formal talks begin soon, but even better thing is that we've been communicating regularly since the last contract. And the competition committees that we have set up with the Teamsters and our own people, we address all the issues very frequently. So we look at competitive aspects. I think all the issues that are impacting us and the Teamsters have been on the table already. When we get to the formal talks here in September, I think it's -- nothing is going to be a surprise of what's going on here. So I'm very optimistic that there's no surprises on either sides as we get together in September.","Kurt P. Kuehn","Yes. But clearly, we have to work together to adapt and change, and it will not be a business-as-usual discussion. And so we're looking creatively for ways to allow UPS to grow, and we've seen great examples of that and, at the same time, also allow us to be able to generate profit improvements. We just don't talk about the details in public. But as Scott said, we think the environment's very productive. We talk about both the opportunities and the problems we face and do expect things to be favorably resolved.","D. Scott Davis","But to your point, Bill, the world is a lot different than it was 5 years ago. So that certainly is part of the talks.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, right. I mean, just, obviously, it's a recognition of kind of things have changed from last time. So I thought maybe there's scope for a bigger discussion, but I appreciate the thoughts.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So in the context of all the International export volumes being under pressure, and it sounds like you guys are going to be adjusting the network down, but at the same time, it looks like DHL is actually adding aircraft into their international network. Can you comment on the pricing environment in International exports, the long-haul transcon stuff?","Kurt P. Kuehn","I think the package environment looks relatively stable. We have seen some volatility, I guess, in pricing on the Freight side and some of the heavy lift of the large shipments. You've got to separate the wheat from the chaff a little bit on capacity increases and see how much is going on. So we don't see huge amounts of capacity being added to the network, no matter what the press releases say, and we think the market's pretty rational.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So the -- no slowdown in the heavyweight package pricing?","Kurt P. Kuehn","Well, clearly, Freight yields right now are weaker. You saw that in our Forwarding revenues, that rates are lower right now on the Forwarding and on the cargo side. Our forwarder, though, has operated very effectively. As I said, we had peak margins for Supply Chain & Freight this quarter. I know that there's a lot of other big stuff going on, but that has been a great process for us, and we're on both sides of the equation. We see as -- having an airlift, the package environment is stable. But cargo and Freight rates are certainly weak, but then our forwarder has been able to capitalize on that and generate the -- really, the best margins we've seen.","Operator","Due to time constraints, our last question will come from the line of Mr. Ed Wolfe of Wolfe Trahan.","Edward M. Wolfe - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Just on the LTL, there hasn't been much conversation about that. Are you seeing slowing trends there? And can you give some sense of what the operating ratio look like at the LTL division?","Kurt P. Kuehn","Yes. Ed, you're right. That's yet another business that we haven\u2019t had a chance to chat about it. I guess we're getting too diversified. No, Freight had a strong quarter on the profit side. We had mid-single-digit margins with significant improvements over last year. We have seen growth moderating in the industry, and clearly, we were fairly disciplined on the pricing and volume that we targeted. So we do think that the industry is slowing a bit, but we've been very pleased by the productivity, some of the operational technology we're putting in. And so a good, solid quarter for the Freight side, but not -- it's not a super exciting time, we think, for shipment growth.","Operator","I would now like to turn the conference call back over to Mr. Andy Dolny for any closing remarks.","Andy Dolny","Yes.

My name is Stephen and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Andy Dolny, UPS Treasurer and Investor Relations Officer. The floor is yours, sir.Andy DolnyGood morning and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Scott Davis, our CEO, and Kurt Kuehn, our CFO along with Chief Operating Officer, David Abney; International President, Dan Brutto; President of U.S. Operations, Myron Gray; and Alan Gershenhorn, UPS Chief Sales and Marketing Officer.Before we begin, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the company. These anticipated results are subject to risks and uncertainties which are described in detail in our 2011 Form 10-K and 2012 10-Q reports. These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the Securities and Exchange Commission.During our third quarter earnings call in October, I explained that if interest rates remain low, UPS would likely record a sizable pension mark-to-market charge in the fourth quarter. Interest rates did remain low and although the plans exceeded their expected rate of return, that benefit was more than offset by the 120 basis point decline in average year-end discount rates. Under GAAP, UPS is required to use portfolio of double A bonds to calculate our pension plan discount rates. In 2011, there were many double A bonds of financial institutions that were part of the portfolio calculation. In 2012, some of the bonds of financial institutions were downgraded and therefore excluded from our portfolio. While the spreads on the ones that remained compressed at a much greater rate than corporate bonds.These two factors, the change in the bond portfolio mix and the compression in the spreads to treasuries resulted in a significant drop in our average discount rate. This led to a non-cash mark-to-market after-tax charge of $3 billion on our company sponsored pension and post-retirement benefit plans for 2012. As a result, on a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share for the quarter were reduced by $3.15. Keep in mind this charge does not affect UPS cash flow, benefits paid to plan participants, or required pension funding. In fact, over the next three years, required pension contributions for UPS are significantly less than the previous three years.Ignoring the impact of this charge, diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1.32. To provide additional information on the mark-to-market accounting process, we have posted a tutorial on the IR website which includes a sensitivity analysis that illustrates the impact of changes in discount rates. For example, a 100 basis point increase in discount rates could result in a mark-to-market gain.In our remarks today, we will refer to UPS fourth quarter 2012 results excluding the impact of the mark-to-market charge. Additionally, all 2012 full-year references and comparisons to 2011 will refer to adjusted results. We believe this is a more accurate picture of the company's performance. Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures and free cash flow which is a non-GAAP financial measure, are included in this schedules that accompanies our earnings news release. These schedules along with a webcast of today's call are available on the UPS investor relations website.A couple of reminders. Any guidance that we provide for 2013 does not include expenses related to our attempted acquisition of TNT. And, finally, each of you will be allowed to ask one question and then get back into queue for follow up. Thanks for your cooperation.Now, let me turn it over to Scott.Scott Davis","Thanks Andy and good morning. I hope that everyone had a safe and happy holiday season.Despite an environment of sluggish global trade that existed for most of 2012 and increase in uncertainty in the U.S created by the November elections and the fiscal cliff, UPS executed well. Although we fell short of our goals for the year, we did achieve record earnings per share. Our U.S domestic business led the way. We continue to see robust growth in residential shipments as the UPS portfolio provides a rapidly growing e-commerce market with unequaled solutions. Whether it\u2019s putting goods in consumers\u2019 hands the next day, or through more economical products like UPS SurePost, we are getting the job done.Though we\u2019ve been around for more than 100 years, things never stand still at UPS and 2012 was definitely a year filled with opportunities and challenges. Our bid to acquire TNT Express is probably the first to come to mind. It would be an understatement to say we\u2019re disappointed by the decision of the European Commission to block the acquisition. UPS essentially put all hands on deck to get this deal done over the last year. I\u2019d like to thank the many UPSers around the world who worked tirelessly on this project. We will of course continue to pursue growth opportunities, both organic and through acquisitions. While we view the TNT transaction as part of a compelling growth platform and it consumed a lot of internal resources, we are moving on.Our financial strength enables UPS to evaluate future prospects as well as continue to invest in our portfolio. The UPS vision and focus centers on four transformative strategies; deploying technology enabled operations; providing unique industry specific customer solutions; expanding our global network; and finally, serving the needs of end consumers around the world.In fact during 2012 and early 2013, we have launched powerful new, all enhanced services as we continue to invest for growth to support the needs of our customers. For example we expanded the footprint of UPS Next Day Air Service in the U.S and today, UPS delivers to more businesses and zip codes overnight by 8:30 a.m. and 10:30 than anyone. Our forwarding unit added innovative supply chain management technology like UPS Order Watch.Most recently we launched the new UPS Worldwide Express Freight Service for heavy airfreight. It offers a seamless experience between shipping express packages and express freight. And finally, UPS further developed capabilities through new and expanded healthcare sites around the world and through operating facility expansions like our Cologne Hub, which is on track to be completed in 2013.On the labor front, UPS started negotiations early with the Teamsters and we continue to be engaged in productive discussions. Things are progressing and we look forward to an early conclusion.Regarding 2013, the global economic environment shows that we remain in a cycle of mixed growth and mixed signals. I\u2019ve talked to a number of customers and it\u2019s clear that fiscal uncertainty continues to erode business confidence and growth prospects. This will continue until Washington starts to compromise and make decisions in some key areas. Yet I must admit that in the U.S, we were off to a surprisingly strong start in January.In Europe there has been some improvement. Forecast for Germany and the U.K are better, while the Netherlands and Poland are worse. But clearly, we\u2019re starting 2013 in Europe in a more stable situation than last year. Asia\u2019s GDP forecasts have also improved.In the fourth quarter, global trade returned to more normal trends and expectations are for that to continue. I\u2019m confident that whatever the global trade environment is, our people will deliver. UPS is made up of hundreds of thousands of dedicated employees. I want to thank UPSers for their efforts during 2012 and I\u2019m proud of how our people rose to the challenges they faced. I want to give special recognition to those who went the extra mile in the aftermath of hurricane Sandy, UPSers stepping up to lend a hand in a time of crisis. Great job.Regardless of external uncertainty, UPS is not waiting around for change. We are leveraging our growth strategies to adapt and prosper. We intend to maintain our high standard for earnings, return on invested capital and free cash flow. And UPS is confident in our ability to achieve the long-term targets we defined at our 2011 Industrial Conference. Now before Kurt covers the financials, David Abney will share information on our peak season.David AbneyThanks, Scott. Holiday retail sales came in slightly below expectations but UPS still hit a new high, delivering over 500 million packages globally during peak season. Our air business was especially strong and reflected the trust customers place on the speed and effectiveness of UPS. On our peak air day, Christmas eve, UPS delivered over 8 million air packages, more than 2.5 times our normal air volume and over 1 million pieces more than last year. Processing this many packages makes having the UPS integrated global network all the more beneficial.Over the years, we have made strategic capital investments to expand Worldport, modernize our fleet, and develop state of the art technologies like telematics and next generation small sorts. These investments give UPS a competitive advantage and are one of the keys to success. Our innovative technologies combined with the best people in the business, enabled us to deliver peak season volume more efficiently than ever before. Offer innovative services like UPS My Choice, which increases operational performance and enhances the customer experience and manage complex operating plans during two distinct volume surges, Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and the two weeks before Christmas.We are even seeing a third spike develop. One to manage the post sales process where the UPS returns portfolio is well positioned to capture growth. Since the financial community loves numbers, here are few more stats for you. Volume on peak day December 19, was almost 28 million packages. And on six days we delivered over 25 million. Our busiest tracking day was December 18, when more than 65 million tracking requests occurred. And my favorite as COO, efficiency metrics. In the U.S. where daily volumes grew by 3%, miles driven were up 1.2% and direct labor hours were up 2.3%.On the air side, U.S. Next Day Air grew almost 8%, while block hours were up only 1.6%. International exports improved over 5% yet international block hours declined 1%. UPS efficiency is nothing new. For example, since 2008 U.S. domestic volume handled per block hour has increased more than 20%. This is just the way we run our business. We don\u2019t wait to implement big operations initiatives. UPS seeks incremental improvements everyday year after year. So as you can see, UPS airline operations are as productive as ever and this positions us for growth and better returns to our investors.Finally, I would like to take a moment to recognize the more than 20,000 employees of the UPS airline. You may not know this, but it was 25 years ago tomorrow that UPS airlines operated its first revenue flight when aircraft tail number, N880UP, a DC-8 flew from Louisville to Milwaukee. In August of that year, UPS announced plans to form its own airline. And it became the fastest startup in FAA history. So congratulations and thanks to all of you who made it possible. Now I will turn things over to Kurt to discuss the financial highlights.Kurt Kuehn","Well, thanks David and good morning everyone. On a consolidated basis UPS fundamentals are strong as ever. We wrapped up the year with free cash flow of approximately $5.4 billion and although we feel short of our target for the year, UPS generated record earnings per share of $4.53. This was achieved in the face of weak global trade and in spite of superstorm Sandy which cost us about $0.05 a share.UPS annual revenue of $54.1 billion was our highest ever, as were the 4.1 billion packages we delivered globally. Pricing improvements, along with the efficiencies that David highlighted, led to margin expansion. For the quarter, consolidated package volume grew 3% per day. Revenue of $14.6 billion set a record as did operating profit at $2 billion.While the U.S domestic segment improved profitability, international experienced a slight decline and faced with a margin squeeze in forwarding, the supply chain and freight segment also exhibited lower profit.Now let\u2019s review our results in detail, starting with the U.S domestic segment. In the U.S, we fired on all cylinders. Operating profit was nearly $1.4 billion, a new high. Average daily volume grew 3% with Next Day Air up almost 8% and Ground up 3%, driven by expansion in B2C shipments.Despite slightly weaker than forecast holiday retail sales, shoppers went online like never before. We experienced strong growth in Next Day Air Saver and traditional UPS Ground and of course our lightweight solution SurePost, was also popular this holiday season. We continued to see strong growth there, even though we wrapped last year\u2019s rollout of this product.Revenue for the segment grew 3%, with Next Day Air and Ground up 5.4% and 3.4% respectively. Revenue per piece increased 1.7%, driven by base rate improvements in both Ground and Air. As a result of increased demand for our Saver products, Next Day Air revenue per piece declined 60 basis points.Operating profit of almost $1.4 billion was up 4.4% and operating margin expanded to 15.4%. Hurricane Sandy was a challenge in the quarter, but our operations expertise and integrated network mitigated some of its impact. In addition, rising healthcare benefit costs continues to be a headwind, but its impact on the quarter was partially offset by some onetime items.Moving on to our international segment, UPS delivered 1.1 million export packages per day, up 5.5%, although that was boosted about 1% by global operating day differences. Leading the growth was Asia, where export volume grew in the mid-teens, aided strongly by tech sector product launches.During the quarter, export revenue per piece declined 3.5% on a currency neutral basis. Typically, Asia growth would be a great story, but during the holidays this growth was concentrated in lower weight packages from high volume shippers using less premium products.Europe exports improved as a result of growth in non-premium products. Companies there continue to streamline their supply chains and lever UPS solutions to meet their needs. Germany, Italy and the U.K all showed solid export increases. We are confident in the opportunities created by a developing European small package market and we\u2019ll continue to aggressively pursue growth strategies there.Domestic revenue in the international segment increased 1.3% on flat daily volume growth. Revenue per piece increased more than 4% on a currency neutral basis, reflecting our focus on revenue management.Overall, total UPS international revenue grew 1.5% to $3.2 billion. Operating profit was $499 million, down slightly. Changes in customer and product mix lowered profits. However, operating margin of 15.6% continues to set the bar in the industry. Acquisition related expenses of approximately $30 million were higher than anticipated and negatively impacted earnings per share by about $0.01 more than originally expected.Now for supply chain and freight. Revenue increased 4% over last year to $2.4 billion. Our forwarding and logistics group improved $40 million or 2.5%, while UPS freight revenue increased by $39 million or 6.2%. In the forwarding business, tonnage and yield improvements led to revenue growth, though this growth was somewhat offset by reductions in other transportation solutions. Increases in transportation expense were a challenge for profit. In the Asia air freight market there was a short term volume surge which exceeded capacities and drove up buy rates. As a result our margin was squeezed and profit declined. However, UPS Ocean products did very well. ","Revenue and profit increased year-over-year and the popularity of our less than container load offering exceeded expectations. The UPS distribution business increased revenue by providing healthcare and high-tech customers effective solutions to better manage their supply chains. In fact, healthcare revenue increased by more than (inaudible). During the quarter we opened three new healthcare facilities and more are scheduled for 2013.At UPS Freight, LTL revenue was up 6.5% and gross weight hauled increased by almost five. For the quarter, operating margin was similar to last year and overall for the year margin expanded by 70 basis points. Let me shift gears and spend a moment on pensions. First, a reminder that the mark-to-market charge that Andy spoke about does not affect UPS cash flow, benefits paid to plan participants or required pension funding. Funding requirements for UPS sponsored pension plans were modified by recent legislation and as a result UPS plans are fully funded and we have no required cash contributions in 2013.As for pension expense in 2013, the lower discount rates do cause higher service and interest costs. As a result, we expect pension expense for these plans to increase about $225 million compared to last year. This will be a significant drag in 2013 although when discount rates go back up, we will see decreases in pension expense. Looking now at our cash and balance sheet.During 2012, UPS generated $5.4 billion in free cash flow after capital expenditures of $2.2 billion. We ended the year with almost $8 billion in cash and marketable securities. Although keep in mind that $1.75 billion has already been used this month to pay up maturing debt. For the year, UPS paid $2.1 billion in dividends, an increase of 9.6% per share. In addition, we repurchased 21.8 million shares for approximately $1.6 billion. Looking ahead to 2013, UPS expects strong free cash flow to continue, again exceeding 100% of net income.As a result of our strong financial position and reflecting our commitment to share on the distributions, UPS is increasing our 2013 guidance for share repurchases by an additional $2.5 billion, up to a total of $4 billion. As always, dividends will also continue to be a priority. Looking at guidance beyond cash, as Scott alluded to, the global economic shows that we remain in the cycle of mixed recovery with more improvement in some places than others. We are confident that the strategies outlined by Scott position UPS well. As a result, we expect another good year of earnings growth. We are anticipating earnings per share in the range of $4.80 to $5.06, an increase of 6% to 12%.Looking at the segments. For the full year, U.S. domestic average daily volume is projected to grow around 2% to 3%, slightly above GDP estimates. Revenue is expected to be up mid-single digits with base rate improvements of 2% to 3%. We are pleased with the momentum in our domestic business although UPS does expect increased healthcare and pension expense to limit margin expansion. We anticipate an operating margin approaching 14%, resulting in profit growth at a mid-single digit pace. In our international business, UPS expects revenue to increase at a mid-single digit rate with domestic and export daily volume growing faster than global GDP.Exports yields will continue to be pressured by both changing customer mix and increased reliance on non-premium products. We expect operating margin will expand slightly in spite of an estimated currency headwind of $125 million. In supply chain and freight, for the full year, we expect revenue to increase at a mid to high single-digit pace with some margin expansion, resulting in profit growth of approximately 10%. The segment is expected to maintain a strong operating margin of at least 8%, despite continued investments in healthcare solutions and facilities.Looking specifically at expectations for first quarter, there are a number of items that will negatively impact year-over-year comparisons, most notably, one less operating day and the timing of an early Easter. Even though UPS expects full year earnings per share growth in the range of 6% to 12%, for the first quarter, we anticipate that earnings per share growth will be relatively flat. Reviewing segments for the first quarter, both U.S domestic and international are expected to generate results similar to Q1 of last year. Supply chain and freight profits end margins should be down on a year-over-year basis because of investments in technology and the gain recognized last year on the sale of the surplus facility.To wrap up the income statement, our overall tax rate for 2013 should be between 34% and 35%. Regarding CapEx, for the full year, we expect our spending to be $2.4 billion, keeping us at approximately 4% of revenue.In summary, 2012 had its challenges. UPS set some records, but we also fell short in some areas. We are always constructively dissatisfied at UPS, seeking to attain new highs and this year will be no different. Despite another year of mixed global economic conditions, and approximately $350 million in headwinds from pension and currency, UPS will continue to raise the bar, with expected full year earnings per share growth of 6% to 12%. And as Scott mentioned earlier, we remain confident in our ability to achieve the UPS long term target of 10% to 15% earnings per share growth.Thanks and now we\u2019ll be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","Our first question will come from the line of Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.Justin B. Yagerman \u2013 Deutsche Bank AGGood morning guys. Wanted to reconcile the guidance and the commentary on the economy in the press release to Scott your early remarks behind how the economy is trending here in the beginning of 2013. It felt like guidance was potentially a little bit conservative here. Kurt, you did a good job running through some of the assumptions, but is it really just the weakness on international yields and the $350 million of headwinds that get you nervous? Or you do see anything else from an economic standpoint that really gives you some pause here in the early part of the year?Scott DavisJustin, let me start. I think that overall we still see 2013 as a slow growth economy. I think that the good signs that I talked about is I think you see a more stable Europe than we saw a year ago. We\u2019re starting to see a pickup in global trade which is very important for us as we look forward. The second and third quarters of 2012 we saw global trade lag, the global economic growth which is very unusual. So it feels like that\u2019s getting more normal. In the U.S, as I said I think we got off to a strong start in January. I think a variety of reasons for that. I think with the trends the last few years we\u2019ve seen strong last weeks of December, early January due to I think gift card purchases after Christmas due to a lot of returns.Yesterday\u2019s GDP number said that obviously the inventories were very low. So I think we\u2019re seeing restocking of inventories early in January. But I\u2019m still cautious as we move through the year that I do think we\u2019ll see growth in the U.S, though we still are going to be addressing the debt ceiling in the second quarter. More than likely that\u2019s going to cause some uncertainty. So we have some challenges. As far as the guidance, the big number I think is the drag due to pension and currency and the pension is out of your control. Low discount rates, it had a big impact and that\u2019s impacts earnings by about 5%. So you take that and add that to the 6% to 12% guidance, it would have been a very strong guidance without those headwinds.Kurt Kuehn","Yeah. I think that the basic expectations are that the U.S economy will be somewhere around 2% and global GDP somewhere around 2.5%. So certainly not a barn burner year. We expect under trend performance and as Scott said, the pension could just as easily turn around next year and if we get 100 basis point increase in the discount rate that would be a $200 million tailwind.Justin B. Yagerman \u2013 Deutsche Bank AGWhat are you guys looking forward to get more excited this year in terms of economic signs? And what are you seeing out of Asian airfreight? That\u2019s been a place of particular weakness. Didn\u2019t hear too much on that.Kurt Kuehn","We certainly some getting resolution in Washington to some extent will be a big deal. So consumer confidence pulling through with the activities in DC. I will turn it over maybe to Dan Brutto, our President of International, to talk a little bit about the trends we are seeing in Asia.Daniel BruttoYeah, I guess the Asia trends really are -- right now you have got a lot of large hi-tech customers that have send out product launches. But after the first of the year, they are getting more positive in Asia. Also the area of somewhat concern is, is folks are using less premium products in Asia. The Chinese New Year is also later this year, it\u2019s in the first week, almost the second week of February. So right now we are off to a good start, as Scott said, in January. So we expect Asia to come back. The tail of the tape will be how we will come back to customers in the middle market where we have provided a lot of solutions for start utilizing premium products to take care of this inventory shortage that we know is in the marketplace.Kurt KuehnLet me just add, I think a more stable Europe will also aid in Asia exports which were very negative last year up until the fourth quarter and in U.S. exports. I mean, that certainly has had a big drag on U.S. exports in 2012. So, as Europe stabilizes and begin buying goods again, that will be good for exports.Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.Tom Wadewitz - JPMorganI wanted to ask you the mix. So Dan, just talked about how that\u2019s been of a headwind in international but can you help me think about mix both domestic, if you have growth in B2C. And how much that affects your margin view? Is that something that maybe makes you a little bit cautious on margin in domestic? And then from an international perspective, how material is that impact on your international margins? Can you deal pretty well with growth in less than premium products or is that a material factor to consider in our margin beyond international?Scott DavisYeah, Tom, I think on the domestic side we have really saw all of 2012 as a year where B2C was really at the lead that our B2B business was relatively flat, just up slightly in the fourth quarter and really that continuing process of direct to consumer was a big factor. And even in that environment and even with the headwind of Sandy, we did show margin improvements in the U.S. So is B2C a little tougher than B2B, yes, it is. On the other hand, Myron, and the deployment of technology enabled operations has made us, we think, able to profitably grow with that.On the international side, we have got -- in Europe we have got great Pan-European capabilities. The yields on our express volume certainly are higher than the standard. But we think we can manage through those things. The big product launch is certainly something that does distort margin a little bit because those are high revenue, relatively low yielding products. So those probably have more to do with any disruption that you saw in the trends.David AbneyI guess on the international front as far as margins are concerned, if you take a look at the last quarter, we really take a close look at the domestic to make sure that we maintain our margins in the domestic business and we serve essentially those customers that are importers and exporters. For our export product internationally, we do very well with B2C as well as B2B. In fact, certainly even in the tough economy in the fourth quarter, a 15.6 margin continues to be industry-leading by a significant amount. We expect that to continue in the future.OperatorOur next question will come from the line of Mr. David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead.David Vernon - Sanford C. BernsteinSo the increased guidance for buyback, so it\u2019s $4 billion for 2013. It\u2019s still going to leave you with quite a bit of cash on the balance sheet. Can you talk about kind of future plans for that capital as well as how you think about growth going forward in a world without the TNT acquisition?Kurt KuehnYeah, I guess if you are looking at the year-end balance sheet, clearly, we did payback a large debt issuance that came in due in January, as I referenced to. So about $1.75 billion of cash was used for that. Now, we are stepping back up our repurchase scenario. We pulled back on that in light of the big commitment of the TNT acquisition and we are certainly getting back on track with that. The $4 billion basically catches up the shortfall that we had in 2012 because of us being a little more conservative. As far as use of cash in the future, I will turn it over to Scott to talk about that.Scott DavisWell, I think, David, the game plan is we will keep a balanced use of cash going forward. We will continue to increase distributions to shareowners. We will review dividend policy here in a couple of weeks. So we had a board meeting for 2013 and clearly we will reinvest in the business. We think there are opportunities out there in the emerging new markets there\u2019s opportunities out there and the supply chain world we\u2019re doing a lot more in healthcare these days. So we\u2019ll have opportunities to reinvest via acquisition route also.David Vernon - Sanford C. BernsteinSo there is a possibility then for some other inorganic stuff to come up in priority?Scott DavisYeah, absolutely there\u2019s a possibility. We\u2019re always looking for opportunities out there. There won\u2019t be things the size of TNT likely, but there\u2019ll be opportunities for us to reinvest in the business.David Vernon - Sanford C. BernsteinAnd would that be core package or would you think more supply chain and freight?Andy DolnyDavid, we\u2019re going to try to limit the questions to get everybody on the call. We\u2019ll answer this one and then I\u2019ll ask to be your last question.Scott DavisI think we\u2019ve always said that our priorities are international package looking as far as we can expand the network. That stays a priority. Certainly in the forwarding and distribution world we see opportunities, namely in healthcare. So I think nothing has changed as far as the outlook there.OperatorOur next question will come from the line of Ben Hartford of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.Benjamin J. Hartford \u2013Robert W. Baird & Co. Inc.Good morning. Dan, maybe you could address a little bit about international capacity on the airfreight side at the moment. I know you guys took delivery of seven aircraft in 2012. Are you expecting or can you talk maybe about the expected timeline of the eight remaining deliveries of the 767? And then more broadly, can you talk about the dynamics on capacity in these key trade lanes from a dedicated freight of perspective as well as from some of the passenger aircraft and maybe where we stand from an equilibrium perspective? Thanks.Kurt KuehnI\u2019ll turn it over to David Abney to talk about the airline deliveries and the overall global network.David AbneyAs far as the 767s that we\u2019re receiving this year, we\u2019re going to receive eight. We look to put seven of them in the domestic routes, one in international. As far as the international flying, just due to the fragile global economics, we\u2019re managing the network very closely by bid period. So, we\u2019re making those adjustments every eight weeks or so.Daniel BruttoI guess I would say on the international arena, our capacity and utilization of aircraft has never been better and certainly as David said, we want to utilize our planes. With our hybrid network, we actually on the forwarding business can move a lot of our freight into the commercial market. In fact for every five kilos that we pick up in our forwarding business, four kilos goes on another carrier\u2019s aircraft. About one kilo goes on a UPS aircraft. That\u2019s very good because when the economy flexes either up or down, we can move more premium or more freight into our own network to make sure that that\u2019s fully utilized as well as optimizing the use of commercial aircraft.Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Chris Ceraso of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please go ahead.Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AGGood morning. Just wanted to get a clarification on the guidance and then a question about the pension. The guidance, does the 480 to 506 include the expected reduction in your share count associated with the $4 billion buyback?Kurt KuehnYeah, it would. That reflects the expected $4 billion spread over the year reasonably ratably and also includes the expectation of the pension increase and others. So that\u2019s all in. what it doesn\u2019t include is any expenses from the TNT, either the freight fee or the substantial amount of legal and internal resources that we\u2019ve deployed.Scott DavisJust to remind you, the share buyback does benefit earnings growth by about 2%. The pension and currency drags earnings growth by about 5% in that guidance range.Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter of BofA Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.Ken Hoexter \u2013 Bank of America Merrill LynchGood morning. If we could just follow up on the international side again, as you noted you continue to improve efficiency, but how do you think about that as the international margins continue to fall? I know that you said they were at solid levels relative to industry, but are there things you can do to continue to get that back on track? Or is that as you watch these new super saver products continue to deteriorate that over time?Scott DavisKen, certainly before Dan talks about it, I guess we do have to take the results of the international business with some perspective that we\u2019ve been involved over the last couple of quarters with the largest projects in company history and a very large number of resources and people have been involved in the TNT acquisition. So as Dan takes a breath and his people get focused on the future, clearly there\u2019s plenty of opportunity.Daniel Brutto","Yeah. I\u2019d just add onto that that certainly we had an extremely large team to work on the TNT transaction. That team now is coming back. A lot of that team was very much involved with our customers, which are value-added sales to customers and certainly now we have that team back in full force. So, that will be a big certainly element in us moving forward to get greater margins in the future.Kurt Kuehn","And you know, Ken, in the fourth quarter we actually talked about, we had larger customers in the mix, we had lighter products, we had slower moving products that impacted it. But I think as you look forward, we are optimistic on global trade getting back to little more normal in the future. And there are things on. We talked about Europe. We talked about the U.S. making some progress in the fiscal cliff, long ways to go but that could help U.S. consumption. Energy, prices have somewhat stabilized compared with the ups and downs we saw in the last few years. Japan\u2019s easing, it\u2019s going to help the trade out of Japan. And I think the recent change in Chinese leadership is going to help stabilize things and cause quicker growth in China.So things are starting to get us back where we feel that global trade will outperform the global economy, whether 125% to 150% over the growth of GDP, we don\u2019t know. But it will get back to normal relationship.Scott DavisYeah, I think one other thing maybe to add. Alan Gershenhorn talked a little bit about the product innovation too, because as we have said, we are not standing still and we do have a lot of initiatives that are adding more value in the marketplace.Alan GershenhornYeah, so as Kurt said we have done a number of enhancements in new product introductions. We just announced the introduction of UPS Express Freight that Scott talked about in his opening comments. It\u2019s in 37 origins to 41 destinations and it covers about 85% of world trade. And we are certainly excited about that. That product again provides a seamless transition between our express package services into express freight. We have also just enhanced our worldwide expedited service. We have added 145 destinations. And that\u2019s really targeted at higher weight, higher yielding packages. We have also introduced U.S. to Mexico and Mexico standard ground service. And, I guess last but not least, we have enhanced our Paperless Invoice service which really does streamline the international process and creates a significant differentiation for our customers.Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley.Bill Greene - Morgan StanleyYeah, Kurt, I think you can hear from some of the questions there is a sense that the guidance is conservative in light of the commentary. And one piece of it that I am just curious about then is, do you make any assumption that there may be a shift of business as we approach the deadline for the Teamsters contract, or is that not expected at all? May be you can get it done even early.Kurt KuehnNo, I think, we feel very confident, as Scott said that we are making good progress and we are still almost half a year out, we have left to go on that, and we do expect that to get concluded successfully and early. The biggest issue really as you talk about the domestic is the headwind we have or the pension frankly was unexpected to some extent and does create about 5% headwind on the domestic results.Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Scott Group of Wolfe Trahan. Please go ahead.Scott Group - Wolfe Trahan","So just wanted to clarify, the $0.05 of Sandy impact, if you could break that out among the three segments. And then just kind of the longer-term question. The guidance for domestic package margins is pretty flattish year-over-year. Is that just a sense that the pension impact is going to be mostly felt there or do you think we are getting closer to peak on those domestic package margins? Any maybe within the margin commentary, if you can give some thoughts on -- if you have assumed any material changes in the economics with the Teamsters and anything with the priority mail contract with the post office.Scott DavisOkay, a lot of pieces to that one. I will try to unfold them. I will talk a little bit about some of the margin issue and the guidance and then Myron clearly can talk about Sandy and also some of the things that we are doing going forward. Basically, the issue for 2013, we are looking at a sub-trend U.S. GDP of about 2%. We have made good progress and we expect that. We do not think we are at peak margins but we do have $200 million, the vast majority of which is U.S. domestic. So it does hit primarily the domestic segment. So we do think we are continuing to make good progress but with that blip and with a muted U.S. economy, the guidance is appropriate that we do expect modest margin improvement and profits up in the mid-single digits. I\u2019ll turn it over to Myron to talk about Sandy, how that impacted the segments and then a little bit about some of the operating initiatives we have.Myron Gray","Good morning. Myron Gray. As you heard, Sandy did impact us probably by about $75 million in the fourth quarter, but despite that, as you\u2019ve heard, we did have a good fourth quarter. Now looking forward, as Kurt and Scott have both alluded to, we do face a headwind of about $200 million of pension expected headwind. Without that, we\u2019d be looking at a 10% growth in profit. However, despite the headwinds that we face, we have continued to attract profitable volume, both in B2B as well as B2C and with the deployment of world class technologies, we expect that we\u2019ll get closer to the 14% margin. Actually if you look at full year \u201912, margin was 13.8%. So we\u2019re right at the expected number and really don\u2019t expect not to make it.Scott Davis","And then one last piece of the puzzle, you made a quick reference to the postal contract. I\u2019ll let David Abney update you a little bit on that.David Abney","We have responded to the USPS RFP to provide airlift services. We expect to hear back sometime next month. We\u2019re confident we can support the postal services commitment to its mail customers, creating significant growth opportunities for UPS. We look forward to expanding our relationship with them.OperatorOur next question will come from the line of Art Hatfield of Raymond James. Please go ahead.Arthur W. Hatfield \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.Morning everybody. Most of my questions have been answered, but just one quick question on Europe. Post TNT, do you see or anticipate or have you heard from any of your customers that the competitive landscape may change given what\u2019s got on \u2013 what this potential acquisition now going away?Scott DavisDan just came back from Europe last night. So I\u2019ll let Dan give you an answer to that.Daniel Brutto","Yeah. I guess I spent last week in Davos and had the opportunity to talk to many European multinational customers. They asked me about what our future plans are in Europe. Certainly there\u2019s opportunity for us to expand in certain areas of Europe and Eastern Europe. We do have the best product portfolio right now in Europe with our transporter product and certainly our breadth of portfolio which goes all the way from ocean to certainly express air. I think for the most part we can provide the service. I think certainly TNT would have helped us get there faster, but there are still all kinds of opportunities for us and right now our ability just in the healthcare field to expand our healthcare operations across Europe. We spent a lot of time with healthcare customers who are very excited about getting out of the supply chain brick and mortar business and turning that over to UPS to handle the end to end supply needs that they have. So we\u2019re very excited about the future in Europe.OperatorOur next question will come from the line of Mr. Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup Global. Please go ahead.Christian Wetherbee \u2013 Citigroup Inc.Good morning guys. Maybe a question just on shipper behavior, particularly in the Asia outbound market. You mentioned some trade-down it sounds like. Is that more just a customer mix issue doing more for the larger players as opposed to more middle markets? Orr are you seeing more strategic changes on how your customers on the whole are treating or managing the supply chain, particularly in that region?Scott DavisWe\u2019ll turn it over to Dan to talk a little bit about that.Daniel BruttoYeah, I guess what's happening is we saw in the last quarter, certainly as margins from some of our large customers gets squeezed in the high-tech area and I would argue in another areas, they look to more efficiency as far as using less premium products, even to the point of going all the way down to ocean. As Kurt mentioned before, we were very successful in ocean in the fourth quarter and actually for 2012, we had our most profitable year in ocean. So I don't suspect that that's going to happen forever, because innovation certainly in the world allows new products to come to market. Those new products have a higher margin and those are the products that fly in our planes and utilize the premium service.Kurt KuehnI'm going to ask Alan maybe talk just a little bit. At the same time we're meeting the needs of very large customers. We have a number of initiatives enabling middle market customers to export. Alan?Alan GershenhornSo we\u2019re \u2013 I think you heard earlier that we're focusing our attention on industry-specific customer solutions. We've talked a lot about healthcare on the call in terms of investing in healthcare complying facilities and technology to enable these middle market customers. Also certainly on the retail side, really working on deploying end-to-end logistics solutions for them. Just switching gears a bit, I was just in Europe also and with our Kiala acquisition, we had a conference. We are watching UK UPS access points and had close to 100 retailers there excited about that opportunity. And that solution there turns those B2C packages into B2B shipments and provides a lot more convenience and accessibility to consumers enabling these retailers to grow their business.Scott DavisWhat fixes it faster than anything is increased demand out of Europe and the United States. And surely in the last couple of years we have had weak demand in both -- most of the developed world. So as that strengthens and we are projecting that, we will strengthen that. That will help this problem.OperatorOur next question will come from the line of Mr. Kevin Sterling of BB&T Capital Markets. Please go ahead.Kevin Sterling - BB&T Capital MarketsYou guys have talked about the trade down with customers from doing economy service from a priority overnight service. What do you think reverses this trend? Is it simply an uptick in the economy or maybe that\u2019s the new normal?Kurt KuehnWell, I think it\u2019s a combination of events. So I will let Alan talk maybe a little about what we see. You know all this talk about trade-down, we clearly are seeing some of that in the international arena in Europe probably most notably. At the same time we had an extra here, volume growth of 8%. So we are certainly not suffering too badly with our premium product up that strongly. One of the reasons we are seeing that is what we like to call this new Omni channel strategy that many retailers are adopting. So, Alan, maybe you could open that up a little bit?Alan Gershenhorn","Yeah. And I think, Kurt, to your point, we have been gaining share in the air business for quite some time and a lot of that has to do with our success in the retail sector. Again whether it\u2019s the B2C or B to the stores. And this Omni channel phenomena is really transformation of what's happening in the retail industry and our customers are out there looking for ways to manage between the online channel and the brick and mortar. And so you are seeing folks ordering online through the store, you are seeing folks fulfill online orders from the store, maximizing their inventories and enabling later pickups and so on and so forth.And I think the key to this is having a broad portfolio of services out there and while we have certainly the phenomenon of folks looking for less expensible alternative, there is also still plenty of market out there for consumers that have an urgent need for product and so and so forth, that\u2019s been driving really our air business to the degree that Kurt mentioned.OperatorOur next question will come from the line of Mr. Nate Brochmann of William Blair & Company. Please go ahead.Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & CompanyI wanted to talk a little bit kind of this whole mantra of the trade down etcetera, but a little bit more specifically on the new Express Freight product. You know that kind seamlessly integrates this, I assume that\u2019s driven by some of those hi-tech customers that are now packaging what used to be small parcel as more of freight shipments. And I was wondering how that\u2019s kind of effecting, one, kind of your load balances. And, two, just kind of looking forward, whether that freight is more like the UPS traditional small parcel customers moving to that or whether you are gaining additional shares from what would have been more traditional freight customers. Thanks.Scott Davis","Yeah, good question. I guess certainly we see a lot of opportunity for new and additional volume for this. But, Dan, why don\u2019t you talk a little bit?Daniel BruttoYeah, Nate, on this whole Express Freight product, first of all it\u2019s not limited as we have seen to date to the hi-tech field. It\u2019s in aerospace, it\u2019s in high-end retail. It\u2019s in diversified manufacturing, automotive as well as hi-tech. So it cuts across all. From a customer standpoint, many of the customers use UPS today but the confusion was how do I get this once a month or once every other month express freight shipment that hast to be there. And the unique part about this is they can use the same UPS technology, the same labeling, the same tracking, the same tracing, the same building, which allows them seamlessly to use express freight from us where many times they had to call a forwarder or someone different to do this. So we think it\u2019s very exciting the product is off to a great launch. We think it cuts across multiple industries and it\u2019s going to be a big winner for UPS this year and into the future.Kurt KuehnAnd this is a premium product initiative. This will have yields much higher than our forwarding and are highly compensatory in the express arena. We just have not focused on that segment as much as perhaps we could have in the past.OperatorOur next question will come from the line of Mr. Jeff Kauffman of Sterne Agee. Please ago ahead.Jeff Kauffman \u2013 Sterne AgeeThanks guys. Just one question. I'm going to focus a little bit on Europe and I know a couple of speakers have already asked that. In the wake of no longer being involved in TNT, but going through the diligence, were there practices or things you noticed about the way they were doing business in Europe or is something that would have happened as a result of that acquisition that makes you rethink the way you want to move going forward? I know you talked a little bit about Kiala. Does that change the importance of Kiala? Does that make you rethink say a road freight network or something like that?Kurt KuehnJeff, I think, probably the biggest impact of our TNT deal was that we put a lot of initiatives on hold. We've been very excited about Europe. We've got a great multi-decade story of growth in Europe, frankly, with the largest acquisition in Company history and one that would have taken us over 1,000 people to integrate at max. We were focused on that, and so we did slow down some of the initiatives. But we remain focused on growth there. Alan already mentioned the fact that we\u2019re kicking off our Kiala offering in the U.K. Dan has mentioned that he's putting the scores of people that we'd have working on the integration planning back to work. So, it's really just kicking back into gear with some of growth strategies.Scott DavisJeff, I'd just add that we understand Europe very well. We've been there since the mid-70s. We think we have, as Dan said, the best network over there already. We did learn that the regulatory process is a complicated process over there. So we learned a lot about the commission, but we think we know the market well over in Europe.OperatorOur next question will come from the line of Mr. Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Please go ahead.Brandon Oglenski \u2013 BarclaysGood morning everyone and thanks for taking my question. When we look at domestic profitability in the fourth quarter, excluding the Sandy impact, it actually looked like close to a record margin and you've been closer to flat throughout the year. So can you talk about some of the initiatives that you've had to better leverage the B2C traffic in your network along with the flat outcomes in B2B?Kurt KuehnCertainly as we\u2019ve said, operations enhanced with technology is a big priority, and I'll let Myron talk a little bit about some of things that worked well to meet the B2C growth this year and then maybe David talk about some of our research and development for the future.Myron GrayFor years we've talked about enhancing our operating leverage through packaged flow technology, and with that employment over the last few years has helped us totally control the number of base hours that we absorb from our employee base. New technologies like ORION and Telematics helped us reduce the miles driven, hold them flat to 1% while we saw volume growth of 3%. Now, while we have experienced a flurry of B2C growth, I think balance is the more appropriate way to look at it. When you balance B2C with B2B and a carrier like UPS that has an integrated network, it totally allows us to control our costs. So with base rate improvements of 1.7% in the quarter, it helped us balance yield with ops expense of 1.4%. So it really was a good quarter for us from a balanced approach.Kurt KuehnYeah and we are certainly doing a lot of research and development to continue this momentum. David, maybe you could talk a little bit about some of the things that's happening.David AbneyWell, one of the technologies that we are very excited about is SurePost redirect, and what this gives us a capability to do is to route SurePost packages to the lowest cost network. For example, it could be that the final last mile delivery would be through USPS or if we have other packages that are going to be delivered through the UPS network, we can make the call or make that decision on a day-to-day basis and switch those packages over to the UPS network for the last mile of delivery. So it's these operational technologies that are not only reducing our cost, streamlining our network, but they also provide a platform for new customer solutions such as UPS My Choice that we have talked about.Scott DavisAnd I guess one lower tack issue that clearly continue to be a driver of positive momentum in the domestic is this growth in our next air products, that the integrated network allows us to deliver those next air products, particularly the saver products at a very reasonable rate and that\u2019s part of why we are attracting that market so effectively.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Ms. Helane Becker of Dahlman Rose. Please go ahead.Helane Becker - Dahlman Rose & CompanyI just have a fleet related question. I thought you said that you are taking delivery of eight of the 767s this year, which is what you have on order. And then you've got something like a quarter of the fleet in three and four engine aircraft. And with fuel prices really not showing signs of going down, are you thinking about replacement aircraft? Are you thinking about next to add some more efficient aircraft for those 747s and MD-11?Scott DavisDavid, I'll let you talk about that. Yeah.David AbneyWell, like you said, we did talk about the 767s that we are bringing into the network. One thing we have to remember that we have the most modern, most quiet, fuel efficient fleet in the industry. We are the only global integrator that is Stage IV compliant and the age of our aircraft is just much younger than any of our competitors. So, we feel real good about our aircraft and we've made changes for the last 10 to 15 years in updating our aircraft and now we are getting the benefit of such.Scott DavisYeah, Helane, the fleet is almost a decade younger than our primary competitors. It also means, we don't have virtually anything in the way of replacement CapEx for aircraft for the next few years. And part of the great cash flow forecast we'll see is especially after this year that our needs for new aircraft will moderate for a while and certainly will be a great story for cash flow.Kurt KuehnLow CapEx, no pension contributions for a couple years does equate to good cash flow.OperatorOur next question in queue will come from the line of Mr. Peter Nesvold of Jeffries & Company. Please go ahead.Peter Nesvold - Jeffries & CompanyI think most of my questions have been answered. I guess just from a numbers standpoint, one thing that's still not perfectly clear to me. If you are guiding to 9% earnings growth at the midpoint for the year, but you're looking at flat year-over-year for 1Q, that would assume 12% on average through 2Q and 4Q and that's despite the 5% pension headwind. So what drives the step-up? Are there kind of two or three major factors that you can just outline briefly and why you see the earnings acceleration as we progress through the year?Kurt KuehnYeah, I think the outlier is more Q1. There is one less working day. That working day moves to Q3. Typically, that's $50 million or more that you would shift. And, also the early Easter hurts Q1 a bit. So, those are the seasonal issues that really drag down the Q1 scenario. Other than that, the year should be pretty balanced with the third quarter perhaps showing the biggest percent increase year-over-year primarily because of the working day. But other than that, no, we're expecting solid stable results. Perhaps the economy will pick up a little bit later in the year but we're not banking on a robust recovery. Clearly, you've heard that in our guidance.OperatorDue to time constraints our last question for the day will come from the line of Mr. Thomas Kim of Goldman Sachs.Tom Kim - Goldman SachsCan I ask you how backhaul volumes are trending both on the Trans-Pacific Europe back to Asia?Scott Davis","Great. Yeah, I'll give it over to Dan to give us some updates on trends we're seeing right now.Daniel BruttoYeah, I guess on the way back to Asia, primarily from -- I'll start with the U.S. Certainly, the U.S. export we all heard is relatively flat, but it was down at least for the first, second and third quarters and it got to flat in the fourth quarter. So, we don't see a tremendous uplift in U.S. exports and that's part of what Scott has guided to. As far as the European market, again, not a lot of robust growth. I will tell you though, on the positive side, the Asia consumer is very interested in buying goods from both the U.S. and from Europe. So, as Kurt said, we're hoping that in the second half of the year, we're going to see a little bit more of an uplift and some better balance with Asian consumers buying more European and U.S. products.Kurt KuehnYeah, and I think if you look longer term, that's clearly something that most economists are forecasting; that as consumption increases in Asia that the balance flows will begin to improve. Clearly, the lower cost of energy and other issues is bringing some manufacturing back to the U.S. So, that would be a long-term very positive for the air business to make sure that you get comparable loads both directions would be very highlight accretive.Tom Kim - Goldman SachsGreat. If I could just add a follow-up to that. Presumably then this should be margin enhancing, just given your air load factors, trends whether they have been, let's say, Q2, Q3, with that?Kurt Kuehn","Absolutely. Putting volume on an empty plane is just wonderful for margins.Tom Kim - Goldman SachsRight. If I could just ask one last question. Just with regard to DHL, they came out mid last year suggesting some pretty aggressive expansion plans in Asia. Have you seen anything to that effect that suggests some changes in the pricing dynamics in that market?Scott DavisPricing remains very competitive although we haven't seen any dramatic change in the basic relationship. It's rational but competitive and certainly cycles somewhat with capacity and demand imbalances. So thank you all for the call and we'll talk to you later."],"21321":["United Parcel Service, Inc.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. And after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. Please note, we'll take only one question from each participant to accommodate more analysts during the call. Thank you for your cooperation.","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Joe Wilkins, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.","Joe Wilkins - Investor Relations Officer","Good morning, and welcome to the UPS first quarter 2016 earnings call. Joining me today are, David Abney, our CEO; Richard Peretz, our CFO; along with International President, Jim Barber; President of U.S. Operations, Myron Gray; and Chief Commercial Officer, Alan Gershenhorn. Also joining us today is Norm Brothers, our General Counsel.","Before we begin, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2015 Form 10-K. This report is available on the UPS investor relations website, and from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The webcast of today's call, along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures are available on the UPS investor relations website. And just as a reminder, please ask only one question so that we may allow as many as possible to participate. Thanks for your cooperation.","Now, I will turn the call over to David.","David P. Abney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Joe. I'm pleased to be here this morning to review another excellent quarter. I want to take a moment to say thank you to UPS employees around the world for their hard work and dedication in delivering more than 13% earnings per share growth this quarter. The International segment sustained its momentum with its fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit operating profit growth. The U.S. Domestic business also expanded operating margins as efficiency gains enhanced bottom line results, while Supply Chain & Freight performed slightly ahead of our expectations.","Our accelerated investments in the UPS network are improving business results. This is enabling us to deliver strong financial results despite the current mixed macroenvironment. In the U.S., GDP forecasts continue to be revised downward, yet consumer spending remains the primary catalyst for growth in the economy and e-commerce sales have again exceeded the expectations.","On the other hand, industrial production remains below 2015 levels. In Europe, economic expansion has slowed slightly, but the pace of growth remains healthy, while in Asia the major economies showed positive signs of stabilization as exports from China improved in March. Despite these mixed economic conditions, we remain committed to making investments for growth and efficiency. We will continue to implement our enterprise strategy, providing UPS customers with increased choice, convenience and control.","During the quarter, we launched enhanced products to support customers' needs for earlier delivery. Our Next Day Air Early now serves almost 30% more zip codes, strengthening our leadership position in offering the earliest next-day deliveries. We also increased our Worldwide Express small package offering to 23 new countries and territories. UPS now offers guaranteed noon delivery on the next possible business day to 88 countries around the world.","In addition to broadening our service portfolio for growth, we also are investing in our infrastructure with innovative technology and major facility expansions. The ability to combine our integrated network with the latest operating technology helps UPS deliver industry-leading margins and provides tremendous value to our customers.","ORION is a great example of how we use predictive analytics and big data to improve service, while bending the cost curve lower. Our future plans for ORION will enhance the benefits for UPS, and our customers. In fact, I recently had the great honor on behalf of all UPSers to accept the prestigious 2016 Franz Edelman Award recognizing ORION, and UPS's leadership in operations research.","In addition to innovation and on-road technologies like ORION, we're making major investments in new capacity and modernized facilities, both in the U.S. and Europe. In the U.S., we're expanding major facilities in Metro L.A., Denver, Chicago, and other areas around the country. In Europe, as part of our $2 billion European investment plan announced in 2014, we opened a larger automated hub in Lyon, France, tripling our capacity in the area, and we also announced an automated facility expansion in Herne, Germany. Adding to these examples of our innovative infrastructure is our commitment to global leadership in alternative fuels.","This quarter, we announced an additional $100 million investment to expand compressed natural gas in our delivery and facility network. Our alternative fuel vehicles are now 6% of our global fleet, and have helped UPS reduce its annual use of conventional fuel by 10%. We are well on our way to achieving our goal of driving one billion miles worldwide by 2017, with our alternative fuel vehicles.","As we invest in the U.S. and abroad, the ability to grow our business is accelerated by global trade. Recently, the President signed the trade facilitation and trade enforcement act. This important legislation is designed to modernize, strengthen and streamline cross-border trade, facilitating faster clearance of goods into the U.S. UPS strongly supports the expansion of free trade around the world. We are developing additional solutions that assist buyers and sellers to transact business across borders.","So, in summary, the first quarter results demonstrate the differentiating value of our integrated network in global portfolio. Our investments in technology and capacity are producing network efficiencies and giving us more control over the cost drivers in our business, and this is providing improved financial results. At UPS, we are innovating and investing to ensure we anticipate the needs of our 10 million customers.","Before Richard covers the quarterly financial results, I have asked Norm Brothers, our General Counsel, to provide an update on developments surrounding the Central States proposed benefit reduction plan. Norm?","Norman M. Brothers - Secretary, Senior Vice President & General Counsel","Thanks, David, and good morning. This is a topic that we first disclosed in our third quarter 2015 10-Q. The Central States Plan proposes to make retirement benefit reductions to its participants, including certain UPS employees. When UPS withdrew from the fund in 2007 as part of our collective bargaining agreement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, we agreed to provide supplemental benefits in the event that certain benefits were lawfully reduced. As a reminder, in December 2014, Congress passed the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act, which for the first time ever, allowed multiemployer pension plans to reduce benefit payments to retirees subject to specific guidelines written into the statute and government oversight. As a result of this law, the Central States Pension Fund submitted a benefit reduction plan for approval to the U.S. Department of Treasury in the fall of 2015.","As we explained in our 2015 10-K, we are challenging the Central States Plan because we firmly believe that it does not comply with the law. According to this new statute, we currently expect a decision from the Department of Treasury on or before May 7, unless there's some agreement to delay the process. Of course, Treasury could reject Central States' proposal, confirming our position. If this happens, the benefits paid from Central States will not be reduced without further action.","In the event this plan is approved as proposed, we fully intend to continue challenging it and pursue all legal remedies available to UPS. As we gained additional information during the quarter, we continue to assess the possible impact of Treasury's review of the plan on UPS. This is a new law and the first time the approval process has ever been used.","And as I stated, we firmly believe the proposed benefit reduction plan does not comply with the law. We recognize there are lot of unanswered questions, but without Treasury's decision, we're not going to speculate. However, we still thought it was important to provide you an update on the process.","Now, I will turn it over to Richard for a financial review of the issue.","Richard N. Peretz - CFO, Treasurer, Vice President & Controller","Thanks, Norm. We estimate that if Central States Plan is approved as proposed and implemented, we would be required to record a charge of approximately $3.2 billion to $3.8 billion later this year. Our estimates are based on the information currently available to UPS. And it assumes, among other things, that the Plan's implementation is not delayed. If this charge is necessary, we expect it will be treated as an interim mark-to-market pension charge, and will be reflected in this year's financial results. In addition, there may be an increase in the ongoing pension expense that could impact 2016. Following our call today, we'll provide a presentation on the IR website regarding this subject.","Now, let's move on to the business and how it continues to perform. As David said, the consumer is driving the economy, and that translates into opportunities for UPS. During the quarter, we turned e-commerce growth into expanded margins and increased operating profit in the U.S. Domestic segment. This, combined with momentum in our International business and slightly better than expected performance in Supply Chain & Freight segment, produced another strong quarter.","Now, let's go a little deeper into the results. Starting with the U.S. Domestic segment, where operating profit increased $78 million, or almost 8%. And operating margin expanded 50 basis points, to 12.1%. Revenue was up 3.1% over last year to $9.1 billion. However, lower fuel surcharges were a drag of about 120 basis points on the growth rate. Average daily volume increased 2.8%, with the ground products up 3.3% and Next Day Air up 3%. After five continuous quarters of double-digit growth, deferred products declined slightly.","E-commerce customers drove both B2C and B2B shipments higher, with B2C up more than 6%. Interestingly, supporting B2B growth during the quarter, online purchases drove demand for UPS's best-in-class return services portfolio, which grew double digit this quarter. Base rates increased about 2% but were offset by changes in package characteristics and the mix of product and customers. There was 120 basis point drag from lower fuel surcharges that weighed on the reported deals. As a result, total revenue per piece was down 1.3% from the prior year. This quarter, the margin expansion was driven by the excellent cost management demonstrated. Cost per piece was down 1.9% compared to last year. Network efficiencies continue to improve, and we're seeing those improvements in our bottom line.","At the foundation of our success this quarter is the continued benefits of the UPS integrated network overlaid with our unique technology. Looking at our key daily statistics, and this is where we're seeing good improvement, is the expansion of ORION lower driver miles by about 1% despite the fact that total stops grew by about 6%. In addition, overall productivity gains held direct labor hours to an increase of 1.8%, well below the average daily volume growth. As these trends continue, UPS is improving the stop economics of e-commerce.","Now, let's turn to the International segment. As David said, we are reporting our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit operating profit growth. International operating profit increased more than 15%, reflecting the impact of disciplined pricing, better network efficiencies, and in-country cost control.","Revenue, on a currency-neutral basis, was slowed this quarter by management actions we implemented in the third quarter of last year. In addition, lower fuel surcharges negatively affected the growth rate by about 200 basis points. Currency-neutral revenue per piece was up 1.6%, with Domestic products up 2.8%. Strong base rate improvements were across all regions of the world and contributed to the best yield growth in more than two years.","Revenue management actions also affected International volume, mainly the non-U.S. Domestic products. Meanwhile, we saw increased demand out of Asia and Europe into the U.S., offsetting lower U.S. exports. Export volume has started recovering from the revenue management actions we started in mid-2015. Fewer local operating days, mostly due to the timing of the Easter holiday, lowered the growth rate by about 200 basis points.","Now, let's discuss the Supply Chain & Freight segment, where operating profit was better than anticipated but slightly less than last year as the segment managed through a tough economic backdrop.","Total revenue on a currency-neutral basis was up more than 11%, driven by the addition of Coyote Logistics. The asset-light, truckload brokerage business is managing well, even in a market that remains soft, and the synergies remain on plan. In addition, market conditions remain weak, both in the Air Freight Forwarding and UPS Freight markets. In the Freight Forwarding unit, international air freight kilos were down, and it's due to a combination of re-pricing efforts in 2015 and an overall softer market. Margins expanded as the unit held firm with rates and achieved higher buy\/sell rate spreads.","Distribution revenue on a currency-neutral basis was up around 7%. Supported by our industry-specific solutions, we had double-digit gains in healthcare, aerospace, and industrial manufacturing sectors. UPS Freight remained committed to disciplined revenue management. LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 2.1% as the unit continued to focus on serving higher-yielding middle-market customers, yet total tonnage declined as market conditions remain challenging.","Now, for an update on our cash position. The company generated $2.2 billion in free cash flow after investing almost $430 million in capital expenditures. UPS improved its quarterly dividend by almost 7% during the quarter and paid about $670 million in dividends, and the company repurchased 6.8 million shares for approximately $680 million.","Now, I'd like to update you on our guidance for 2016. The first quarter results continued our momentum from last year, and we remain on track for 2016. Economic conditions around the world will remain mixed. However, our business model is adapting well in this environment. In addition, International and Supply Chain & Freight will lap certain pricing actions we took last year. Based on our current performance, we reaffirm our 2016 full-year guidance of $5.70 to $5.90 adjusted earnings per share.","This guidance does not include any impact for the Department of Treasury's decision on the benefit reduction plan. Regardless of how UPS chooses to respond to Treasury's decision, we still expect to remain within our 2016 guidance. However, if the plan is approved and implemented without delay, the ongoing expense could possibly push us towards the lower end of the range. As we stated earlier, we fully intend to continue challenging the plan if it is approved by Treasury.","To summarize, this quarter is an example of how our accelerated investments are providing benefits across the company. We are adapting to the changing market conditions, bending the cost curve, and at the same time, producing strong financial results. We are well-positioned to continue to make progress through the rest of 2016.","And now, I'll ask the operator to open the lines for the questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question will come from the line of Ben Hartford, Baird. Please go ahead.","Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good morning, guys. Just want to know your thoughts on yield, just given the competitiveness that we're seeing in truckload rates, in particular, during 2016 at 2% base rate within Domestic. What is the likelihood that that meets or exceeds that level as we move through 2016?","Alan Gershenhorn - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP","Hey, Ben, this is Alan. First of all, we saw some really good volume growth in the U.S. that certainly was in line with our expectations, and we continue to align the revenue to the value we create and with the costs incurred. The first quarter 2016, we certainly continued our successful base rate strategy and we did achieve a base rate increase between the 2% and 3%. It was offset by about 120 basis points to lower fuel surcharges, as well as continuing to still see some significant changes in the customer and the product mix, and the package characteristics that are also weighing on that base rate increase.","Just one quick example here, SurePost, it's the lowest revenue piece product in our portfolio by its nature. It achieved double-digit growth this quarter. It also has some of the highest delivery density in our network, and it generates excellent profitability and ROIC, and it's even more profitable when we combine that with the SurePost Redirects. We've got a lot of examples where we're focusing on driving profits where the revenue to cost ratio is, where the RPP is actually lower than average, like SDS, UPS Access Point returns, they're all significant density creators. I don't know, Rich, you got some comments?","Richard N. Peretz - CFO, Treasurer, Vice President & Controller","Yeah. Ben, the other thing that's important to understand that, as we make the adjustments for how the characteristics are changing, the benefits that we're seeing on how we're handling within our network and the implementation of our technology is showing up in the bottom line, as you saw the cost per piece actually reduced almost 2%. And that created the margin expansion in the U.S.","Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. If I could just ask a clarifying comment there; is there enough disconnect in terms of the customer conversations that B2C and e-commerce growth can be viewed separately from the broader kind of freight fundamentals, specifically the pricing on the truckloads, such that you can continue to get positive and healthy yields with regard to B2C, in particular, even though broader freight rates in 2016 appear to be much weaker than that?","Alan Gershenhorn - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP","Yeah, I think there's definitely two distinct markets there. It's certainly a competitive market, but we focus our pricing consistent with the value we provide to our customers, and we're continuing to enhance our efficiencies, like Richie said, and our value proposition with what David mentioned on the UPS Early Express, so on and so forth. So, yeah, we're confident in being able to achieve the range of 2% to 3% going forward.","Joe Wilkins - Investor Relations Officer","Thanks, Ben. This is, Joe. As we move forward, let's just keep it to one question so that we can get as many on as possible. Thanks, Ben. Next question?","Operator","Tom Wadewitz, UBS. Please go ahead.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah, good morning. I just wanted ask around the International margin improvement. Congratulations on the strong margin improvement there. I was wondering if you could give us the sense of, I guess, you talked about some of the key drivers, but does the pace of that accelerate, does it kind of sustain in terms of some of the things you're doing to drive that almost 300 basis points of margin improvement? Just so we have a kind of a way to look at it going forward the next couple of quarters. Thank you","Richard N. Peretz - CFO, Treasurer, Vice President & Controller","Sure, Tom. And this is, Richard. I think the first thing, it was a very strong quarter, but our focus is really on our earnings \u2013 our growth in earnings and economic value more than the margin, because there are fluctuations in the network, and which products are growing stronger year-in and year-out.","The other thing to keep in mind is that the hedge program that we've really had in place for multiple years does aid the margins. Even if you adjust out for that, you're still talking about almost a 17% margin, which is the best in the industry. I'm going to ask Jim to actually comment on a few of the initiatives driving the improvements in International.","James Jay Barber, Jr. - President, UPS International","Thanks, Rich. So, Tom, I think it's really a two-part question for me. One is backward looking, how we've done. You've seen the last five quarters. We feel good about that. I think the other side to it is that, at the same time, right in line with our overall growth strategy, we're able to invest in some of these growth platforms we've talked about over the last year, year and a half. Like Access Points, like southern and trade lane borders across the world in emerging markets, so that ultimately, it's \u2013 here and now you see the margins and you hear Richie's comment with respect to the lift in currency, and so on and so forth, but the general operating efficiency and base rates is holding us, but at the same time, we feel really good, I do, about the investments we're making for long-term at the same time. So appreciate the question.","Operator","Next question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter, Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Good morning. Just maybe a little bit of clarification on the pension exposure you talked about at the opening of the call, the $3.2 billion to $3.8 billion. Is that a one-time charge; is that a cash expense that you'd have to pay out? And then, more on the ongoing level you talked about. Can you talk about the ongoing impact and what the ongoing cost exposure could be? You talked about moving to lower end of the range, but just maybe give us some parameters on what the ongoing expense would be? Thanks.","Richard N. Peretz - CFO, Treasurer, Vice President & Controller","Sure. So, I think the first question you asked was, whether it was a one-time payout. And actually, the way that \u2013 first of all, it's a complicated topic, and there will be a deck, I mentioned, out on the website to explain a little bit better. But it really isn't something we're paying to a third party. It would be a liability that we would have to take on.","But that being said, we look at many different scenarios, and we feel comfortable that even if this was approved, and while we go down the path of looking at other options legally, that it would have a operating income impact, but it would still keep us within the range that we gave at the beginning of the year.","So there's a lot of unanswered questions that we just don't know until we know more from treasury's decision. But at this point, that's really all we can share with you.","David P. Abney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And this is David Abney. Just want to remind people that we do not know how treasury is going to decide. We're expecting a decision between now and May 7, May 8, but they could reject or they could accept. We just felt it was important to get the information out that just gives you an idea if they did accept the plan. But we really don't have an idea of which way that they're going to decide, so we don't want to send any other impression out there. Okay.","Operator","David Vernon with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys. Richard, maybe a question for you on the productivity side, it seems like the mix was a little bit weaker in the quarter. I'm just wondering if that's kind of a fair assessment. And then, as you think about that decline of 190 basis points year-over-year in the unit cost for the Domestic segment, was that influenced any way by the mix? Did you get some help there for some of the lighter weight or lower cost products versus kind of pure productivity? Is there any way to think about sort of breaking up that 190 basis points in relation to mix? Thanks.","Richard N. Peretz - CFO, Treasurer, Vice President & Controller","Sure. Because we run an integrated network, and when you think about the activities that occur, mix has a little bit of play when SurePost grows faster. But I would tell you that, we expected SurePost to grow faster this year. Last year, we talked about the two-year stack, and we knew that SurePost would continue to grow.","But that being said, when you look specifically at what we're doing in the U.S., with how direct labor hours are being managed, because of really the overlay of ORION, and what we're able to do with reducing miles, at the same time is increasing stops, it's something we're starting to see the last few quarters, and it's something we still expect to continue to see.","And I'm actually going to ask, Myron, to talk a little about some of the initiatives that he has seen from ORION, and what's happening in it, because the expansion of the margin really was something that we did expect, and we continue to expect.","Myron A. Gray - President-US Operations & Senior Vice President","So, David, it's really a combination of a number of activities that we're undertaking to continue to bend the cost curve. Richard has referred to ORION, and yes, while our stops grew almost 6%, we were able to reduce our miles by 1%. But when you add in SurePost Redirect, coupled with Access Points, it allows us to build greater densities, and we're taking advantage of it.","You've also heard us talk about SDS and EDGE, which we'll be talking more about later this year. Those activities combined, regardless of the mix, has allowed us to continue to bend that cost curve. Then you couple that with some of the automation projects that we have in place, it's not only allowing us to bend the cost curve, but it's also ramping up our service to our customers.","Operator","Chris Wetherbee, Citi. Please go ahead.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, thanks. Good morning. Wanted to ask about the ground volume growth, which was impressive in the quarter. We definitely saw a re-acceleration. And I think in the comments, you mentioned that the B2B side benefited probably from e-commerce returns. Just wanted to get a sense if you could parse out maybe sort of how the industrial side of your business is sort of trending, and maybe if you expect that ground growth to continue through the rest of the year here, outside of what we saw from e-commerce, which is probably at least partially holiday-related. So, any comments there would be helpful.","Alan Gershenhorn - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP","Yeah. Thanks, Chris. This is Alan. Yeah, as you said, we had a really strong growth of B2C growth and our customers are really responding to the choices we're providing. The e-commerce customers drove both B2C and B2B shipments higher, with the B2C up more than 6%. And by the way, that was our best B2C growth in the last five quarters. And like Rich said, we achieved margin expansion with that growth of B2C. The online purchases are continuing to drive demand for UPS's best-in-class return services, which are, essentially, a business delivery, and we did see mid-teens return growth there. We think, as B2C grows, we're going to continue to see very strong returns growth there that is going to help our B2B segment.","So, overall, B2B is still in positive territory, but it's still being impacted by the softness in industrial production. But we've been positive on B2B growth for the last few years now, with the exception of one quarter. So the economy certainly is soft out there when it comes to industrial production, but we think the combination of our B2C and our B2B value proposition to the non-retail segment is going to allow us to continue to grow that B2B business.","Operator","Nate Brochmann, William Blair.","Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yes. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Obviously, this has been well publicized, in terms of a very high profile customer kind of maybe doing some more things in-house, and I know we've talked about the value proposition for UPS a lot over the years. But have you seen probably the majority of what they plan to do already taken in-house, in terms of that already kind of being behind you? And has that impacted at all kind of the density benefits that maybe we were on previous trajectory to be able to get, and do you have to do anything to circumvent that?","David P. Abney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, Nate, this is David. Yeah, I'll just start off with saying that that high-profile customer, I think because of the scale and the scope, gets a lot of attention in everything that they do, obviously can appear under the microscope. I can tell you though that we value our mutually beneficial relationship and obviously we'll evaluate any market moves that any company or customer makes, and we look at it from a competitive standpoint.","But where I really want to focus is our integrated network creates efficiencies and just gives us a value proposition that is very difficult to match. Our diverse customer base also, just from a density standpoint, no single company is going to be able to match that. So we add value with global scale and scope. We continue to invest in technology to deliver high-value solutions, and there are going to be customers that are going to utilize us as a single source. There's going to be other customers that are going to adjust and sometimes go single source, sometimes go multiple vendors, and sometimes they will bring some work inside, take it in-house, and that's going to adjust as conditions adjust. But we feel we have a good relationship with that customer and feel that we will continue to add value for many, many years to come. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will be from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my question. So can we come back to the economic picture? I mean, you guys talk a lot about how you move 6% of U.S. GDP in your network every day. How do we read the divergence in industrial production and consumer growth, plus really weak international trade, but you're still seeing premium expansion in your network. What does this all mean for GDP and IP looking forward? And have your customers given you any view on expectations heading into the back half of the year on inventories and growth?","David P. Abney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, Brandon, thanks for the question; this is David. And yeah, our customers have given us a lot of views. And I'll give the same impression to that that I would to the customers, that is it's very mixed. And U.S. GDP has obviously weakened. Even today, the numbers that came out quarter-over-quarter has showed weakness and year-over-year slight deterioration.","But again, you can look and you can find bright spots and then you can find things that worry you. On the one hand, consumer spending continued to be the primary economic driver in the U.S. On the other hand, industrial production has been disappointing; although I can say there has been some recent data on manufacturing that is showing some sign of expansion.","On the one hand, again, online retail is continuing to grow much faster than many expected. On the other hand, the especially brick-and-mortar retailers have not done so well. Again, on one hand, inflation and unemployment have stabilized, although wage growth, of course, has been muted. And when you look at it internationally, I think the same thing, you're going to see positives and you're going to see things that concern you. From the European Union, we still expect to see that economy grow at a fairly solid pace compared to the recent past, but there are signs of slowing, especially in some countries.","Emerging markets, you see some concerns there, especially in Brazil and Russia. China, though, the GDP forecast has stabilized. You look at U.S. exports, because of the strength of the dollar that, of course, has weakened. But when you look at European exports imported into the U.S., that has been pretty solid.","But my final point, and I think it's what's led to our success the last four quarters or five quarters and will continue to lead to it is that regardless of these challenges, we have to make challenges opportunities, and it's how we execute our investments, our strategic initiatives. If we continue to execute, we have proven and will continue to prove that we can have success in this mixed economic environment. So thank you for the question. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question will be from Scott Group, Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, thanks, morning, guys. Just one quick question, just going back to the pension issue for a second. If this thing happens, does it have any impact on capital allocation, share buybacks, either for this year or next year?","Richard N. Peretz - CFO, Treasurer, Vice President & Controller","The short answer is, it does not have any impact on 2016. We continue to allocate capital the way that we planned. For everything, for 2016, we continue on the plan. There's a lot of unanswered questions we talked about, but that won't change what we're doing for this year. And for 2017, later in the year when I guide, we'll go through that as I told you when we've gone through multiple scenarios and certainty will be understood a little differently. And then we'll make the appropriate plans because there are different things and different tools available to us as well. So, I just think it's too early to look at that, but 2016 will continue as is.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Allison Landry, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks, good morning. In terms of your comments that you are improving the stop economics of B2C, first, can you carve out the impact of productivity gains versus fuel in the 2% improvement? And then curious if the rapid growth in e-commerce is finally starting to lead to density increases in local and regional markets. Thank you.","Richard N. Peretz - CFO, Treasurer, Vice President & Controller","Sure. So, Allison, again, this is Richard. And the interesting thing is, you're right, fuel is lower. It does have an impact on both the cost and the revenue, but if you pulled those out, we still had negative cost per piece growth. And so we are seeing that the benefits of everything that we've been really building the last two years showing up in the bottom line and we actually talked about the margin expansion and that plan is a multi-year plan. And so that will continue as we expected it to. And that's it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jack Kauffman (sic) [Jeff Kauffman], Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hi, everybody. Good morning. It's Jeff. I just wanted to ask a question about CapEx and free cash flow. There was tremendous free cash generation this first quarter. So congratulations. But you threw off almost $2.6 billion in free cash, and I was modeling about $5.5 billion for the year. Have you changed your capital plan at all or is there a reason free cash might be a little stronger than expected this year, obviously holding off for anything that may or may not happen with this pension situation?","Richard N. Peretz - CFO, Treasurer, Vice President & Controller","Sure. Again, this is Richard. When you actually look at our cash position and where we're at as a company, after the first quarter we're about where we were last year. In fact, our cash is slightly about $100 million less than last year at this point. So, when we look at our plan, it's about the whole year. And I also want to remind you that a large portion of our cash, about 40%, is offshore. And repatriation would cause additional tax, and we need that money offshore for the investments we're making in Europe and Asia, as well. So our plan was built at the beginning of the year, and it's something that we're working that plan, and that plan really is built to return to shareholders what we've been doing previously. We're investing $2.8 billion in CapEx, and we actually spent about 20% more the first quarter this year than we did last year, so we'll continue working that plan.","David P. Abney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, this is David. I just want to clarify a little bit that we are clearly opposing the Central States Plan and that shouldn't indicate any change on our part to our long-term capital expenditure plan. So, again, this is something that has not happened. We don't know if it will or it won't. So I don't want anyone to read into comments that maybe we're adjusting our strategy based on this. We continue to execute this capital plan just as we originally planned. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Art Hatfield, Raymond James.","Art W. Hatfield - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, morning. Thanks for taking my question this morning. With one of our competitors getting ready to make, or hopefully making an acquisition for them in Europe, have you seen any changes in the marketplace over there, any customer dislocations, i.e. any risks or opportunities ahead of that?","David P. Abney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Art, this is David. And in Europe, it does look like that acquisition is going to be approved. And the things that I wanted to cover on that is, that we have a very strong position in Europe. We've been winning in Europe for some time now, and we've certainly have been sprinting over the last several years. We haven't changed our strategy. We're going to continue to invest and grow in Europe, and we are certainly seeing benefits of that in 2015.","We're in the beginnings of our five-year $2 billion network investment, and we're already seeing benefits from that. And just try to give you an idea, you know that Europe is a key part of our strategy, and we've just had great momentum. We've had five consecutive quarters of double-digit operating profit. So what we're hearing from our customers is that, we continue to provide value and they continue to give us more of their share of business. So we think it's a very positive environment for us.","James Jay Barber, Jr. - President, UPS International","Art, it's Jim. I think a couple of other points on the back of what David just mentioned is that, we've talked over the last year, year and a half about the capital outlay plan of $2 billion. I think it's important to note, especially in line with our top line growth discussion, is that we've only touched 19 of our planned almost 70 facilities that we plan to expand throughout the network.","So we won't be done until 2018. We're going to be doing that much in line with, as you pointed out, what is the customer's expectation in Europe post-merger? We've had our eyes on that for some time, obviously on the road we've traveled. And so we are kind of looking at our Customer Solution, specifically, and our network and making sure that it leans into those risks and opportunities that any merger brings forth. So we're looking forward to the years to come in Europe. Thanks.","Operator","Jeff Atkins (sic) [Jack Atkins], Stephens. Please go ahead.","Andrew David Hall - Stephens, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, guys. It's actually Andrew on for Jack. Richard, just going back to the International business for a second, and the impressive operating income growth there. Can you just clarify, kind of the puts and takes of that growth? How much is related to lower fuel prices and positive currency translation as opposed to the operational efficiency improvements you guys are seeing?","Richard N. Peretz - CFO, Treasurer, Vice President & Controller","Sure, Andrew. First, let me start by saying that, I had mentioned that, even adjusting out currency; we're talking about almost a 17% operating margin. So it's a very positive, and it's actually the best margin in the industry. The other big thing to remember is, and we talked about it, I think, in my talk a little bit, was that, when you look at the yields for International, it was the strongest yields we've seen in quite some time, both in the non-U.S. Domestic and in the International exports as well.","And your question also mentioned fuel. And let me also remind you that, we don't use fuel as a profit center. So it does impact the revenue line. But there's really not a big impact to what happens on bottom line.","This quarter is really about great cost control, and the quality of revenue, and it was really something that Jim and his folks started mid last year, when we took on some revenue management initiatives, and we know we'll wrap that in the second half of the year. We guided that way at the beginning of the year. And so, this was really a very balanced profit picture, and a return for the quarter for International.","Operator","Scott Schneeberger, Oppenheimer.","Unknown Speaker","Good morning, guys. This is (46:33) for Scott. Premium product is growing faster than non-premium products, can you elaborate on the drivers there, and what you expect going forward?","Alan Gershenhorn - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP","Yeah. Hey, this is Alan. Thanks for the question. Yeah, so, as you stated, our premium Next Day Air products grew more than 3%, and I think, part of that is, the customer is responding and enjoying to our continual expansion of our Next Day Air and our Next Day Air Early, as well as our Express services that David talked to in his opening comments. We certainly are establishing a beachhead there, a leadership beachhead in Express and premium Next Day Air. And certainly, the healthcare, high-tech and professional services segments are in need of those type of services. Thanks.","Operator","Bascome Majors, Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna International Group","Yeah, good morning. I know it's only April, but as we look out to 2017, can you remind us of how much of the FX hedge protection that you had in 2015 and 2016 is going to roll-off next year? Just how should we think about the impact of the loss of some of those hedges from a sensitivity perspective? Either if that's looking at your International segment margins, or maybe an overall EPS impact on the company?","Richard N. Peretz - CFO, Treasurer, Vice President & Controller","Sure. This is Richard again. And the first thing I want to remind everyone is that, we do use a multi-year hedge strategy, and it's worked very well for the last two years. And underlying that is really the strength of our business, because the core business is running very well.","Right now, we're in the middle of a process. We continue to look at different opportunities because of the volatility of currency, to go in and do different hedging, to protect and minimize the change. It's really a little too early to talk about what it's going to be, because we're still in the middle of that. And then, yes, we know that euro went from $1.35 down to today's rates, but we're also looking at what other initiatives across the entire enterprise we can move forward to offset some of that. So we'll continue to work on those two efforts, and at the appropriate calendar time, we'll update you on 2017.","Operator","Kelly Dougherty of Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Kelly Dougherty - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to follow up on an earlier economic question. Is there any way to break down how much of the adjusted 7% to 11% EPS growth you're expecting this year comes from kind of external macro-like factors, versus some of the internal yield and profit efficiency things you're doing? Just to get a better sense of maybe how much of the growth story is within your own control, kind of despite what happens in the macro environment?","Richard N. Peretz - CFO, Treasurer, Vice President & Controller","Sure. So, when we make our guidance at the beginning of the year, and we monitor as the year goes, we have a certain assumption for what's going to happen with economic indicators, and they have come down. If you go back to January, and you look at what GDP was doing and what expectations were around the globe, those have all come down.","On the other side, what's happening in UPS, and what we're seeing is the continued margin expansion, the things that we talked about in both International and Domestic, around both from a cost and network efficiency standpoint, as well as making the adjustments, as the volume looks different.","So today, I'd say it's more about what's happening at UPS, but we also have to continue to think about what's happening externally because that does have an impact. But because one is a little bit better than it was going to be at the beginning of the year, and the other is a little weaker, you put it together and we think, where we're having guidance is the right place.","David P. Abney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And this is, David. Just to reinforce, Rich. It's nice to have tailwinds. And obviously, you'd prefer not to have headwinds, but that's not the world we live in. But what we have been able to do, over the past five quarters or so, is to deal with the hands that we have dealt, and make the most of it. And our management team, throughout the world, is focused on absolutely that. And what's important, is that we stay disciplined and focused on our strategic initiatives. As long as we do that, we're going to be in good shape and real proud of what the team has been able to do. Thank you.","Operator","David Ross, Stifel. Please go ahead.","David Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yes, good morning, gentlemen. I wanted to talk a little bit about the pilots that have been in the news. Any comments you have on the current IPA talks, which seem to be, I guess, heating up a little bit after about five years of discussions. And then, also, the Cologne strike, where the pilots didn't fly some planes this week due to their sympathy strike with Verdi.","Myron A. Gray - President-US Operations & Senior Vice President","Yeah, David, this is Myron. It's not unusual to see some of the recent headlines that have been pretty robust on behalf of the pilots. But let me assure you that there is no real threat of a strike. We remain, along with the pilots union, at the bargaining table, and we believe, as usual, that there will be a win-win negotiation at the end of this for both the pilots and UPS.","And also, as a reminder, we're at that negotiating table with the National Mediation Board, and it would take action on their behalf to release both parties in order to have something happen. And the reality is that's not going to happen any time soon. So we're going to get this thing done.","James Jay Barber, Jr. - President, UPS International","David, it's Jim. On the Cologne situation, just a couple of points I'd like to reinforce. First of all, there's work stoppages that happens, or manifestations, as they might be called, in the world, especially in Europe, that we have to deal with day-in, day-out in our business.","This specific situation, to be very clear, Verdi's stance in Germany in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia was really not even in the logistics sector, it was in the government sector, which has a whole another set of views to it. The IPA and the pilots took their stance on that. Our job is to run the network. And I would tell you, over the last 48 hours, the guys have done a heck of a job over there. Just like the last time the ash cloud appeared and that power of the ground and the air network came through. And tonight, our network will be just as normal. Tonight, Thursday night, in Cologne, and we expect to provide great service going forward. So I'll stop on that. I appreciate the question.","Operator","Ravi Shanker, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks, everyone. Good morning. You bought a stake in Deliv, I think in February of this year. Can you just talk about the rationale behind that, what you've learned so far? And also, how you see the omnichannel retail shift as a potential opportunity or threat just being a general disrupter in the e-commerce channel? Thanks.","Alan Gershenhorn - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP","Yeah. Hey, Ravi, this is Alan. As you guys know, we've been in the same-day business for a long time with Express Critical and our world-class service parts logistics network, but certainly there's a lot of buzz with e-commerce with same-day, and the real challenge is obviously low-cost e-commerce delivery because the consumers are looking for a low-cost option there.","Currently, as you know, same-day for e-commerce has challenges with consolidating density and single-piece stop economics that could create profitability issues as these companies look for the low-cost model. Deliv's goal is pretty unique. It consolidates multiple deliveries on one driver with pickups from multiple stores at a mall, for example. So we're looking to get some key learnings there. So we made that SEF investment in Deliv to better understand the economics, demand and value proposition, and certainly they are a leader in that particular space.","At the same time, we believe that because the lion's share of shopping takes place in the late afternoon and evenings, there's much more demand for local next-day, which really speaks to the latter part of your question about omnichannel. And we're very focused on those local store solutions that enable us to take evening orders that are dropped to these stores. Let the stores fulfill them locally that same evening, and with the UPS late-night pickup, we can get next-day or morning delivery. So we can make the delivery in as little as 10 hours to 12 hours from the time the order is dropped into checkout. And you combine that again with our industry-leading e-commerce platform, and we're really leading the way in the B2C e-commerce market. Thanks for the question.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Helane Becker of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks very much, operator. Hi, everybody. Thank you very much for the time here. I'm not sure how many employees at UPS are minimum-wage employees, but there's been some moves, especially in California, to push the minimum wage up. And I'm just kind of wondering how will that affect your compensation, your outlook for keeping costs under control and that line. And any comments you can make would be appreciated.","Richard N. Peretz - CFO, Treasurer, Vice President & Controller","Sure. This is Richard. And I think the one thing that's important to understand about UPS is that many of our wages are part of our national bargaining agreement. So there are very few employees where the start rate would be at something that would be affected by the minimum wage change.","That being said, in some states where there's a slight change, it would impact only the people that are first coming on to the payroll with UPS, because there's a progression schedule. So it's a very small impact. We've looked at it, and I'm talking hundreds of thousands of dollars kind of thing, because it's just not something that is our value proposition as an employer, and giving the full benefits and the rates we pay aren't things that are going to drive additional cost for this in any meaningful way.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Rob Salmon of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. Piggybacking on the e-commerce question, which had come up basically two prior to me from Ravi, if I think about the local delivery opportunity from a UPS perspective, historically I've always thought of that as a tougher market to compete in, particularly when there's some crowd sourcing opportunities, given your cost structure. Could you talk a little bit about the attractiveness or not of that marketplace from your perspective? And more broadly, what are the markets that you think make the most sense to attack from an e-commerce perspective, given your returns and margin profile?","Alan Gershenhorn - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP","Yeah. Hey, this is Alan and thanks for the question. Look, it's really about the whole e-commerce platform at UPS, but certainly all of our brick and mortar retailers are also in the e-commerce business. So it's about providing them a total solution. And omnichannel is a growing trend in the retail industry. We're seeing 30% year-over-year growth in UPS accounts in 2015, and that means at the store level, we've got about 120,000 ship from store locations that are shipping or have the potential to ship.","We're starting to see this phenomena start to take place also outside the U.S. in our International business. So we think it's a real advantage for the retailers to optimize for a number of things. Sometimes it's inventory, saving the order, because the order is not in the e-commerce fulfillment center, but it's in the store. Other times, it's to speed up the delivery, other times it's to get to the lowest cost option.","So it's really about the whole platform that we offer with UPS My Choice, UPS Access Point, omnichannel, the SurePost, Returns, marketplace tools we provide, so on and so forth, that we're out there selling along with, with obviously, the power of our whole product portfolio aligned to the integrated network that's really driving that success.","And I guess, the last thing I'd say is that, to kind of one of the questions earlier, where \u2013 about density creation. We're really creating this density synthetically through all of those e-commerce solutions that I just spoke of, because all of them both drive customer and consumer convenience as well as density for UPS. And you combine that with some of the things we're doing on the efficiency side with ORION and automation and things that Myron talked, about, we really believe we've got a great platform for e-commerce, for both \u2013 for retailers, consumers and to continue to enhance UPS profitability.","Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Time constraints; that was our last question. I would now like to turn the conference back over to our panelists for any closing remarks. Please go ahead, gentlemen.","David P. Abney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. This is David. I'd just like to review quickly, UPS had another excellent first quarter. We are very effectively implementing our strategic initiatives and we're investing in new capabilities in the right places, which will ensure that we remain the world's premier logistics provider.","Lastly, though, I would like to make an announcement that would be interesting to many of the people on this call. Joe Wilkins will move into the role of Vice President and Corporate Controller and Scott Childress will replace Joe as the Vice President and Investor Relations Officer.","I'll speak to myself and the company, we are very fortunate to have two very extraordinarily, qualified and seasoned professionals, and I'm confident that each of them will be just as successful in their new roles as they have been in their prior roles.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations second quarter 2013 earnings conference call. [Operator instructions.] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Andy Dolny, UPS treasurer and investor relations officer. Sir, the floor is yours.","Andy Dolny","Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Scott Davis, our CEO, and Kurt Kuehn, our CFO, along with Chief Operating Officer David Abney, International President Jim Barber, President of U.S. Operations Myron Gray, and UPS Chief Sales and Marketing Officer Alan Gershenhorn.","Before we begin, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the company. These anticipated results are subject to risks and uncertainties which are described in detail in our 2012 Form 10-K and first quarter 10-Q reports. These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the Securities and Exchange Commission.","In our remarks today, all full year comments and comparisons will refer to adjusted results. In addition, we will discuss UPS\u2019 free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Reconciliations of free cash flow and adjusted results, along with the webcast of today\u2019s call, are available on the UPS investor relations website.","Finally, as a reminder, our goal is to allow as many as possible to participate on today\u2019s call. So, please ask only one question, and then get back in the queue. Again, no multi-part questions, as we will select which part to answer. Thanks for your cooperation.","Now, let me turn it over to Scott.","Scott Davis ","Good morning. UPS second quarter results reflect the impact of customer behavior and market trends. International freight forward operating profits and margins continue to be influenced by moderating demand and changes in shipper preference. Customers around the world continue to put greater emphasis on cost, rather than time in transit, trading down in the UPS product portfolio.","We believe this trend is primarily cyclical. Over the last few quarters, there\u2019s been a trough in the innovation cycle. Demand for new high tech products traditionally drives express small package and air freight out of Asia.","On the other hand, some of the trade down is likely permanent. More international trade is being conducted regionally, and supply chains are becoming more efficient, so the need for the fastest express options may not grow quite as strong in the future.","Here in the U.S., volume growth was a little less than we expected. Some opportunities were missed due to labor negotiations. Regarding labor, on June 25 we announced that the Teamster International master contract received majority approval. We believe this agreement provides a fair competitive wage and benefit package that rewards our employees while also enabling UPS to remain competitive for the long run.","UPS and the Teamsters have committed to address unresolved local supplements in UPS freight. The supplements cover specific geographic areas and include topics such as bidding and local area work rules. Until then, the current agreements remain in place, including UPS freight. The company and the Teamsters have agreed to contract extensions while we continue to discuss the remaining issues.","Looking forward at the macro picture, though global economic expansion for the second half of 2013 is still expected, forecasts have been lowered in 10 of the 12 largest economies, including here in the U.S. One area the U.S. continues to struggle with is exports, especially to Europe. So UPS strongly supports the Transatlantic Trade Investment Partnership. This is a great opportunity for the U.S. and the E.U. to set the standard for trade pacts.","Business cycles are creating short term challenges similar to those we have faced many times before. UPS still sees great growth prospects in B2C throughout the world, emerging markets, and healthcare solutions. In healthcare, for example, during the quarter we announced the opening of two new distribution facilities in Hangzhou, China and Louisville, bringing our total healthcare space to more than 6 million square feet worldwide.","At UPS, the key to expanding operating profit is to adapt our integrated network and expand our portfolio to capitalize on changing market conditions. In a moment, David will provide details of several operational cost initiatives and growth opportunities, but first Kurt will take you through the financial results and updated guidance.","Kurt?","Kurt Kuehn ","Good morning everyone. As Scott noted, we faced several trends during the quarter that continued to impact revenue and operating profit growth. Total company revenue was $13.5 billion, on volume gains of 2.3%.","A couple of weeks ago, UPS announced our second quarter results of $1.13 per share, slightly below our expectations. The profit of our forwarding business unit dropped significantly, and our international results were reduced as customers continued to choose lower yielding products.","In addition, we lowered guidance for full year earnings per share to a range of $4.65 to $4.85, reflecting a 4% to 13% improvement for the back half of the year, as economists around the world reduced their outlook.","Now let\u2019s review the segment results. U.S. domestic total revenue was up 2.3% on average daily volume growth of 1.9. Operating profit was flat with last year, and margin declined 40 basis points to 13.7%, as productivity improvements did not fully offset higher driver wage and benefit costs.","Daily ground volume increased 2.3%, and deferred was up 1.4. Our next day air volume declined for the first drop in five quarters. Next day package volume gained slightly; however letter volume was down more than 5%.","During negotiations, our ability to win new business was hampered. Even though we received a handshake early, we missed some opportunities and did experience some minor volume diversions.","Our average revenue per package was relatively flat, and though we see consistent base rate improvements, lower fuel surcharges and changes in mix and package characteristics weighed on reported yields.","Now for our international results. Total international revenue was up 1.6%, while operating margin contracted 40 basis points to 14.7. Operating profit was down slightly to $451 million. It was lowered by shifting customer preference for deferred products, especially out of Asia. Network and in-country cost reductions partially offset this revenue shortfall, and fuel and currency were also a drag of about $15 million more than we expected.","Daily export shipments increased 5%, driven by gains from Asia and Europe which were somewhat offset by lower U.S. exports. Local day comparisons aided the growth rate by about 1.5%. Domestic products were up 5.1%, also aided by local day comparisons. The emerging market of Turkey led the way, with double digit growth, while Canada and Italy also had solid improvement.","Currency neutral yields declined 2.8%, as our non-premium products like worldwide expedited and trans-border standard jumped by more than 10%, while our premium express products were flat compared to last year.","Moving on to the supply chain and trade segment, our operating profit declined from the record levels achieved in the second quarter of 2012. Total revenue dropped 3.2% and operating profit was down more than 20%. Operating margin, though, still exceeded 7%.","The decline in revenue and operating profit was primarily due to the forwarding business unit. UPS experienced double digit reductions in forwarding revenue, driven by lower demand for air freight forwarding from Asia.","Revenue is heavily concentrated from large, high-tech shippers whose business is down significantly from last year. In addition, we did see large declines in the military sector. Reduced operating costs could not offset these headwinds. UPS is focused on diversifying our revenue base and David will tell you more about that in a moment.","In our distribution business, revenue was up about 4%. Operating profit declined from last year, as a result of continued investment in healthcare infrastructure. The unit did generate a margin of approximately 8%.","UPS freight revenue was $731 million, driven by LTL tonnage improvements and truckload revenue gains. Operating profit growth was relatively flat, as margin was negatively impacted by higher pension and healthcare benefit costs.","Now let\u2019s review our financial strength. For the six months ended June 30, UPS generated $2.5 billion in free cash flow after capital expenditures of $990 million. So far this year, UPS has paid $1.1 billion in dividends, an increase of almost 9% per share. In addition, we\u2019ve repurchased 21.8 million shares for approximately $1.8 billion.","Note that our Q2 tax rate increased slightly to 35%, due to a higher mix of profits from the U.S. And we do expect that rate to be between 35% and 36% for the rest of the year. Speaking of guidance, earlier in July, we provided new full year expectations for earnings per share of $4.65 to $4.85.","This is based on the anticipation that the market trends experienced during the second quarter will persist through the remainder of 2013. Our new range also reflects the latest forecasts for economic expansion, and as Scott indicated, 10 of the 12 largest economies are now expected to grow a little slower than originally thought.","While we did bring down our numbers, it\u2019s important to note that UPS still expects improvement. In fact, the midpoint of our range calls for about 8% earnings per share growth over the second half of 2012.","Looking at the remainder of 2013 for the segments, in our U.S. domestic segment we expect daily volume will increase between 2% and 3%. Growth should get stronger as the year progresses, as we convert missed opportunities from earlier in the year.","Revenue growth should be slightly higher than volume. Package characteristics and lower fuel surcharges will continue to mask a base rate improvement somewhat, and profitability will be up at a mid single digit base.","For our international segment, in the beginning of the year we expect revenue and daily volume growth of approximately 4% to 5%. Yield improvement will be hampered by continued mix changes as well as commodity fluctuations.","We expect currency to negatively impact profit comparisons by approximately $100 million. However, we anticipate operating profit improvement in line with our revenue growth of 4% to 5%. Third quarter operating profit expansion will be relatively flat, due to comparisons with last year.","Looking at supply chain and trade for the remainder of the year, we expect revenue growth to be flat, with an operating margin of approximately 8%, driving mid single digit profit improvement.","Before I turn things over to David, let me assure you UPS is focused on both our long term strategies and on making the necessary adjustments to adapt to current market conditions. Now David will take you through some of our key initiatives. David?","David Abney","Thanks, Kurt. I want to spend a few minutes discussing how UPS is adapting to the conditions that Scott and Kurt just identified in their opening comments. Economic cycles and consumer behaviors change, creating challenges and opportunities. The key to long term success is adapting our model to capitalize on these changes.","This is something we\u2019ve been doing for more than 100 years. It goes without saying that we have already identified overhead and discretionary cost reduction opportunities. I can assure you that I have an internal checklist of these items. But that\u2019s not all I want to discuss.","Today I\u2019m going to provide insight into how UPS is making strategic changes to our network and portfolio to meet the evolving needs of the market. In our U.S. domestic operations, UPS is wrapping up technology implementations like Orion, which takes route optimization to a new level. To give you an idea of the scale of this project, we have assigned almost 500 people to this multiyear development.","At the same time, we\u2019re delaying some projects that don\u2019t deliver immediate results. Additionally, we have identified opportunities to move more premium volume over the road, taking advantage of more important capabilities and the UPS integrated network.","To meet customer demand, we are leveraging our relationships with retail shippers to develop more sophisticated distribution models that better utilize their store inventory. The implementation of omnichannel fulfillment is still in the early stages, and we\u2019re seeing great results, including B2B shipment growth.","In our international business, margins do benefit from the adjustments we make to our global air network. Maximizing aircraft utilization has always been important. We have already cut our Asia capacity by about 20%, and we will continue to reduce truck routes and schedule frequencies, making adjustments from Asia to the U.S. and Europe, being mindful that we must remain nimble enough to react to surges in demand.","We\u2019re making changes to address the risk and opportunities of a changing marketplace, expanding our presence in emerging markets with an array of solutions for customers. Notably, we expanded our worldwide expedited service to 145 new destinations and 60 new origins earlier this year. We now provide shippers in these emerging markets with an economical alternative to express shipping.","To increase more premium revenue into our aircraft, we introduced UPS Worldwide Express Freight. This service offers shippers in key markets guaranteed, day-definite, door-to-door freight options.","In the supply chain and freight segment, our primary focus is on the forwarding business unit. To better manage our purchase transportation, we\u2019re implementing a system that optimizes buy rates to manage real time market conditions.","Additionally, we are diversifying our revenue base to take advantage of the trade-down trends in the air freight forwarding market. UPS expanded our ocean freight capabilities, a business we\u2019ve been in for over a decade.","For example, we extended the reach of our ocean less than container load service to hundreds of new lanes around the world. UPS Preferred LCO service accelerates ocean shipments and has been expanded to several key markets in Europe. When customers seek less expensive freight options, UPS offers a complete portfolio of solutions.","Also, across the entire supply chain and freight segment, we expect to reduce overhead and operating cost utilizing UPS technology. Given our long history of adapting to changing conditions in the actions I just reviewed, we are confident that we will deliver a solid second half in 2013 and beyond.","Now, back to Kurt.","Kurt Kuehn ","Great. Thanks, David, and hopefully you can see that we do have a wide array of both opportunities and initiatives in motion to address current conditions. And operator, I\u2019ll turn it over to you now and we\u2019ll take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] Our first question will come from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays ","I want to talk about your domestic growth. Last year you had pretty good traction with the new next day saver packages. We could see that in the numbers. But I\u2019m wondering if that at this point in time have you reached a saturated point in the market where that new premium offering has met a level where you can\u2019t drive much more share with that? And what are the type of innovative products that you can leverage the integrated network with relative to your competitor.","Kurt Kuehn ","The major driver of the reduction in our next day air business for the quarter was a reduction in letters. The actual package business, which is more related to the B2C, and certainly the omnichannel, continued to grow moderately. But we did see a big decline in letters, and we do see some cycle there with refinancing dropping a bit, and also it certainly was impacted by some of the uncertainty in the second quarter.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Art Hatfield of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Arthur Hatfield - Raymond James","Despite some of the slowing demand trends, or some of the markets where there may be a little bit of excess capacity, are you seeing any irrationality in pricing in any of your markets?","Kurt Kuehn ","In general, I think the small package market remains rational. Clearly there\u2019s a desire for customers to trade down. Probably the one area that has the most volatility is in the freight forwarding arena, and most notably Asia. And I\u2019ll have Jim Barber comment a little bit on the trends there.","Jim Barber","I think that\u2019s right, Kurt. Obviously you look at the international segment. We feel very strong about the Europe piece of the business, and very solid. Foundations are good, pricing is rational. As the market capacity moves largely out of Asia, you get a lot of pressure through the network in pricing and capacity, with freighters coming out of the market and then belly space coming in. So we\u2019ve got to manage to that, but in general the pricing position within UPS we feel very good about.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein"," ","You guys have been very successful in offsetting some of the international small package yield headwind from trade downs by managing up the air network utilization. I was trying to get a sense for what the level of utilization is right now in the trans-Pacific and how much more you might be able to offset ongoing yield headwinds if these trends continue.","Kurt Kuehn ","Certainly, as David mentioned, we\u2019re doing a lot of work on the network changes. So David, maybe let\u2019s start with you.","David Abney","Yeah, I think it\u2019s an area we\u2019ve done a great job with over the years in managing that balance, matching capacity to volume trends. In fact, since 2011, we have reduced our Asia capacity by 20%. And even this last quarter, from an international standpoint, with export volume up 5%, [block] hours were down 1.2%.","That being said, though, it\u2019s an ever-changing environment, and we have to watch it very closely. And for this next quarter, we plan to reduce from 8 to 7.5 truck routes out of Asia. We also are reducing one weekly frequency from Asia to Europe.","But we also have the ability to plan in advance, and when we see days that are going to have less volume, we will shut down lanes for particular days of the week, which we\u2019re having a lot of success with. So something that we\u2019re actively managing.","Jim Barber","To add on to what David said, obviously internationally, I think if you look at the results over the years in our operating margin, the network has a big play into it, but the other factor that we believe we do very well in international is to manage our in-country operations.","You can see that comes through in the margins. We feel like we\u2019ve done it very well over the last couple of years as the economies have moved across the world. So it\u2019s a balance of the network as well as our UPS leadership across the world to manage the in-country operations, and the results of that, I think, as you can see, is our international margin. So we\u2019re pretty comfortable with that.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tom Wadewitz - JPMorgan ","I wanted to ask you a little bit more on the trade down. What do you think is timing, and I don\u2019t know if you have product launches in mind. That\u2019s one thing with tech shippers, as you mentioned, on trade-down. But what do you think is potential timing where you would have some more evidence to say either we\u2019re right that this trade down is cyclical or you say maybe it\u2019s a bigger issue and it\u2019s more persistent? Is that a couple of quarters out? How would you look at the visibility and timing for potential change in net trade down dynamic?","Scott Davis ","I think I\u2019d start with the fact that clearly there\u2019s less need for speed in a soft global environment. And I think we\u2019ve seen that, we\u2019ve been in that environment, unfortunately, for a couple of years now. But I do think that what gets express going again is obviously innovative and high value goods.","And as I said earlier in my comments, we\u2019ve been in a trough. We\u2019ll come out of that trough at some point in time in the future. For me to say it\u2019s going to be two quarters or three quarters, I\u2019m not sure, but we know there\u2019s going to be product launches coming up, new innovation coming up. We\u2019re not done innovating new products.","And when that happens, again, you\u2019ll see the express product grow. I\u2019m not sure you\u2019ll see express products grow as fast as you did 10 years ago, unless you get a strong global economy and good growth in global trade.","But I do think the fact is, we talked five years ago about the fact that the next day market in the U.S., being a market that was going nowhere. Last two years, we grew that market faster than the ground. So again, I think we sometimes overreact on these things, and I do expect it will be back.","Kurt Kuehn ","Yeah, and I think as David mentioned, we\u2019re doing a lot of product innovation and expansion, both to increase the yield on our aircraft and add some new product capabilities in the lower arena. So maybe Alan, you can talk a little bit about the portfolio and how we\u2019re adding products.","Alan Gershenhorn","Yeah, I guess first, Scott alluded to high-tech launches, and we\u2019re certainly looking forward to some of the launches that should take place in late third, fourth quarter this year. We\u2019ve got a great portfolio there to help high tech companies with those launches.","David talked about worldwide express freight. It\u2019s surpassing our expectations. Again, this is a new piece of the express market that we\u2019ve entered, so we\u2019re excited because there\u2019s a tremendous amount of upside for UPS there. And we\u2019re also able to bundle that to win other express package.","And then on the yield management side, again, David talked about the expedited expansion. Again, a couple of keys there is that utilizing our lower cost integrated network we\u2019re able to utilize ground transport or standard ground network in Europe as well as our second day air and ground network in the United States to lower the cost and keep the packages off the planes.","And one interesting note there is that 75% of the new volume we\u2019re getting on those lanes are coming from shippers that never shipped on those lanes before. So it\u2019s new business, and it\u2019s not down trading from express.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch ","Domestic margins took a bit of a downturn year over year. What was the growth of short post and how is the shift to sure post and ecommerce impacting margins? And how is that felt within the negotiations?","Kurt Kuehn ","I\u2019ll take at least the pure growth part of that, and then Myron can talk a little bit about our productivity and other issues. But we\u2019ve wrapped a lot of the ramp up of sure post. It\u2019s continuing to grow. Clearly B2C continues to outperform B2B in our portfolio, and we\u2019re doing fine with that.","The biggest issue, clearly, in the second quarter for domestic, was the slowdown of volume growth, below what we\u2019d expected. And Myron, clearly you guys are adapting to that.","Myron Gray ","On the heels of slower growth than what we expected, when you look at the [wrap] of the basic product in the sure post, we were able to improve our operating margins by deploying sure post redirect. During the second quarter, on average we saw 17.5% of the packages that would have been delivered by the post office we were able to redirect our package delivery drivers, matching them up with other stops that were going to residences, which drove density.","So we\u2019ll see continued expansion of our productivity and moving into the third quarter we\u2019ll try to hone those productivity improvements.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Kevin Sterling of BB&T Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Kevin Sterling - BB&T Capital Markets ","Can I dive a little bit more into your freight forwarding comments? The weakness that you\u2019re seeing, is it mainly a mix issue, volatile buy rates, volume? Really what\u2019s driving that deterioration in forwarding?","Jim Barber","It\u2019s all those together, quite frankly, and some of the comments we started with, we know that in our network right now we\u2019re really concentrated in a couple of ways. The Asia lane is driving a lot of the growth historically. It concentrates in high tech, and Scott talked about some of the innovation trough. You heard some comments about military and defense. We\u2019ve had some of those movements going on across the world.","So some of those pressures combine to where we are right now in the current quarter. But looking forward, as David said, we\u2019re pretty confident. We\u2019ve been investing in freight. The UPS freight forwarding over the last couple of years.","You mentioned, David, kind of a go-forward new piece of go-to-market on how we\u2019re going to go to the procurement side of freight, so we\u2019re comfortable that we can take that and continue the growth. And we also have to take a look at emerging markets.","And quite frankly, we feel like the emerging market announcements we\u2019ve had recently, as the trade patterns in the world move, is going to provide us great opportunity to match our network with that emerging market investment and continue to grow all of those together.","And at the end, even in these tough times, the margins weren\u2019t the worst you\u2019ve ever seen, so we\u2019re kind of holding those. Year over year comps aren\u2019t the best, but at the end of the day, we still have some pretty strong margins in freight. We continue to keep going down that path and we\u2019ll manage them together.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Please go ahead.","Chris Wetherbee - Citi","Maybe a question just on the second half guidance, when you think about the 8% midpoint. Can you give us a little bit of some of the inputs and the expectations, I guess, for volume progression as you move throughout the year, that kind of gets you to that point? I guess maybe what I\u2019m asking is how much is it reliant on maybe a somewhat more normalized peak or some product launches that go on later on in the second half of the year?","Kurt Kuehn ","You know, we\u2019re not basing our guidance on any significant ramp up economically, as I think I mentioned. We\u2019re looking for basically a steady state economy, unexciting, a little underperforming, clearly, from where we thought it would be at the beginning of the year, but not radically down.","We do expect the U.S. business to ramp up a bit as we ramp up some of the customers, perhaps, that got deferred or delayed during the negotiation period. So [cross talk] volume growth strengthen with Q4 clearly being stronger than Q3.","On the international side, kind of steady as she goes on that. Clearly there\u2019s volatility in the air freight, but we feel pretty good that the core business is very strong. Europe continues strong. So no real unique shape to the rest of the year as far as economic conditions.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Kelly Dougherty of Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Kelly Dougherty - Macquarie ","Just want to follow up on forwarding a bit. You talk about air freight overcapacity. I\u2019m wondering if you can talk about some of the moving parts. Are you seeing that in lower purchase transportation costs? Or maybe you have to then pass that through more quickly from a pricing standpoint? If you can help us think about how that\u2019s working on the air freight side, and then maybe a little color on ocean as well, please.","Kurt Kuehn ","I think the major overcapacity in the forwarding is that it\u2019s not so much on the dedicated cargo carriers, but the passenger airlines clearly have added capacity. And our real strategy, as Jim said, is to adapt so we\u2019re as flexible as we can be to reflect buy rates. And then importantly, also, to develop a portfolio to help customers move up and down as much as we do in our package environment.","So, you know, the forwarding market is volatile, and cycles happen quite a bit. We think we\u2019re reacting accordingly and building a good base.","Kelly Dougherty - Macquarie ","Any color, maybe, on the ocean side?","Kurt Kuehn ","Ocean remains solid, and that\u2019s part of the reason we\u2019re building and expanding for it, is we\u2019re profitable in ocean and looking forward to growing it.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Justin Yagerman with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Justin Yagerman - Deutsche Bank ","In David\u2019s remarks, you guys talked about moving from 8 to 7.5 truck routes. I think you were talking about the Asian market. And I think it was the first time you had given color around that. And I was kind of curious, as I frame up the international small package business, can you give us a sense of how much of that business stays on the ground as opposed to actually flying in either your owned or chartered aircraft? That would be helpful, I think, in terms of getting an idea of the profitability of the business.","David Abney","To just clarify, last quarter we were at 8 truck routes. And this quarter we\u2019re moving to 7.5. And what that means is there\u2019ll be some days that are, [end of the week], 8, and then there are other days that are 7. But these truck routes, of course, are the routes that are very important, connecting Asia to the U.S. and Asia to Europe.","Jim Barber","Clearly the issue, it\u2019s more of a challenge for us coming out of Asia, where you fly the goods. When you hit the cross border in Europe, you\u2019re going to have to seek to move between air and ground, and that flexibility. But the challenge, for us, obviously, is when business slows down out of Asia, you fly it.","Justin Yagerman - Deutsche Bank ","And so just framing up the back half of that question, in terms of the overall percentage of the international small package business that stays on the ground, any color around that?","Jim Barber","Most of that question really pertains to our European operations, because of the way we\u2019ve been at it since we went over there in 1976. The network we built that is both trans-border air and ground allows us to essentially keep about 85% of what we pick up in Europe to stay in Europe. And it\u2019s the customer\u2019s choice. They can fly or they can put it on the ground. And the power of that network allows them to do both. So that kind of gives you a feel for the materiality of the European [unintelligible].","Scott Davis ","And you know, Europe is over half our revenue in international, so it\u2019s a big piece. And Canada is also a decent sized operation.","Alan Gershenhorn ","I was just going to say that we\u2019ve got a material business between the U.S. and Canada, and we just recently launched a ground business to Mexico, so we now have U.S. to Mexico standard, and Mexico to U.S. standard, which is, again, also exceeding our expectations in terms of growth.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Scott Group - Wolfe Trahan ","Maybe just an update on the Teamsters negotiations and the contract status there. With the tentative deal on the package side, are you starting to see any of the domestic volumes come back more than you thought in the second quarter? And then on the LTL side, are you seeing any of the volumes start to go away given that you seem further away on the deal there?","Scott Davis ","First of all, you\u2019re right. We\u2019ve got the national [master] agreement done, and the national master covers the important things on the package side, and covers the wages, the pension, and the health and welfare. We do have some supplements open that we\u2019re working our way through. We\u2019re working with the Teamsters and our employees right now, and those issues, they generally involve work rules.","I\u2019d say that, as we\u2019ve said before, we\u2019re really not seeing additional diversion or any diversion at this point in time. We missed some opportunities and as we negotiated it took us a while to put these new wins on board, to convert them. And I think we\u2019ll see that, and we\u2019ll see more in the third quarter, and we\u2019ll see more in the fourth quarter. So I don\u2019t see any more losses from that perspective.","On the LTL side, we\u2019ve got to finish that agreement. We do have an extension, which gives our customers a little bit of a calm feeling, because we have that extension. And I\u2019d say currently we\u2019re really not seeing a lot of lost volume on the LTL side. We feel pretty good about it. We just need to get that agreement done.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley ","I\u2019m wondering if you could comment on something that we get asked a lot, which is when we look at sort of what appears to us as a duopoly in the U.S. market, it seems somewhat surprising that we don\u2019t see more, I guess, stronger pricing power overall. And I realize there\u2019s always puts and takes and mix shifts and whatnot, but I\u2019m wondering if you can comment at all about how you think about the progression of this market. DHL\u2019s been gone for quite some time, so maybe talk a little bit about how you think about pricing.","Kurt Kuehn ","First thing I have to do, I guess, is take issue with your framing that the market is a duopoly. Clearly this is a competitive market. The post office is a very large player in the ground business especially, and there\u2019s a number of regional players.","In general, the pricing is rational in this industry, and that\u2019s one of the great elements, but I think some of the trends we\u2019ve talked about do create some challenges and mask that. That goods are getting smaller and lighter. The average weights are down 2% to 3% typically year over year, and that there\u2019s been a transition of goods to some extent from business to business to business to consumer.","So pricing remains rational. It\u2019s somewhat masked. It\u2019s sometimes hard for you guys to see all the moving parts, but if you factor out average weight and some of the other product changes, we\u2019re still looking at core base rates of over 2%.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Ben Hartford of Baird. Please go ahead.","Benjamin Hartford -Robert W. Baird ","I\u2019m wondering if I can get some perspective on my choice and where you think that technology is as it relates to capturing B2C benefits, both in terms of volume and utilization in the network. Maybe just kind of framing where that product technology is and whether we\u2019re on the front end or back end of realizing the benefits.","Alan Gershenhorn ","First, I\u2019d say that we\u2019re on the front end of that. We have over 3.3 million consumers signed up right now, and certainly by the end of the quarter we should approach or exceed 4 million enrollments. We have 54 million deliveries that have taken place, and about 14% of those deliveries the consumer actually takes action on them.","So there\u2019s some real value being created there. Certainly on the cost side for us, we\u2019re reducing our send against or making sure that more packages are being delivered on the first attempt. Just recently, we introduced the ability to upgrade your sure post packages to UPS ground, and that\u2019s also resonating well with our customers and exceeding our expectations. And we\u2019re the only provider out there in the marketplace now that enables all residential services to have consumer day before visibility and ability to reroute or reschedule","The other exciting thing is we just launched the UPS my choice Facebook app, and that enables a Facebook login and also my choice capability on Facebook. It\u2019s just out a couple of weeks, and we have 120,000 new users that have linked their UPS my choice or their myups.com to Facebook. So we\u2019re excited about that. We\u2019re also listed as one of the top 10 Facebook apps right now.","Just some other interesting stats, we have 3.6 million downloads now on our iPad, iPhone and Android apps, so a lot of traction with my choice. Also really resonating with retailers.","Kurt Kuehn ","Right. So if you don\u2019t get it, we\u2019re moving well on my choice, and if you guys haven\u2019t signed up yet, you\u2019re missing a great service.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Nate Brochmann of William Blair. Please go ahead.","Nate Brochmann - William Blair ","That\u2019s a great transition here to my question, which is as you guys continue to get more B2C business, and you\u2019re able to leverage more off your drivers, even by rerouting from sure post into the regular ground network, what\u2019s that doing for your margins in that B2C business, and how much higher can that go as you continue to get more density and more business through those channels?","Kurt Kuehn ","Yeah, I think Myron clearly will fill you in on the redirects, and also Orion. In general B2C is a bit more challenging, but through the innovation we\u2019ve done, we\u2019re finding ways to grow very profitably with B2C.","Myron Gray ","In David\u2019s opening comments, he addressed Orion, but before we go there, let me remind you that just last year we finished completion of deploying telematics in the U.S. So in the quarter, we were able to drive 1.6 million less miles on top of 1.9% volume growth.","Now, a couple of on top of that. You talk about the 500 people that we\u2019ve deployed with Orion, which is an on-road integrated optimization system that will allow us to reduce additional miles. Keep in mind that for every average mile reduced there\u2019s a $50 million savings to UPS.","So we feel very confident that as we grow B2C volume, we\u2019ll deploy technology that will allow us to balance the cost. But as we get additional B2C, we\u2019ll also increase density, which obviously will help us improve margins.","Kurt Kuehn ","Right, and I guess just to reinforce, the Orion is a major deployment that\u2019s going to take us 3 to 4 years to get fully rolled out. But it does create a very dynamic environment that allows us to do real time adjustments.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer ","Could you speak to the back half guidance. What would be the two, or three, or four biggest swing factors to put you at the high end or the low end as you approach it?","Kurt Kuehn ","Well, certainly the economic factors will be a big driver. I think in the domestic side, making sure that this nascent recovery continues, our success clearly on bringing in customers to accelerate the volume growth and then normal execution.","Internationally, the product launches, I think, in late Q3, Q4, have a big impact on demand conditions. Although in Europe we\u2019re plugging along pretty strong, we had growth upper single digits in Europe and continue to see that work as our integrated network differentiates. So biggest factors really would be the economic environment.","Scott Davis ","It\u2019s our job to adapt to whatever we faced in the second half of the year. The team here will adapt to conditions. Kurt said in earlier comments that we\u2019re assuming the same trends we saw coming out of the second quarter. Hopefully we\u2019ll get a little bit better, but we\u2019ll adapt to whatever we get.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse ","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how much you expect to improve profitability at the forwarding division once you\u2019re able to implement some of the initiatives that you were speaking about earlier.","Kurt Kuehn ","We have given guidance that the overall supply chain and freight will have 8% margins for the remainder of the year. So clearly that represents a very solid margin and we\u2019re comfortable that the actions we\u2019re taking will get us to that point.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse ","And is there a longer term expectation?","Kurt Kuehn ","We\u2019ve not laid out exact numbers for that subsegment, but clearly if that sector is in the 8% to 10% margin over the long term, we\u2019re generating economic profit and feel good. And then it\u2019s just a matter of continuing to grow that sector.","Scott Davis ","And we think international air freight is at a trough and it\u2019s hard to imagine it getting much worse going forward.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research","Not to beat the forwarding question over the head here. I\u2019m just trying to segregate what\u2019s more of a short term issue versus a long term issue. You mentioned weakness in the [tech] out of Asia, and you mentioned weakness in the military. How much of that do you believe is shorter term in nature or timing in nature versus how much do you think is more of a secular issue?","Jim Barber","Scott talked about the innovation trough in the beginning, so that\u2019s obviously a piece of the drag on the high tech sector. The military and the defense side, you know, you can see what happens across the world and what\u2019s going on with that. And I think our real opportunity is to reverse the concentration in what we\u2019ve got.","You know, we\u2019ve been investing, for instance, in healthcare over the last couple of years, and we expand that footprint. We\u2019re going to go down the path here into emerging markets, which quite frankly in their early years of development as trade continues to grow. That\u2019s really a freight need that they have to connect to the world, as opposed to in express products.","So all of those provide great opportunities for UPS in the years to come, so we\u2019re very comfortable. We\u2019re glad we\u2019re in forwarding, and right now it is a bit of a trough. We hold the margins tight. We continue to invest, and we\u2019ll continue to grow it as UPS should.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of David Ross of Stifel. Please go ahead.","David Ross - Stifel Nicolaus ","UPS freight showed an increase in density with shipment volume up nicely in the quarter, and yields were up just a little bit, but margins, it said in the press release, declined slightly due to increases in compensation and benefit expense. Could you explain if that\u2019s anything out of the normal annual increase in wages and benefits? And then also why the increased density wouldn\u2019t have driven margin improvement?","Kurt Kuehn ","Yeah, there was a bit of a tough comp to the previous year that gave us a little bit of a headwind. But Myron, maybe you could talk about some of the deployment of UPS technology into freight that should help us drive margins.","Myron Gray ","Yeah, as Kurt noted, in the quarter, while we did see continued growth in revenue, we did see also continued abilities to attract additional market share, which boded well for us. However, with the increase in health and benefit costs, we were not able to improve margin expansion.","We will continue to deploy customer-facing as well as operational technology. Customer-facing technology like pickup notification utilizes UPS\u2019s world ship, that gives our customers an hour timeframe of when they\u2019ll get the pickup. And we\u2019ll continue to deploy small package technology and freight to get additional operational improvement.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Helane Becker of Cowen Securities. Please go ahead.","Helane Becker - Cowen Securities ","I just had a question on capital allocation and capital deployment. I know you guys are very committed to the dividend and the share repurchase program. And yet your share count is going down, your revenue growth is flat, and your earnings are going down. So can you just talk about your thoughts with respect to capital allocation within the context of slowing revenue growth environment?","Scott Davis ","Clearly we\u2019re committed to our distributions. We\u2019re committed to our dividends, we\u2019re committed to our share repurchase, the numbers we\u2019ve talked about in the past. But we\u2019re also committed to reinvesting in the business.","So we have a lot of opportunities out there right now for us to reinvest, particularly in areas of emerging markets. We talked about that a little bit earlier. There\u2019s all kinds of opportunities in healthcare that we\u2019re just tapping right now. And the B2C we\u2019ve talked about throughout the call. Around the globe, there\u2019s a lot of opportunities for us to enable our customers\u2019 growth in B2C.","So we see plenty of ideas and plenty of opportunities to reinvest interest business.","Kurt Kuehn ","And Helane, I can\u2019t let you get off the phone here without taking issue with you. I mean, we\u2019re looking for profit growth in the next quarter and revenue growth, an 8% midpoint for profit growth. So we did hit a bit of a hiccup in the second quarter, but we feel very confident in both short term and the long term outlook for the company.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Jack Atkins of Stephens. Please go ahead.","Jack Atkins - Stephens ","Just to go back to your comments earlier about air freight capacity, as an operator of your own asset, I\u2019d be curious to hear your thoughts on the long term outlook for air freight capacity, especially given the influx of passenger belly space we\u2019ve seen over the last several years. I\u2019d just like to hear your broader thoughts on the capacity situation, both over the next 12 months and the next 3 to 5 years.","[David Abney]","I think, the first thing, you certainly hit it right. What\u2019s increased the capacity has been the belly space and all of the passenger airlines and aircraft that have been added. What you are seeing us do, and other people in our marketplace, is to watch very closely the trade lanes and to make sure that we deploy those assets to match the volume in those trade lanes. So when we need to pick up the lift in certain areas, quickly you deploy that aircraft and then on the other hand, when we need to pull back, we still can effectively do that.","One of the things that\u2019s unique, I think, to our company right now is we have not ordered any aircraft after the 767s that we\u2019re receiving this year. So that gives us some time to just hold firm and see what\u2019s going to go on in the marketplace in the next couple of years.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar ","You mentioned the double digit revenue declines in forwarding, and Scott, I\u2019ve heard you say in the past, [it\u2019s all trade on board]. I\u2019d like to ask you to comment on volume shifts, namely DC customers who shifted to air in the past, diverting all the way down to ocean. Or are you seeing shippers simply shipping fewer shipments? And as a corollary, are you margin neutral on these modes? Or does slower ocean demand fewer UPS resources?","Scott Davis ","Let\u2019s let Alan answer that. I think clearly we\u2019re probably seeing all the above, but Alan will take a shot.","Alan Gershenhorn ","Yeah, we\u2019re seeing some of our customers look for solutions that move the air freight to ocean. Certainly there are certain products that Scott talked about earlier in terms of innovation and high value that just don\u2019t fit that mode.","You know, we recently introduced, and David talked about, our preferred ocean LTL, which is really a combination of our ocean move and then using our integrated network to expedite those moves once they hit the destination, say in the U.S. here, where we\u2019ve got some nice margins on that. That\u2019s obviously higher than regular ocean, and it speeds up the time in transit to faster than ocean, but still somewhat slower than air freight. And that\u2019s been boding low for us.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar ","About the margins, is ocean more or less attractive to you compared to air?","Kurt Kuehn ","In the short term, if we\u2019ve got premium volumes sitting in an aircraft, there\u2019s a higher incremental impact. It\u2019s harder to adjust, especially flights out of Asia, than it is other integrated areas. Over the long term, we are very profitable in ocean. In fact, we have major investments to help supplier management and to help accelerate ocean. So we\u2019re building the portfolio, classic UPS approach, and we\u2019ll make sure that the margins are appropriately compensatory for the investment.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of David Campbell of Thompson Davis & Company. Please go ahead.","David Campbell - Thompson Davis & Company","I don\u2019t want to overdo it on forwarding, but I haven\u2019t heard, unless I missed it, how much forwarding air freight tonnage was down in the second quarter.","Kurt Kuehn ","It was down a little over 10% in the quarter. And as we said before, the military was a big piece of that. And that was certainly a very volatile group as movements happen. And then the core underlying weakness also in high tech drove that.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein ","Kurt, I was just wondering if you could maybe give us a sense for what the right level of maintenance capex should be on the airline side once you lap the new aircraft deliveries in this coming year.","Kurt Kuehn ","We\u2019ve got the youngest fleet in the industry, so at least the day to day maintenance is pretty minimal. But yeah, we think in general, depreciation is a reasonable representation of maintenance capex.","As David said, we\u2019re not real long on aircraft right now. We\u2019re bringing in a couple more 767s this year, and then the fleet\u2019s in great shape. And we\u2019ll be flexible and decide what happens from there. But we feel really good about our capital position, very few capital commitments and great cash flow for the company going forward. And the depreciation, we think, really represents a pretty good shot at what maintenance capex is.","Operator","And we have a question from the line of Mr. Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Scott Group - Wolfe Trahan ","Just following up on those comments about free cash should be really good the next couple of years. What prevents you from being even more aggressive with the buyback or the dividend? Because the stock is up so far this year, you\u2019re above a 3% yield, you\u2019ve got $6 billion of cash, you used to run the business with closer to a billion of cash. Why not be more aggressive?","Kurt Kuehn ","We have, you know, a policy that we manage to fairly steadily, Scott, as you know, of just [targeting] approximately 100% of net income in the form of either dividends or share repurchases. This year we are more aggressive with a stated target of $4 billion in share repurchases, partially to catch up for last year, where we held back as we accumulated cash.","But we think a steady programmatic approach is the best way to do it. We do buy it back and retire the shares that we commit, and so I think investors can count on a programmatic approach that is understandable and foreseeable. And at least for now that makes a lot of sense. Clearly if markets get crazy, we\u2019ve got the cash if we want to become more aggressive in share repurchase. But right now we\u2019re very comfortable with our current approach.","Scott Davis ","As I said earlier, I think that even though it\u2019s a slow growth global economy, we see a lot of opportunities to reinvest in ideas we have out there.","Operator","Due to time constraints, our last question for the day will come from the line of Kelly Dougherty of Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Kelly Dougherty - Macquarie ","I just wanted to change gears and see if you could talk a little bit about the B2B side of things. You know, what you\u2019re seeing from perhaps a stabilization or when you think that maybe you\u2019ll see growth reaccelerate, and how the omnichannel might fit into that. So maybe any color you could give on B2B would be helpful.","Kurt Kuehn ","Yeah, we did reference in our earlier a little bit of a slowing in the industrial base. So we saw some drag there. But Alan, maybe you could talk about what\u2019s happening in the retail sector?","Alan Gershenhorn ","Certainly your comment about omnichannel, that certainly does create B2B shipments. We\u2019re really excited about helping brick and mortar retailers provide an omnichannel experience for their consumers that obviously merges the online with the brick and mortar. We\u2019re finding that there\u2019s a lot of customers out there, consumers, that want to order online and ship to store.","We\u2019re also enabling our retailers with our technology to be able to drop orders to their stores and ship to other stores, or ship directly to consumers, which is a win-win-win for UPS, the retailer, and the consumers, because the consumers are getting faster fulfillment of their orders. The retailer\u2019s getting it at cost-effective rates, and obviously we\u2019re getting new business.","We\u2019ve got probably about 25 retailers that are engaged with us today on that, and it\u2019s resonating well with them. The other thing that I would just add is the one driver really resonates well with the retailers, because obviously the store personnel needs to stay focused on the in-store consumers, and using our technology and one driver to pick up all the air and ground and deliver all the air and ground keeps those employees on track.","Kelly Dougherty - Macquarie ","And do you think that this omnichannel driving that can lead to a stabilization in the B2B volumes any time soon?","Alan Gershenhorn ","Yeah, I think certainly it\u2019s going to help grow B2B. Obviously you wouldn\u2019t have thought in the past that the B2C or online would generate B2B, but you\u2019re finding more and more that the folks are getting packages delivered to their work, delivered to stores. We certainly have our Kiala UPS access point model in Europe, with 8,000 access points for consumers. Many consumers are preferring to pick up those packages at businesses versus at home.","So yeah, we\u2019re excited about the prospects of a more balanced B2C market or online ecommerce market that generates more B2B than it has in the past.","Scott Davis ","Kelly, in the second quarter, if you watched the economic statistics, the inventories got liquidated, so inventories are at a pretty low level right now. And U.S. exports were really weak orders. So both those two areas should really help B2B going forward to get back to normal.","Operator","That does conclude our Q&A session for the day. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Andy Dolny for closing remarks.","Andy Dolny","I\u2019m going to turn it over to Scott for some final thoughts.","Scott Davis ","Thanks for doing this today. First let me say that I am quite confident UPS will achieve the goals that we discussed today. And that\u2019s despite a slower economic growth forecast and the trade down we\u2019re experiencing.","I want to reiterate the comments I made on Helane\u2019s question. I really can\u2019t remember a time in my 28 years at UPS when we had more opportunities in front of us. Opportunities like the omnichannel in the U.S. retail that we\u2019ve just been talking about, market share expansion in the fast-growing emerging markets, healthcare solutions to assist an aging population, and UPS enabling global B2C business growth around the globe. Lots of opportunities ahead of us.","Thanks for joining us today."],"21214":["United Parcel Service, Inc.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. And after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Scott Childress, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.","Scott Childress","Good morning and welcome to the UPS third quarter 2019 earnings call. Joining me today are David Abney, our CEO; Brian Newman, our CFO; who joined us in September; Richard Peretz, our Former CFO; Kate Gutmann, our Chief Sales and Solutions Officer; along with our Chief Operating Officer, Jim Barber; our Chief Information and Engineering Officer, Juan Perez; and Scott Price, our Chief Strategy and Transformation Officer.","Before we begin, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements and address our expectations for the future performance or operational results of our company. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2018 Form 10-K and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the SEC.","During the quarter, UPS recorded a pre-tax charge of $63 million or $0.06 per share on an after-tax basis. The charges are primarily from transformation-related activities with the majority split between the U.S Domestic and International segments. In the prior year period, UPS recorded a pre-tax charge for transformation cost of $97 million or $0.09 per share on an after tax basis.","The webcast of today\u2019s call, along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures are available on UPS Investor Relations website. Unless stated otherwise, discussions today will refer to adjusted financial results. Webcast users can submit live questions during the call. We will attempt to answer questions of a long-term strategic nature. Callers are asked to submit only one question so that we may allow as many as possible to participate. Thank you.","And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to David.","David Abney","Good morning, everyone. Today I\u2019m going to provide highlights from the quarter and discuss several of the exciting industry [per] [ph] solutions we recently announced. Then John will outline our actions for a successful peak and Richard and Brian will cover the financial details.","In fact, I would like to welcome Brian Newman to the call as our CFO. He brings broad international business experience and I'm very happy he has joined UPS. I also want to thank Richard for his numerous outstanding contributions over his 38 year career with UPS. Rich is staying through the remainder of the year to ensure a smooth transition.","Now turning to the results. Again this quarter, we're reporting strong performance in a dynamic environment. Our transformation investments continue to deliver benefits driven by our highly efficient and expanding global network, our focus on targeted growth from the most attractive opportunities and solid execution of our initiatives.","Our innovative solutions are differentiating UPS from others in the industry. As a result, consolidated revenue grew 5% and operating profit grew more than 20% creating strong operating leverage and the highest quarterly operating profit in the company's history.","Margins expanded in all three segments, a testament to the quality of our strategies and disciplined execution. Our integrated network is running well and widespread adoption of next day delivery is an excellent fit of our expanded Air and Ground capabilities.","As you are aware, trade uncertainty continues to create macro challenges for businesses. We are working closely with our customers to help them adjust, while also making the most efficient use of our assets. Here in the U.S., the consumer continues to drive the economy with strong retail, healthcare and e-commerce sales, bolstered by solid consumer economic conditions.","Our strategy is resonating with customers. Despite the slowdown in the industrial sector, as evidenced by B2B volume growth in other sectors for the fourth consecutive quarter, we are benefiting from improved SMB customer mix and expect it will continue as we prepare for another record peak season. We have recently announced several new capabilities and solutions that support our strategic growth imperatives, small and medium-sized businesses, international growth markets, e-commerce and healthcare.","In the healthcare and life sciences area, I'm pleased to introduce UPS Premier, a new technology enabled healthcare shipping solution. We are adding next generation on package sensors and special tracking technology to provide pinpoint location information on each package.","In addition, we have a priority handling program for these shipments that further improves reliability. The sensor technologies and special handling plans provide a high-value solution for great visibility and special contingency actions for critical packages.","E-commerce and the rise of online marketplaces and platforms offers boundless opportunities for customers and for UPS. B2C and B2B sellers of all sizes benefit from the convenience of platforms to reach customers and manage their business. Through our digital access program, we're making it easier for SMBs to use UPS services by embedding our shipping solutions directly into the leading e-commerce platforms.","On these platforms, our customers are already hosting websites, managing orders, fulfillment and other tasks. For example, we just announced a new agreement with Stamps.com where UPS is presented as a preferred shipping partner to their more than 700,000 customers. We have a presence on many other platforms and have more to come. This strategy will enable UPS to increase our market share of high quality B2C and B2B e-commerce packages.","As you have seen in recent media coverage, UPS Flight Forward became the first company to receive full Part 135 Standard approval from the FAA to operate a commercial drone network. We are working to quickly scale and just announced a new healthcare campus delivery program at the University of Utah in partnership with Matternet. We will transport samples, specimens and other cargo via drone instead of using couriers. This new deployment is similar to our initial program launch that WakeMed in North Carolina.","In another Flight Forward development, we're also partnering with CVS Health to establish other drone delivery use cases involving deliveries to residential locations. Together, we will define and implement shipping solutions for urgent deliveries, including pharmaceutical or other CVS Health merchandise. These solutions leverage the speed and point-to-point delivery capabilities of our Flight Forward drone delivery network. This is an important expansion as CVS Health is the first retail partner for UPS Flight Forward's programs.","UPS is also working with AmerisourceBergen to utilize drones for delivery of pharmaceutical supplies on hospital campuses served by the company. We're pleased to help AmerisourceBergen develop improved operating efficiency and timeliness among other benefits realized by drone deliveries.","We have also begun a new program with Kaiser Permanente to develop drone delivery operations at several of their hospital campuses. Together we will identify solutions to improve patient outcomes and increase overall operational efficiency. We envision UPS drones offering innovative delivery solutions for many industries. Again, more to come. Through our investments, we're strengthening our core business as demonstrated by our operating results. These actions also further position us to accelerate performance.","Before I turn the call over to Jim to discuss peak, I want to make a few comments. This morning we announced that Jim Barber our Chief Operating Officer has decided to retire at the end of this year. Jim and his team will maintain our strong focus on several UPS transformation projects and will guide our peak efforts. He has served UPS for 35 years, and like many of our people he rose through the ranks to an important leadership position. He has made tremendous contributions during his many domestic and global assignments. I wish Jim a happy and healthy retirement.","And now I'll turn the call over to Jim.","Jim Barber","Thank you, David. UPS presented many exceptional opportunities that led to remarkable experiences over the course of these 35 years. I had made enduring relationships with many global customers and have enjoyed working with many exceptional UPS people who have become lifelong friends.","I've also had the great fortune to be involved with extraordinary philanthropic causes that make the world a better place. All these experiences have shaped who I am. I will be forever grateful to past and current UPS partners who guided me, worked alongside me and gave their best effort to expand and sustain this wonderful company. UPS has a great future ahead.","That being said, our focus is on putting our customers first, engaging our dedicated people and creating value for our shareholders. So that brings me to peak 2019 and our plan to handle another record holiday season with great service and great operating performance.","We are very confident that our plans will enable us to successfully execute peak again like last year. Our global strategy is focused in three key areas: implementation of the proven tools and best practices from last year; full utilization of our expanded network capacity and deeper collaboration with customers for joint development of daily volume expectations.","We expect another record peak season barring any unforeseen weather events. Retail sales are forecast to grow more than 5% and online holiday retail sales are likely to reach a new high. Our network operations are running extremely well with industry-leading on-time performance and excellent operating efficiency gains, giving us great momentum as we move into the holiday season.","We had a highly successful peak last year. It was well-planned and cleanly executed. We are building on that approach, but have even more assets to reinforce our confidence in dependable performance. Since last peak, we taken delivery of nine new aircraft with two more on the way in support of growing demand for our air services.","We will have added another nearly 5 million square feet of highly automated facilities, including another 400,000 pieces per hour of automated sort capacity. About two-thirds of that sort capacity is already online and operational compared to last year when almost all of our new capacity came online in the fourth quarter.","We also improved the Ground network, widening the reach of our Next Day Ground capabilities and speeding transit times in key lanes. And we expanded the use of technology providing our expert planning and operating teams with enhanced tools to improve execution and efficiency.","In addition, to help support the expected increase in package volume, we are adding about a 100,000 seasonal employees and have shortened their ramp-up time with enhanced global trading. We expect the holiday shipping season to start the week of Thanksgiving, then rise sharply during cyber week and remain heavy through Christmas.","We're also planning for heavy returns volume following cyber week and then again after Christmas through mid-January. Overall, during peak 2019, we expect a greater than 5% increase in daily global deliveries above last year. Plus, we estimate we will deliver more than 32 million packages per day around the world, an increase of more than 50% over our regular daily volume.","What's more, due to e-commerce structural changes, air volume continues to grow at near historic levels. And we expect demand to be strong during peak as Next Day delivery increasingly becomes the new standard for B2C and B2B e-commerce. Our preparations also include deeper collaboration with our customers.","Our joint forecasting process, which runs throughout peak helps us identify planned and unplanned daily Ground and Air volume. Then we align it with available network capacity for increased utilization and operating efficiency. It is a proven approach from 2018 that we know improves service to our customers and helps them take advantage of our network flexibility.","In summary, we are ready to deliver another successful peak season. Our smart global logistics network enabled by our advanced technology and run by talented UPSers worldwide is in top form. And we are fully committed to providing high quality service for all customers and delivering healthy financial returns to our shareowners.","Now I will turn it over to Richard to discuss our results.","Richard Peretz","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. UPS delivered solid performance in the quarter, reflecting significant progress on our initiatives. This morning I will review a summary of our third-quarter results and Brian will discuss our outlook.","For the company, operating profit grew more than 20% on 5% revenue increase. Operating margin expansion was substantial, up a 150 basis points. Our results are an indication that our strategy and investments are improving the fundamentals of the business, especially in the U.S. What's more, the strategic growth and cost management actions we are taking are helping to offset the headwinds from a weakening global economic environment and slower U.S industrial production.","Now let's turn and review each of the segments. We continue to see progress in the U.S with clear gains in the top and bottom line results, driven by our ability to adjust the network and anticipate changes in demand. Revenue increased nearly 10%. Both Next Day and Deferred grew by double digits and Ground revenue was up nearly 8%.","Total volume across all products grew more than 9%. Next Day volume jumped nearly 24% and Deferred was not far behind up more than 17%. Our growth in Air was diverse across multiple industries. Ground volume was strong, up nearly 7% led by retail and healthcare and mix is now just over 50% residential deliveries.","Reported yields were a bit softer, but were more than offset by a decrease in unit cost, which we will talk about in a moment. The declines in yield were due to a rapid adoption of faster delivery services by large e-commerce customers coupled with increased and lighter weight shipments with average weight per piece down about half a pound. Going forward, we expect yields to grow as our new SMB solutions pickup speed and have broader variety of customers and industries adopt this new standard.","Most importantly for the quarter, unit cost was down 2.5% driven by productivity gains, efficiency in our new automated building and benefits from other transformation initiatives. The combination of strong revenue and enhanced cost efficiency generated substantial bottom-line results this quarter. Operating profit was up nearly 26% and operating margin expanded 130 basis points. As you see, domestic is performing well and we expect momentum to carry us into peak and the upcoming quarters.","Looking at the International segment. International delivered good performance with operating profit increasing more than 20% to $693 million. We saw a lower-than-expected benefit from currency and the business felt the effects of the softness in the global economy, both of which were partly offset by gains on a property sale for approximately $40 million which was above what we\u2019ve anticipated.","To match changes in geographic demand, we frequently made changes and adjustments to the network and our localized strategy. As a result, total export volume was flat. Asia exports continue to grow to virtually all major non-U.S regions of the world and we grew exports within the European continent.","We continue to see volume weakness into and out of the U.K and on the Asia to U.S lane. And we had slight domestic growth overall with a number of countries increasing, including Mexico, France, Spain and notably the U.K. On a currency neutral basis, domestic revenue per piece increased 2.3% for exports, product and lane mix weighed on reported revenue per piece.","International operating margins expanded over 300 basis points this quarter. Our performance was driven by the combination of successful execution, continued structural changes in the network and our ability to target growth markets.","Now let's turn to look at supply chain and freight. The segment continue to adapt in a dynamic environment with disciplined cost control by targeting SMBs and with gains in a number of the business units. Putting it altogether, operating margins expanded on lower revenue and slightly lower profit. Comparisons are difficult to last year's third quarter. As a reminder, profit grew over 33% in 2018.","Ocean, air freight and truckload brokerage revenue were lower this quarter with gains coming from Marken and the logistics unit. Logistics increased revenue more than 7% and generated solid profit, led by customers in healthcare, retail and the manufacturing sectors. On the profit side, healthcare, LTL and logistics were bright spots with Marken and UPS Freight growing profits by double digits. Overall, UPS delivered good performance in the third quarter. Our investments to modernize our global network are improving our results and momentum will continue.","Well, that was the last time I will cover Results. What a good quarter to end on. I\u2019ve had an exciting and fulfilling Career here at UPS. It's surprising how quickly 38 years can go by. It's been an honor to represent the UPS team and this great company each quarter. The outlook for the company is bright.","And now I'll turn it over to Brian.","Brian Newman","Thank you, Richard, and good morning, everyone. I'm very grateful for the opportunity and excited about the growth prospects which UPS represents. I was fortunate to have gain broad experience with one global company and now I'm humbled to join UPS. I've been very impressed by the UPS team and I'm eager to meet our investors as I hit the road over the next few weeks.","Now I'll share the update on our cash position and outlook. One of the hallmarks of UPS is our ability to generate cash. Year-to-date UPS has generated $5.7 billion in cash from operations and adjusted free cash flow was $3.2 billion, which includes capital investments of about $4.5 billion.","Looking at capital expenditures, our projects are generating greater benefits than anticipated, plus, we\u2019ve made gains in deploying our capital more efficiently. Projects have been standardized and we continue to optimize procurement practices. As a result, we are lowering plan CapEx by about $500 million for 2019 and again in 2020, all while maintaining our network automation targets and other transformation goals. We are also raising our adjusted free cash flow target for 2019 to over $4 billion, predominantly driven by adjusted CapEx and working capital efficiencies.","Now let's turn to shareholder returns. So far this year, UPS distributed more than $2.5 billion in dividends, which represents a 5.5% increase on a per share basis over the same period last year and we repurchased 7 million shares for $753 million.","Moving to tax. Our effective tax rate for the quarter came in just under 21%. As Richard discussed on the second quarter call, there were anticipated one-time benefits in the third quarter. Accordingly, we anticipate our fourth quarter and full-year tax rate will be between 22% and 23%.","Turning to guidance. 2019 is a year of significant progress across the segments. Transformation investments are becoming much more visible in our performance and we expect this momentum to carry forward. Looking at the fourth quarter across all the segments, we expect the U.S consumer to remain strong and the structural shift for faster e-commerce delivery to drive elevated demand for our services, offsetting the current slowdown in U.S industrial production.","This year we added more capacity to the network. All 400,000 pieces per hour of new capacity will be ready ahead of peak. As a result of our positive growth and efficiency factors, we expect strong operating profit improvement and margins to expand on a year-over-year basis.","In the International segment, we continue to make network adjustments to optimize asset utilization and efficiency. In addition, we will further grow in targeted trade lanes and within the international domestic markets. And so we expect International operating profit to continue to grow.","Turning to supply chain and freight. We expect double-digit operating profit growth. Gains in logistics, healthcare and UPS freight were more than offset market headwinds in forwarding and truckload brokerage. Also of note, last year we had a drag on profit driven from the UPS freight contract ratification process. On the whole, we have confidence in all of the factors within our control and we expect to be well within our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $7.45 to $7.75.","Despite weakening macro conditions throughout the year, we\u2019ve maintained our initial guidance range. Our strategy and network investments are generating positive returns as evident in our profit margin gains. However, our guidance is based on the continuation of current conditions, should external conditions deteriorate, our outlook could be negatively affected, yet remain within the range.","I'd like to close by echoing Jim's comments. We are fully prepared to deliver a successful peak season with healthy returns for our shareholders and great service for our customers.","Now, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","I will now turn the program back over to IRO Mr. Scott Childress to start our Q&A segment. Please go ahead, sir.","Scott Childress","Thank you, Steven. Couple of reminders. Please only one question per person, so we may allow as many as possible to participate. And during the call, Richard will take questions on the actual results and Brian will take questions on our outlook.","Our first question comes from Chris Wetherbee of Citi. With the efficiencies from transformation and the benefits from the SMB initiatives, do you think that cost per piece can move lower in the future?","David Abney","Hey, Chris. This is David. Thanks for the question. And we do believe that the costs will continue to be lower than last year. And it's our growth and cost initiatives are gaining momentum. It's a combination of our strategies, of our investments; of course, our automation. Our execution has been very good especially this past quarter. Our transformation initiatives and the structural changes that we're seeing with Next Day Air. Positive operating leverage two quarters in a row, but this quarter just very strong positive operating leverage. Our cost per unit was down 2.5%. You have to go back a long, long way to see that kind of performance. And U.S. operating profit was up nearly 26% and our operating margin expanded 130 basis points. So very successful third quarter. We have momentum. We expect it will continue and we do believe that we will continue to have lower costs than the previous year. Thanks for the question.","Scott Childress","Our next online question will come from Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. How is the UPS network positioned to benefit from the structural shift in both short zone and next day?","Kate Gutmann","Thanks, Allison. UPS is positioned very well. We continue to gain the benefits from the structural change in the market and we've seen increased demand for faster e-commerce and UPS delivering positive operating leverage. Air grew double-digits with Next Day Air nearly at 24% and Deferred at 17%. And we also see Air growth in e-commerce as well as broadly in healthcare, high-tech and throughout small and medium-sized businesses as well. The structure change also means faster shorter zone Ground. And we have had strong Ground growth at nearly 7%, fueled by our solutions like our leading Next Day Extended Ground Service, which is enabled by the flexibility and power of our network which Juan will talk to you.","Juan Perez","Thanks, Kate and thanks, Allison for the question. We continue to work very actively on building our smart logistics network. And I will tell you that the UPS network is really well positioned to accept multiple changes in the market as we continue to see them. That comes as a result of a number of investments we've made. You\u2019ve heard Jim and David talk about some of those investments, but they all come together in the smart logistics network. Additional automation in our network, that's definitely paying off and we\u2019ve additional plans to continue to enhance our automation moving forward. Capacity in our facilities is providing unprecedented flexibility to the UPS network. We expect that to continue to be the case. Investments in technology to improve efficiency definitely the case and we\u2019re not stopping there, we continue to make investments in advanced technologies that are going to continue to make the network more flexible, more capable. So we're excited as to where we are today and where we\u2019re going in the future in adding capabilities to support the business.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Mr. Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Please go ahead.","Tom Wadewitz","Yes, good morning and congratulations on the strong results, particularly that domestic program seems very good in international margin. And just wanted to say congratulations also to Jim and Richard. You guys have had a great run at the company and look forward to working with you Brian. So I guess on the domestic package improvement story, it seems like you\u2019re early on in that. You had first quarter a pretty substantial gain in domestic margin. How do you think about that going into 2020 with the kind of soft industrial with a lot of momentum in your retail. Is it reasonable to think that you\u2019re early on in domestic package margin improvements and a lot of momentum going into next year? Or should we be somewhat cautious given the soft macro backdrop? Thank you.","Jim Barber","Hey, Tom, I\u2019m going to start and then Brian is going to take us into 2020 a bit. Look, I think that as we talked about, this was a pivot year for UPS and we continue to pickup pace. The most recent quarter we really have about five or six levers that are coming together here to look at to bring us to what David talked about in the opening comments and in his first question and that's the leverage that we got. You got transformation, that\u2019s a tailwind. You have procurement, that\u2019s a tailwind. The extra capacity that we\u2019ve talked about, the automation that we\u2019ve talked about, you got operational execution. Our operators are executing at a very, very high level. And then the last point, I think we continue to talk about the power of the integrated network and we're able to put the Air and the Ground and the International to at the same time at these high rates that produces what you see on this piece of paper. So it's been a great quarter for us and Brian will talk about the future for a second.","Brian Newman","Yes. Thanks, Jim, and thanks Tom for the question. So Q3, as Jim mentioned, we saw a nice pop of a 130 bps, so it was a good margin expansion. We are looking for good margins in the fourth quarter. But as we look out to 2020, what we are really focused on is the relationship between the revenue per piece and the cost per piece and making sure we drive that leverage. So we will come back to you and talk more about operating margin expectations in the -- on the January call, Tom. Thanks.","Operator","Question from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead.","David Vernon","It looks like things are just starting to turn here. You are starting to get the leverage we want. And I don't want to sound too indelicate or anything, but like why -- could you talk a little bit about the thought process about why now is the right time to maybe step down? And then, David, could you talk a little bit about kind of what\u2019s your plan is from a management standpoint and a succession standpoint as we\u2019re making some changes at the C level to make sure that the momentum we have here and some of the investment programs is going to continue into 2020 and beyond?","David Abney","This is David. We are very excited about the progress that we have made and we are going to continue to make in the U.S. I think well-deserved recognition. It was due to the transformation initiatives and due to the investments that we have made and those are going to continue. I think we've done an excellent job with our management team. We've got a blend of people, the long-term UPSers like Rich and Jim and then we also have brought in some very good people from the outside. I see that continuing. We have a strong bench and succession planning is something that that we constantly focus on. And this is a natural progression. We have many people that spend their entire years careers at UPS and we appreciate that. And then we have others that are ready to step in and so we're excited about those opportunities too. So feel good about where we are. We have the team that will handle and that will bring transformation initiatives all the way through. I\u2019m as confident as I can be about that. Thanks David for the question.","Scott Childress","Our next question is an online question. There is -- from multiple analysts. Can you provide an update and some color around your CapEx guidance?","Brian Newman","So thanks, Scott. Look, UPS has been a good steward of capital. And if you look at the returns from an ROIC perspective, we're roughly double the industry average. We lowered our CapEx guidance as you saw by $500 million this year and a similar amount next year. And that offer 3 points in terms of reflection. One is the reduction is due largely to efficiency gains in buildings across the network and procurement standardization. Second, the change does not affect our transformation or capacity initiatives. And then lastly, the CapEx reduction has enabled us to actually raise our adjusted free cash flow to north of $4 billion for 2019.","David Abney","An important thing here is we're just getting more done with less and this is what transformation was intended to do. And we're very happy to see that take place.","Operator","Next question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Ken Hoexter","Hey good morning. And Jim and Richard, thank you for all your help over the years and Brian welcome. Just maybe, David, talk about the deceleration in the Next Day Air. Last year you or last quarter you are up about -- oh no, I\u2019m sorry, last year you are up about a 100,000 packages sequentially. This year up 35,000, so I\u2019m wondering if is this Amazon taking some of the share back? Is it a deceleration in the underlying growth and maybe that transitions to your multiple comments on if the economy decelerates or deteriorate? Is that something you\u2019re already seeing, given the multitude of your commentary on that?","David Abney","When it comes to -- and we will talk about the Air business first. And what we're seeing is an acceleration and it is not due to the economy, although the U.S economy is consumer driven and it is providing a lot of opportunities. But when you look at this quarter, we have taken flight to success, that\u2019s why I\u2019m so sure because our Next Day Air volume is up 24%, our second day of Deferred is up 17%. And it's a structural change and then it's more than just one customer. And Kate would you like to talk a little bit about other customers?","Kate Gutmann","Yes, absolutely. We are excited because we\u2019ve seen it in e-commerce and across all segments in e-commerce, customers of all size. But that\u2019s Air growth, so the speeding is definitely occurring whether it would be two to one or Ground to the Air mode. And then we\u2019re also seeing that ground short zone. So this structure change is resonating and we\u2019re seeing the benefit to operating leverage.","Ken Hoexter","I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not thinking -- I don't think you answered the -- I guess, I\u2019m seeing a deceleration in growth from sequential. Is that not kind of pointing towards the economy or a customer shifting in volumes, just from 2Q to 3Q?","Richard Peretz","No, I think -- this is Richard. Obviously, you have to -- and we actually called it out during the second quarter. There are different seasonalities in average volume per day impacts and we actually called out that during the second quarter, especially earlier in the quarter, your volume levels aren't the same as they are in the third quarter. And so we took advantage where we thought it was appropriate, getting the right return as you see in the bottom line results. But there's going to be seasonality and opportunities from a -- just a level of business, based on how each quarter operates across the entire -- the U.S., there's just more business activity, say in the fourth quarter than the first and more in the third than in the second. So the [multiple speakers] \u2026","Ken Hoexter","Got it. Thank you.","Richard Peretz","\u2026 already there.","Ken Hoexter","Okay. Thanks, Rich.","Scott Childress","Our next question comes from Brian Ossenbeck at J.P. Morgan. What are some of the services and partnerships contemplated under the new Digital Access program?","Kate Gutmann","Thank you. This is Kate. We are excited about the Digital Access program. It's a continuation of our small and medium-sized business, strategic imperative and the investments we've been making. So just to crystallize the thought, we are investing to ensure that we enable UPS solutions and integrate them for easy shipping wherever our small and medium-sized business sellers and go to sell as well as where consumers go to shop. And we have already integrated with anything of meaningful size with marketplaces and platforms and excited about the most recent announcement on Stamps.com. Just to put it into more quantified format, with Stamps and Shopify alone, we are actually reaching over 1 million small and medium-sized businesses and there is more to come. We continue this partnership strategy. Scott, did you want to lend a \u2026?","Scott Price","I think just the core investments that we've made to the transformation program. Some of the areas are improved timing trends at the announcement of our 7-day network, and of course the expansion of our Access Point. So all of these solutions hold nicely on those transformation investments improving in our core.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Scott Group","Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Can you clarify, just because I haven't heard it, can you clarify what the actual CapEx guidance is for this year and next year? And then on the U.S. margin side, I know we are not guiding to 2020 margins yet, but do you have maybe some longer term thoughts on where you think U.S. margins can go, once we get through sort of the full few years of transformation?","Scott Childress","Scott, we are going to take one of those questions. So, please make sure it's only a single question per ...","Brian Newman","So from -- its Brian. From a CapEx perspective, we had guided for this year and next to be 8.5% to 10% in terms of sales -- in terms of revenue -- CapEx as a percentage of rev. So within that guidance, what we -- if you take it from the midpoint, we were guiding down $500 million in 2019 and a similar amount in 2020.","Scott Group","Thank you.","Scott Childress","Our next online question comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. In International Package, can you offer some perspectives on the trend that you're seeing in the services and across the globe?","Jim Barber","Scott, it's Jim. So couple of things that we are talking about. First of all, you've heard from everybody on the call about some of the changing trade dynamics. It certainly effect, if you want to call the premium versus non-premium. We see it all as a premium service offering. And I think from an export perspective and Richard talked about it, you've got a lot of lanes growing across this world. There's a couple of power lanes that are slowing down, and when that happens, we got to adjust. You also heard, we will lean into domestic, where our ground networks have great capabilities and then we backstop that with an operating leverage state of mind, when all three business units in this kind of dynamic are able to create operating leverage. And we do that, and we continue forward and grow the business with some of the factors that we're talking about here. So we are pretty proud of it. It will grow again, and we will continue. If you look at our historic rates over the last 2, 5 and 10 years, we are proud of the premium and it will continue to grow in the future, as trade dynamics allow it. So appreciate the question.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Allison Landry. Please go ahead.","Allison Landry","Good morning. Thanks. So last quarter you talked a little bit about leveraging the U.S. post office. I was wondering if you could provide an update on that, and where you see those trends going? How much capacity you think that could free up in your network? Thank you.","David Abney","Thanks for the question. This is David. And, yes, there's couple of instances that I can talk about. First is from a weekend delivery, we've talked about it, one of our options will be using SurePost and on enhanced Saturday and also on Sunday. So we see good indications there. We also see opportunities, when you talk -- and this combines with another question that we received from the web, is the fact that the UPU and the changes that have been made there and how that of folks the Postal Service now, it affects us. And obviously, we applaud the administration for their efforts to modernize the UPUs terminal dues as a structure. What it does, is it raises the floor and it opens opportunities for American SMBs to grow, and of course that falls right into our worldwide economy expansion in our SMB initiatives. So we do have a unique relationship to Postal Service. We are a supplier. They are a supplier and we are competitors at the same time. We do believe there is ways that we can leverage their network for a lot of small delivery, at the same time, add additional capabilities to our own. Thank you.","Scott Childress","Our next online question is coming from Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Can you provide an update on your hub automation initiatives? Will you reach 80% of eligible volume in 2019?","Juan Perez","Yes. Thanks, Chris, for that question. We definitely continue to work to work very actively on our automation and facility modernization efforts. By the end of 2019, we are definitely on track to be right below 80% of our U.S. ground eligible volume to be processed through automation, and the plans are for 2020 to get to 85%. So we continue to be on track with that. As you heard earlier, we -- this year we have 20 new retrofit automated facilities going online, and above and beyond that by the way, we're also putting on -- we're almost done with all of them now, about seven additional automated small sorts across the facility. Each and every one of those keeps adding overall processing capacity to the network. And it goes back to the question that was asked earlier, all these automation keeps adding network flexibility, to provide all these different types of services and capabilities to our customers. So we are well on track to hit our targets, and we definitely have the commitment of the organization to continue to make the right investments to get there. Thank you.","Operator","We will now take a live question from the line of Mr. Chris Wetherbee as well of Citi. Please go ahead.","Chris Wetherbee","Hey, thanks and good morning. I wanted to ask about some of the comments you've made earlier in the year about double-digit growth and the operating profit of all the segments. Is there still targets -- are those targets still good as we think about sort of last quarter of the year? And if they have changed a little bit, can you talk a little bit about the factors that might have impacted them? Thank you.","Richard Peretz","This is Richard. And I will start the question and then Jim will talk about the businesses. But overall, we expect the total enterprise to have operating profit growth in the double digits. At this point, each of the business units have plans in place that was set at the beginning of the year. And you saw what we've done in the last quarter, in the international and the domestic and we expect the momentum to continue. And in the supply chain, we also, as we called out during my talk, that there were some year-over-year comps that's going to continue to show good improvement in operating profit.","Jim Barber","So it's Jim. I would just -- I say, agree with that. I mean, obviously, you've seen the quarter now. We've got one quarter to go. You've seen what we reaffirmed today, and then ultimately it's a situation -- it is a little bit of a different year than when we started, no question about that. But the double digit is clearly still in sight, and then we move on to 2020. So it's about all the factors. And this operating leverage is real key for us to be able to make it in all three business units, and that's what we plan to produce in peak. So appreciate it.","Scott Childress","We've got another online question here. It's from multiple analysts. Can you give some color around your global procurement that you highlighted? And please discuss if -- how that's filling out into the transformation initiatives that you discussed at the conference?","Brian Newman","So I will take the first part of that and then kick it over to Scott from a transformation perspective. We spend roughly $25 billion a year in global procurement, and we're going through multiple waves of the coverage negotiations. We are seeing benefits, as evidenced in the margin expansion and we are continuing to see big pushes in DSO and DPO. So Scott, do you want to hit the transformation side?","Scott Price","Yes. We launched the procurement capability and grew out, basically category by category. We are now fully implemented and I think you see the result of that not only in terms of the operating expense that is covered and the ability to support the lower reduced cost per piece in the U.S., but also the announcement that -- our ability in CapEx to be able to overall operate more efficiently and continue to do 100% of our transformation programs with less CapEx.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Jack Atkins of Stephens. Please go ahead.","Jack Atkins","Good morning and thank you for taking my question. I guess just to go back to the macro for a moment, just to ask the question directly; but David or Jim, are you seeing anything in your business or leading indicators within your business that make you more or less concerned about the direction of the U.S. or global economy. Just any thoughts there I think would be very helpful, just given your role in the global supply chain. Thanks.","David Abney","Okay. This is David and I will certainly talk about it. The global economy remains in growth mode, it's just at a slower pace. And risks are more acute and global industrial production has lowered and we are watching closely to see these trade developments. At the same time, though, that we see the softness, we continue to gain and execute our opportunities as is evidenced by our international results and our domestic results. It's the flexibility of our strategy in our network. A good example of that is we have one of our new large aircraft, 747-8 that was scheduled to operate from China to the U.S. We looked at changing trade flows. We moved it from China to Europe and those are the kinds of proactive steps that we will take. We also have to realize, there are some rays of sunshine that are coming across the horizon. If you compare what we're seeing about Brexit now to the last quarter, the fact that there has been some negotiations between Ireland and the U.K. in between the U.K. and the E.U., it's still to unfold, but we will see this Phase 1 negotiations between the U.S. and China. There are some rays of sunshine there too that we're looking at much more to be developed. The important thing is, regardless of those macroeconomic conditions, we have the flexibility and the agility of our network to meet our customers' needs and we are confident we will continue to do so. Thank you for the question.","Scott Childress","We are going to take a online question from Tom Wadewitz of UBS. How does your expanded drone delivery capabilities fit into the strategies that you've got for growth?","Jim Barber","As David mentioned in his introduction, we are the first to receive the FAA Part 135. We are the first and still only fully certified drone airline in the United States. We actually begin investing in drones several years ago, since our very first residential trial flight actually in February of 2017. We are moving fast. We are quickly scaling, building on the WakeMed program we have announced yesterday, University of Utah, a similar campus. But we see greater opportunity beyond that. We've announced then three partnerships, CVS, Kaiser Permanente and AmerisourceBergen. In partnership with those companies, we are looking for new services and solutions. We are very excited about the opportunity and we see much more to come in this area as we progress. Thank you.","David Abney","Yes. This Flight Forward and this drone strategy, this is just indicative of our transformation initiatives that we are going to charge forward with new technologies, and we are not taking a backseat to anyone. We've made that clear from the start. But the fact that we've already made 1,500 commercial flights, we're doing it on a day-in, day-out basis and you\u2019re going to continue to hear much, much more from us. So really want to commend Scott and his team. But this is UPS embracing the future and we are very excited about it.","Operator","We will take a question from the line of Jack Atkins of Stephens. Please go ahead. Mr. Atkins, your line is open.","Jack Atkins","I'm sorry, my questions have been asked and answered. Thank you.","Operator","We will move on to the line of Mr. Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks. Good morning and congratulations, Jim, and Richard, and Brian. David or Jim, we've -- it seemingly in for peak season, a condensed calendar, a much shorter period between Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve. Just wondering if you could discuss, how you feel you're prepared to face that challenge heading into this year, and what you've learned from years past and how you are prepared for this condensed calendar? Thanks.","David Abney","Yes, I would like to talk about it. Got a lot of momentum going into peak. It is a shorter peak season, there is no doubt about it. But that didn't just happen over the last few weeks, right? I mean we've known that for years, and so, the capacity that we've added for the past couple of years, we've added 5 million square feet. We've added 400,000 packages an hour capacity over the last two years. And whether it's Jim or Juan, we can talk a little bit more about the peak network in just a second. But the fact that we have buildings in place, we have the plans to hire the people and the fact that we've got momentum, we feel really good about that.","Juan Perez","Yes. And thank you, David. Another couple of points here. We continue to refine our delivery models to improve our overall capacity. This year we will be using an extended -- more impactful personal vehicle driver model across the network, that will add capacity for delivery. In addition to that, the investments we continue to make on technology, like Orion navigation, will make a significant impact in the way that we are going to manage delivery capacity this year because that type of technology just adds additional efficiencies to the way that we complete our deliveries. So to David's point, capacity in our facilities combined with capacity on the delivery side, puts us in a really good position to execute well.","Scott Childress","We are going to take a online question. This question comes from Amit over at Deutsche Bank. He wants to ask about UPS' relationship with Amazon, and the company's ability to lean into Amazon volume?","David Abney","Yes, this is David. I would say that years ago, we made a decision to lean into e-commerce, and there is no doubt about that. And at that time that I think others were considering or had other plans. When we say lean, we are talking about across the e-commerce ecosystem. So it is small and mid-sized businesses, it's other e-tailers and retailers and that includes Amazon. But it is not specific to any one company. When it comes to dealing with large customers that have a lot of volume and that they do some in-sourcing themselves, is really how you negotiate the deal and how you structure the contract, and how you set your pricing that you can help influence the behavior that you want to drive. But the real key to e-commerce, and you can see it in our innovative solutions that we just rolled out, with the Digital Access program and the way we are expanding worldwide economy, is helping small and mid-sized companies worldwide compete with the big retailers and e-tailers. And that is the key to our success. And thus what we are driven to lean into, more than in any other areas. So, e-commerce is here to stay. We've embraced it. We've got a head start and we will continue it. So thank you for the question.","Operator","We will take a question from the line of Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Amit Mehrotra","Hey, thanks operator. Hi, everybody. I just wanted to understand the year-on-year improvement in domestic margins? Some of that, I would imagine, just reflects the operational penalties you had last year, reflecting the facility build out. So just what domestic margins have expanded, excluding some of those one-time related costs last year, and just given that dynamic, would we expect the pace of -- excuse me, year-on-year expansion to maybe moderate next year because you don't have those tailwinds from the operational penalties?","Richard Peretz","Yes, so this is Richard. And I think the first thing to remind you is, this year and last year we opened up, as David said, 5 million square feet in each year. So the operating penalties for this year in 2019 is about the same as they were in 2018. So the margin improvement was directly related to better efficiency gains in the new buildings as well as opening those buildings earlier, which we called out in the first quarter, that we would have so much of an opening in the second and third quarter, and Jim mentioned, almost two-thirds of it is open as of today. Last year was the end of the year. That's part of it. Part of it is the improvement in the productivity and the operation execution in the U.S. business. And, that's inherent in the numbers. Earlier, someone asked about fourth quarter costs and we said we would continue to see improvement. But you have to remember, the percentage improvement differs by seasonality. It differs by things that are happening inside the business, because we also are seeing a different kind of packages and we're growing more e-commerce and slightly less industrial because of what the macro is doing. But most importantly, it's all fall into the bottom line and we expect that to continue.","Jim Barber","Let me add one thing to it. I think it hasn't come up as much as I think it's important, is that we talked about the structural change in the Air network. David talked about some of the aircraft. Remember, the whole strategy is to bump and roll bigger aircraft back through the network. We've brought big aircraft back to the U.S. to help us handle this. And the real fact is that, this record Air volume we are handling in this integrated network is being put away beautifully, and that's the secret to the margins, is when they run together like they are, and the operators take care of it and Worldport does a great job, the margins come. So that's where we kind of see the whole thing coming together getting ready for peak.","Scott Childress","We are going to take one more online question. This question comes from Ben Hartford of RW Baird. Your SMB products are making progress, but yields continue to move lower. Can you give us some color around the mix in those yield headwinds?","Kate Gutmann","Yes, absolutely This is Kate. Thanks, Ben. I will separate the two a bit. SMB, we are seeing solid momentum you're -- you've heard of the innovative solutions, My Choice for Business, early traction. Every day hundreds of enrollments and just as a point 40% increase month over month, two months in and on track. So our solutions are resonating with SMB. Then separately tied to the yield question, do note that with the structure change that's occurring in the market, we are seeing a lighter weight product, as many SKUs are being added to the shorter zone and also next day type delivery, whether on -- in the air or on the ground. But as I noted before, air growth is occurring broadly and across our small and medium-sized businesses, healthcare, hi-tech and operating leverage is the answer that Jim just noted, that is the score at the end of the game, and that's what we posted.","Operator","We have a question from the line of David Ross of Stifel. Please go ahead.","David Ross","Yes. Thank you for squeezing me in before Jack Atkins again. Got a question on -- a comment you made that I found interesting that Next Day is becoming the new standard for B2B and B2C. We've heard mostly about the next day growth in the B2C world. How much of that 24% year-over-year growth in the quarter do you think came from B2C versus B2B and any other color on the B2B growth in Next Day?","Kate Gutmann","So thanks so much. This is Kate. I will take the question. I will start first of all, with our B2B growth overall 3.4% and that's despite some of the economic slowdown with industrial production. So we do see solid air growth in hi-tech and healthcare and some of the examples would be distribution to hospitals and in e-commerce. Also there is a returns component that is B2B. The returns don't tend to be in the air, but on the healthcare and hi-tech side, we are seeing B2B growth and our solutions continue to enable our customers to move faster and it's resonating.","David Abney","What gets lost in the mix is many of our large B2C shippers are also B2B shippers, and so that's having a big effect there. But this trend is not just to the end consumer, I mean it is absolutely B2B at the same time. We just probably don't talk about it this much.","Operator","I will now turn our conference back over to Mr. Childress. Please go ahead, sir.","Scott Childress","Thank you very much, Stephen. And David, closing comments?","David Abney","I will. UPS is making significant progress, as you've heard in executing our strategies, especially in the U.S. And would like to call out, George Willis, the President of our U.S. operations, and his team as they have worked with Jim and the rest of the management committee and have really implemented these initiatives that we have asked them to do. These transformation initiatives have turned our results around improving efficiency and they are enabling these new innovative solutions that we've covered the last couple of earnings calls and they are just going to continue to be an important part of the future. We see growth opportunities regardless of the environment around us, in both in the U.S. and internationally. And in summary, we expect another successful peak season for our customers and our shareholders and we will continue to accelerate initiatives to move forward fast and just do it at an ever faster pace, and thank you for joining us today.

My name is Steven, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise, and after the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer period. Please note we will take only one question from each participant to accommodate more analysts during the call. Thank you for your cooperation.","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Joe Wilkins, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.","Joe Wilkins - Investor Relations Officer","Good morning, and welcome to the UPS second quarter 2015 earnings call. Joining me today are David Abney, our CEO; Richard Peretz, our CFO; along with International President, Jim Barber; President of U.S. Operations, Myron Gray; and Chief Commercial Officer, Alan Gershenhorn.","Before we begin, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2014 Form 10-K and 2015 10-Qs. These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the Securities and Exchange Commission.","As a reminder, in the second quarter last year UPS completed the transfer of post-retirement liabilities for certain Teamster employees to defined contribution Healthcare plans. As a result, the company recorded an after-tax charge of $665 million, reducing second quarter 2014 diluted earnings per share by $0.72. In our remarks today, all quarterly and full-year comments and comparisons will refer to 2014 adjusted results. In addition, we will discuss UPS' free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure.","The webcast of today's call along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures are available on the UPS Investor Relations website. And just as a reminder, please ask only one question, so that we may allow as many as possible to participate. Thanks for your cooperation.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to David.","David P. Abney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone and welcome. We're pleased to share results of another solid quarter and I want to thank the UPS team for their efforts. This is the second consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth, which demonstrates we are successfully executing and generating improved performance.","UPS grew operating profits and expanded margins across all three segments. In the U.S., we remain focused on growing the business, effective revenue management and delivering operational improvements. Although, the economy slowed somewhat we made progress on executing our plan.","Our International segment continues to have positive momentum with our operating profit, up more than 17% primarily led by strong results in Europe. Our ongoing investments and integrated operating model are driving increased customer demand around the world.","Our Supply Chain & Freight segment also had a solid increase in operating profit. The result was led by Forwarding as it continues to pursue a disciplined pricing strategy across key trade lanes. Clearly, we're making good progress this year. We're highly focused on executing our strategy to create unmatched value for UPS customers and UPS shareholders. We will accomplish this by continuing to build on the strategies guiding our business. They are: expanding our network capacity; improving operational efficiency; focusing on high-growth markets; and delivering industry-specific solutions.","In the area of expanded network capacity, we made key announcements during the quarter. In Germany, we doubled the capacity of the UPS hub in Nuremberg. This automated facility is ideally situated to link Eastern and Western European trade lanes.","We announced an expansion of UPS Worldwide Express Freight service, adding five emerging markets in Latin America and three in Europe. This guaranteed services designed for urgent, high-value and heavyweight international shipments.","In another high-growth market, UPS implemented several enhancements throughout Asia to improve service coverage and network speed. The moves accelerated intra-Asia transit times by up to one full day connecting 41 key markets. These improvements will position UPS to further capitalize on the fast-growing intra-Asia marketplace.","We continued to make good progress expanding UPS industry-specific solutions. To broaden our global Healthcare network, we announced two new facilities in the Netherlands. These new sites add capacity and simplify customer access to our global distribution network.","We also opened an automated distribution facility for Pratt & Whitney in New Hampshire. This facility is a great example of how we collaborate with Aerospace companies by offering specialized solutions that provide them with competitive advantages, while these investments help UPS grow strategic acquisitions, speed the implementation of new capabilities across our global network.","In fact, UPS Capital recently acquired two specialized high-value logistics companies, Parcel Pro and IPS. They enhance our global small package network for secure shipment and insurance solutions for high-value goods in Europe, Asia and the U.S.","Another great example of acquiring capabilities in one region and implementing them globally is our purchase of Kiala, which we have referenced in the past. We've refined and improved this unique e-commerce delivery solution and launched it globally as the UPS Access Point.","In the U.S., we had very positive results in five initial markets. Today, I'm excited to announce we are accelerating the rollout of this delivery option to more than 100 U.S. cities. By year-end, we'll have more than 8,000 locations in the U.S. and more than 22,000 globally.","The UPS Access Points location provide a convenient and secure alternative to home delivery in order to enhance the e-commerce delivery experience for consumers. This is an important part of our strategy to offer unique customer solutions and improve e-commerce profitability.","Before I turn it over to Richard, I would like to applaud the passage of the U.S. Trade Promotion Authority bill. TPA will help facilitate trade agreements that provide growth opportunities for UPS and our customers. We all know that trade is vital to the U.S. economy, supporting global growth and spurring job creation.","I understand the negotiators are making headway on the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement. We urge them to resolve final outstanding differences and for the U.S. Congress to approve the agreement. We also encourage negotiators to make progress on TTIP, another critical agreement that will enable international trade.","To summarize, I'm pleased to say that we're on track with our earnings growth and pace of investment. Based on our recent performance, we fully expect to attain the higher end of our guidance range. Our progress to-date, especially in the International segment, makes us confident in our strategic direction and four-year plan.","Richard will now take you through the details.","Richard N. Peretz - CFO, Treasurer, Vice President & Controller","Thanks, David, and good morning. I'm glad you could all join us this morning. It's great to speak with you on my first official earnings call.","I've had the opportunity to meet many of you, the analysts and investors, who know our company so well. Those meetings gave me a better appreciation for the market perspective on UPS as an investment. I heard the importance of execution in the current business model as well is looking for future opportunities to grow this business and create value. Your open and honest feedback is appreciated by me and it will be useful as we move this great company forward.","Now, let's turn to the second quarter results. UPS delivered better-than-expected results. The International continues to show strong momentum with key initiatives around the world contributing to our success, especially in Europe.","The U.S. Domestic business is on track with its revenue management and efficiency gains; however, we are seeing some softening in the economy. Our Supply Chain & Freight results were lifted by improvements in the Forwarding unit. Market pricing and customer mix drove better-than-expected results. Together the segments produced earnings per share growth of 12%.","Turning our attention more specifically to the U.S. Domestic segment, where operating profits increased to $1.2 billion. The operating margin expanded to 13.6% as a result of the pricing initiatives and productivity improvements from technology implementations such as ORION that we've talked about in the past.","Packages per day were up 1.8%, driven by a 15% increase in Deferred Air products and UPS SurePost growth of over 8%. On the other hand, total average daily volume comparisons were lowered by 50 basis points versus last year due to a second quarter benefit in 2014 for a large catalog shipment.","This year, UPS experienced balanced commercial and residential growth. The pace of B2C expansion continued slowing, while B2B gains were due to omni-channel and return services in the retail sector.","Reported yields were flat with last year as solid base rate increases were offset by the product mix changes and more importantly, about a 300 basis point decline in fuel surcharge revenues.","Turning to International, and this is where the segment set a new high in second quarter operating profit, our profit rising more than 17%. Our results are due to a balanced approach, a balance of export shipment growth, network efficiency gains and a strong focus on revenue management initiatives. These areas also drove significant expansion of our operating margin, but keep in mind, it was magnified by the weakening of the non-U.S. currencies.","Looking at the top line in this segment, International revenue adjusted for currency increased 1.5% over the prior year. I've received a lot of positive feedback on the transparency of the new currency schedules we added last quarter. We kept the schedules that showed the impact of currency changes on our reported revenue.","Revenue management initiatives have boosted base rates across the globe. However, there is about a 350 basis point headwind due to lower fuel surcharges in 2015. Looking at yields, there is some impact on shift of products as reported revenue per piece on a currency adjusted basis decreased 2.4%. Although the biggest impact to reported yields is due to fuel surcharges, if we factor out fuel, revenue per piece was slightly positive.","The International success is due to robust export volume growth that remains strong at 5.5% growth driven by an intra-Europe shipment growth of over 8.5%. The strength of the U.S. dollar contributed to greater U.S. import shipments primarily from Europe, while exports out of the U.S. were down slightly as the dollar increased in value.","Looking at the Supply Chain & Freight segment, operating profit jumped 18% to $207 million and margins expanded to over 9%, driven primarily by the improvements in the Forwarding unit. The Forwarding unit is executing a disciplined revenue management strategy focused on profitable trade lane growth.","As a result, revenue declined as certain lower yielding contracts were not renewed. Market conditions in the International Air Freight business allowed the unit to capitalize as buy rates dropped quickly, providing improved pricing spreads during the quarter. Operating profit increased and margin expanded to high-single digits.","The distribution unit continues to expand its industry-specific solutions in order to win more and win faster, opening new facilities around the world like the ones David mentioned earlier. Revenue growth was led by Mail Services, Healthcare and Aerospace gains.","UPS Freight revenue declined 2.5%, primarily due to lower fuel surcharges and a drop in the LTL tonnage. Pricing discipline in the unit was evident as we saw LTL revenue per hundredweight increase 1.4%.","Now let's turn and talk about our cash position. For the six months ended June 30, UPS generated $3.3 billion of free cash flow, after reinvesting in the business with capital expenditures of about $1 billion. In terms of shareholder distributions so far this year, UPS has paid $1.3 billion in dividends, an increase of 9% per share. We've also repurchased more than 13.5 million shares for just under $1.4 billion. Note that our second quarter tax rate decreased to 34.5%, primarily due to a one-time tax credit.","Now let's turn and discuss our guidance for the rest of the year. Total company first-half results came in a little better than anticipated, primarily due to the improved International performance. As we previously guided, third-quarter earnings per share is expected to be up modestly due to tough comparisons with the same period last year. Earnings per share growth in the fourth quarter should be slightly above our guidance range.","Now let's turn and talk about the individual units. In the U.S., we expect Domestic volume to increase between 2% and 3%, as a result of the slowing pace of growth in the economy. Revenue should grow at a slightly faster pace as base rate pricing remains strong. However, lower fuel surcharges will continue to weigh on the reported yields.","U.S. Domestic operating profit in the third quarter should be flat with last year. It's due to the tough comparisons created by lower workers' compensation cost in 2014. Fourth quarter operating profit is anticipated to grow in the low-double digits. Full-year operating guidance remains unchanged at 5% to 9%.","In the International segment, we expect to see positive momentum continue in the second half of the year with operating profits at the high end of our 6% to 12% range. Revenue growth in International will continue to be challenged by currency changes and lower fuel surcharge revenues. We are confident of the International guidance, because of our balanced approach of growing the business, creating network efficiencies and strong revenue management initiatives we have implemented.","In Supply Chain & Freight groups, second-half operating margins are predicted to continue to be around 9%. Top line growth will be muted in Supply Chain & Freight as the Forwarding unit continues to implement their initiatives and change their customer mix.","To summarize the quarter's results, positive progress is being made across all segments of our business. All segments improved profitability and margins. The investments we are making in new capacity and capabilities are starting to pay dividends.","We are successfully executing our strategy today, while we continue to identify both organic and new accretive growth opportunities for the future. The confidence we have in meeting those objectives is demonstrated by our move to the higher end of the guidance. Thank you.","Now, I'll ask the operator to open the line. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question will come from the line of Nate Brochmann of William Blair. Please go ahead.","Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah. Good morning, everyone and thanks for taking the question. I'm just wanting to talk a little bit on the domestic side with the comments of things slowing a little bit. One, is that relative to just expectations for the start of the year or is something really going on currently? And how do you disassociate that from whether any of your other customers might be doing a little bit more themselves and if that's taken an impact? And if indeed you believe that slowness to continue for the year, will that hurt any of your expectations going into peak season in terms of the benefits on profitability, particularly expectations for greater route density both real and synthetic?","David P. Abney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. This is David. That is a heck of a question. And I will start the answer and then I'll hand it over to Alan. He can talk a little bit about it from a customer standpoint. But to get to the economy, recent economic news has just been mixed and it's caused us to be cautious. The continued strength of the U.S. dollar and I think this impending rate hike by the Fed appears to be holding back some U.S. growth.","If you just look at in January, the GDP forecast we thought was going to be about 3.1%. Now, the thinking in July is about 2.3%, so let's say, a pretty significant decrease. Retail has been uneven and we saw it soften a little bit in June. And so, that's the reason that we're cautious. Obviously, we had a good first quarter, a good second quarter, but a little bit cautious about the U.S. economy. Alan, you want to talk a little bit about it from a customer standpoint?","Alan Gershenhorn - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP","Yeah, Nate, a couple of things to keep in mind. Remember back in the second quarter of 2014, we've got some tough comps. We had some of our best Ground growth in 2014 for the second quarter, up above 8% growth. So, when you look at the two-year growth comparison, we're up about 9% versus 2Q 2013. Also, we had a very large catalog shipment last year that was about a 50 basis point positive impact on the second quarter last year.","While the overall growth issue was just shy of 2%, we've had some really strong Deferred Air growth at 14% and even with lapping some 60% year-over-year growth on SurePost, for the first half of 2014 we still had excellent SurePost growth at 8%. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Please go ahead.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Yes, good morning. Wanted to ask you on the pricing side and just I guess a question on how that came through in the numbers for Ground yield. I know there was fuel surcharge impact, but if I look at Ground yields were up about 1%, 1.1% in second quarter, they were up 3.1% in first quarter. So, I don't know if you could give some color on why there is that deceleration and if the core price still looks pretty strong? And then in terms of any thoughts on peak season surcharge whether that's likely at this point or whether we should be cautious on our view on that? So, on the broader pricing front? Thank you.","Alan Gershenhorn - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP","Yeah. So, on the Ground you can see the RPP showing plus a little over 1%. And what you've got there is a fuel surcharge drag of a couple of hundred basis points that's putting a drag on that as well as the large customer versus small customer mix. And obviously, we're growing our SurePost faster than our Ground residential.","And then you've also got the omni-channel there, where we've got some shorter zone. But, on the base rates, we are absolutely at the high-end of the 2% to 3% range and our tactics of creating value for customers along with the revenue management associated with the GRI, dim weight and other value-added asset stories are all working. And we're obviously very, very pleased with the yield.","As far as peak goes, we're certainly focused on improving the residential profitability year-around. And like I said, we're at the higher end there, the 2% to 3%. And that's going to have an impact on residential and peak. And we are going to continue to address peak on a customer-by-customer basis, really understanding what their needs are, the value of the solutions and market conditions and price them accordingly.","Operator","Next question will come from the line of Ben Hartford of Baird. Please go ahead.","Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yes, thanks. Maybe, Richard, this is probably directed to you since this is the first time at the helm for you at the call. On the heels of some of the recent industry news speculation with regard to your acquisition strategy, specifically targeting a large truck broker, I won't ask you to comment on that specifically; but maybe generally speaking, can you provide some context to your perspective on how you view the business from an acquisition standpoint? What are some targets or goals and really how do you view your industry-leading return on invested capital? And could your focus change a little bit to broaden the scale or opportunities as it relates to acquisitions going forward, some perspective there would be helpful?","David P. Abney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, Ben, this is David. I'll take the first part of that question. And as you accurately predicted, I'll turn it over to Richard. But really, first, when it comes to any rumors that may be out there, obviously, we can't respond to rumors as you know, and UPS does not discuss M&A activities just due to confidentiality and competitive reasons. But, getting back to the more general understanding of what we are looking for, it's really in three different areas.","First is, what are new opportunities that would allow us to expand our portfolio and allow us to give additional value to our customers? We also look at geography, are there certain geographies that could strengthen our offering? And then third, we look at what capability does our network presently need that we don't have? And where there's an adjacent industry or whether it's a different service offering. So, that's in general, the way that we look at it. Richard, do you want to talk a little bit about the ROIC and our expectations?","Richard N. Peretz - CFO, Treasurer, Vice President & Controller","Sure. So, when we think about the acquisitions, we look at not only how the business stands alone, but also as we integrate into our business what it does? And so, obviously, over time what happens with our acquisitions is that the ROIC becomes closer to the characteristics of the UPS ROIC as it expands the capabilities David talked about. And such as Kiala, where it started out as a standalone with a very small ROIC, and now its value to the UPS network is much greater. So, we look at it is growing it into the UPS network, also increases and is important to the acquisition \u2013 it takes on the attributes of our financial discipline as well. Thanks for the question.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Tom Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Tom Kim - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning and thanks for your time. Congrats on the quarter. I wanted to, obviously, we appreciate your confidence guiding toward the higher end of the range. It certainly seems that you're bucking the trends on global Air Freight trends; and frankly, indicators that we've been looking at had been deteriorating, so it's great to see you guys outperform there. And I know we've talked previously about how Europe is driving all of that. My question is around China. As you know, concerns around to that market have only increased recently with a market selloff. And as I think about your business, I believe, it's predominantly exposed to China exports and if that's fair, I'd certainly love to hear that affirmation. But, I am wondering to what extent you can provide color around your exposure to China imports and the domestic market, which obviously would be more impacted by a slower China. Thank you.","James Jay Barber, Jr. - President, UPS International","Tom, this is Jim. I'll pick that one up. I think, obviously, the last couple of days in the market have been unique, to say the least. I think we look at that, though, as really more of a domestic phenomenon as opposed to really aligning to our business.","We still are firmly in the export-import business in China. Most recently, we're up about 5% to 6%, we continue to focus on the middle market. And so, we continue to be in China for the long-term. So, really those factors that are going on as they moved to more of a domestic GDP consumption, we have to keep an eye on it, but our business is aligned to grow almost regardless of that through the import-export and the Supply Chain and Forwarding business. So, that's the kind of what we look at it right now.","Tom Kim - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Good morning. Can you dig into the comments on the slowing B2C just a little bit, maybe flesh that out? Or is that a slowing overall market? Are you losing volumes to other modes? And I guess if you compound that with your thoughts on a slowing economy, do you now need to get out ahead of this and I don't know, cut costs, eliminate trade lanes, lower CapEx, is there anything you need to react at this point? But, I guess, primarily thoughts on the commentary around the slowing B2C? Thanks.","Alan Gershenhorn - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP","Yeah, Ken, hey. This is Alan. I'll take that. We're certainly, we're about where we thought we would be. We think the economy was certainly slower for sure. The B2C pace, I think the secular trends are still in place; although, it is slow again, you've got to remember we had those tough comps from last year. I'd also say that, on the B2B side as a demonstration of e-commerce, the omni-channel and the returns are still very, very strong.","David P. Abney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","This is David. Alan talked about the tough comps. You just have to look back and if you look at two years ago and compare what our volume is today, you actually see an increase of 9%. It's just that when you compare them to the comps of last year that you get a little bit different perspective. So, good question. Thank you. And, operator, we're ready for the next question.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Kevin Sterling of BB&T Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Kevin W. Sterling - BB&T Capital Markets","Thank you and congratulations on a nice quarter, gentlemen. You've talked about UPS Forwarding benefiting from improved market conditions and customer mix. Maybe could you expand a little bit more upon the improved market conditions commentary? Is that more of a function of better buy rates? Or is that in conjunction with maybe a pickup in volume? Just maybe a little more color around those improved market conditions you're seeing in Forwarding. Thank you.","James Jay Barber, Jr. - President, UPS International","Okay, Kevin. It's Jim. So, first let me start with the overall Forwarding results are really balanced. I'll get to the IAS specific in a second. But, when you look at the North America Freight network, ocean brokerage, NIF, they all had really solid quarters for us. We've told you guys back in 2014, we'd come into this with a very focused go-to-market strategy of the right tonnage, the right customers, and our balanced network. We did that.","With specifics to the market right now, what's going on is from the way we see it, we got about 12% more capacity in the market than we thought. What that does is drop, obviously, the buy rates and it opens it up a bit. We think that will last about three more months, maybe two-and-a-half months as we come up into the retail peak season.","At that point, we'll continue to adjust, but we did get some tailwinds. I would say, the majority of the results are really kind of because of the right focus, the right customers and the right tonnage in the network, the balance of that is some tailwinds on the market.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys and thanks for taking a question. So, if we look at the leverage that UPS is getting in International, can you help us to understand what's driving the upside? I'm specifically trying to figure out, if it's the benefits from maybe better profitability in the longer haul, sort of cross-ocean package business? Or maybe you guys are just getting a lot more leverage on the high rates of intra-European growth than maybe would have expected? Just trying to sort of look at it from the inside out. Are you getting better growth out of the cross-ocean business or more intra-European?","James Jay Barber, Jr. - President, UPS International","Yes. I'll start with that. So, let me just say this. We talk a lot about Europe, but we also over the last year-and-a-half have really done some good work in Asia as well, largely around our intra-Asia network. David made some of those references in the opening comments. But, we really had to kind of get that intra-Asia network built up, after we built it to the right place and the team's done a great job.","Europe continues to do very well. So, really, the Asia-Pacific that has intra-Asia and the trunks back to Europe and U.S. are performing very nicely. Europe, as we've said, it's about a balanced mix of product mix, yield mix, and then cost management on the back of the capital that we've talked about and putting an extra $1 billion of capital into that part of the UPS network. So, it's really a combination of those two.","And then, I would say, at the same time, I would ask you not to lose sight of, as these results come out, we're also taking advantage of actually investing in emerging markets and continuing to expand as we said in opening comments, in some of the other capabilities. So, we're kind of blending it all together and that's kind of what you see in the bottom line results.","David P. Abney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","You know, we do have, we do see a lot of strong momentum in our International business. And one of the key factors is definitely the pan-European network that we put in place maybe a few years before its time, before the market started shifting to a pan-European inventory replacement model. And now that that transition is happening, we've just got the right network in the right place, at the right time. And Jim and his team's just doing an excellent job with it. Thank you. And next question, please, operator?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you could discuss the impact of fuel and lower buy rates in the Forwarding division that you saw on the purchase transportation expense line item. It looked like there was a more pronounced sequential decline as a percent of sales than the historical average. So, any color that you could provide with respect to this and maybe how to think about it going forward. Thank you.","Richard N. Peretz - CFO, Treasurer, Vice President & Controller","So, I think I'll start by talking about the impact of fuel in total and then I'll turn it over to Jim to talk a little bit about the Forwarding group specifically. When we look at the total company and adjust for fuel, we're talking about a growth rate of about 1.5% versus what's reported. So, fuel this quarter had the biggest year-over-year change that we expect or that we've had in 2015. So, because of the large 300 basis points in Ground and 350 basis point difference in Air, it had a big impact on reported revenue and you see that in the revenue number.","In fact, it's worth mentioning that we're pretty happy with where our revenue growth has been, but it's being masked by both fuel and currency. Those two combined would take revenue growth to almost 4%. So, there's something around the neighborhood of $700 million difference in reported revenue versus the commodities. Jim, why don't you talk about the Forwarding?","James Jay Barber, Jr. - President, UPS International","Yeah, Allison, the only thing I would remind you and come on the back of that was what I just mentioned a minute ago, and that is that we come at this with a very targeted approach. Last year, we grew effectively tonnage almost double-digits quarter-over-quarter-over-quarter, which obviously hits the top line. This one has been much more muted. It's about flat tonnage, year-over-year. But the product mix and the tonnage we're bringing in, you can see how it affects the bottom line as well.","And as I said, or we talked about, that buy rate, we figure is down about 7% where we thought it would be coming into the year. That translates also to the bottom line and I've spoken how we see that going forward. So, that's kind of how we manage the results.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Please go ahead.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to touch a little bit on the guidance, specifically around the fourth quarter as you expect sort of a bit of a ramp back up to low-double digits on the domestic side. I guess when you think about sort of e-commerce customers and preparing for the peak season, you have about four months to go. I guess, how far through the process are you in terms of talking to customers, getting them prepared for what they might need to do from both an operational perspective as well as sort of a pricing perspective, as you're at this point in the game? I just want to get a sense of sort of how far you are through that process, maybe what else needs to be done as you go through the next four months in advance of peak? Thank you.","Alan Gershenhorn - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP","Yeah. This is Alan. Our peak season planning for 2015 started right after peak 2014. So, we've been having discussions with our customers on the solutions that we need to put in place, the capacity planning, the visibility we need, the forecasting, and so on and so forth. So, this is an ongoing process that happens throughout the year. We don't discuss the individual customer pricing, but we do have comprehensive peak pricing initiatives underway to increase revenue from the customers that surge and ultimately drive significantly greater cost at peak.","And this solutioning and pricing is really separate and distinct from our year-around revenue management and solutioning. And it's helping us better align our revenue with our cost. And now maybe, Myron, you want to talk a little bit about what we're doing on the operations side?","Myron A. Gray - President-US Operations & Senior Vice President","So, Chris, this is Myron. We're certainly on plan as it pertains to operations. Earlier Alan alluded to Access Points, so we're going to deploy them in over 100 cities and we'll have over 8,000 Access Points by the end of the year. It's a win for the customer, for the companies, and certainly for UPS as we'll be able to drive delivery density. Along with that, we'll continue to deploy operational technology at a faster pace. We'll have over 70% of our drivers deployed on ORION by the end of year.","There are 10 projects that we certainly are addressing that either allude to hub modernization, automation or expanded capacity. And our flow-through at the end of peak season will be enhanced by over 6%. And then we're also going to, as I've alluded to before, tighten up operations. We'll extend our drivers' delivery day a bit and will not use as many drivers as we've used in the past to lower our costs. So, we're on plan and we're pleased with where we are today.","David P. Abney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","This is David. Everyone in our organization is focused on making sure that we have a good peak for investors, customers, and employees. And we absolutely felt like that we're on track and where we need to be at this time. And we're focused on where we need to go between now and peak. So, thank you for the question.","Operator","Our next question will be from the line of John Barnes of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, thank you. Hey, just to follow-up on that, I mean, you mentioned capacity planning, I know last year you made a concerted effort to over-resource the network for a period of time to ensure the service kind of came through. How do you balance the capacity planning with some of the comments you've just made on maybe seeing some slowing in B2C, some signs that may be the economy is a little softer, retail has obviously been a mixed message? How are you walking through this process of kind of figuring out that capacity planning, resource planning when you've got this backdrop that maybe is a little softer than you anticipated?","Myron A. Gray - President-US Operations & Senior Vice President","So, as Alan alluded to earlier, we've been collaborating with our customers since the beginning of the year and this is much even earlier than what we've done in the past. So, we're certainly going to stay close to what their projections are and we'll flex the system based on what we believe the volume pinch points may be.","I also alluded to the projects that we have in place this year to expand capacity and if you'll remember last year, our pinch points were network-related and not delivery-related. So, we'll flex our drivers based on the capacity that we see and we believe that these expansion and capacity projects that we have in place will improve our flow through to the point that we can control our costs. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Jack Atkins of Stephens. Please go ahead.","Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.","Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could comment on the competitive landscape in the U.S. Ground segment. Given the Postal Service wants to become a bigger player with some of the larger e-commerce shippers and you're seeing certainly a more competitive dynamic among the regional players out there, what are you seeing as you try to implement these above-trend pricing increases? And are you seeing any disruptors in the marketplace given a more sluggish domestic economy?","Alan Gershenhorn - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP","Yeah. The U.S. market has always been competitive, but I would tell you that where we're seeing the growth right now in the e-commerce area, nobody has a better solution out there than UPS with our e-commerce ecosystem, whether it's omni-channel or synchronized delivery solutions, returns, our SurePost and SurePost Redirect, UPS My Choice, UPS Access Point that Myron talked about. So, we're real confident in our ability to achieve our plans from both a top and bottom-line perspective.","David P. Abney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And one of the reasons that we're so confident, and this is David, is that the unique solutions that we continue to focus on that are going to help us not only during peak season, but throughout the year to remain competitive and to provide the value to our customers that are looking for Access Points, I think, is a great example that we get the benefits during the year. And this is something that started on an acquisition that we did a few years ago in Europe and now we're implementing it across the U.S. in over 100 cities. And these Access Points combined with UPS My Choice just gives us a real differentiator to offer the marketplace. So, thank you for the question.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Jeff A. Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you. Thank you very much. A lot of my questions have been answered so let me follow-up more on the investment side. You're now rolling out Access Point, you had accelerated ORION, you're seeing a little bit of a softer patch domestically on the retail side. Have you given any thought to the capital spending for the next one to two years?","Richard N. Peretz - CFO, Treasurer, Vice President & Controller","Jeff, this is Richard, thanks for the question. You know when we think about investing in our network, we think about the long-term benefits and we think it's important that we continue to manage this network and the highly integrated parts of the network for the long term. And so, as we look at what's happening with volume, there might be little tweaks; but overall, we're adding capabilities and enhancements that are going to help our customers for the long term. Thank you.","Jeff A. Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks very much. Over in the Supply Chain & Freight category, I'm just curious, could you elaborate a little bit on the Mail Services with distribution. And then as a follow-up, just Freight pricing in Freight if there's a little bit of slowing growth in the market, what you can do there? Thanks.","James Jay Barber, Jr. - President, UPS International","Yes, Scott, it's Jim. The Mail Services, as most of these products are designed to do is provide a solution to a customer that the other products in the portfolio don't. Obviously, it's, if you will, an asset-light business that we're glad we're in it. We'll continue to invest in it the right way.","We've got a lot of customers that are using all of our products. And so, it's not one product versus the other. But obviously, we have the SurePost on the other side as well as Mail Innovations. But, it's a product that we are glad to be in and we plan to continue to invest in it and it just complements all the other products that we have for our customers.","David P. Abney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","From our Supply Chain & Freight perspective overall, we are seeing good growth and had a good quarter. And we've got a good focus and expect that we will continue to see good results. Thanks.","Operator","Next question will come from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Brandon Robert Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. Congrats on the better quarter here. Richard, I want to come back to a near-term question, because I think it's important here, but can you comment on the FX impact in International's quarter? Because it would seem to me that if you're translating foreign currency into a shorter dollar, it would actually be negative on earnings. So, is there some hedge impact that we should be thinking about? And if I extrapolate your guidance in the back half of the year, it sounds like you're talking for a sequential deceleration in International margins. Is that the right way to think about it?","Richard N. Peretz - CFO, Treasurer, Vice President & Controller","Yeah. So, let's first talk about currency, because currency really has an impact on the top line and the bottom line for UPS. On the top line, obviously, there's lower reported revenue as the dollar strengthened. And in the schedule, I had referenced earlier, there's about $320 million less revenue.","On the bottom line, our hedges are protecting our profits, not creating profits, and the hedge allowed us to make sure our profit levels stayed the same. But, we did have about a $15 million drag for the unhedged currency and that's part of that unhedged currency drag that we talked about for the year. It had a minimal impact; but at the same time, there are currencies that are moving very quickly and the exposures aren't large enough for us to take a position on those. What was the second question?","David P. Abney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","The second question was about the second half of the year.","Richard N. Peretz - CFO, Treasurer, Vice President & Controller","Okay. And on the second half of the year, our guidance really is at the higher end of our, where we expect it to be and it's really driven by the fourth quarter that you mentioned; but in the third quarter, there's some tough year-over-year comps.","In the third quarter, we had a very high earnings per share, 14%. We talked about the volume that drove that and there were some wage deflation productivity improvements and we expect some of that to continue, but there was also a true-up of workers' comp with a credit and we just don't think the credit will be quite as large in the third quarter. And so, when you put them together, we're growing our profits in both the third quarter and the fourth quarter. And we expect to hit the high end of our guidance.","Brandon Robert Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey. Thanks guys, good morning. So, just wanted to follow-up on a couple of items with you, Richard. The currency hedge impact that you talked about in the second quarter, how should we think about that hedge benefit in third quarter and fourth quarter and then into 2016? And then also on the fuel side, you gave good color on the revenue impact. Can you just help us think about the net impact on profitability for each of the segments in the quarter?","Richard N. Peretz - CFO, Treasurer, Vice President & Controller","Sure. First, we'll talk about the currency hedge. One of the things we talked about in previous calls as well is that we took a multiyear approach to the hedge. We really did that as the currency was at the $1.35, $1.33 range. So, we have coverage on the currency all the way through the end of 2016. And because of that we don't think there's an impact that you should be thinking about on that.","In terms of the fuel and the net fuel, when you think about fuel there's a lot of ups and downs, but the bottom line is it's almost neutral to the profit line. There is a slight drag in the domestic in the second quarter, but it's not enough to really talk about at this point. But overall, our fuel surcharge is meant to be a natural offset to the changing volatility of fuel prices, so that it's taken into account.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","All right. Helpful. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Kelly Dougherty of Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Kelly A. Dougherty - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi, thanks for taking the question. I know there's been a lot of discussion about slowing B2C growth, so I'm just curious if you can estimate for us how much of the business is industrial-related versus consumer-driven. And I'm pretty sure it's pretty different within the segment so any comments on that. And then maybe just a big picture insight into how you see industrial versus consumer parts of the economy moving, and maybe how you might have to make some adjustments to the network, if that's changed since you first put out the operating plan for this year.","David P. Abney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. I'll take the second part of the question about the economy and then turn it over to Alan. So, we have talked about seeing B2C, the pace slow down just a little bit. We don't at all want to leave people, though, with the impression that B2C is not going to continue to grow. And it is, but just the pace of growth has slowed just a little bit.","And the other part from the industrial, the manufacturing side, we've seen four quarters of increase from the manufacturing sector; but really this quarter, we saw that, I was going to call it even, but it was just a slight decrease. So, that's one of the reasons that we're a little cautious about the remainder of the year in the U.S. We just want to see if the manufacturing sector rebounds. I'll turn it over to Alan for the first part of your question.","Alan Gershenhorn - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP","Yeah. Kelly, really the split right now in the U.S. is about 45% B2C, 55% B2B. And like David said, the manufacturing and some other sectors that were related to B2B have slowed down a little bit. The B2B this quarter was primarily driven by retail with returns and omni-channel. Next question?","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of David Ross of Stifel. Please go ahead.","David G. Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yes, good morning, everyone. I wanted to talk a little bit about UPS Freight. Shipments were flattish year- over-year, a little down probably reflecting the industrial economy that you just talked about there, David. But when I look at yield, adjusting for weight per shipment it looks like yield was down year-over-year unless something went on with average length of haul. Was average length of haul up, down? What was the impact there and what was kind of true pricing like in the LTL?","Myron A. Gray - President-US Operations & Senior Vice President","Good morning, David. This is Myron. Overall, as you know, the U.S. Freight market is down 1.5% to 2%. However, our base rates and bottom line continues to be supported by a disciplined strategy, which is our focus on the middle market. So, the average tonnage was down, but revenue per ton continued to actually grow because of rate actions that we're taking on some lower yielding customers. And we see it coming through in our business, so we're actually pleased with where we are.","David G. Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Where was average length of haul?","Myron A. Gray - President-US Operations & Senior Vice President","It's about the same.","David G. Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Rob Salmon of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes, thanks for taking the question. We heard a lot of talk a couple weeks ago with regard to July Black Friday events, and I was curious, if you could talk a little bit about how that volume, if we should be expecting any sort of meaningful impact in the third quarter? And could you talk about the performance during that kind of summer peak-type volumes and if there were any incremental resources that you added to the network?","Alan Gershenhorn - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP","Yeah, hey. This is Alan. Look, as we all know there was a number of retailers out there that had a number of similar events. And we're actually excited about this innovativeness that's going to continue with e-commerce. It obviously drives significant small package growth and redefines how business is done. And UPS will benefit and continue to benefit from those type of promotions.","And certainly, our ability to develop the solutions that I talked about earlier with our e-commerce ecosystem gives us the ability to flex our integrated interoperable network to support those kind of promotions very cost-effectively.","The last thing I'll say is that I think it's also a demonstration of the potential to drive and shift demand that there's going to be some definite new learnings from. For example, we've talked on prior calls about the U-shaped volume between Thanksgiving and Christmas. And certainly, if we can better level that working with our retailers, that's going to help out our retailers and UPS alike. Thanks.","Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of David Campbell of Thompson, Davis & Co. Please go ahead.","David P. Campbell - Thompson, Davis & Co.","Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on a good quarter. I just wanted to ask about the last six months. Someone mentioned I think that operating profit in the International operations would be up 15%; but I'm not sure, I got that right. Could you please clarify that for me?","Richard N. Peretz - CFO, Treasurer, Vice President & Controller","Sure, this is Richard. What we have guided to for the next six months is that the operating profit in International would be at the high end of the range that we've given at 6% to 12%. And that's what we expected in the guidance and was in my talk.","David P. Campbell - Thompson, Davis & Co.","And so that rate of growth is also in the last six months, 6% to 12%?","Richard N.

Just wondering to the extent you could update us on your thoughts and your tests in the same-day market that would be extremely helpful. And what you might look at the market size as going forward.","Alan Gershenhorn - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP","Yeah, Matt, this is Alan. We've been in the same-day market for about 20 years on the B2B side with our Express Critical and Forward Stocking Location network primarily aligned to high-tech and Healthcare.","As you know, there's a tremendous amount of innovation going on in the retail e-commerce space including same-day. And we all know why that is, is because retail is expected to grow four times the GDP. We saw an announcement this morning about one of the operators closing down their same-day operations. And quite frankly, I think we all know that the challenge is having a valid economic model for low-cost shipping offers.","Currently, the same-day free e-commerce has challenges with consolidating density on single piece stock economics that create profitability issues. So, we continue to monitor the space and look for cost-effective solutions that are profitable that can serve the needs of our retailers.","David P. Abney - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Matt, this is David. Because of the time that most of these e-commerce orders are made which is later in the afternoon we're really seeing much more of a demand for giving our retailers, especially those with an omni-channel network, giving them late pick-ups and then giving them local delivery the next day. And we've seen a lot of interest there and that's part of our business is growing and we expect that that will continue to grow at a pretty rapid rate.

Now I will turn the call over to David.","David Abney","Thanks, Scott and good morning everyone. I'm pleased to report another quarter of strong financial results that demonstrate the power of UPS' diversified business model. Again this quarter the International segment led the way. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit operating profit growth. The U.S. Domestic business is growing operating profit on higher B2C demand. Supply Chain & Freight continued to execute in a challenging macroenvironment. Turning to the economy, the consumer market in the U.S. remains healthy and e-commerce forecasts have been elevated for 2016. And we're seeing that growth.","On the other hand, our B2B volume is affected by the continuing weakness in industrial production. In fact, global GDP and industrial production growth forecast have been downgraded slightly. Delayed inventory drawdowns and soft export demand likely will remain headwinds in the latter part of 2016. Additionally, we're mindful of the current political commentary on trade. Increased trade not only bolsters business but also produces jobs here in the U.S. and abroad. Historically, following ratification of trade deals we have seen about a 20% increase in U.S. exports to the countries involved. UPS is a steadfast proponent of trade and supports agreements that minimize friction in the global supply chain. Trade legislation to accelerate economic expansion like the Trans-Pacific Partnership is vital to the health of the U.S. economy. We encourage our political leaders to support and pass pending trade legislation.","Turning to our business, the strategic initiatives implemented over the last two years are ensuring we remain on track to achieve our long term financial goals. We continue investing in four priority areas. We're adding network capacity, achieving greater efficiency through technology, deploying industry-specific solutions and expanding in high-growth markets. In Europe we have completed about one-fourth of the projects associated with our $2 million capital investment plan. During the second quarter we announced new automated facilities in Belgium and France.","In addition, we began an extensive program that would dramatically improve time-in-transit in our intra-Europe ground network with some trade lanes improving by as much as two business days. The majority of the benefits of these investments are still ahead of us and will guarantee our position as a market leader in Europe for many years to come. We're also investing heavily in our U.S. operations and in a few minutes Richard will update you on our technology and capacity projects. A pillar of our strategy in the U.S. is deploying industry-leading e-commerce capabilities that help online retailers take advantage of consumer trends.","We recently released the fifth annual U.S. Pulse of the Online Shopper study that highlights some of these changing trends. This year's survey revealed that most shoppers prefer home delivery while also expressing an interest in an alternative delivery location. To provide more delivery options, UPS is expanding our Access Point locker program in several major U.S. markets. These automated pickup locations augment our more than 8,000 existing U.S. retail locations in the more than 25,000 Access Points worldwide. We're providing more convenient alternatives for urban online shoppers.","New technology features were also introduced for the 24 million My Choice users in the U.S. For example, members can now use the Follow My Delivery feature to track their package using real-time maps. These new capabilities are unique solutions to create value for our customers and further differentiate their online offering.","Our investments are broad-based and targeted for the needs of customers in multiple industries. This quarter we announced a specialized set of global services for healthcare companies performing clinical trials and in Europe we expanded our field stocking locations for medical device distributors. UPS healthcare customers are gaining additional alternatives for shipping their sensitive materials globally with the assurance of our guaranteed services.","UPS also launched a market-leading partnership with SAP and Fast Radius to support end-to-end 3D printing solutions. This capability is linked to more than 60 UPS Store locations and the urgent delivery capabilities of the UPS network. This partnership is enabling UPS to expand into an adjacent market with great growth potential. We entered another adjacent industry in 2015 with the acquisition of asset-light, truckload brokerage services of Coyote Logistics. The combination of Coyote's capabilities and the UPS integrated network is providing customers with unmatched flexibility.","Next month will mark the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. The synergies in procurement, asset utilization and cross-selling remain on track to achieve our 2017 targets. In fact, cross-selling has already produced several great wins. ","Before I turn it over to Richard I want to take a moment to recognize a milestone we will achieve in August. UPS marks our 40th year in Germany and our entrance into Europe. Over that time our business has matured rapidly and the European operations have become a cornerstone for our integrated network. Today we operate in every European country generating more than $6 billion in annual revenue using our best-in-class pan-European network. The expansion in Europe and the growth of our business around the world are made possible through the hard work and dedication of UPSers. As our strong momentum carries into the second half of the year I want to thank all of our employees around the globe for helping make and maintain UPS as the market leader.","Now Richard will review the financial highlights.","Richard Peretz","Thanks, David. The second quarter operating results demonstrate the value of our flexible business model as we had another solid quarter. Additionally, we're seeing high-growth in the e-commerce and healthcare sectors while the LTL and forwarding markets remain challenged. Even with these dynamics currency-neutral revenue growth increased 4% while fuel surcharges were a drag of around 120 basis points. Second quarter earnings per share were in line with expectations. Our performance reflected the gains from our investment strategies despite the mixed macroenvironment. The International segment outperformed while U.S. Domestic was on target. And finally, Supply Chain & Freight was slightly below expectations.","Now for some details by segment, U.S. Domestic revenue increased 2.4% as lower fuel surcharges reduced total revenue growth by about 100 basis points. Average daily volume increased 2.5% led by Next Day Air products which were up about 6%. The Next Day Air gains were produced by customers of all sizes. Demand was consumer-based as more online retailers are providing faster delivery options to stay competitive. During the quarter Ground products increased 2.4% over last year as B2C expansion outpaced B2B by more than 5 to 1. Base rates accelerated slightly from last quarter. Lower fuel surcharges reduced yield growth by about 100 basis points.","The higher base rates were able to compensate for some of the changes in product and customer mix. Operating profit increased about 3% and operating margin expanded to 13.7%. Enhanced productivity and lower fuel cost resulted in operating cost per piece declining 2\/10 of a percent. Once again we're seeing good improvements in our daily operating statistics. Despite the fact that delivery stops were up over 3% ORION lowered driver Miles by 3\/10 of a percent. In addition, overall productivity gains continued as direct labor hours grew less than the volume. Our investment in ORION is bending the cost curve. And we remain on track to complete Phase 1 implementation later in 2016.","We're continuing our multiyear investment strategy in hub automation in the U.S. operations. So far in 2016 we have announced new projects in California, Colorado, Illinois and Texas. These facilities are adding increased capacity and improved productivity.","Now turning to the International segment which had another remarkable quarter with operating profit expanding more than 11%, on a two-year stacked basis operating profit is up more than 30%. Export daily volume increased almost 4% as improvements in all international regions offset slower U.S. exports. Europe led the way with significant gains in cross-border products and export growth to all regions of the world. In fact, the Europe to U.S. Lane grew at double-digit pace this quarter. Cycling out of the revenue management initiatives that we started in the last half of 2015 we have seen good non-U.S. domestic daily shipment growth which is up 4.5% while at the same time currency-neutral revenue per piece increased 1%. We saw higher base rates. However, they were offset by changes in product and trade lane mix.","Currency-neutral revenue for the segment increased 1.5%. The lower fuel surcharge did impact revenue growth by about 170 basis points. The cost and productivity improvements held operating down during the quarter. As a result, operating margin expanded to 19.9%. The International segment had a record second quarter with its highest second quarter delivery volume, operating profit and one of the best margins ever.","Now let's turn and look at Supply Chain & Freight. Total revenue increased more than 13% due to the addition of Coyote Logistics. The new truckload brokerage revenue offset tonnage shortfalls in international forwarding and the U.S. LTL business. Freight Forwarding revenue and operating profits declined as we wrapped last year's rate actions. Cargo capacity continues to outpace demand, contributing to the weak market conditions I mentioned earlier. Expansion of the buy-sell rate and cost-containment efforts led to the operating margin expansion. The unit remains focused on growing the more profitable middle market.","In the Distribution unit we experienced strong revenue growth in the healthcare, aerospace and automotive sectors this quarter. In fact, this quarter healthcare became the top revenue sector within the contract logistics business. Distribution operating profit jumped more than 10% and the margin expanded. The UPS Freight business remains disciplined on pricing with revenue per hundredweight up 3%. The unit's execution of revenue quality initiatives is driving higher shipment yields. Total tonnage was lower by about 10% due in part to the weak LTL market conditions.","Now to update you on our cash position, for the six months ended June 30, UPS generated $3.7 billion of free cash flow, a 13% increase over last year. And this was after spending $1 billion on CapEx. The Company paid just over $1.3 billion in dividends, an increase of almost 7%. In addition, we purchased over 13 million shares for more than $1.3 billion. Combined we're on schedule to meet our return to shareholders goals we set for the year.","Looking at the rest of the year, our strong International performance and the return on investments we're making in our network give us confidence in our ability to achieve our full-year earnings guidance of $5.70 to $5.90 per share. As I discussed in February, we expect 2016 operating profit by quarter to follow the same pattern as it did in 2015. We still expect the fourth quarter operating profit growth to be above our annual guidance, somewhere between 9% and 11%. The additional workday between Thanksgiving and Christmas, the continued strength in e-commerce and our strategic investments position us well for another solid fourth quarter.","Looking at the segments, in the U.S. Domestic we expect strong fourth quarter results. However, we will face tough comparisons in the third as a result of one less operating day and lower Worker's Compensation cost last year. Therefore, we anticipate third quarter operating profit to be relatively flat year over year. For the International segment we expect to continue into the second half of the year the progress we have made with operating profit growth in the 8% to 12% range. The Supply Chain & Freight segment is where we anticipate the current market trends in International Air Freight and the U.S. trucking markets to remain soft. In addition, lower fuel surcharges will weigh on reported revenue growth. Therefore, total annual revenue growth for the segment should be around 10%.","Now let's look at taxes. The faster growth of our profits from the International segment means that we will have a slightly lower tax rate in 2016. In summary, UPS' financial performance this year clearly demonstrates the value of our diverse business. We're embracing the opportunities created by the evolution of the global e-commerce marketplace as it expands beyond the traditional retail base.","We continue investing in strategic technologies, systems and expanded capacity and by our execution we're strengthening our leadership position. At the halfway point of the year our business is responding well to the changing macroenvironment and we're confident about the remainder of 2016.","Thanks for your attention today. Now I will ask the operator to open the line. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter, Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Ken Hoexter","I just want to follow-up. Richard, thanks for the overview on the International side there. And the strength you are talking about continuing it. Maybe some of the advances you've made, you talked about advancing two days on some of the service deliveries. What is accelerating that pace and how are you achieving that operating margin gains?","Jim Barber","We've talked over the years about the network in Europe. David referenced it in his opening comments. I think the key to our success in Europe has been and will continue to be making sure the network and the service and product offerings are best-in-class. And so that means always maintaining the network, putting the speed in and making sure that the customers feel the benefit of that. And as you've seen over the years they have said that.","Obviously the marketplace is changing in Europe. We know that as well, so it forces us to continue to relook and reevaluate everything we do. The margins, they've always been strong. I think I will flip it to Richard to talk a little bit about the margins, as well.","Richard Peretz","I do want to point out that the margin of 19.9% is very strong and it does include that multiyear hedge that we've talked about on the call the last few quarters. So I want to remind you that even adjusting for that we're still over a 17.5% margin which is the highest of any player in the industry. And along that route if you recall the currency we've been using a multiyear hedge strategy and what happened is in 2015 you saw a lot of volatility and the euro go to the dollar from $1.35 down to $1.11. So 2017 will be a transition year where we expect to have somewhere around $300 million impact for the change in the currency.","We have moved to a different hedge strategy because of the volatility has increased so much on currency where we're using more of a rolling average so that year over year going forward will not see these dips if you see a lot of volatility in currency. But overall that 17.5% is really a result of all the efforts of Jim and his folks really putting together and making adjustments in the network and at the same time the quality of revenue that we're bringing in.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Please go ahead.","Chris Wetherbee","I wanted to ask about some of the comments around the third quarter Domestic side relative to the fourth quarter. So I'm guessing there's probably some level of investment that needs to happen in advance of TPP that you guys really start to shore up and get ready for that surge again.","Just thinking about it on a European basis I guess I just want to make sure I understand the comment around the tougher comps from the third quarter Domestic side. Are there specific cost items that we might expect this year that we didn't have last year? I just want to make sure I understand that cadence of Domestic in 3Q and 4Q. Thank you.","Richard Peretz","I think the first thing to keep in mind here is that we continue to see margin expansion. Because of operating days, how holidays fall, things like that, it's not a linear movement of the expansion of the margin but over the year to year we have kind of guided that we continue to see improvement and expect to see improvement going forward, as well. When you look at the third quarter specifically, there is one less workday and that does have an impact, as well as last year we had some Worker's Comp. credits that won't repeat this coming year. So when you take all of that into account you have to look at and we did at the beginning of year understanding how the quarters would look and what we saw is that we need to make sure that you guys had some transparency to understand that workday shifts some of the profit around.","And if you look at this quarter this quarter we had a good improvement and that improvement was really driven by the operational improvements. Even though we saw so much volatility in fuel this year in the second quarter, we actually saw a 25% increase in fuel from April to June. So we were chasing the revenue. But when you step back and look at what we expect for the fourth quarter we're going to have a strong fourth quarter. We're putting our plans in place and we look forward to completing 2016 very much like we told you we would at the beginning of the year.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of David Vernon, Bernstein. Please go ahead.","David Vernon","Maybe just following up on Domestic, Richard, I guess the step below trend long term guidance growth in that Domestic segment obviously going down this quarter to 3% and then an expectation for flat in 3Q.","Maybe as you think over the course of the next sort of one, two, three years and that rate of margin change how should we be expecting that to happen to get to that longer term 15%? And what do you think is going to be different about next year and the year after that will let you get back to that kind of 8% growth that you guys have put out for a long term target in Domestic?","Richard Peretz","So, first, if we step back if you recall when we guided this year and what we've seen through the year is we have seen some softness in the macro measures. Everything has kind of come down each quarter of this year and so we take that into account, obviously, with how we think about this year. The good part about this year is even with that softness we're putting initiatives and investments in that are bringing returns. And that's why we're able to leave our guidance right where we expected to be at the first part of the year.","That being said, we're in a multiyear process of investments both in the ORION that David talked about in his talk as well as the hub automation and how that will continue. So all of those things are about putting together the multiyear process of where we're going to improve the margin that we laid out really at the end of 2014. We're putting those investments in. Those investments are paying the return we expected. And we just expect as we get more of that integrated into our network we will continue to see the benefits of that. So we feel very comfortable where we're at. We know we're on a roadmap for the next few years and we're following that roadmap.","David Vernon","All right. Thank you very much for the extra color on that. Thanks.","David Abney","Okay, this is David and we're going to take an online question. This one is from Nate Brochmann. And as a large e-commerce shipper takes over more of its own delivery within the denser cities, does that change the density equation at all and the need to retrofit all of the regional sort facilities and how is that project progressing and what have you learned thus far in terms of benefits heading into another peak? So Nate got his bang for his buck in that question. And I will start and address the first part of it, then I'm going to turn it over to Myron to talk a little bit about the retrofit and peak.","And it's not unusual for any of our large shippers to make decisions whether they are going to outsource or in-source different parts of their business. Our focus is our diverse customer base, just makes it so difficult for any one company to be able to match our density no matter their size. So with our integrated network that creates efficiencies, we're constantly increasing our value proposition.","So we always believe that even our large customers would have more density with us than going in another direction. So we feel very confident in our strategy from that regard. Why don't you talk about the retrofit and peak preparation, Myron?","Myron Gray","So Nate, the process itself is going well and we continue to realize 20% to 25% productivity improvements as we go along. Keep in mind this is a multiyear, multiphase implementation. And you've heard about some of the cities that we introduced earlier in Richard's comments. Our goal is to automate the top Tier 1 hubs and there is approximately 30 of them in the U.S. That process is as much as 60% of our volume.","Three of those automated hubs are in our air operation and the remainder will be in the ground. All new hubs moving forward will be built using an automated design and the second phase of it will be to go to the Tier 2 hubs and automate them, as well. So we feel very good about the progress that's being made and we're on plan and a go-list to get it completed no later than 2020.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Tom Wadewitz, UBS. Please go ahead.","Tom Wadewitz","I wanted to ask a bit in specific about ORION. I know Richard you offered some comments on high-level multiyear productivity and so forth. But is 2017 or are you starting to see this year where there is the reduction in the rollout costs and really getting some of the cost savings coming in in a bigger way? Are you starting to see that or is that something which would be maybe a bigger support for Domestic margin performance in 2017? And then you've mentioned a Phase 2, I don't know if you want to comment on that, I know that's a couple of questions. Maybe just some perspective, a little more detail on ORION. Thank you.","Richard Peretz","Sure, Tom. What I will do is I will start off and then I will hand it off to Myron to talk specifically about the benefits he's seen. But when you think about the investment and when we've been on the road talking about ORION we have talked about that later this year we will complete, call it, the first phase of ORION. And then we're investing the dollars in, call it, Phases 2 and 3 and 4. But on top of that it's not just the investment in ORION, it is also the investment in hub automation and what that does to the network.","So we're using those investment dollars and the additional expense that we were using to train up for ORION in other ways so that we get the end result. And that's kind of what we talked about at the end of 2014 and we continue to talk about each year. We're investing in our network and it's pulling through when you see the reduction in miles and things like that. But the next phase is additional capabilities that will save money and then additional features by having the hub mod and then there are some other things that we're working on, as well, that is just a little too early to go into. With that I'm going to send it to Myron to talk just a little bit about what he's seen operationally with the results of ORION.","Myron Gray","Tom, let me start with we expect to be 100% fully deployed by the end of 2016 with ORION. And we will continue to see the benefits that we've alluded to earlier, more than eight miles per driver in savings. For example, this quarter we saw our delivery stops growing more than 3% on 2.5% average daily volume gains. However, we were able to reduce our miles driven by 3\/10 of a percent which helped keep our costs per piece down by 2\/10 of a percent. So as the volume continues to grow our wages are growing at a lesser pace than the volume.","So we're continuing to see benefits and that's Phase 1. Phase 2 will actually begin in the back half of this year, well into 2017 and we hope to have the Phase 2 completed by 2017 when we hope to see additional benefits from ORION. And, again, that's just one of many technology projects that we will continue to roll out that should help us continue to bend the cost curve, so we're real pleased with what we're seeing.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Scott Group, Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Scott Group","Actually I just want to follow-up on the ORION question. So I understand the savings this year but there's probably some implementation cost. Can you quantify what the implementation costs are this year and if ORION has been a net positive or tailwind to earnings this year? And do you think that next year, how do you think about next year given the savings from Phase 1 but maybe the cost from Phase 2, any color there would be helpful.","Richard Peretz","And we're seeing the savings and if you just step back for a moment and look, year over year we continue to see the margin expansion. The margin expansion is a direct result of all the things Myron just talked about. We will continue to see those improvements. And it is a net positive but we also are spending some of the savings in order to invest in the next phase and the next capability. Those are all important pieces.","And that's why my comment a few minutes ago about the margin will improve year over year, it won't always be linear by quarter. And so that's an important part because we're investing for new capabilities and to continue to bend the cost curve because of the investments we're making and the plans we have for the next few years.","David Abney","This is David. I just want to stress that ORION is one of these things that it's the gift that keeps on giving. So what we have seen with ORION is we're seeing benefits that are greater than what we originally believed and that continues to reinforce itself every year. We have a lot more we're going to accomplish through ORION with the later versions and taking it to various countries. So we're very positive about ORION of the returns that we're getting and investments that we're making are certainly worth it. All right, next question.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Brandon Oglenski, Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.","Brandon Oglenski","As we look out, can you talk about where the pricing is falling in the U.S. Domestic market and why with this tremendous growth in B2C that we're not seeing a little bit more traction on yields which I think could also talk or this discussion on Domestic margins? Because obviously we've talked a lot about cost, but what are we doing on the revenue side and is there ability to take more price?","Alan Gershenhorn","So for the quarter we achieved our 2% to 3% range in our base pricing and the core pricing actually remains firm. We actually saw a bit of an acceleration from the first quarter. Keep in mind that some of the other phenomena we're seeing out there is the offset of about 100 basis points due to lower fuel surcharges and we're continuing to see changes in the customers and product mix and specifically the package characteristics as we bring more lightweight into the business.","The other thing I would say is that we saw even with some of those package characteristics and customer product mix challenges we did see margin improvement overall in the U.S. Domestic business. So we think the base rate improvements remains steady and they will continue to remain that way and core pricing right now is firm. Thanks for the question.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Scott Schneeberger, Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Scott Schneeberger","Just curious, here at the midpoint of the year, obviously reiterating the guidance range I'm curious looking out over the second half what do you view as the swing factors that would put you toward the high end or the low end of the range? Thanks.","Richard Peretz","This is Richard. I think when you start and you look at where we're at year to date first of all on earnings per share we're at about 8.5% growth in earnings per share on a target of 5% to 9%. So we're pleased with where we're for the first half of the year. We're actually right in line with where we expect it to be. But when we look at guidance there is really two factors we're looking at.","The first is the external and what's happening on the external measures. Because our volume does have some correlation, especially when you get to B2B, to what's happening with both domestic GDP, things like industrial production and things like that. And they all have softened somewhat from first quarter to second quarter.","The other side of it, of course, is what's happening internally, the things Myron has talked about in his operation and those improvements that we're seeing. So we put all that together and we say do we have economic assumptions are realistic and how are we benefiting from the initiatives that we have implemented. So we think we balance all that. And that is what we're seeing in 2016, we're seeing a nice balance where we're making up for some softness externally with what we're doing internally. And that's allowed us to grow our earnings per share for six quarters in a row and we will continue to work those plans for guidance going forward.","David Abney","So just to add to Richard's answer, it's our investments and strategies that have allowed us to offset some of this economic shifts that we've seen in the last year and a half. And we feel very comfortable about our strategic initiatives. We're extremely focused on them and it's allowing us to overcome some of those headwinds. We'll take the next question. We will do an online question. This is from Helane Becker. And it's are you seeing any signs of weakness in the UK related to anything including Brexit? Jim?","Jim Barber","So David, thanks for that one and Helane, as well. I think I get this question every day quite frankly over the last couple of months. But to give you a little bit of backdrop on it I go back and just remind you of something here. Back in 2008 when we bought LYNX it was our choice in the UK to strengthen that market, to feed the network we talk about a lot and obviously also feed that country and the consumers.","It took us a couple of years to get it done. We were done in 2010 and although we don't talk much about country-level performance I think this question will get us pretty close to it. I could just tell you that from the years 2010 through 2015 that UK operation for us is best-in-class in many ways that we measure our business. So that acquisition and integration that took us about three years has paid dividends for many, many, many years now. Brexit we don't see changing that for that market, quite frankly. Our job is to continue that priority, number one, to take care of that economy and the consumers, our employees and the shareholders and link it into that European network. So that is priority one.","The issue obviously becomes what the free-trade agreement is set up to be. Don't forget a couple of things from my perspective, one is there are many, there's a number of free-trade agreements in that union, as well. You've got the Norway model, you have got the Swiss model and you've got the EU model. So how it unfolds we will see but there are various models that could unfold. We've analyzed scenarios as far left as the WTO setup all the way back to something close to what they have today.","In the end I think our priority is to advise and advocate and support consumers at the free-trade agreements are finalized in the coming years and then continue to whatever happened support that market in the network. I think we could easily say there will be somewhat more complexity but I think our job is to simplify the complex in a network for consumers and continue the great service. And that's what we plan to do as that unfolds.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Ben Hartford, Baird. Please go ahead.","Ben Hartford","Just wondering what your point of view is today on the acquisition environment as you start to lap the Coyote acquisition. Obviously taking into account what you've said historically about acquisition criteria, are there specific segments or verticals that you're more interested in?","And I guess I'm leading you into UPS Freight in particular given some of the softness that we see in that LTL market. Do you think that business is a sufficient scale today or are there potential acquisition opportunities in that segment specifically? Thanks.","David Abney","And I will answer the first part and then you talked a little bit about Coyote so I will ask Alan to briefly hit that and then the LTL environment and Myron will take that. From an acquisition standpoint we have an active process and we're really looking in what I will call just three general buckets that we're always taking a look at. First is new opportunities, new opportunities that would help us to add more value to our customers. And then anytime that we can expand capability within our network, so if it's something that we don't feel as strong about as we'd like to then that would be that second criteria.","And then third, the trade lanes are shifting throughout the world and so geographic presence is always important. Over the last few years the emerging markets has been a place that we've put a lot of attention on."," So adjacent markets which is what we did with the Coyote acquisition, is key on our mind. But at the end of the day whether it's organic growth or its inorganic growth our focus is on growing this business and at the same time having profitable returns. So, from a Coyote standpoint, Alan?","Alan Gershenhorn","Just a quick update on Coyote, certainly their customers and our customers and new customers are responding very well to the new Coyote and UPS combined value prop. For the quarter we continue to see strong year-over-year growth in loads and our gross margin has also expanded for the quarter. As I think we all know the truckload market remained soft but certainly this asset-light model has provided some great flexibility in the up-and-down cycles.","And then just lastly, I will say that as far as the synergies related to the acquisition we're seeing some good work happening there in procurement, asset utilization, cross-selling and then organizational synergies that are benefiting both Coyote and also our U.S. Domestic and Supply Chain & Freight segments and we're on track. And I guess I will turn it over to Myron to talk a little bit about the LTL.","Myron Gray","Ben, as you are well aware the LTL market for the last 16 consecutive months has experienced softness. And our customer base is telling us that they have high inventory levels. In addition to that with high inventory levels the opportunity for restocking is soft as well. All those things considered, we believe that we have the appropriate scale at UPS Freight. We will have and continue to monitor the market and make the appropriate adjustments and make the right business decisions moving forward in terms of whether or not to expand our scale. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Allison Landry, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Allison Landry","Could you speak a little more to your earlier comments about U.S. consumer interest in alternative delivery methods? I wanted to understand how well penetrated it is even in the urban areas and specifically how much you think it would need to increase from here in order to move the needle on density. Thank you.","Alan Gershenhorn","This is Alan. There are a number of things, first of all, that we're doing to improve density. And it's really part of the whole e-commerce value proposition and ecosystem that we've put in place. The UPS Access Points, UPS My Choice, the Synchronized Delivery Solutions and certainly SurePost Redirect which is now at about the 30% of those packages are being redirected back into the Ground network.","On Access Points right now we will probably finish the year at about 27,000 Access Points globally and we continue to expand there. So when you think about bending the cost curve, I guess the 1\/10 contributes to about $200 million in bottom-line cost if we when we increase the density by 1\/10. And then I guess the last thing I will say is we continue to be bullish about Access Points and we're expanding the current model. And as you probably saw we invested in our locker expansion after some tests we ran last year and we're laying in 300 lockers into the United States.","And your point about urban America and urban anywhere in the world, lots of consumers out there have challenges receiving packages at home in urban areas and the Access Points and the lockers is a great solution for them and it also benefits UPS.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of David Ross, Stifel. Please go ahead.","David Ross","You talked a lot about the U.S. and also about Europe. Can you talk a little bit more about Asia and the rest of the world and what you're seeing going on there from a trade perspective?","Jim Barber","Certainly the Asia market it also continues to change. It's the biggest market out there from a China perspective, we currently quite frankly are seeing very, very nice and actually momentum picking up in our middle-market growth based upon the solutions we're providing to the Chinese consumer as their model shifts at the same time. Certainly the network that we have in place has served us well for many years. This quarter overall I think the block hours were down about 0.5%.","You saw in the early opening comments of the call this morning and the releases that the export volume continues to grow at UPS. That includes our Asia-Pacific region as well as our Latin America region at the same time. So we continue on. One of our big focuses out there is our intra-Asia network. It's a great opportunity for us. We laid that in in 2010.","We think it has lots more upside. We will continue to do that and really align that, as well, to the emerging markets strategy that David just referenced a minute ago that we continue to invest in and I'm confident we will be referencing on the calls to come. So I appreciate the question.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Jack Atkins, Stephens. Please go ahead.","Jack Atkins","So I was wondering if you could expand for a moment on your comments around B2B trends. You referenced in the press release that B2C group grew five times that of B2B but could you maybe comment exactly what the growth rate was for B2B in the quarter, what portion of your U.S. Domestic Package business B2B makes up now and what customer verticals are you seeing particular strength and weakness on the B2B side? Thank you.","Alan Gershenhorn","On the commercial B2B side we did see a slight increase. The good news is we've seen a slight increase the last few quarters there. It's mainly being driven actually by the retail sector and returns but we're seeing some growth in some other areas. Wholesale, healthcare and professional services are some of the other areas and then also consumer and home goods. As you know industrial production, as David indicated, was pretty soft and B2B is really being driven now by retail and some of those other sectors that I have spoken about.","I think our investments really in some of these sectors including healthcare are helping us gain share in that particular area. So kind of outrun the economic challenges. Then, lastly, our B2C business is about 45% of our business today.","David Abney","Okay, the next question will come from online. And the question and this was from the buy side, is do you see any long term opportunities to expand streamlined delivery routes with the ride sharing programs. So Alan?","Alan Gershenhorn","I think again everyone knows on a call that we made a strategic enterprise fund investment a few quarters back in a company named Deliv which is a retail-to-consumer same-day B2C delivery company that actually uses the excess capacity out there in the market with people that have vehicles that want to participate in that program, similar to what's happening on the ride sharing part of the economy there. They are a leader in this new space and we're excited to learn more from that.","The other thing I would say is that Coyote is really a technology platform that's doing the same thing. It's matching up excess capacity in the marketplace from thousands upon thousands of carriers that have backhaul excess capacity and we're providing a similar service with Coyote. So we're excited about that in the heavier truckload type business as well as for prospects potentially on the pickup and delivery side.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Kelly Dougherty, Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Kelly Dougherty","I just wanted to think about the U.S. domestic volume growth. Obviously it seems like prime are driving demand for more premium products, but would love to get some insight on how other retails are pursuing e-commerce, if they are offering free shipping on some or all spending levels. Do you expect that will show up more in your Deferred offerings? That certainly didn't seem to be the case this quarter. I'm just trying to get a sense of what you think the volume and maybe the revenue mix will be as e-commerce grows.","Alan Gershenhorn","A couple of points on your question. First the holiday offerings here in July were pretty widespread amongst a whole number of retailers. And I think we will see more and more of that, certainly in this summer time frame but also in other parts of the year, to drive growth in the e-commerce sector for these retailers which is critically important for them.","Certainly the e-commerce growth drives significant growth in our Ground business and our SurePost business and then on the overnight and Deferred side mainly in the Saver and the Second Day Air business. But the key here is that we've got this great portfolio, so when a customer absolutely has to have it they are usually willing to pay for that and we have the full gamut of services to get those goods to them when they want it and we have the more economical alternatives along with some of the value ads like UPS Access Point, UPS My Choice and omnichannel that really drive those retailers and those consumers to UPS. Thanks for the question.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Rob Salmon, Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Rob Salmon","I guess this is a piggybacking on Kelly's question. Can you walk us through some of the factors that were impacting U.S. Domestic Package Deferred volume and yield trends which have diverged a little bit from the rest of the U.S. Domestic portfolio with volumes down a little bit but yields up year on year? And if you could specifically address if we're seeing the impact of any large customers changing their delivery methodologies that are impacting Deferred trends?","Alan Gershenhorn","First, our premium Next Day Air products grew at nearly 6% and the Ground was up more than 2%. So certainly our customers are responding to the continual expansion of our Next Day Air and our Next Day Early service to more postal codes. In fact, all of our Next Day Air services experienced growth.","On the other hand, Saver, Ground and SurePost and certainly Deferred are focused more on the e-commerce and retail customers. And so on the Deferred side you really need to look at it on a two-year stacked basis we almost grew 15% following strong double-digit growth in 2015. Thanks for the question.","Operator","And the last question in queue at this time will come from the line of Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ravi Shanker","I'm going to try and squeeze in two follow-ups if I can. The first one is on 2017, so between the FX hedges rolling off and the Ground growth costs do you think EBIT can be higher in 2017 versus 2016? And the second question is on Amazon do you feel like your delivery share with them has held constant or is it up or down in the last 12 months?","Richard Peretz","This is Richard and I will start with the first question on the guidance for 2017. I think the important thing is as we had said that as we move forward we have continued initiatives that will continue to improve the operating margin. That being said obviously different segments things will happen and growth rates might have to be adjusted. It's a little early to talk about exactly what's going to happen. And that's really because there's a lot of things going on in volatility of currency, too. So the year here we're in end of July we have time still and if you tell me where in November the dollar\/euro is or the sterling\/dollar that will be a lot about the story of how much variation, that's why we say the plus or minus numbers.","An important thing is that we have a plan, it will improve by segment. Our first priority is to reinvest in this business because of the strength of the Company. We continue to deliver the highest ROIC and the highest margins in the business and our plan is to continue to do that. We will continue to do that while at the same time having dividends of over 3% or around 3%. So as we get closer to the 2017 I will guide you appropriately but we're in the middle of putting all those plans together.","And your second question around the percentage of our share of any one customer is something that we obviously continue to win customers based on our strategy to win customers. We don't comment on any one customer but you can see our volume growth for the U.S. was up about 2.5%.","You adjust for fuel we saw revenue growth about 3.4%, so it was a strong quarter. We laid out for you how we think the fourth quarter is going to look and that's another strong quarter. And we're going to end up delivering on the guidance numbers that we gave you at the beginning of the year and I think that's the most important thing.","David Abney","Okay, we have one last question and this is an online question from Tyler Brown. And it's about return logistics, reverse logistics and kind of two parts. Could you talk about what kind of growth rates you're seeing in return volumes? And talk a little bit about our capabilities on this front and do we need to do something to add to our capabilities. So Alan, if you would take that.","Alan Gershenhorn","As I said earlier returns growth has been strong, it's in the mid-teens. And as you all know returns is very good business for us because customers tend to drop those packages off, so we have high density pickups at those drop-off locations and then high density deliveries back to the retailers. UPS has some of the most technology-advanced transportation return services with things like Returns on the Web, RS1, RS3 print label return.","So when it comes to label generation, shipping, tracking, visibility, enabling speedy refunds for the consumers for customer experience we've got some of the best returns solutions in the business. Combine that with the UPS Stores, the UPS Access Points, the lockers, the other alliance partners, UPS drop boxes, there are millions of packages being returned or being delivered to those drop-off locations casting that wide net. And again I just tie that back to the whole e-commerce ecosystem that we have that really benefits retailers and consumers and makes UPS the e-commerce transportation Company of choice. Thanks to the question.","Operator","I would now like to turn the program back over to Mr. Childress. Please go ahead, sir.","Scott Childress","Thanks, Stephen. I want to thank everyone for submitting an online question today and for your interest in UPS. If you submitted a question that did not get answered please reach out to the investor relations team or myself after the call. Now I will turn the call to David for his closing comments. David?","David Abney","So UPS performed well in the second quarter. We expanded our margins in our International and in our Domestic small package business. And very importantly we're investing today to ensure our future performance. So we're at the halfway point of the year. So to UPSers, this is half-time.","And we have had a good first half, we were on plan but it's very important and we're all committed to our plans and confident in our 2016 guidance. So on behalf of the 435,000 UPSers around the world, thank you for your time today and for all of you thank you for investing in UPS. Thank you very much.","Operator","That does conclude our call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations' First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] It is now our pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Andy Dolny, UPS Treasurer and Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.","Andy Dolny","Good morning. Today, I'm joined by Scott Davis, our CEO; and Kurt Kuehn, our CFO, to discuss the company's results for the quarter and future expectations.","Before they begin, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the company. These anticipated results are subject to risk and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2011 Form 10-K report. This report is available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the Securities and Exchange Commission. ","Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures and free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, are explained in the schedules that accompanied our earnings news release. These schedules are also available on the UPS Investor Relations website in the Financials section.","In March, UPS announced it reached an agreement to acquire TNT Express. Although we expect the transaction to close before the end of the year, any guidance that we provide will not include the results of TNT operations nor any synergies or integration expense associated with the acquisition.","As always, today's call is being webcast and is also available on the UPS Investor Relations website. [Operator Instructions] I thank you in advance for your cooperation. ","Now let me turn it over to Scott.","D. Scott Davis","Thanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone. 2012 is off to a good start for a couple of reasons. First, we announced our intention to acquire TNT Express, an investment that will contribute to our growth for many years to come. ","Secondly, looking more near-term, first quarter results built upon momentum from last year. We continue to see strong demand from UPS products and services, especially in the U.S. and Europe. Both the U.S. Domestic and Supply Chain and Freight segments delivered double-digit profit growth in the quarter. ","Back in January, we discussed that expectations for the U.S. economy were improving, especially compared to the rest of the world. During the quarter, the most positive news has come from the U.S. where indications of economic rebound are evident. Retail sales have grown faster than expected, and the employment environment has improved. ","On the other hand, economies in other parts of the world continue to face challenges. Europe struggles under austerity measures, and slowing growth persists out of Asia. ","Despite this, we continue to see our export volume in both Europe and intra-Asia perform well. UPS is executing on its strategy of investing to grow with the announcement of 2 acquisitions. ","First, in February, we acquired the European consumer delivery company, Kiala. Its retail delivery network and unique technology will benefit UPS, as we continue to look for ways to serve the growing B2C market, especially outside the U.S. As you know, last month, UPS announced an offer to acquire TNT Express. While we have not closed on the transaction, we have made initial contact with the regulators. ","UPS remains confident it will receive all required approvals. The acquisition of TNT will diversify our global revenue, increasing our portfolio of solutions and expanding our geographic footprint. We're excited about the prospects of adding such a strong and respected company to the UPS family. ","During the quarter, UPS received accolades from a number of organizations for our reputation, ethics and brand. One of the more widely recognized honors we received was the #1 ranking with Fortune Magazine as our industry's most admired company. This is the 27th time UPS has received this recognition in the 31 years the award has been given. ","Also during the quarter, UPS My Choice, the B2C solution we introduced in October, surpassed 1 million subscribers. UPS has received a positive response from customers, as they enjoy unprecedented levels of visibility and control over their deliveries. ","Before I turn it over to Kurt, I want to congratulate the almost 6,000 members of the UPS Circle of Honor: Individuals who have achieved 25 years or more of accident-free driving. In fact, this year, we recognized our first driver to surpass the 50-year milestone. That's truly amazing. This is just one example of how these drivers and the rest of the approximately 400,000 UPS's around the world contribute to our company's success. ","As you can see, 2012 is off to a good start. UPS continues to be a global leader, investing for growth, developing innovative solutions and continuing to build on our corporate legacy. ","With that, let me turn it over to Kurt to review the results for the quarter.","Kurt P. Kuehn","Well, thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Yes, we are off to a good start. Daily package volume for the quarter was up a strong 4.3%, as online shipping continued the rapid growth seen last quarter. Boosted by strong results from the U.S. Domestic and Supply Chain and Freight segments, earnings per share grew 10%. ","Let's take a look at the segments. Operating profit for the U.S. Domestic segment jumped 13% on revenue growth of 6.1%. Operating margin expanded by 70 basis points to the highest first quarter margin for this segment since 2008. ","Our package volume increased 4.5%. Deferred products were up 10%, as online retailers clearly recognize the value of using our network to expedite the movement of goods to their customers. ","Our Next Day Air volume increased 5%, with Next Day package up 6.5%. And some gains in letter volume, something, frankly, we've not seen in many quarters. ","Our Next Day Saver product was the primary source of growth, as residential deliveries for large e-commerce shippers continued to expand. Ground shipments rose 4%, with approximately half of the growth resulting from a 30% increase in lightweight products. These solutions are proving to be very popular with our customers and are creating connectivity to other UPS products. ","As we saw in the fourth quarter, the strong demand for saver and lightweight products, like SurePost, impacted yield growth. Base pricing was up about 2.5% to 3%, but it was somewhat offset by changes in product and customer mix that I just discussed. ","The impact on yields will begin to moderate as we wrap the buildout of our SurePost launch. This will become most evident by the fourth quarter. Keep in mind, while these trends negatively impact yield, they do have a positive impact on our cost to serve and on our capital consumption. ","Direct labor hours, block hours and miles driven all increased at a rate significantly less [ph] than the 4.5% volume growth. Operating leverage was also apparent in the quarter, as we continue to improve efficiency, benefiting from productivity gains, greater economies of scale and a mild winter. ","Now turning to the International segment. Although we face some challenges, primarily due to shifting trade patterns, our international export volume continues to perform well, up 5.4%. Average daily volume comparisons did benefit by about 1% due to year-over-year differences in local operating days. ","Looking at the regions, exports increased at a mid-single digit pace for both Europe and the Americas. However, our long higher-yielding lanes out of Asia were relatively flat. We also saw European shippers increasing their reliance on our standard products. ","International yield growth was flat, as the benefits from the fuel surcharge and base rate increases were offset by the impact of shorter trade lanes, changes in product mix and the impact to currency. ","On a currency-neutral basis, yield was up 2%. The International segment operating profit came in at $408 million. Currency translation and rising fuel costs accounted for over 1\/3 of the $45 million decline, although our operating margin of 13.8% remains industry-leading. ","Moving onto Supply Chain and Freight. Operating profits increased substantially, up 19%, with forwarding and distribution leading the way. The segment did receive a $9 million benefit from the sale of a surplus facility. ","Revenue for the Forwarding business declined due to lower tonnage in yields, as excess capacity remained in the market. However, operating profit and margin improved due to growth in customized solutions and brokerage services in addition to improved productivity. ","The Distribution business saw profit expansion in an environment of increased investment in health care capabilities. UPS expects to add 5 new health care compliant facilities this year around the world, bringing our total to 38 dedicated facilities. ","And what is typically the most challenging quarter for the industry, our UPS Freight unit broke even. Tonnage declines were offset by higher revenue per 100 weight and improved productivity. ","Looking now at cash and our balance sheet. UPS generated $1.8 billion in free cash flow during the period. Capital expenditures were $417 million, including the delivery of 3 additional 767s, bringing our total fleet count to 226 aircraft. In the quarter, the company repurchased more than 7 million shares for approximately $550 million. Less than expected, as internal guidelines caused us to restrict purchases during the TNT acquisition negotiations. ","As UPS prepares to close on this transaction, we are reviewing multiple alternatives for financing. Although our plans are not yet finalized, we remain committed to the preservation of a strong balance sheet and our dividend approach. And under any scenario, we do expect significant share repurchases in 2012 and beyond. We are evaluating our options and will update you on our decision. ","Regarding guidance. UPS is right where we expected to be at the end of the first quarter, so our full year guidance remains unchanged. We anticipate 2012 diluted earnings per share of between $4.75 to $5, which represents a 9% to 15% increase over 2011. I do, however, want to take a couple of minutes to provide more insight into the remaining quarters.","On a consolidated basis, second quarter earnings per share is anticipated to grow at a similar pace to the first quarter. Third quarter earnings per share growth should be a bit lower due to one less operating day compared to last year's. And we expect fourth quarter earnings to grow at the fastest pace. This is due to the operating leverage generated by peak season volume growth and our proven ability to efficiently process e-commerce shipments. ","Our guidance for the U.S. Domestic segment remains consistent with what we told you back in January. For the full year, we expect to generate high single-digit operating profit growth. Although our expectations are for 2% to 3% base pricing, yield growth will be muted by changes in product and customer mix. And we do anticipate average volume growth of 3.5% to 4%, with air growing slightly faster than ground. ","Turning now to International. For the second quarter, we expect revenue trends to be similar to the first. Local day comparisons will negatively impact reported daily volume growth, a reversal of what we saw in the first quarter. Although we expect operating profit to improve compared to the first quarter, it will be relatively flat to last year. ","Beyond the second quarter, year-over-year comparison should improve. For the second half of 2012, we expect operating profit growth in the mid-teens on high single-digit revenue improvement. ","Regarding Supply Chain and Freight, we expect second quarter revenue growth to be similar to the first quarter and operating margin to be relatively flat compared to last year. ","Looking at the second half of 2012, we anticipate operating profit growth of mid- to high-teens on high single-digit revenue growth. ","So all in all, we're off to a good start to what should be an exciting year for UPS. Although market dynamics continue to change, UPS will benefit by adapting to them. Whether it's e-commerce growth, shifting trade patterns or demographic changes, UPS has the capabilities to meet the challenges. ","Thanks for listening this morning. And now, Scott and I will be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question will come from the line of Mr. Chris Wetherbee of Citi.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, maybe a question, I guess, on the yield side. I just wanted to kind of tease out a little bit of the mix kind of impact as you go forward here and think about it. Is it 2Q and 3Q before 4Q you start to see a little bit of improvement where we can actually see that core yield growing in the kind of 2% to 3% range?","Kurt P. Kuehn","Yes. Certainly, the dramatic impact we've seen in our lightweight products has changed the shape of what you guys see anyway. The -- but the core underlying philosophy we have for pricing has not changed. On an account-by-account basis, our discipline and approach is the same. Individual customers are all being reviewed, and we are executing our normal yield processes. And if you look at Q4, really, the trends, if you take out fuel surcharge changes, the trends are really pretty stable. The only product, really, that sees any notable difference in changes, our Next Day product, where the substantial growth of the Saver product, which is the afternoon delivery, does come in at a lower yield, but generates substantially lower cost and so profits are good. But to answer your question directly, yes, what you really see is, as we just really initiated the SurePost at the beginning of last year, it ramped up and really began to hit its stride in Q4. So the year-over-year comps will moderate over the year. In Q4, you'll see more of the core underlying base rates that we've talked about.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Nate Brochmann of William Blair.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I wanted to talk a little bit just on that question strategically. I mean, obviously, you have the benefits of the integrated network and probably can ship pretty easily. But what are you having to do with the network to kind of accommodate the new SurePost product? And how do you kind of adjust the rest of the network to accommodate the faster pace of e-commerce that's obviously growing pretty rapidly?","Kurt P. Kuehn","Yes, I think the thing that gives us some confidence that this is actually a positive trend for UPS is that with the deep integration we've done of these products through every component of our business, it flows through very smoothly, it utilizes existing assets and the incremental impact on the network is minimal. As we mentioned, our hours, our miles and those things are just barely up for the quarter, even though we showed some of the strongest volume growth you've seen in some time. Another great proof point of that is, I guess, if you look at the compensation and benefits, it's up 4% over year-on-year on 4% volume increase. So we are able to process this volume very efficiently, and the incremental impact on expense and capital is very minimal.","D. Scott Davis","And, Nate, I think things we're doing, like the My Choice, helps us get that delivery there the first time, has the consumer take control of it and get the delivery the first time. Kiala, the acquisition in Europe, looks at alternative delivery. Location's the same thing. We are having more deliveries, helps the density as opposed to the one package to one house. So the variety of things we're doing is helping that.","Kurt P. Kuehn","So it's an interesting time for us. We are seeing changing mix and at a rate that's more frequent and more significant than you'd normally seen. The core underlying momentum of the business remains very steady and our approach to the market is unchanged. Layering on top of that then, though is this rapid expansion of products frankly, that we haven't competed for in the past.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to touch on, I think, the kind of broader topic you're talking about here with B2C and the impact as well. If I look at fourth quarter, I think you've seen a pretty big favorable impact for B2C growth. And you see that in the deferred air, certainly. And you had a very strong incremental margin. I calculate just simply on the Domestic Package, 52%. It seems that your mix effect is probably similar in first quarter with a lot of growth in B2C. But the incremental margin shows up as 25% in Domestic Package. So I'm wondering if you can just talk about what the differences in the 2 would be. Because I guess looking at margin performance, that kind of helps us figure out whether it's good business or how good the business is that you're bringing on.","Kurt P. Kuehn","Yes, Tom, it's a lot of moving parts to try to decompose incremental margin quarter-to-quarter, I guess. And clearly, we talked at some length about the Q4 and the process there. Certainly, in Q4, these trends were even more extreme. And as we mentioned during December, over half of our volume in aggregate was B2C. We feel good about the domestic margin expansion. We saw a full 70-basis point expansion. We expect margin expansion to continue with these trends.","D. Scott Davis","I think, typically, Tom, you're going to see that kind of change from Q4 to Q1. There's certainly some seasonality to that.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Would you think that incremental margin would accelerate then through the 2012? Or it's more of kind of fourth quarter is just different than you see in any of other quarters?","Kurt P. Kuehn","We're more focused on overall total margin improving than the calculation of the incremental margin quarter-to-quarter. We are confident that we're going to continue to increase the margins on the domestic side and work towards our long-term target.","D. Scott Davis","Yes, I think, as we said in January as far as our margin goals domestically, we feel extremely confident, frankly, a little ahead of target right now.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Maybe I can come at that a little bit differently. Just it\u2019s typically the first quarter is impacted by weather and you obviously didn't have that this year. Yet, the volumes in the first quarter were the highest you've posted kind of relative to the rest of the year. So what occurs in the first quarter that pushes your overall margins to be the lowest? Again, I just want to dig into the understanding of that incremental concept of why we see this lower, given the beneficial weather and environment?","Kurt P. Kuehn","Well, we did see significant improvements in margin. Q1, historically, is a tougher year. You still have winter weather and lower aggregated volumes typically versus the year spend overall. I mean, certainly there are some headwinds in the quarter. Fuel was a bit of a headwind with the rising fuel and the like and the surcharge. We do have some increased pension expenses, although, we'll see those all year, and that's in our guidance. So we're pretty comfortable with the 70-basis point improvement. Q1 is not typical of the entire year, and we expect to see margin continuing to increase over that. On the flip side, clearly, the -- we did -- this was a pretty benign weather period for Q1, and that helped to offset some of the things that I just mentioned. So we're pretty pleased just on, domestically, we're getting back to margins that we've not seen since early '08, and we expect them to continue to grow.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So just to understand that, there is something in the first quarter that keeps it lower than what you see in second and third quarter, despite volume declines on a relative basis in 2 and 3Q relative to what you see in the first quarter.","Kurt P. Kuehn","Historically, yes, Q1 is a challenging quarter for us in domestic because of the weather. As is Q3, usually the most challenging quarter in the international because of European holidays. So I think if you look those are pretty typical seasonal pattern.","Andy Dolny","[Operator Instructions]","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Ben Hartford of Baird.","Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I just wanted to talk about international and thinking about it over the course of the next 2 or 3 years, the margin performance in particular. In the release, you talked about changing product mix in shifting trade patterns as being one of the contributing factors to the margin declines year-over-year. So just trying to get a handle around how big of an impact that's going to be, given the changes in trade patterns expected going forward. And if we can kind of talk about it irrespective of TNT and just think about kind of shorter lengths of haul or changing lengths of haul, and what impact that might have over the next 2 or 3 years in terms of progress toward what you had talked about, I guess, late last year at the Analyst Day in terms of the ability to get back to 18-plus percent margins in the segment.","Kurt P. Kuehn","Yes, clearly, it is a moving target right now. And we have seen, really, for the last 3 quarters, I guess, Asia be a bit of a challenge. It at least was more or less of a breakeven this quarter. So we did see an impact where the long-distance highest yield lanes, mainly Asia to Europe and the U.S., were relatively flat. Whereas we saw robust growth on intra-Asia and the European volumes, most of the exports, which tend to stay in the continent. I think over the medium term, we adjust all those in our combination of an air and ground network, allows us to create economic value out of both. Certainly, the capital demands of the intra-European volume are much less than dedicated high-value of assets flying 6,000, 7,000 miles. Although it does create challenges as those transitions happen. So we feel pretty good actually that we're in great shape to handle that. Whether it's regional trade patterns across North America or Europe, we can adapt and certainly be profitable. But it does have some impact on margins in the transition.","D. Scott Davis","Yes, I think, longer-term, I think global trade is going to stay strong. I don't think you're going to see, long term, these trade flows change that dramatically. I think some of that Asia impact clearly has been weaker consumer demand in Europe than in last year, consumer demand in the U.S. which is picking up now. So I think we're fairly optimistic. You're going to see later this year some of the Asia export numbers start picking up again. So I think this is kind of a temporary predicament we're in right now.","Kurt P. Kuehn","Yes, and I guess, just to reinforce, we are not sitting on our hands just watching these patterns change and not reacting. We are continuing to make network adjustments. We've -- if you look year-over-year, we've taken our Asia capacity down about 10%. We have some additional things that have been rolled out to maintain the kind of service levels we want, but at the same time, reduce our exposure. We continue to show great growth within our European capabilities, but we're also cautious. And so we have a number of operating cost initiatives there. We have seen some increase in consumers' choice of our lower-value products. And so there is definitely some trade down, which over time, is -- it can be adjusted because things like time of day and those, we reduce our cost, but it does require aggressive cost focus to get there. And at the same time, we're looking at revenue management strategies to make sure that we are extracting the value we should and being paid for the services. So there's a number of initiatives in the international to adapt. And we do -- clearly, we're not thrilled with the Q1 performance in international. It was a challenging quarter for us and, I think, for most players. But we've got pretty good plans and that's why we're confident in our results going forward.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Ed Wolfe of Wolfe Trahan.","Edward M. Wolfe - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Outside of the mix issues with SurePost, it does seem like domestic volumes, particularly the Next Day Air, particularly spiked in the first quarter while the yields declined. Is there some intentional market share gains you're looking for in the Next Day Air? And can you talk to SurePost? And is that all recorded within ground? Or is there some of that, that impacts what the yields might look like in any of the air products?","Kurt P. Kuehn","Ed, I think there is some indirect benefit. I mean, SurePost is just one product in the portfolio. And I think as we've mentioned since we first introduced this, it is part of an overall combined value propositions for customers. So typically, for every SurePost product, there's 5 or 6 other packages through our traditional ground service or our air products. So there is some portfolio benefit, I guess. But we did see the e-commerce momentum that is clearly pushing our results right now, ripple through both to air and ground. I think in the fourth quarter, we talked about that being a big impact on our deferred air, as a lot of the premium retailers are taking advantage of the time-definite services. We're also seeing some of that ripple into the Next Day also. And it did create surprisingly strong growth in our Next Day product. The vast majority of that, as I said, is our Next Day Saver, which has no time-of-day commitment. So it really looks and feels to us like a traditional ground product, but it relies in our air network. So it is a good product for us. It doesn't have the kind of high delivery cost that a time-committed air product does. So we're very confident that it is good volume for us and that we can handle those e-commerce shippers' needs very appropriately.","D. Scott Davis","Yes, Ed, as Kurt said, clearly, the big change was I think the large online retailers looking for that competitive advantage and going to the Next Day Saver product. We are focused on that base rate 2% to 3% increase, and we're holding to that.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Jeff Kauffman of Sterne Agee.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","The big mix shifts going around and the previous 2 questions have addressed this as well. I think you did a great job, saying, okay, what's going on in Southeast Asia we think was kind of a shorter term issue related to consumerism. But how much of the mix shift and the shift down the product chain do you think is structural and kind of a longer-term fact of life, which it's sounding more like the U.S. is as opposed to just shorter term, this trade lane wasn't here or customers were just a little bit conservative with their product choices in a tough economy.","Kurt P. Kuehn","I don't think we're overly concerned on that, Jeff. I mean, clearly, Europe is a bit of a wildcard right now. So that's probably the area where there's the most movement. It's also a market that's not as mature for product differentiation. What we call our standard product, in a lot of cases, exceeds the delivery commitments of other companies' express products. So there may be some settling on it. But I don't -- we don't see this as a big risk. It's more a matter of adapting and having the appropriate capacity, both for the overnight services and then the definite [ph] services. So we don't see it as a long-term risk, I think. It's more of just a bit of a moving target. And as economies -- economic conditions get challenging, we do see customers tightening up a little bit and extending their time commitments and to save a little money on transportation.","D. Scott Davis","But what is not changing though is the growth of B2C. And that really benefits the small-package industry, and we're going to benefit from that. And that's some -- where you've seen some of the package volume grow. Now our job is to figure out the best way to serve that. And that's why we did the Kiala acquisition to help with the density on residential shipments on alternative delivery locations. That's why we did My Choice. So that trend will not change going forward.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Can you guys put some numbers around the sequential shift in B2C? You talked about 50% of domestic in December. I guess I'm just trying to get at this in a different way and get a handle on back to Tom's question. Has that shifted and incremental margins move down sequentially? I guess I'm trying to understand if some of this business that's come on in the B2C space is coming on at discounted pricing because you're getting good volume through your network from like an Amazon Prime or somebody like that who's able to deliver big volume, and so it gives you good utilization, but you're willing to take a step down on the pricing on that product in order to get that and maybe get a foot in the door to raise price in a better time period. So I'm trying to understand how that mixed shift is working and the sequential change in the B2C percentage.","Kurt P. Kuehn","Well, we are seeing some market shifts in the customer composition in the B2C space. Clearly, there has been consolidation. If you look back 5 years ago or more, there were more numerous players all vying to create market share in the B2C. And we have seen both some of the big traditional retailers become much more focused on it and some of the pure plays, like you mentioned. So, no, there is absolutely a large customer impact right now. We're seeing overall greater growth in large customers and small customers that does tend to reduce yields, but they also bring significant economies of scale, both in direct expense and in support expense because we can connect electronically to them. So that is a trend very much that's in place. Larger customers in general are outperforming. We've talked before about small business and the challenges they're facing. Nonetheless, across-the-board, on our revenue management, we are managing the customers and extracting base rate increases.","D. Scott Davis","Again, this is not a new trend. Back in September at our investor conference, we shared with you our long-term targets for domestic operating profit growth and domestic margin growth, and we're right on target. So I feel very confident with those long-term targets.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Art Hatfield of Raymond James.","Arthur W. Hatfield - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I was going to ask about the mixed shift, but I'm going to move on from that. I want to move on to the margins in Supply Chain and Freight. If I recall, and I can't remember what you said recently, but over the long haul, you always had a focus on that kind of high single-digits, roughly 7% -- I think 7% to 8%. You're kind of there in Q1. Can you talk a little bit about how you feel about where those margins are now in Supply Chain and Freight? And if you think you can get those up to double-digit levels?","Kurt P. Kuehn","Yes, thanks, Art, for giving us something else to talk about here. No, we feel pretty good that this capability we built of an integrated Supply Chain and Freight offering is continuing to pay some dividends. We -- margins were very strong in the quarter. Although, clearly, the growth was more muted, as some of the buy rates on the forwarding side have come down over time. And we were able to adjust and adapt and taking cost out. So we feel great on that front. The distribution group is a great asset. We are investing right now, but we've been able to maintain decent margins there, even with the headwind of deep investment in health care. And then our UPS Freight group clearly has a lot of opportunity going forward. Their results were relatively flat in this quarter, but we're making great progress on differentiating ourselves and trying to strike a balance between being a disciplined yield player and still generating good growth.","D. Scott Davis","And that's what makes it -- that margin that much greater because when freight starts kicking in, then you can see better margins there.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Hey, I just -- I'm sorry to beat this dead horse, but I just want to understand when you have conversations with your customers and they're considering moving to a SurePost or a product like that, how does this conversation go? Because I think all of us sort of look at this and say, it's not just the yield mix risk, there's a profit risk mix as well. And I know you're aware of sort of the risks there. But how do you ensure that you can keep defenses up and keep premium ground. Because ground is so good for you that I'd think by offering your SurePost, you'd create some risk of cannibalization of your own very good business. So how do you manage that? How do you think about that?","Kurt P. Kuehn","Yes, I think, Bill, it's a portfolio management issue. I mean, we've always faced that issue as having such an integrated network. It's very easy for customers to move from 8:00 a.m. air to 10:30 to Saver to 2-day air products to ground. So it's not a new concept at all for us. And I think, if anything, we've had a lot of experience. We do -- the SurePost is one piece of a puzzle, but what it really is, is it's giving us now a relevance in a very lightweight in to the market than in a lot of cases where we weren't relevant before. So there's always cannibalization risk. But at the same time, we're continuing to differentiate our ground product. If you use SurePost, you can't take the advantages of the great UPS pickup and delivery network as much, you don't have the capabilities with My Choice to redirect deliveries. So it's a multi-tiered strategy of differentiating the UPS ground product, but at the same time, offering a different alternative for very lightweight, low-value shipment. So is there risk to it? Absolutely. Do we talk about those things? Those are critical marketing issues, and the appropriate approach is what we've done from years, is to create differences across our product line, price those appropriately and then let customers take advantage of it. So the vast majority of what we're seeing is new volume coming in that we hadn't been really targeting. Is there some transition from our basic product, which was a start on this into SurePost? Absolutely. But in aggregate, it's bringing more volume in all fronts across rather than cannibalizing.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. David Vernon of Sanford Bernstein.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","You talked a little bit about pulling down buybacks in the quarter. Can we expect that to get made up in the second and third quarter? Can you give us a little bit more insight as to what you're expecting on that front?","Kurt P. Kuehn","Yes, we -- once we got hot and heavy on the discussions with TNT, it was appropriate for us to restrict our purchases in the market. Fortunately, we had put in some accelerated share repurchases before that started. So we weren't -- we were able to at least continue to purchase that reasonable amount of shares. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are revisiting a number of alternatives for how we finance and structure the acquisition -- pending acquisition of TNT. And we do expect to reach conclusion on that in the not too distant future. We intend to maintain a very strong balance sheet. Our dividend policy will remain unchanged. But we are reviewing the purchase -- the repurchase strategy. And we do expect to be a significant buyer of stock under all scenarios. But at least at this point, we're not ready to lock in guidance as far as repurchases in the short to medium term. We'll give you guys an update on that not too far in the future.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Peter Nesvold of Jefferies.","H. Peter Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So if I take a step back, earnings were up 10% year-over-year this quarter. The midpoint of the range implies 12% earnings growth. So you've got to grow low teens for the rest of the year. And there are a lot of different moving parts. You've identified a number of them. And I promise I'm not asking you to write my note for me. But could you rank prioritize let's say the 3 key bullet points why is year-over-year earnings growth going to accelerate as this year progresses? Because it does seem that you had some tailwinds, so whether it's productivity from good weather in the U.S. or additional operating days in Asia.","Kurt P. Kuehn","Yes, although Andy said he would volunteer to write your note for you. He just wants you to know.","H. Peter Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I don't think my boss would let me, but...","Kurt P. Kuehn","Yes, no, as we said, we actually are right on target for what we expected. There may be a couple of you that got a little ahead, but it's -- there's not dramatic differences, I think. We do have some headwinds with fuel moving up a little bit this quarter and the currency wasn't particularly friendly. Those things -- we expect currency, clearly, to moderate with our hedges in place. So the international gets a little bit of help there. We do expect our ability to adjust and adapt to the international, so we're going to -- we showed negative earnings declines in Q1 for international. We do not expect those going forward. We're going to see improved results. And the business momentum, we feel is strong. I mean we feel great about what's going on in the Domestic business, 13% profit improvement. We feel the momentum in the Domestic business continues unabated. So we feel good about the U.S. economy. And we also saw some stability and firming in Asia, I think, in March and into April anyway. So we feel, in general, positive and think that the guidance is appropriate.","D. Scott Davis","Yes, I think when we gave the guidance in January, we talked about tough comparisons for forwarding and for international package in the first half of the year. Obviously, Asia fell off in August of last year, and the comps get much easier in the second half of the year for both the international package and forwarding. So like I say -- as Kurt said, we're right on target where we thought we'd be at this point in time.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of John Barnes of RBC Capital Markets.","John L. Barnes - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just in looking at this specific quarter and the next couple of quarters. Can you elaborate at all, were there any costs associated with what you have done on TNT? And any costs associated with the expansion of airfreight capacity that you mentioned in your press release around Latin America that you can quantify, that would have impacted this specific quarter that might not be there on an ongoing basis? Kind of startup costs or onetime in nature, as you kind of tackle those 2 issues.","Kurt P. Kuehn","Clearly, we got a lot of people spending a lot of time in airplanes and other activities, John. But at least in the scheme of the scope of UPS, I'd hate to characterize those things as anything but negligible. We do have expenses everyday. Clearly, the Kiala acquisition, we've got work we're doing on that to build the capability across the globe. But in the scheme of things, most of that is not material. And the bulk of the expenses, clearly, with the potential TNT acquisition will be in Q2, Q3. And as it gets to be material, we will discuss and give you guys clarity around those. So at this point, they're more of a rounding issue.","John L. Barnes - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And in the expansion in Latin America?","Kurt P. Kuehn","Just -- well, that's just part of our overall dynamic air fleet network. It does add some expense as we add capacity there. But once again, not enough to hugely move the needle. But that's -- I mean, some of the steps we make now will position us well and that's part of why we're giving the guidance we are going forward.","D. Scott Davis","The biggest drag on international clearly was fuel cost, it was currency and slow growth out of Asia.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just want to come back to this Next Day Saver product that you guys are definitely showing quite a bit of growth in. It's been my understanding that, at least historically, some of your highest cost operations are delivering those Next Day packages to residential addresses. So how is that levering into your network here where you can get similar profit profile on those new packages?","Kurt P. Kuehn","That's a great question. And that is really why the Saver distinction is so critical for residential. It is very challenging for us or anybody to work their way out to a residential suburban area and make an 8:00 a.m. commitment. Or in some cases, even a 10:30 commitment. You do what we call break trace. You go off the optimal travel path or you have to have a dedicated driver driving it out there. With the Saver agreement, we get it there next-day guaranteed, but we have the flexibility to deliver it in the afternoon. So we're able to deliver that package during the normal optimal trace that all of our great operational technology tells us we should. But there's a dramatic reduction in operating expense in return for not having that early-morning commitment. Most consumers aren't driving to get the thing first thing in the morning. If they are, then the product would not be Saver. So it's a great way to generate next-day air yields, but have a minimal impact on the pickup and delivery operation and utilize our integrated network. One other interesting anecdote, which I mentioned earlier, was we did see growth in our letter products that we are seeing a beginning of an uptick in refinancing applications in the mortgage industry. So that's another nice trend that has taken letters from being negative to positive and that this is the first quarter in some time that we've seen that.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. David Campbell of Thompson, Davis & Company.","David P. Campbell - Thompson, Davis & Company","During your initial comments, you said the international trends and revenue trends in the second quarter would be like the first quarter. But there's been substantial rate increases, sea freight and some in airfreight, and some, as you mentioned, firming in the Asia-Pacific market. So I'm kind of surprised that the revenue growth will be the same as the first quarter.","Kurt P. Kuehn","Well, there -- the first quarter was almost -- you can almost split the first quarter into half as far as the airfreight market. We were very disappointed in January results. And then, February didn't fully compensate for it. So it was a challenging period. In March, as some of the big product launches came out, then there was an improvement in demand and yields did move up. So it's hard that the first quarter was really a tale of 2 different cycles any way. We've seen demand stabilize a bit. Although I don't get a sense that yields are moving up significantly in the airfreight industry right now. If anything, there may be a slight decline having forwarded.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Chris Ceraso of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on the international business. I know you've mentioned that Asia to U.S. and Asia to Europe was a little bit soft. And you characterized it mainly as a consumer concern on the delivery side of that. But are you seeing anything with your customers that are relocating any of their manufacturing facilities back to North America, for example? And is there maybe some underlying structural trend that will weigh on outbound Asia volumes going forward?","D. Scott Davis","I don't think so, Chris. I mean I think there's some of that and there is -- we're seeing some manufacturing growth in the United States. But I don't think we're seeing a dramatic shift at this point in time. I think what will drive that shift is energy prices if they climb. I think that a big change in lanes, I think, would be if energy prices do climb a lot then you will see some near sourcing. But today, I don't think there's dramatic shift yet.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. David Ross of Stifel, Nicolaus.","David G. Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","With UPS Freight, surprised by the tonnage decline there. It seemed to be an easy comp quarter and industry volumes were higher, especially with yields not being too great either. Can you talk a little bit about why the negative volume there?","Kurt P. Kuehn","Yes, it's a combination of kind of us trying to find the right balance of growth in yields and also some tough comps to last year. We had a pretty strong quarter last year with substantial growth in both yields and shipments. And we are seeing some moving patterns. Some of the players in the market are getting a little more aggressive. So we're trying to find a middle ground right now as things stabilize. So we feel good that the business unit's making good progress, but we are trying to be selective and continuing to focus more on the middle market areas than an across-the-board growth strategy.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line Of Helane Becker of Dahlman Rose.","Helane R. Becker - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","So you have, I think, a pilot contract that came due recently. Can you just give us an update on how the negotiations were going and what the timing is using for resolving that?","Kurt P. Kuehn","Yes, Helane, the contract became amendable and we are having discussions. But I'd say we're early on the discussion at this point in time. Typically, in pilot negotiations, they don't get completed until 2, 3 years after the amendable date. We're hoping to get it done sooner than that. But so far, early in discussions and they are underway.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Mr. Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I thought it would be helpful if you could give us a little breakdown in terms of what the composition of the yields were. I know you talked about kind of 2% to 3% base price. But can you run through on, let's say, the air express -- I don't know if you want to do air express and ground. But how much is price? How much is change in weight per piece? And then how much is fuel impact just to give us a little better sense of what's really driving the yields?","Kurt P. Kuehn","Yes, Tom, we did see a big impact on overall weight. The ground was down a couple of percent in aggregate and our air products were down 4% to 5%. So that's a fairly large piece. The -- probably the most notable issue, and that encompasses both the mix of the B2C, which tends to be lighter, and the lightweight focus. The core underlying base rate, in most cases, is 2% to 3% customer-to-customer. So the changing mix, both of lower service, with Saver, for example, where there is a yield hit. Although, as we mentioned there's an offsetting price benefit. As I mentioned, Q4 to Q1, the trends are very similar for ground and deferred air, if you take out fuel surcharge. Next Day Air shows a bigger difference because of the substantial increases we're seeing on the Saver side and the weight being letters. So all in all, the base rates, as we factor out those things, are very steady at the 2.5% to 3%. Ground, a little better than that average. Air maybe a little below that average. But we know that on a customer-by-customer basis, as we do our customer strategies, those yield and freezes are happening. But with the significant mix change, it has masked that a bit.","Operator","Due to time constraint, our last question will come from the line of Mr. David Vernon of Sanford Bernstein.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Could you maybe give us an update on the regulatory process with TNT?","Kurt P. Kuehn","All right, sure. Yes, David, we're -- I think we're making good process. I guess, what's happened since we had our call back on March 19 announced the deal is one that TNT's held their annual meeting, which I thought gone quite well, which is I think is important to get a perspective of where there shareowners are. We have had discussions with the regulators a couple of meetings so far. We're working through the process. So far, so good. Probably, the next big thing is we're going to file the offer memorandum by May 11 with the AFM, so that's a big next step. And we'll also file the form CO with the European Commission probably mid-May. So far -- it's early in the process, still. But so far, so good.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Any feedback from them on divestures or any sort of increased concern on your part on that end?","Kurt P. Kuehn","No, too early for that at this point in time.","Operator","I would now -- that concludes our Q&A session for the day.

And after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Scott Childress, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.","Scott Childress","Good morning and welcome to the UPS fourth quarter 2019 earnings call. Joining me today are David Abney, our CEO; Brian Newman, our CFO; Kate Gutmann, our Chief Sales and Solutions Officer; along with International President, Nando Cesarone; President of U.S. Operations, George Willis; our Chief Information and Engineering Officer, Juan Perez; and Scott Price, our Chief Strategy and Transformation Officer.","Before we begin, I want to remind you that some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements within the Federal Securities Laws and address our expectations for the future performance or operating results of our Company. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainty, which are described in detail in our 2018 Form 10-K and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports, when filed are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the SEC.","During the fourth quarter of 2019, U.S. GAAP results included a non-cash, after-tax mark-to-market pension charge of $1.8 billion, an after-tax transformation charge of $39 million and U.S Domestic after-tax legal contingency and expense charges of $91 million, predominantly related to the New York cigarette case. ","The after-tax total for all three items is $1.95 billion, an impact to fourth quarter 2019 EPS of $2.23 per diluted share. The mark-to-market pension charge includes the effect of notably higher than anticipated asset returns and the unfavorable movement to lower discount rates. It also includes an updated estimate of potential benefits related to the central states pension fund. ","In the prior year period, the Company\u2019s GAAP results included a non-cash, after-tax, mark-to-market pension charge of $1.2 billion or $1.42 per diluted share. More details on the mark-to-market accounting will be available in a presentation posted to the Investor Relations website later today. ","Unless stated otherwise, discussion today refer to adjusted results. The webcast of today\u2019s call, along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures are available in the UPS Investor Relations website. Webcast users can submit live questions during the call. ","We will attempt to answer questions of a long-term strategic nature. Callers are asked to submit only one question, so that we may allow as many as possible to participate. ","Thank you. And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to David.","David Abney","Good morning, everyone. I\u2019d like to welcome Nando and George to the call. They oversee our two largest segments. Each have deep knowledge of our business through more than 30 years of UPS experience. This morning, I\u2019ll share my thoughts of the fourth quarter and the year ahead. Brian will then review the financial details of the quarter and 2020 guidance. ","During the fourth quarter, we continued to successfully execute our strategies and deliver on our commitments. Revenue growth improved network efficiency to drive operating leverage and continuous transformation to stay ahead of market changes. ","Our multiyear investment strategy is positioning us well to support the needs of our customers, generate profitable revenue growth, reward our shareowners, and create opportunities for our employees. I want to thank the 495,000 UPSs around the world for their efforts during the peak. We delivered more than 1.6 billion packages in the fourth quarter including a record-level of residential packages. ","This exceeded our expectations and resulted in a new 8% increase in volume over last year. Also, we were recognized by third-parties for providing industry-leading, on-time service for this remarkably high peak volume. ","Our execution over the holidays benefited from increased capacity and automation throughout the network, effective use of proven tools and enhanced technology and deeper collaboration with our customers to align volume with network capacity. ","Our operating teams took advantage of the 20 new aircrafts, and an additional 10 million square feet of automated capacity we added to our network in 2018 and 2019, which enabled us to provide great service for our customers for the last two peak seasons. ","And many of the technologies and processes we employed during the peak will carry forward to make our normal daily operations more efficient year-over-year.","For the company in the fourth quarter, revenue grew 3.6%, operating profit was up nearly 14% and margins expanded in all segments. As a result, fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $2.11, a nearly 9% increase over last year. We are continuing to focus on our strategic growth imperatives, SMBs, e-commerce, healthcare and international growth markets. ","Our transformation strategies and investments anticipated the growing significance of the global e-commerce and position UPS well to capture opportunities from all customers. We are embracing the e-commerce structural shift to faster delivery which brought a surge in next year volume of more than 22% in 2019, an increase we were well equipped to handle with greater efficiency. ","Our investments drove productivity gains and lowered unit cost on a year-over-year basis generating positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter and for the year. We also proved that our integrated network provides GPS and our customers tremendous flexibility to more efficiently respond to the fast pace of change in the markets. ","Now, looking ahead to 2020, I just returned from the World Economic Forum in Davos, where discussions with customers and policy leaders reinforced our current outlook for this year. The 2020 economic backdrop will provide opportunities for UPS. ","Consumer demand remains healthy globally and in the U.S. and we are positioning solutions to grow commercial deliveries despite weakness in the industrial sector. Global GDP estimates call for slower growth in the first half of the year, with four year growth at 2.5% finishing about the same as last year, which is below what many considered a normal growth rate. ","On a positive note, advancements with U.S. trade are encouraging with the President\u2019s recent signing of the U.S. MCA and the U.S. China Phase 1 trade agreement an historic event I had to privilege to witness, each is a big step in the right direction for global trade.","Amid dynamic economic conditions, and structural shifts in the market, UPS is taking aggressive steps forward by investing for growth, speeding up our networks and introducing new SMB-centric solutions that help them compete and grow. ","Our customers rely on speed to market as the competitive differentiator and we believe there is additional growth opportunity for UPS as we accelerate our network and further broaden weekend operations. This year we are significantly expanding extended hours pickup, but Next Day, Ground to cover an industry-leading 98% of the U.S. population.","We are also expanding weekend delivery services. More Saturday deliveries we are bringing online more operations, doubling the amount of volume we handled in 2019 to reach an additional 40 million U.S. consumers, plus, we remain the only integrated carrier that offers commercial and residential pickup and delivery on Saturdays. ","We are initially launching Sunday delivery to the majority of the U.S. with an economy product and will expand throughout the year to provide our customers a wide range of delivery options covering all seven days of the week. We will also further expand our integrated network by adding more than 5 million square feet of new automated capacity. ","Most notably, we recently announced plans for a super hub in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania unlocking opportunities and speeding up the network in the Midwest and Northeast corridor. We see tremendous opportunities and we are taking advantage now by reinvesting a portion of our transformation savings to speed, time and transit and introduce unique new products and services.","These actions generate long-term revenue growth and enable further diversification among our growing SMB customer base. ","Yesterday, we announced several new solutions to continue to help our SMB customers, we are expanding My Choice For Business in 30 countries and by the end of 2020, 96% of UPS\u2019 global small package volume will be eligible to be tracked and controlled through My Choice For Business. ","And we are enhancing ups.com\u2019s simplified cross border trade. The website will guide customer through estimated duties and taxes, and determining customs requirements, making it easier for SMBs to ship internationally. ","We also introduced several next-generation technology expansions. Drone delivery service from UPS Flight Forward will soon began at the University of California, San Diego health campuses. We will soon close on an equity investment in Arrival, a leading electric vehicle manufacturer, along with our commitment to purchase 10,000 advanced EV delivery vehicles. ","And we are deploying Dynamic ORION, continuously optimizing routing in the U.S. as we progress to make the fastest most technology-enabled company in the industry. We have made great strides expanding and further automating our smart global logistics network and in creating new solutions to grow revenue. ","The impacts of our transformation are becoming more visible in our operating performance, even as we invest in new capabilities. All of the network investments and SMB initiatives we are discussing reinforce our confidence in achieving our transformation, EPS commitment of $1 to $1.20. ","The decisions and investments we are making, especially with our SMB initiatives and pulling forward actions to speed up our network will uniquely position UPS in the industry and our design to ensure continued success well into the future. ","Now Brian will take you through our results. ","Brian Newman","Thanks, David and good morning. Today my remarks will cover our quarterly performance and the full year for 2019, then I will finish with our 2020 outlook. ","Both our fourth quarter and full year results were enabled by UPS\u2019 strategies, execution and investments in our smart global logistics networks. Our diversified growth is a result of making the right trade-offs as we continually adapt to the changing environment. ","During the quarter, we generated positive operating leverage and grew operating profit and margins across all segments. As a result, 4Q 2019 diluted EPS grew nearly 9% and full year EPS was $7.53 per diluted share. ","Moving into the segments, in the U.S., we continue to see strong volume growth. The additional aircraft capacity and automation we added enabled our operators to adjust the network and efficiently meet the surge in demand for our services, allowing us to take on new customers during the height of peak seasons. ","U.S. domestic revenue increased nearly 7%, driven by volume growth across all products. Next Day Air volume increased nearly 26%, deferred was up almost 16% and Ground volume rose more than 6%. Growth came from B2C and B2B shippers producing the fifth consecutive quarter of B2B growth. Customer and product mix dynamics decreased revenue per piece by 2% driven by lower average weight per piece and larger e-commerce customers\u2019 adoption of faster delivery options. ","Most importantly, unit cost was down 3.2%, which in turn generated positive operating leverage. The result of productivity improvements from the investments we have made over multiple quarters. U.S. domestic operating profit was more than $1.2 billion, a significant increase of more than 20%. ","Now, looking at the International segment, strong execution and continued cost management enabled another quarter of profit growth and margin expansion, which helped to counter a 1.7% decline in revenue, primarily due to conditions in the macro environment. ","Total export volume was down slightly in the quarter, as gains on intra-Europe, intra-Asia, and U.S. export trade lanes did not fully offset the declines into and out of the UK and on the Asia U.S. lanes. We adjusted global Air capacity to match demand where and when needed driving high levels of asset utilization. We lowered international block hours by about 3% and in total, unit cost decreased by 2.8%.","While navigating within the challenging environment, we grew operating profit nearly 4% and expanded margins 110 basis points reaching 21.5%. Our outperformance further demonstrates our ability to leverage our capabilities and continuously adapt to grow profits.","Now let\u2019s turn to supply chain and freight. Even with the macro challenges in forwarding, operating profit was up 17% and margins expanded 120 basis points, primarily due to the diversity of our portfolio, our continued focus on SMBs, and lapping last year\u2019s profit impact during labor negotiations for the freight business. ","Looking at the individual business units, Logistics, UPS Freight and Marken were bright spots. All three grew revenue with profit up double-digits helping to offset the softer business conditions faced by Coyote and Forwarding. ","Now let\u2019s turn to cash and shareholder returns. UPS continues to generate strong cash from operations enabling further investment and rewards for our shareholders. As I guided last quarter, we lowered our 2019 CapEx due to increased capital efficiencies. The result was capital investments of $6.5 billion.","Additionally, we returned $4.3 billion to shareholders including about $1 billion of share buybacks and $3.3 billion in dividend distributions. ","Now let me comment more broadly on 2019. We made strong progress with our Transformation. We closely monitored market changes and made quick and prudent adjustments throughout the year. For example, we continually adjusted our integrated network, aligning our capacity with changes in market demand resulting in a lower cost structure that drove strong operating leverage across our business. ","We launched numerous innovative solutions to help grow B2B and B2C volumes, as well as win new SMB customers and we took advantage of structural changes in the market like rapid adoption of faster delivery driven by e-commerce, a benefit to UPS in 2019. ","The strength of our network allowed us to capitalize on the structural shift in the market for next day delivery and help all customers embrace this trend. UPS was also able to increase our business with Amazon through competitive wins and the structural shift to next day delivery. When combined with the revenue declines in the International and Supply Chain and Freight segments, Amazon\u2019s percentage of total company revenue rose to 11.6% for the year.","On the whole, we managed nearly 6% increase in annual volume and at the same time, we generated double-digit increases in operating profits and expanded margins. And we were able to deliver EPS within our guidance range despite a dynamic market environment. ","Now looking to 2020. We expect full year adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $7.76 to $8.06. Our outlook reflects forecasted year-over-year declines in U.S. industrial production and other global softness. However, there is growing optimism due to the recent trade agreements that could move us higher. ","Another external factor that will affect our results is lower pension discount rates. For this reason, operating profit specifically in the U.S. will be muted. However, benefits below the line in other income and expense will more than offset the impact to operating profits. ","We provided a new table in our financial information that holds pension discount rates neutral on operating profit on a year-over-year basis giving investors additional transparency in this area. ","Now, let me review the key drivers of our 2020 EPS guidance at the total company level starting with 2019 EPS of $7.53. First, strong underlying segment performance is anticipated to produce year-over-year EPS growth between 6% and 10%. ","Supporting this growth are several company-specific tailwinds including, growing adoption of our new solutions, increased efficiencies from our expanding automation and the proven value of our integrated network that provides us and our customers flexibility to adapt to a changing environment. ","Working against us this year is the impact to operating profit from lower pension discount rates I mentioned earlier. This is equivalent to a drag on EPS of $0.26. In addition, there is a $0.33 EPS headwind from the SMB network initiatives. We have elected to implement SMB initiatives to speed up our network across multiple lanes and broaden our weekend operations. ","This will result in tripling the rate of improvement we made in 2019, making time in transit faster for 80% of residential and commercial customers in the U.S. Clearly, this will improve UPS\u2019 competitiveness and further diversify revenue creating more opportunities for SMB growth. ","These initiatives will drive both startup costs and revenue growth in 2020 and in the coming years, revenue is expected to grow significantly. In 2021we expect EPS and margin accretion from these initiatives. ","Starting below the line, total other income and expense will be a positive for the company primarily because in 2019, we generated more than 17% returns on pension assets leading to a favorable impact in 2020. ","And lastly, in 2019, we enjoyed tax benefits from discrete items that are not anticipated to repeat muting EPS by $0.10. The 2020 tax rate is expected to be between 22.5% and 23.5%. Pulling it all together, full year 2020 adjusted diluted earnings per share will be in the range of $7.76 to $8.06, another year of solid EPS growth. ","The strong underlying segment performance builds on prior year gains and gives us confidence in our ability to deliver our long-term targets, which includes an incremental $1 to $1.20 of EPS by the end of 2022 from transformation initiatives. ","Diving deeper into the segments, in the U.S., we forecast revenue to increase 4% to 7%, driven impart by continued adoption of faster delivery services and the new solutions we have introduced. We anticipate Ground will grow in the low-single-digit range with healthy growth in Air shipments keeping in mind that we will be lapping elevated Next Day growth over the last three quarters. ","We are also planning for improvements in customer and product mix, as well as growth in base rates. As I mentioned, we are further broadening our customer base through network and product initiatives. We also expect incremental efficiencies throughout the year from previously opened and new automated facilities that come online during 2020. ","Given all these factors, U.S. Domestic operating profit on a pension discount rate neutral basis should grow in the low-single-digit range. This includes the impact from the SMB initiatives that we chose to accelerate and expand in 2020 to capture the tremendous growth opportunity. ","Moving to International, we will continue to adapt to changing conditions, target high growth market opportunities, and adjust the network to balance capacity with demand. Average daily shipments will increase in the low-single-digits and revenue will increase 4% to 6%. ","We will maintain our industry-leading margins and we expect to generate operating profit growth in the mid to high-single-digits on a pension discount rate neutral basis. ","Finally, the Supply Chain and Freight segment will continue to execute its SMB and cost management strategies. The diversity of our Supply Chain and Freight business units will again help us manage through cyclical moves in the market. We expect gains within our healthcare unit and truckload brokerage should rebound in the second half of the year. ","For the segment, revenue is anticipated to grow between 4% and 6% and operating profit is projected to grow between 5% and 7% on a pension discount rate neutral basis. ","Looking at the shape of EPS across the quarters, we expect 2020 to somewhat resemble 2019. In the first quarter, we expect EPS to be in the range of 17% to 18%, a full year adjusted EPS midpoint, driven by tougher year-over-year supply chain and freight comps, softer macro conditions, as well as the significant initial cost associated with our SMB initiatives. ","The remaining quarters will be fairly balanced in a range between 27% to 28% of the full year adjusted EPS midpoint with the fourth quarter at the top-end of the range. ","CapEx for 2020 is planned to be around $6.7 billion. These investments, which include automated buildings and technologies continue to expand the efficiency and flexibility of the UPS Smart Global Logistics network. ","Adjusted free cash flow is anticipated to be between $4.3 billion and $4.7 billion. We plan to reward shareholders with growth in dividends, subject to Board approval and anticipate share buybacks of around $1 billion for 2020 similar to the last few years. ","In conclusion, the Transformation investments we are making and the actions we are taking better position UPS to capitalize on growth opportunities. And as macro conditions turn more positive, we could see additional upside potential for the year. ","And now, I\u2019ll ask the operator to open the lines. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of\u2026 ","Scott Childress","This is Scott Childress with UPS. Please allow \u2013 we are only going to allow one question from each speaker. So we may allow as many as possible to participate. Our first question is a online question. We got multiple analysts. ","Todd Fowler from KeyBanc, as well as Fadi Chamoun from BMO. You mentioned that you are fast-tracking initiatives in 2020 to capitalize on the market opportunity. Can you elaborate on this?","David Abney ","I certainly can. This is David and I would say, we are faster \u2013 fast-tracking initiatives in 2020. We have had positive momentum in 2019 and we see it in the underlying performance in 2020. We have clear visibility to structural shifts that we really want to take advantage of Next Day and Seven Days. And so, we just see tremendous opportunity especially with our SMBs. ","So we have elected, made a conscious decision and we wanted to pull forward some transformation initiatives into 2020 that would speed up our network significantly and take advantage of these opportunities that are being presented. And so, we are focusing into \u2013 two main areas. Our time and transit, and we started improving time and transit, making it quicker in 2019. ","We are going to triple that rate of improvement in 2020. In fact, the UPS network, we will be faster by the end of this campaign for 80% of the U.S. population than we were before we started. So, 80% significant improvements. ","And then of course, weekend, seven day deliveries, just so important to consumers today and we are going to double our delivery volume and weekends on Saturdays, we are going to reach 40 million new consumers and what\u2019s important is, seven days is important, not just for residential, but for commercial deliveries too. ","We have SMBs saying what about us, we need seven day delivery and we are focusing in that regard too. And then, Sunday, we started out with an economy service that\u2019s over the majority of the population and we are going to expand Sunday offerings throughout 2020 to give a wide, wide range of delivery options. So these are two structural shifts that we see that run hand-in-hand with our SMB strategy. ","And the good thing about these is, they are not CapEx heavy, they are OpEx and cost and we will be putting in OpEx in 2020. But these initiatives, when you look them together are going to be accretive in 2021. It\u2019s going to give us much higher asset and lane utilization. It\u2019s going to give us better competitiveness and more pricing power. ","It\u2019s going to give us additional business and allow us to continue at our lower cost and we are just really excited about this opportunity. Now is the time, we seize the moment and we believe investors expect us to seize these kinds of opportunities and that\u2019s what we are doing. Brian will talk a little bit more about the effect for 2020 and then of course, we have already said accretive in 2021. ","So, yes, fast, faster and we are going to continue to be speeding up our network for our customers. Thanks for the question. ","Scott Childress","Our next online question comes from Ben Hartford of R.W. Baird. As transformation has progressed, how confident are you in UPS\u2019 ability to either realize the stated $1 to $1.20 or get it earlier or even exceed the initial estimates? ","Brian Newman","I\u2019ll take that, Scott. Thanks, Ben for the question. It\u2019s Brian. Look, we are confident in the $1 to $1.20 incremental EPS given the investments we have made already returning. We are looking at margin expansion across all three segments in 2019 and it\u2019s just building on the momentum. ","So I think by choosing to invest, accelerate and expand the investments in SMB that David referenced, we see opportunity to capture accretive growth going into 2021 and beyond. ","Operator","We have a question from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Please go ahead. ","Tom Wadewitz ","Yes, good morning. Wanted to get your thoughts about competitive environment. I think, FedEx has accelerated \u2013 they are kind of quickly doing six day and seven day. So it seems that they are competing harder in e-commerce. Obviously, you are getting a lot of traction in the market, getting strong growth in Domestic Package and investing more aggressively as you announced today. ","Do you think that these investments accelerate your volume growth looking forward? Or is this something where you just have to spend more to compete and kind of keep the momentum? How do you think about competitive dynamic? And how that translates to volume? Thank you. ","David Abney ","Yes, we will, Tom. This is David and I\u2019ll let Kate to follow-up. What I can tell you is we are focused on serving the entire e-commerce ecosystem. And that includes large e-tailers, that includes the large retailers and that includes the SMBs, the thousands and thousands of SMBs that we have to compete and to punch above their weight with the larger companies. ","Just a few things to point out, when it comes to the major retailers, over 90% of the larger retailers utilize our innovative services and we\u2019ve seen their business grow. I\u2019ll just give you a few examples of that target Qurate Retail Group, Macy's, GAP, Kohl's, Best Buy, Overstock. I mean, all of those companies have seen our innovative solutions and we have grown. ","But where our real passion is in this area is, allowing and enabling small and mid-sized businesses to compete against the bigger companies and that\u2019s where you saw just a straying of announcements yesterday. We made more product and service announcements in 2019 than we made in my entire career at UPS and we are following it this year. ","And Kate, I\u2019ll turn it over to you to highlight a few that you want to focus on. ","Kate Gutmann","Yes, absolutely. And so, clearly, we are the e-commerce provider of choice and David just brought life to that and focus on the SMBs, the exciting part of our solutions is that we actually are leaning in both on B2B and B2C. The speeding of time and transit help both and fast means, through the weekend. UPS only has the commercial offering for our customers helping the SMB to actually speed through the weekend and also replenish inventory. ","So very impactful. And you know, these customers have told us, it\u2019s about pace, speed and ease. And the ease is helping them to connect whether they are already existing and that is with Digital Access, that\u2019s exactly what that does it brings together the community of buyers with the SMB sellers and attach My Choice For Business on that. ","It helps them to control not only their outbound, but their inbound and the more you can do that, you save staffing, you save cost and then that helps them to reinvest into their businesses. So we do see these investments as accelerating growth and we are excited that it is with the structural shift in the Air, also the speed on the Ground and very excited.","David Abney ","Yes, there is just two that I want to highlight. One is, we\u2019ve been a e-commerce shipper of choice for over years. This is something that we concentrated on six, seven years ago and we have put the network in place and we will continue. But just two things I think is worth drawing out is, we talk a lot about the structural change of Next Day Air and Next Day in general. ","And our extended hours Next Day program where we can pickup \u2013 get late pickups and we can actually serve 98% of the population for our brick and mortar retailers that\u2019s within a 150 miles of their locations. We can cover 98%. That is industry-leading and that is giving them a competitive advantage. It allows them to hit Next Day through their Ground network. ","And then \u2013 so that was very important. The other one that we\u2019ve made a lot of announcements about, but we are just speeding through and that\u2019s Access Points and we are adding in the press release, another 1,500 Access Points, new package express centers. What makes this unique is this is in a lot of rural areas, people that don\u2019t have a lot of options and by the time these get implemented with the others we have announced, 92% of the population of the U.S. will be within five miles of our Access Points. ","So it just gives you some good examples of what we are doing to maintain our status as the e-commerce shipper of choice. Thank you. ","Operator","And we have a question from the line of Ken Hoexter of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. ","Ken Hoexter ","Hey, great. Good morning. Dave or I guess, Brian, that was great information on the breakdown in terms of the 6%,10% outlook, but then, with the pension and other network rollout. So looking at that $380 million or so pre-tax expense you are spending on accelerating the network, can you maybe talk about the split between rolling out weekend delivery? And what the other actions that are \u2013 that you are spending money on? ","And then, within that shift from two day to next day to now intra-region that Dave was just talking about, how do you plan that world? Does that require any additional network shifts or investment as you do that?","Brian Newman","Thanks, Ken for the question. Look, we are looking at the SMB initiatives in total as I broke it out, it\u2019s a $0.33 total investment with two objectives. We are trying to accelerate the time and transit. We are going to reach over 80% of our customers and then in addition, expand the weekend coverage. ","So, rather than breakout the $0.33, we are looking at it in totality as a program. We see it accretive to 2021 and beyond. Maybe I\u2019ll let Juan take a stab at sharing some of the details of the two programs. ","Juan Perez","Yes, thanks, Brian. And as we think about the expansion of weekend delivery services, we started that already in the Q4. The advantage that we have is that we have a well defined integrated network that gives us unprecedented capabilities to be able to enable these services. We are going to leverage the relationship that we have with the USPS. ","David made that reference to the Access Point network that we have. It\u2019s a network that\u2019s in place. We\u2019ve already built that technology that supports the integration between UPS and the Access Points. That will make it really easy for us to be able to expand us well in those areas. And again, we will continue to provide services through the network that we\u2019ve already built with the great people that we have supporting those operations. ","Scott Childress","Our next question is an online question coming from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please address UPS\u2019 progress in driving U.S. Domestic B2B share growth and the potential to further expand in 2020?","Kate Gutmann","Thanks so much. This is Kate. So first, we are proud to be the B2B market leader and also to say that we grew B2B for the fifth consecutive quarter. This quarter\u2019s B2B growth was fueled by retailer returns, returns growing 6% with our unmatched portfolio. So you can actually have the flexibility of returns, whether it be label list, package list and also right available on your mobile application. ","So very excited about the progress that we\u2019ve seen in that space. And then B2B a critical component of that is our healthcare strategy as well as our SMB with a large majority of B2B tied to those. Also David mentioned the structural shift. Structural shift comes with the businesses speeding and that also impacts B2B. ","So, everything you see us doing with speeding time and transit, through that we can follow that to continuing our success with B2B. Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Jordan Alliger of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. ","Jordan Alliger ","Yes, hi. Good morning. Just sort of wondering, can you talk a little bit and I know this the pension headwinds, but a little bit about your thoughts on managing the cost per piece and the revenue per piece in the Domestic business and managing to sort of that spread differential and what we should think about in terms of cost per piece going forward? Thanks. ","Kate Gutmann","Okay. Sure. So, I\u2019ll start with the revenue per piece. First of all, we were excited to deliver the positive operating leverage and George will speak more about that aligning the cost per piece with revenue per piece. As we\u2019ve noted, revenue per piece was affected by weight per piece and customer mix. As we leaned into this structural shift that\u2019s going on in the market, and we will continue to do so. ","With that, we are seeing speeding, whether it be in the Air services. You saw our Air growth very strong. Three consecutive quarters over 20% with this past quarter at 26% for Next Day and double-digit for deferred. A lot of which by the way is coming from a very broad customer base heavily SMB in that area. ","And then, David mentioned that Ground inclusion that we have, which is our extended hours, Next Day Ground and the coverage that we gain, 98% of the population by activating brick and mortar. That will continue. ","So, shorter zone, some less weight, but solutions that gain the whole portfolio Air and Ground from our customers which will help RPP. And then, we remain committed to growing our price as aligned to our value and our cost per piece. ","George Willis","Hey, Jordan. This is George Willis. And thanks for the question. So, as far as the cost per piece goes, our investments have significantly lowered our structural cost. So in answering your question, you think this is going to continue to drop. We continue to see it improving as well. ","We are driving productivity gains and we are lowering our unit cost. We did that last year and we expect to do the same thing this year. We are creating excellent leverage as Kate just talked about earlier. And it was \u2013 it actually exhibited last quarter in the fourth quarter. This was evidenced by our cost per piece actually going down 3.2% in the fourth quarter. ","So we see the benefits in our new facilities. We are going to continue that. We also see the continuous improvement on on-road and in our Air network driven by the new technology and automation. ","Jordan Alliger ","Thank you. ","Scott Childress","Our next online question comes from Scott Group of Wolfe, as well as a few of the other analysts. Please provide an update on your relationship with your major customer. There is always much discussion of their plans and how that could impact UPS\u2019 business over the next few years.","David Abney ","Okay. This is David and I will \u2013 and our business did increased with them over 2019 and part of which was due to a structural change and this focus on Next Day. And we foresaw that change and we had the list available and we really took advantage of that, not only with the large e-tailers, but with other companies that are matching that same structural change. We also had competitive wins. We have large e-tailers and others. ","And we saw a little bit of a muted growth top-line from International and Supply Chain due to macro conditions and of course, that made the percent revenue a little bit larger. But one of the things we want to focus on is, at the same time that we took on additional volume that we did bring our cost per piece down significantly in the U.S. operations for the fourth quarter, in fact, on an adjusted basis by more than 3% from the year before. ","And also, that other customers are able to take advantage of some of this capacity and structure. So, other retailers and small and mid-sized companies have been able to take advantage in the same way. As long as there is with any of our big customers, as long as there is a mutually beneficial relationship, then we will continue and we will find ways to win together. ","But we also find ways to continue to help our small and mid-sized companies and others to compete against those large opportunities, whether it\u2019s through Ware2Go or e-fulfillment or Access Points or other options. So, that\u2019s kind of a run down about where we stand. Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Please go ahead. ","Chris Wetherbee ","Hey, thanks. Good morning. It looks like the guidance for the first quarter suggests basically flat earnings although you are expecting growth throughout the rest of the year. Can you talk a little bit about the cadence of the investments that you are making, the SMB initiatives and others and is that sort of front-end weighted? ","And is that a driver of that sort of weaker than average first quarter? Or do we think that there is sort of introducing new seasonality to the business with the potentially sort of the growth in your largest customer as a percent of revenue. Just want to get a sense to sort of how we should be thinking about the cadence of the growth and the expenses, particularly in the first quarter? ","Brian Newman","Yes, it\u2019s Brian. Thanks very much for the question. So it has less to do with the changing of the seasonality. It\u2019s more about the phasing and cadence of the investments we announced. The $0.33 OpEx investment or EPS headwinds that we are putting in. The revenue lag to those startup costs. So, as you think about Q1 and launching the investments, revenue comes a bit later. ","And that\u2019s why we are muting EPS in addition in the Supply Chain and Freight business, given the macro backdrop that we are expecting some rebound in the middle to late part of the year. So, those are the two elements impacting the phasing of the guidance. ","Chris Wetherbee ","Thanks. ","Scott Childress","Our next question is an online question that comes from Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Can you discuss the announcement of the construction of a super hub in Pennsylvania? Is the construction embedded in your three year CapEx? And can you tell us how the super hubs will differ from your other major sort facilities?","Juan Perez","Yes, Allison, this is Juan Perez. Thank you for the question. Just a couple of points, let me first clarify the $1.4 billion that we announced is for not just one facility in Pennsylvania. It\u2019s a total of four facilities in Pennsylvania. The largest of those is the super hub we will be building in Harrisburg Pennsylvania. By the way, you have heard us talk about the Smart Logistics Network a number of times. ","Part of the Smart Logistics Network is building critical capacity to support the needs of our e-commerce customers. We continue to build that capacity. We\u2019ve been very effective. That capacity is yielding the expected results. ","Your question next talks about how we continue to improve the facilities that we build. We have this philosophy at UPS that every time we build a new facility, that facility is going to have the next-generation of advanced technologies that will help us continue to build capabilities, improve our automation, reduce our hours. ","In this particular building, we expect to see some really unique technologies. More data analytics that will provide better insights on how the facility is running. Of course, how it can help the overall network and we also expect these new facilities to use the latest and greatest automation technologies that we have. ","The CapEx is included in our three year plan. So this is something that we have been planning all along as we continue to build our Smart Logistics Network. We are excited about what we are building in the Northeast critical corridor for UPS. ","Operator","We have a question from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead. ","David Vernon ","Hey guys. Good morning. Brian, maybe could you talk a little bit about how the $0.33 is going to be kind of earned back into 2020, 2021? Is this something that we should be expecting to be basically, just go away as a one-time item? Or is this going to take a little bit of time to grow through? And as you think about the next three year view on CapEx, obviously, these investments announced in the last couple of days have been significant. ","But this sounds like your part of the capital envelope. Has your thinking on reinvestment changed at all as far as kind of the next three year view on CapEx going forward? Thanks.","David Abney ","This is David. I\u2019ll take the first part of that question and I\u2019ll turn the CapEx over. So, from an OpEx standpoint, on speeding up the initiatives, this is really about how to increase the asset and lane utilization of our transportation network. It\u2019s about competitiveness, it\u2019s about pricing power. When you have a much faster network, you don\u2019t have to discount as much. ","We also don\u2019t have to have customized solutions. So we are going to be able to take some of those that we have put over the years to help speed the network. We are going to be able to take that out. But we really see that we are going to get additional business and that was the thing that got our attention so much last year is when we put these first ones in, we way exceeded the return of additional packages than we were going to get. ","So when you put this infrastructure in place, it\u2019s not fully utilized at first. It takes a while to grow. But based on what we\u2019ve seen last year and what we expect to see this year, the revenue and the pricing power from this move is going to more than take care of the operating cost. That\u2019s why we are boldly saying that this is accretive and it\u2019s accretive in 2021 and we\u2019ve got the \u2013 so far the examples to show that. ","So let\u2019s turn over to the CapEx side and that's to you, Brian. ","Brian Newman","Thanks, David. And David, thanks for the question. So, with respect to CapEx, you are right. The investments we talk about this morning, Harrisburg et cetera, those are all embedded within our capital guidance and envelope. David talked about the OpEx investment. But in terms of where we are headed on CapEx, you saw we are guiding to about 6.7% in 2020. ","That\u2019s really coming from a lot of efficiency being driven as we saw in 2019, as well as 2020. We see a glide path eventually moving down towards our historic average of 7%. And ultimately, if you look at the ROIC, which is among the leading industry and really it\u2019s a good investment for the company in terms of the returns. ","So, hope that gives you a little insight on the CapEx side. ","Scott Childress","We\u2019ve got a couple of questions on International. Tom Wadewitz from UBS, as well as Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. UPS realized a 150 basis point margin improvement in international package in 21 despite small declines. Is there room left for further margin improvement? And does the recent phase one of the China deal helped in that regard?","David Abney ","I\u2019ll talk about phase one of the China deal and then Nando will go further than that. We think the U.S. China Phase one was a historic agreement, as much for what it kept from happening with additional tariffs being implemented, plus what was covered in the actual agreement and certainly looking forward to working with governments on both sides for Phase two. But a positive start there. ","When you take a look at that, and you also take a look at the terminal dues change that is going into effect this year, which is going to allow us with our worldwide economy service to really compete in cross-global e-commerce cross border, I should have said, the e-commerce shipments that we haven\u2019t been able to do before, because of the very low cost of the terminal dues. ","So that\u2019s gotten addressed and so, we do see some positive momentum and I\u2019ll turn it over to you Nando to talk about the business units.","Nando Cesarone","Sure. Thanks for the questions. Of course, what we look at trade obviously concerns exists, we focused really strongly on making sure that we were growing our operating profits regardless of the macro backdrop. We were able to execute industry-leading margins, create positive leverage and of course, continue our profit growth during the quarter. ","I also want to just thank the International staff globally for the work and how they accomplished all of those things in a very challenging environment. While we saw the volume coming in a little bit differently, of course, we feel very comfortable about the cost reductions and the cost control and how we manage expense, mainly the network efficiency, our revenue quality, but also cost efficiency. ","We executed 2.8% decrease across all cost categories in International. Long-term targets are 16% to 19%. We are 21%. Higher margins are not exactly the primary goal, but maximize our profits certainly is. So, thanks for the questions. Appreciated. ","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. ","Scott Group ","Hey, thanks. Morning guys. So, can you just share what the Air and Ground volume expectations are for this year? And then on the $1.10, I just want to make sure I understand the numbers of how much you think you got in last year? What\u2019s assumed for this year? I just want to know what\u2019s left for 2021?","Brian Newman","So, I\u2019ll take the first part of that and kick over to Kate to talk on the Air outlook. So, from a \u2013 in a $1 to $1.20 in terms of what\u2019s in there, we basically \u2013 anything over the 7.5% or the 5% to 10% guidance is, think about putting a deposit down. So, we posted pretty strong operating growth in the 2019 results. ","We basically earned about 25% to 30% of that EPS upside. So, the balance would be left to come in 2021 and 2022. So, Kate, do you want to take the Air piece?","Kate Gutmann","Yes. ","David Abney ","Of course, she does. So - and we talked about when transformation that we had targeted $800 million to $1 billion of cost savings in our Smart Logistics Network initiatives and we are certainly on track. We may get another question on that and we can talk about that. But we are on track there too. So, then, Kate, do you want to talk about the Air side?","Kate Gutmann","Yes. Absolutely. I think, it's a good starting place to say that we are the Air market share leader and we saw this and anticipated this change, the structural change going on in the market and leaned into it with our solutions. ","And as a result, you\u2019ve seen the strong Air growth three consecutive quarters over 20%. We do expect to continue to see healthy Air growth alongside related to what Brian was saying the Ground comes hand-in-hand. So, we are seeing Next Day Air, Two Day Air resonating across our customer base whether it be from healthcare, SMB, e-tailers, large retailers. ","We have expanded capacity, additional planes, all of that tying together to the strategy. And then we\u2019ve talked about the unmatched UPS network and the ability to cover 150 miles of One Day Ground, really activating our retailers and our SMBs brick and mortar to help them to better compete in the market. So flexing where their inventory is and then using whichever of our product fits for that need. So, healthy feature as well. ","David Abney ","So, a key point that Kate brought up on our Air volume really and we gained significant market share last year in our U.S. Air network. We\u2019ve been gaining market share in that sector at least for the last five years, if not five of the five years. So we\u2019ve been constantly investing in aircraft and have 11 more that we are putting in this year that benefit the International cascades to the Domestic. ","So, this is something that we offer a clear differentiated value advantage to our customers and they are rewarding us and it\u2019s going very well for us. ","Scott Group ","Okay. ","Scott Childress","We\u2019ll take another online question. There is multiple analysts asking this. Did \u2013 how did your peak season returns compare this year to last year? And please discuss UPS\u2019 process to handle this.","George Willis","Yes, first of all, I would like to thank all of our partners and service providers in the U.S. for a very good peak season. It was driven primarily because of several things. First, our collaboration with our customers. ","Second, the efforts of our people and third, the use of technology in our automated facilities. As a result of this, through third parties, we\u2019ve led the industry again in service for the second consecutive year. We delivered over 32 million packages, 16 of the 18 delivery days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. ","Majority of our volume, as you heard us talk about investments and handle that growth was \u2013 year-over-year was done in our automated facilities. Our network responded and was very responsive and we continue to be agile. Our operators made good decisions during peak. And now for the technology part, Juan?","Juan Perez","Just a couple of quick statements folks. The first one that I think, it\u2019s important for you guys to know is that at the end of 2019, 75% of our U.S. eligible Ground volume was actually sorted through automation. ","In addition to that, we had completed the rollout of UPS ORION Navigation. That gave us significant benefits, especially as we bring seasonal workers on and they needed that type of technology to improve their overall delivery capabilities. ","And of course, we don\u2019t know that we are introducing additional technologies on the dispatch on delivery side that are going to continue to help us throughout peak season. The benefit of automated facilities cannot be understated. We actually exceeded throughout the year and certainly throughout peak season, we expect that production improvements that we get from automation. ","We introduced new solutions as well in terms of autonomous-guided vehicles in our automated facilities to support the movement of bulk. All those solutions proves extremely valuable in executing our successful peak season and we are already planning for 2020. That\u2019s the way that we now approach peak season for a number of years. ","Scott Childress","We are going to take one more online question and then we will close it out. The question is from multiple analysts asking about what technologies are in front of us, as well as our drone technologies, how we see that playing out? ","Scott Price","Thanks for the question. So, as we mentioned, transformation helps us bend the cost curve to help us invest in growth. Some of the growth opportunities we see, in particular in support of our customers is in the area of leverage of Ground. So UPS Flight Forward which was launched last year. A number of trials we announced the San Diego, where we are able to move across campus speed up for critical care or our support to customers. ","We also announced the Waymo. And Waymo is an interesting opportunity for us. It allows us to test a new model for later pickups at UPS stores. That supports our SMB customers and get them a later cut-off and a competitive ability to do late orders and fulfillment for Next Day. So, all of these technologies are helping us to grow and at the same time, bend our cost curve. Thank you. ","Operator","That concludes our Q&A. I will now turn the program back over to Mr. Scott Childress. ","Scott Childress","Thank you, Steven. David?","David Abney ","Good, Scott. Yes, I am sure, you could see on this call that we are making significant progress in executing our strategies. The U.S. was certainly an excellent example of that through the fourth quarter. We are leaning into SMBs. The great majority of the solutions that \u2013 innovative solutions that we\u2019ve announced in 2019, 2020 is to assist these SMBs to do more effective and to be able to compete with the larger companies. ","And our transformation initiatives, they are driving efficiency and they are allowing us to provide these new innovative solutions. So these things are interrelated that go together. And the last thing I wanted to hit about our call today is we are absolutely speeding up our network and expanding our weekend. We see a unique opportunity here in the market and we are going to take advantage of it. ","We are going to make those investments from an OpEx standpoint. And we do feel strongly it will be accretive in 2021. And we absolutely are convinced it\u2019s the right thing to do. So, we are going to continue to accelerate. Move at a faster pace for the benefit of our customers, our shareholders, and our people. ","So, thank you for joining us today.","Operator","That concludes our conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and have a nice day. You may now disconnect. "],"21211":["United Parcel Service, Inc.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. And after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Scott Childress, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.","Scott Childress","Good morning and welcome to the UPS fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. Joining me today are David Abney, our CEO; Richard Peretz, our CFO; along with Chief Operating Officer, Jim Barber; Kate Gutmann, our Chief Sales and Solutions Officer; our Chief Information and Engineering Officer, Juan Perez; and Scott Price, our Chief Strategy and Transformation Officer.","Before we begin, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements and address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of our company.","These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2017 Form 10-K and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports are available on the UPS investor relations website and from the SEC.","During the quarter, UPS recorded a non-cash, after-tax, mark-to-market pension charge of $1.2 billion. The charge includes the effects from lower-than-anticipated asset returns, partially offset by higher discount rates. It also includes a partial liability from the performance of The Central States Pension Fund.","In the prior-year period, UPS recorded a non-cash, after-tax, mark to market pension charge of $607 million. The charge resulted from lower discount rates, partially offset by higher asset returns.","Also, in 2017, we recorded a one-time income tax benefit of $258 million due to the adoption of new tax legislation.","More details on the mark-to-market accounting will be available in a presentation on the investor relations website later today.","GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter 2018 was $0.52. Adjusting for the impact of the mark-to-market pension charge, earnings per share for the quarter was $1.94. Fourth-quarter 2017 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.26 and adjusted earnings per share was $1.66.","Unless stated otherwise, discussions today will refer to adjusted results. The webcast of today\u2019s call, along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures, are available on UPS investor relations website. Webcast users can submit live questions during today's call. We will attempt to answer questions of a long-term strategic nature. Callers are asked to submit only one question, so that we may allow as many as possible to participate.","Thank you. And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to David.","David Abney ","Thanks, Scott. I welcome this opportunity to share our positive fourth-quarter results and our plans for continued improvement throughout 2019. On today's call, I\u2019ll share highlights for the quarter, our transformation progress and our views on the macro business environment.","Jim Barber will discuss our peak and Q4 results and our drive to improve operating leverage. Richard will then review the financial details of the quarter and 2019 outlook. ","First, I'm going to take a moment to applaud the nearly 500,000 UPSers who completed a successful peak season. Thanks to their hard work and commitment, we delivered industry-leading on-time servers and solid earnings growth.","We also thank our customers as we work together for our mutual advantage, by optimizing UPS' network utilization to ensure reliable service to their customers.","During peak, we produced good volume and revenue gains, as well as orchestrated improved revenue quality. But, most important, we effectively managed the total network and drove productivity improvements, while processing high peak volume levels.","As a result, we successfully delivered on our consolidated financial targets for earnings growth. We realized the benefit of several transformation initiatives, including strong SMB growth and yield management and the highest B2B growth in several quarters.","For the total company, we lifted revenue by 5.2% on a currency-neutral basis, generated solid operating margins, had excellent free cash flow and, in 2018, awarded shareowners with $4.2 billion in dividends and share buybacks.","I'm pleased with the improvements we've made across the company and with our strong Q4 EPS growth of 17% to $1.94.","Our domestic business performed as planned, successfully processing the record volume that came into our network.","International grew both top line and bottom line in a changing economic environment, while supply chain and freight delivered strong results in the Forwarding and Logistics and coyote units.","UPS remains the industry leader by identifying and capturing opportunities, managing macro risk and delivering results that support our customers and reward shareowners.","Beyond the strengths of the UPS business model, our transformation will deliver even better performance in the future.","At our conference last September, we outlined a three-pronged strategic approach to transformation. We\u2019ve made great progress. And in a few moments, Jim will provide an update. You will hear we have generated higher-quality revenue growth, greater efficiency to improve operating leverage, and actions to shift our culture to greater urgency and continuous transformation.","As mentioned in my discussion on peak, we\u2019re realizing the benefits of transformation in our financial results. We remain committed to elevating EPS by an incremental $1 to $1.20 by 2022.","We began our transformation in late 2017. And by doing so, we\u2019ve put UPS on a structured path to enhance performance, future-proof the company and take advantage of growth opportunities.","Looking ahead to 2019, external forecasts are calling for somewhat softer export and GDP growth across major economies due to uncertainty over trade policy. ","Our diverse portfolio, global revenue base and flexible network help to buffer the potential impact of these factors for UPS and our customers.","We continue to see growth opportunities in targeted business segments and in markets where we\u2019re well-positioned to accelerate local domestic and cross-border trade.","I\u2019ve recently met with industry and government leaders at the World Economic Forum. While both economic headwinds and tailwinds were discussed, I left more convinced than ever that we\u2019re on the right track.","Investments in our strategic growth imperatives, especially to support SMBs, along with our network automation, will enable profitable UPS growth. These actions will ensure our success today and well into the future.","As we look forward to 2019 and beyond, UPS is uniquely positioned to deliver long-term value creation for customers and shareholders. Our 2019 guidance demonstrates the early results of our multi-year actions to improve leverage in our domestic business.","Before I close, I want to welcome Philippe Gilbert to my leadership team. Philippe was recently appointed President of UPS Supply Chain Solutions and is a member of the management committee.","He has extensive global industry experience and will lead the next phase of growth and operating improvements across our supply chain and freight business units. ","His appointment is another step in our transformation-focused realignment of the UPS management committee. In a little more than a year, 6 in 12 of management committee members have been appointed to new positions, including three members who have joined us from other companies.","We are enhancing our culture and transformation by blending internal and external leadership [indiscernible]. This approach is adding new perspectives and taking advantage of our broader experiences.","Now, Jim will take you through details on peak, the actions driving revenue and revenue quality, greater operating efficiency and our evolving culture. Jim?","James Barber ","Thanks, David. I want to reinforce your comments on the work of the UPS team during peak. The dedication to customer service that is ingrained in our culture was on full display.","Several factors led to our service and performance success. We coordinated closely with customers for improved forecasting, expanded air and ground capacity with higher levels of automation, refined staffing and training plans, introduced new technology to align incoming volume with available capacity and, finally, we implemented pricing actions to better control shipment characteristics.","We developed comprehensive peak plans and executed successfully. I'm very proud of the entire UPS team.","Most important, these and other actions will carry forward into our normal daily operations throughout 2019.","As David mentioned, we realized benefits from several transformation efforts during the quarter. As noted previously, the US domestic segment will be the greatest beneficiary of our enterprise-wide transformation.","The first major transformation strategy is growth and higher-quality revenue. Our commercial actions to align pricing, volume and mix were very successful.","In Q4, RPP [ph] increased nearly 5% in the domestic segment and 4.6% overall on a currency-neutral basis. That's the best RPP gain we\u2019ve generated in many years.","We also simplified pricing and enabled our sales force to provide small and medium-size customers with quicker quotes, often on the spot. And we generated strong digital marketing results with streamlined product offerings and pricing programs aimed at small and occasional shippers.","These commercial actions also helped drive SMB growth, the best in recent history. B2B deliveries grew by about 3%, reflecting our customers\u2019 favorable reactions to our marketing and pricing strategies.","In addition, to better connect buyers and sellers in today's digital world, we recently partnered with two new B2B and B2C e-commerce platform companies, Inception and ShopRunner.","With Inception, UPS offers attractive shipping rates to Inception customers and is positioned as the preferred shipping choice during checkout. ShopRunner, a popular B2C e-commerce membership platform, offers two-day shipping and other benefits when members shop at participating retailers.","As a result of our partnership, in the near future, UPS My Choice members will have access to ShopRunner services.","There are more than 56 million My Choice members and we expect even greater participation as a result of the ShopRunner. ","Partnerships such as these are proven catalysts for future B2B and B2C e-commerce growth. We plan to announce more creative alliances and fulfillment offerings in 2019. ","The second transformation strategy is using technology to drive greater efficiency in operations and our back office, while making the company more agile and flexible.","During 2018, we opened 22 new or retrofit facilities globally, including five new superhubs, which employ the latest automation and productivity tools.","We also rebalanced volume flows and equipment across our global air network, which enhanced on-time performance and improved efficiency. As we start 2019, 18 additional new and retrofit facility projects are underway with completion dates ahead of peak this year.","In addition to facility automation, we also are enhancing UPS' on-road network. We\u2019ve launched UPSNav, which provides turn-by-turn navigation to loading docks and receiving areas for every stop on our drivers\u2019 routes. In 2019, we will provide UPSNav to more than 40,000 additional drivers in areas where route density is greatest to increase final mile efficiency.","We also began rolling out UPS' Network Planning Tools, or NPT, which was a valuable asset during peak. Part of NPT is our Peak Volume Alignment Tool, or PVAT. Using advanced analytics, we are better matching incoming volume flows and available network capacity for increased capacity utilization and operating efficiency. Full implementation will continue into 2019 as we add more digital connections across our network.","Adding technology and automated capacity is absolutely the right approach for the future of our more efficient and flexible network.","Finally, there are many other revenue and efficiency transformation initiatives that will improve performance in 2019. These include continued working capital gains from procurement, as well as cost reductions through outsourcing activities that had traditionally been handled within UPS. Transformation is prompting us to think differently.","I'm excited about the progress we've made throughout our global operations in 2018. And as we turn into 2019 and we\u2019ll execute additional strategies that expand our competitive advantage.","Now, Richard will take you through the results. Richard?","Richard Peretz ","Thanks, Jim. And good morning. Today, my prepared remarks will cover two areas. First, the quarterly performance of our segments; and second, our 2019 outlook.","In the quarter, UPS demonstrated great execution. We delivered industry-leading on-time performance, improved revenue quality and we generated excellent free cash flow. As a result fourth-quarter 2018, EPS grew 17% and full-year EPS was up nearly 21%.","Moving into the segments. In the US, we delivered on average more than 21 million packages a day and our growth was led by next-day air. Revenue was robust, up more than 6%.","Early in the quarter, we experienced some softening of package demand due to labor negotiation headwinds. As we moved into December, we saw sequential improvements in our financial results, while maintaining outstanding service levels.","The strong peak performance offset the majority of the labor headwinds, producing a full quarter profit result slightly below our own expectations. Our strategies to better align pricing with the value we create pushed base rates up 3.3%.","In addition, and most noteworthy, we saw positive trends in product and customer mix. The combination drove revenue per package to expand by almost 5% as we leaned in to create higher-quality growth.","As Jim discussed, we accelerated our SMB and business-to-business deliveries with the best gains in recent history. This is a strong proof point that our initiatives are working virtually. Every industry vertical showed volume improvements and higher revenue per package.","US domestic operating profit was about $1 billion. As expected, this quarter's profit was lowered by the planned opening of 14 new facilities, one less operating day and higher pension operating costs.","Now, turning to the international segment. We posted strong results, demonstrating the strength of our business model and the value that UPS solutions offer to global buyers and sellers.","Currency-neutral operating profit increased by nearly 10%. On a two-year stack, currency-neutral operating profit is up about 25%. Operating margins were over 20% and expanded 60 basis points this year.","International revenue rose 5.4% on a currency-neutral basis to $3.9 billion. We grew revenue in all regions during this period and flexed the network to take advantage of opportunities on multiple trade lanes.","Export shipments grew 2.4%, with a two-year stack at nearly 18% growth. Exports in Europe and the Americas led the segment.","Most lanes out of Asia were positive, with exports from Asia to the US down due to the changing trade environment.","International revenue per package increased 4.2% on a currency-neutral basis with excellent yield growth on both international domestic and exports. Product mix was favorable, driven by strong growth in B2B and premium solutions. ","Operating profit in the segment reached $781 million, up nearly 10% on a currency-neutral basis, its highest ever. This demonstrates our ability to grow and adapt to changing conditions across the globe and execute a disciplined approach to control costs. ","Now, let's turn to the Supply Chain & Freight segment. The Supply Chain & Freight group produced a solid quarter of financial performance when you consider the approximately $60 million in lost profit related to the contract ratification process at UPS freight.","To protect our customers\u2019 business, we proactively cleaned out our network. On November 12, we resumed operations with a ratified contract and started welcoming back our customers.","At this point, the overwhelming majority of our customers have returned. And as we execute win back and growth strategies, we will continue to right-size our freight network in line with the current needs.","Looking at the other business units in Supply Chain & Freight, performance was excellent. The forwarding group generated outstanding profit growth, driven by international air and ocean freight, coyote and the brokerage group.","For example, in the fourth quarter, ocean freight produced its best results this year, double-digit shipment growth, great cost control and expanding margins.","Distribution and logistics increased revenue by almost 7%, with all regions of the world contributing. The healthcare, aerospace, retail and manufacturing sectors all grew in the period and the unit achieved good operating profit growth.","Overall, Supply Chain & Freight team had another outstanding year, with double-digit profit growth. In fact, on a two-year stack, we have grown profits in this group by almost 37%.","Now, let\u2019s turn to the balance sheet, our financial strength has continued to be a hallmark of UPS. In 2018, UPS generated $6.1 billion in adjusted free cash flow. It was aided by benefits from the tax refunds in the first quarter and improvement from working capital initiatives throughout the year.","On an adjusted basis, we made $6.6 billion of capital investments during the year, in line with our expectations.","UPS returned $4.2 billion in 2018 to shareholders, with $1 billion of share buyback, as well as almost $3.2 billion in dividend distribution. That represents a nearly 10% increase per share this year.","Our effective tax rate was slightly over 22% for the fourth quarter, primarily due to the discrete tax benefit related to the final resolution of uncertain tax positions. In 2019, we estimate our effective tax rate to be between 23% and 24%. The estimate could change based on the final resolution of the new tax regulations.","Let\u2019s cover the rest of guidance. We view 2019 as a year of real progress. It\u2019s built from transformational momentum, investments in our network and the advancement of our strategies that have been developed over the last few years.","UPS will generate substantial increases in operating profit this year. We expect total operating profits to grow in the low teens, with all three segments up double-digit. ","Included in the operating profit results is an update to our short-term stock compensation program, which reduces the vesting period from five to one year. It brings UPS' annual incentive program for almost 40,000 management employees in line with peers and aligned to today's mobile workforce.","In our guidance, this is an increase to expense of about $250 million. The vesting is a non-cash timing event with no real economic impact. The drag will fade over the next five years.","Also in the results is a benefit from lower service costs, driven by higher discount rates and it mostly offsets the vesting headwind. ","Diving deeper into the segments, in the US, we expect revenue to increase 4% to 6%, driven in part by revenue quality initiatives. We\u2019re planning for improvements in customer and product mix, as well as an expansion in base rates.","We anticipate growth in the air shipments to be in the mid to high single digits and ground in the low single digit range. Operating profit is projected to grow between 10% and 13%, coupled with margin expansion.","We expect the international segment to have another strong year, with average daily shipments up 3% to 5%. Product mix will increase revenue yields. And as a result, revenue will increase 5% to 7%. We will maintain our industry-leading margins and expect to generate operating profit growth of 10% to 12%.","Finally, in the Supply Chain & Freight segment, we will continue to execute the disciplined strategy. We expect operating profit to increase in the low to mid teen range. ","During the first half of the year, we anticipate some headwinds to remain from the freight contract ratification process. ","Breaking out some of the key drivers of 2019 guidance, let's start with the 2018 adjusted earnings per share of $7.24. First, the strong underlying segment performance, year-over-year growth is anticipated to be up between 10% and 14%. The outstanding profit gains would be partially offset by the external factors affecting the below-the-line items, more specifically pension and tax.","The major driver of other pension income and expense is the higher interest cost and lower asset return. Pension asset returns were below our historical norm due to the turbulent 2018 financial markets late in the year.","Moving to tax, last year, we enjoyed tax benefits from discrete items that are not anticipated to repeat. Combining the below-the-line pension and tax, year-over-year adjusted EPS growth will be muted by about $0.51 or 700 basis points.","Putting it all altogether, we expect full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share to grow in the range of $7.45 to $7.75.","Looking at the seasonality of EPS across the quarters, in the first quarter, results will be muted, driven by one less operating day, Easter moving to April and the 2018 tax benefits that will not repeat. We expect earnings per share to be about 19% of the full-year adjusted EPS midpoint.","We expect the distribution of EPS to be approximately equal across the remaining three quarters, in a range of between 26% and 28% of the full-year adjusted EPS midpoint. ","Transformation charges are not part of our 2019 guidance. We expect charges this year and will provide additional information as initiatives are launched.","We affirm our guidance on CapEx of between 8.5% and 10% of revenue for 2019. These investments, which include automated buildings and technology, continue to expand the efficiency and flexibility of the UPS Smart Global Logistics Network and were instrumental in our success this peak season.","Additionally, we plan to reward shareholders with growth in dividends, subject to board approval, and anticipate share buybacks of around $1 billion in 2019. We also expect the dilutive share count to be about 870 million shares throughout the year.","Adjusted free cash flow is anticipated to be between $3.5 billion and $4 billion, with potential for additional upside based on our working capital initiatives.","We view 2019 as a year of real progress, with UPS generating a substantial increase in operating profit. We expect total operating profit to grow in the low teens with all three segments up double-digit.","Thank you. And now, I\u2019ll ask the operator to open the line. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the program back over to our IRO, Mr. Scott Childress. Please go ahead, sir.","Scott Childress","Thank you. We\u2019re going to take an online question this morning. We\u2019ve got multiple questions. Fadi Chamoun from the BMO, Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer, Jack Atkins from Stephens that ask, it appears UPS did not experience the full impact of economic headwinds. Can you elaborate a little bit on what you're seeing in terms of demand in your international business?","David Abney","Okay, this is David. And thank you all for that question and there are many more questions about international. I think we could spend an entire call on international. ","I would just say, the way we look at headwinds is from our perspective. And do we see global headwinds? Absolutely. We see many of the ones that have been identified by others. But what's not talked about near as much is the tailwinds and the opportunities that we believe are out there. And those tailwinds really are strategic imperatives. And those where we\u2019re going to make our investments, continue to make our investments and take advantage of these opportunities. So, we still think, with all the trade discussion, that there are global growth markets that we can certainly expand in. e-Commerce is providing all kinds of opportunities.","Small and mid-size businesses that don't get talked about nearly as much as larger e-tailers, are certainly playing a big role in this market. And then, healthcare and life sciences. So, all of those, we think, are just good, good opportunities.","And when you look at our fourth-quarter results, as was briefly mentioned, currency neutral, our operating profit in our international business was up 10% and our operating margins over 20%. This is our best performance international ever and it is during some of these headwinds and opportunities that we talk about. ","So, that \u2013 we\u2019d like to discuss a little bit more about Europe specifically. Jim, would you like to do that?","James Barber","Sure, I\u2019d love to. So, two opening comments, I guess, is we continue to see international, and not just express business, but supply chain as well, is a growth and diversification engine. No question about that. I think we\u2019ve seen that over time.","Europe, obviously, is one of those parts of the world that Brexit seems to win the day. And, certainly, from our perspective, we want that to be solved properly. But in the midst of that, our European business managed to grow revenue in the high-single-digits, keep expense to about half that growth and grow profits about 15%.","David talked about some of these factors. Obviously, some years ago, when we didn't win our way with the TNT merger, we had a choice and we moved on to a $2 billion organic investment strategy. We stay absolutely true to that. Our job is to win in both organic or inorganic moves in the market. Right now, in Europe, it is very much an organic growth story. And in the end, our job is to be able to create leverage in almost any environment that we\u2019re dealt. Macro changes will come and go over time. And at the very end, our job is to run the business and create leverage. In Europe, we feel like, had a nice quarter. We talked about in the third quarter that we\u2019ll continue forward. Fourth quarter did that. And we can see similar actions and initiatives going forward in 2019. So, that\u2019s the international European from our perspective.","Scott Childress","We\u2019re going to take another question from multiple analysts \u2013 Brian Ossenbeck from J.P. Morgan, Ben Hartford from RW Baird, and Kevin Sterling over at Seaport Global. Can the US domestic segment grow volume and expand margins or are the two mutually exclusive, given the headwinds in B2C?","Richard Peretz","So, this is Richard. I'll start and then I'll turn it over to Jim as well. I think you look at the fourth quarter and it's indicative of some of the transformation around growth that we\u2019ve talked about. We had revenue per piece in the US up almost 5%. During my talk, I mentioned, and Jim mentioned about, the SMB, the small medium-sized business, and also the positive product and customer mix.","We do see 2019 as a pivot point. If you go through the numbers, you'll see that operating profit is growing, which means that we are creating leverage and it really is the start of something that we talked about would happen as we had our investments come in line, transformation as well as improving operations throughout the country.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jim.","James Barber","Yeah, yeah. I had a few key points to it. I think when you sit down and you think about the year that we\u2019ve just entered, you've heard a lot about revenue quality, obviously, throughout the call. I know Kate\u2019s going to talk about that more. But the continued focus on that. And Kevin, obviously new, is going to support as well.","Non-op leverage and procurement savings coming through. Scott will talk about that today some more as well on the call. But at the end of the day, we haven't talked as much about the capacity adds. Juan will do that as the call goes on, but certainly the 22 facilities we built last year and the 18 we\u2019re going to add this year really allow the integrated networks to perform and perform at much higher levels, which is the key to success at peak as well. How we execute peak in 2019, we\u2019re going to continue to refine that strategy and move that forward.","There\u2019s already ground for us. We\u2019ve expanded it. We added about 100 buildings in 2018. So, as we enter 2019, we are in 323 buildings in the US. And, quite frankly, the operating leverage that we saw in the fourth quarter of 2018, we see moving us out and starting in 2019 and going forward. So, that really is the pillar underpinning the dialogue and the turn as we move into 2019 and we\u2019re anxious to get on with it and move through the quarters as Rich described.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Please go ahead.","Thomas Wadewitz","Yes, good morning. And congratulations on the strong peak season performance and results as well. I wanted to ask, Jim. You just commented a bit on domestic. I wanted ask you a little bit more on that. Richard, first, if you can just kind of review the comments you made about the vesting change in impact and then kind of the \u2013 I guess the lower discount benefit, if you can just review those comments?","And then, within domestic packets, how do we think about the impact of that favorable mix into SMB, B2B? Is that going to continue? And then, productivity, how much flows in? So, I think just a number of things to understand. How we would think about the drivers of domestic package margin performance in 2019?","Richard Peretz","Tom, what I'm going to do is I'm going to cover the MIP and the discount rate and then I'm going to turn it over to Kate to talk a little bit about where we\u2019re headed with some of the initiatives around our customer and product mix.","Specifically, around the vesting, it really is about a short-term stock equity program that 40,000 employees participate in. The legacy was, it was a five year vesting and it wasn't meeting the market. And it\u2019s transformation we continue to look at. How do we make UPS attractive place to work, get the right talent and also make sure we\u2019re delivering appropriately from a compensation standpoint? So, part of that was making the change. It really is no overall impact when you go through the five years. There is a little bit heavier charge now and then slowly dissipates to zero by the fifth year.","In terms of the discount rate, that $250 million is pretty much offset by the benefit we saw in the operating line on discount rate. So, in the press release, we call out the below-the-line portion. And while it\u2019s not entirely the same as the MIP, a large portion of the MIP is offset by that. And that's because the service cost portion is accrued differently when the discount rate rises. So, that\u2019s all inside the operating line.","But, most importantly, I think when you look overall, the operating growth in the low double digits is a big improvement for the US and it's not just what\u2019s happening in the operating leverage, but what we\u2019re doing with revenue and Kate will talk about that.","Kathleen Gutmann","Thanks. And, Tom, I\u2019ll just add, both customer and product mix was positive in the quarter and, yes, tied to our strategy of revenue quality. And we continue to align value price and cost. And going further with different industries, different segments, further with small and medium-size businesses, and be more selective with large customers. So, the strategy is playing out and will continue to do so.","Thomas Wadewitz","Great, thank you.","Operator","And we have a question from the line of Scott Group, Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Scott Group","Hey, thanks. Morning, guys. So, I wanted to ask \u2013 the guidance for profit is low teens. If I if I heard you right, Richard, for first quarter, it sounds like it implied more like low to mid-single digits. So, maybe help us think about why \u2013 what's changing and why it doesn't show up in the beginning of the year and why it comes more in the back half of the year?","And then, can you just walk us through the pieces? $6 billion of free cash flow last year and $3.5 billion to $4 billion this year. What are the drivers for the delta?","Richard Peretz","Okay. Scott, I'll start with the guidance specifically. I think you're calling out the first quarter. The two big factors in the first quarter are, first, the workdays and Easter move from the first quarter to the second quarter. So, if you go back and look in history, there's a volume run up prior to Easter, and that plays into it. And then just the workday. There's one less workday in the first quarter. And when you do the math to the third quarter, you'll see the pickup because there\u2019s an extra workday in the third quarter.","In terms of when you think about the free cash flow, we had called out some working capital initiatives that we\u2019re going to continue and we talked about that, but also we know, in 2018, there were some past benefits that we called out in March, both for the tax rate change as well as a big refund. ","So, when you kind of normalize for that, we\u2019re going to have an excellent year of free cash flow again. We\u2019re going to continue to try to build that. And we talked about additional opportunities to grow it through some of the initiatives. And as we do daily in 2018, we\u2019ll share those accomplishments and what it means to free cash flows as the year goes.","James Barber","Yeah. Just to follow up on the first quarter, there are no business fundamental issues with the first quarter. Rich certainly pointed out the two things about the calendar.","The other thing is these discrete tax items that hit the first quarter of last year that don't this year. So, other than that, we see the first quarter with the same momentum as the rest of the year.","Scott Childress","We\u2019re going to take an online question here. This comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Did you progress in your pursuit of growing share with small and medium-size businesses this peak season?","Kathleen Gutmann","So, thanks, Scott, for the question. This is Kate. And the answer is yes. Our strategy is working. Our small and medium-size business growth was the best we've seen in recent history in the US as well as throughout the world and across different industries. And you can see that demonstrated in our notable B2B and B2C growth. The sales and marketing teams continue to work very well together to win more in the market. And it is notable that we\u2019re the market leader already in small and medium-size businesses, but we\u2019re delivering more solutions to go even further. ","Just to give you a little flavor, Where To Go, we\u2019ve talked about, but there is strong demand as we build out our merchant network. UPS My Choice just hit an amazing 56 million of happy consumers and we\u2019re going to be extending that to UPS My Choice for Business later this year. So, very excited about that.","And then, also, the alliances Jim mentioned in the opening, the Shopify integrating UPS services into that system, ShopRunner bringing two-day delivery across the country for different retailers, Inception and then Optoro on the return side. And continuing to enhance how we reach these small and medium-size businesses globally through digital solution.","So, SMBs are the growth engine for economies throughout the world and we are very well positioned to continue our success in that segment. Thanks so much.","David Abney","And this is David. Just a quick summary about the importance of SMBs. They are 95% of the firms and they are 50% of US GDP. So, when Kate talks about all these initiatives, it\u2019s because that\u2019s such an important selector and, of course, it is one of our strategic imperatives.","Scott Childress","We\u2019re going to take another online question. This question is from Ravi Shankar from Morgan Stanley and Amit [ph] at Deutsche Bank. What percent of your US volume is being sorted manually today and what do you see going forward? As well as, can you give us an update on the 22 facilities you brought online this year?","Great. Good morning. This is Juan Perez. Thanks for the question. We continue to make significant progress in expanding our automated capacity across the network. And just as a reminder, that is a key component of the buildout of our Smart Logistics Network, which we\u2019re really proud of the progress we've be making up to this point.","Now, to tell you how that progress has materialized, at the end of 2018, we had nearly 70% of our ground eligible volume going these automated facilities. In 2019, we expect that number to grow to almost 80%. And to put it in perspective, back in 2017, we were only at about 50%. So, continued progress in that area.","Now, to do that, we successfully \u2013 and Jim mentioned it, we successfully completed our 22 automated facility projects in 2018. That was a global project footprint. They accounted for more than 5 million square feet in capacity across the network. For those who are in the US, 1 million was in international. That added 400,000 packages per hour of capacity in one year across the network. The regionals in Atlanta and Salt Lake City in Phoenix, they just provided excellent capacity support in these areas. And on top of all that, we added 2,300 car positions to the US network, again, giving us additional capacity to support the Smart Logistics Network. ","In 2019, that would be another busy year for us in building capacity. We\u2019re excited about it again. Jim mentioned 18 US facilities that will be coming online. In total, we\u2019ll have 20 because we have some international facilities as well coming online. Seven automated small sorts. We will be adding an additional 400,000 packages per hour of capacity. And critical areas where we see significant growth will see additional capacity as well. Tennessee, California, Kentucky and Ohio. So, we continue to move forward with our strategy. We feel pretty solid about it.","Operator","We have a question from David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead.","David Vernon","Hey, good morning, guys. So, Richard or David, I wanted to talk a little bit about the returns on this CapEx program. We\u2019re about a year-and-a-half, two years in. CapEx has stepped up. It\u2019s going to go on for another two years. And it feels like within the guidance, you guys are getting some of the productivity that you are expecting, some of the return on these investments, but they're being offset by the below-the-line pension, they're getting offset by this change in the stock comp at $0.51 that you\u2019ve called out. How should we be thinking about the return on this investment program? Should we be expecting that $0.51 to maybe not be there in 2020 and you're going to get that catch-up into that next year? Or will there be additional sort of offsets that are coming up? I guess what I'm trying to figure out here is when does the benefit that you guys are getting from these investments going to show up actually in the EPS number.","Richard Peretz","Sure, David. This is Richard. And I think the first thing that we have to think about is, if you just look at what happened really the stock market in the last six weeks of the year, that's predominately what's driving a tremendous amount of the pension below-the-line impact. So, I'd love to sit here and tell you that we\u2019re not going to see \u2013 we\u2019re going to see a positive market that\u2019s X, Y or Z, but I do understand that what we look at \u2013 what December looks like, it was a stock market that was, for the month, worse since, I believe, the Depression. And so, that had a big impact at the end of the year that wasn't expected. I don't expect that to repeat. And because of that, I do believe \u2013 and if you think about the underlying real story here, it is that we have double-digit low teens growth in all three segments. And it's been many years since you've seen that. We are at the pivot point of the benefits from transformation, the investments. And, most importantly, our return on invested capital remains within our range.","David Vernon","So, as you think sort of like the 2020 build, right, you're getting the return on the investments you've been making. It\u2019s just getting offset a little bit and then that should still ladder up into that 2020, 2021 timeframe. Is that right?","Richard Peretz","That's right. I kind of think of the below-the-line as some things we have to deal with, but at the end of the day it's not what we\u2019re doing on the top \u2013 on the operating profit and continue to improve that year-over-year.","James Barber","This is Jim. The question that we\u2019re kind of dancing around a little bit, Tom asked it a minute ago, was are we getting the productivity improvements from these investments. And the answer is yes. In fact, there\u2019s other investments in this integrated network that come to life once you get these hubs effectively moving the way they. And you saw some of that in peak and you\u2019ll see that in the years to come as well.","David Vernon","All right. And maybe just as a quick follow-up, you guys talked in the past about the CapEx resting back down to that 6% range following the facility buildout. Is that still kind of how you're looking at the world in a post sort of 2021 timeframe?","Richard Peretz","So, Dave, we, obviously, expect that it will eventually come down as we\u2019ve talked about. We\u2019ll guide to outer years as appropriate. But we know for the next few years, the advantages from the investments are getting the return and we\u2019ll come back to that. And I\u2019ll cover some of that with you offline as appropriate.","David Vernon","All right. Thank you, guys. ","Scott Childress","Thanks, David. Just make sure that we\u2019re following only one question, so we can move on. Our next question is an online question from Brian Ossenbeck, JP Morgan. There was a mention on Central States during the prepared remarks. Can you give us the latest update on that from a UPS standpoint?","Richard Peretz","So, this is Richard again. And I'll start by \u2013 and I think David will finish up on this one. But the first thing to remember here, when we withdrew from Central States in 2007, and today it was the right decision. In 2014, some legislation passed that allowed for pension reductions and it opened up new accounting considerations we had to look at, as we disclosed that a few years ago when that law passed.","If you look at the requirements under GAAP, we have to evaluate outcomes based on the current legislation. When you look at the multi-employer area on pension. There's over million participants in 5,000 employers that are impacted by plans that are in declining status.","The industries are vast. In fact, UPS is less than 2%. That being said, we continue to work with all the appropriate parties to find the right solution. And I think David wants to talk a little about some of those efforts.","David Abney","I do, Rich. And in 2018, a joint select committee made up of equal members of Democrats and Republicans, equal members from the House and the Senate, and they made very good progress in finding solutions for these failing multi-employer pension plans. We\u2019re talking about Central States here, but this problem is much bigger than Central States. There's hundreds of these plans that we are not involved in as a company that are in this critical and declining status. So, that\u2019s why this is a nationwide issue. ","While they made good progress, they did not meet the statutory deadline of reaching a bipartisan solution by the end of the year. Really believe that Congress does understand the sense of urgency and that they will continue to make this a priority this year. And we are certainly going to continue to advocate with both Congress and the administration on why this needs to be addressed, how it affects many employees throughout the country, and how it can also have an effect on employers in \u2013 not as much on the big companies. There is a lot of smaller companies out there that have employees in these plans. And if this situation doesn't get fixed, it could certainly have a negative effect on them. So, it\u2019s an important issue. We\u2019ll continue to work on it.","Scott Childress","We\u2019re going to take an online question here. This question comes from Chris Wetherbee at Citi, as well as Todd Fowler from KeyBanc. The question is about an update on transformation. Is transformation mostly a cost reduction initiative or, from the high-growth side, strategic standpoint, how is UPS getting at this?","Scott Price","Thanks, Chris and Todd, for the question. So, as we mentioned in the fall investor conference, transformation supports and funds the business strategy. So, it's a combination of both cost and growth. And you've heard that as each one of the speakers explained progress in their areas as the transformation very much is supporting all sides. ","On the cost end, we've made some really good progress. The voluntary retirement program, we had a very good take rate. Centralized global procurement to leverage our global scale and buying power. And we\u2019re moving back office work and transactional work to our global business services and BPO to reduce our overall cost and investing those back in technology.","We\u2019re investing in a lot of growth. Kate mentioned quite a bit about SMBs and the platforms that in partnerships that we\u2019re building to support B2B e-commerce. We\u2019re capturing international, as Jim touched on. Healthcare is an important area for us and we see an opportunity for helping our customers to increasing regulatory compliance challenges, cost pressures. We think that our network is well-positioned.","We have home healthcare opportunity, direct to patient, lab specimen, clinical. And then, of course, we\u2019re building on our synergies with Marken.","We set aggressive goals in 2018; we achieved them. We have many new initiatives in 2019, with just as aggressive goals. I'm a little over a year now with the company and I continue to be impressed by how the organization is able to adapt and agilely transform itself, while also continuing to deliver our very, very high levels of customer service, as you saw in peak.","Operator","And we have a question from the line of Allison Laundry of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Allison Laundry","Good morning. Thanks. I wanted to ask about the operating penalties and where they came in for the full year 2018. And then, also, in terms of the domestic cost per piece, if you could parse out what the efficiency gains were during the quarter, maybe the operating penalties themselves and fuel and any other components? And then, how should we think about cost per piece inflation in 2019?","Richard Peretz","Sure, Allison. This is Richard. I think the first thing, we did call out a number for the year for operating penalty. It came in pretty close to where we had expected. We had called it out during the quarters. And if you look at December, while we\u2019re slightly below where we expected to be, mostly because of what happened in November with a really strong December, those penalties that we expected, they came. We expect some penalties again this coming year because we\u2019re opening up almost the same number of buildings, but it\u2019s not going to be as much of a drag because we\u2019re getting the benefits, and we talked about the year-over-year.","In terms of the cost per piece and the changes, I think with what we've given you, you can calculate the cost per piece. You can see the inflation numbers or the increases coming down. You could even look at our operating expenses this quarter and it was among the lowest that we've had in the last two years.","With that, I think perhaps getting into the model and the numbers, I think we can take this conversation offline and talk about the incremental pieces that you\u2019re asking.","Allison Laundry","Okay, thank you.","Scott Childress","We\u2019re going to take an online question from Scott Schneeberger as well as Tom Wadewitz from UBS. The question is, can you give us an update on your returns that you saw around peak and how they affected your business, as well as how you view your pricing as you think out into 2019?","Kathleen Gutmann","Absolutely. This is Kate. I will start with overall peak because returns is one component that comes along with the business. But with the quality revenue that we delivered, as you've noticed the last few quarters, we have delivered base pricing over 3% as we further align our value that we\u2019re delivering to customers with our pricing, gaining that leverage and ensuring that we\u2019re addressing our cost to serve. So, we do see that continuing. That is absolutely the strategy.","And then, as you say, enhancing our customer and product mix returns is a key component of that. It is a very valuable business with high density delivery and we saw a notable growth. We also have the most expensive returns portfolio in the marketplace and we are furthering that. So, we've got everything from mobile returns where small and medium-size businesses can actually manage their own returns policies then to consolidated returns for large customers in an alliance with Optoro, which helps them to turn their returns dollars into revenue dollars, so that in the moment selling of returns really helps them to reclaim the value and for us to then leverage that to ensure higher value equals higher price.","So, we\u2019re confident about our strategy and we will continue to deliver on that.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Christian Wetherbee","Hey, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask about transformation benefits and sort of understand if we\u2019re getting transformation benefits in 2019 and the guidance from the VRP or other initiatives that you have. And then, beyond 2019, how we should expect the cadence of that $1 to $1.20 type of \u2013 how that should roll in post 2019?","Richard Peretz","Sure, Chris. This is Richard and I\u2019ll start; and then, Scott will talk a little bit about some of our plans and where we\u2019re headed. But inside transformation, we talked about the VRP and the full run rate happening in the last half of the year. That is, in essence, what\u2019s in the guidance. We had a successful program. We\u2019re making the adjustments. On the revenue side, both Kate and Scott have talked about the growth side of transformation. You see it in our revenue per piece. You see it in our growth in SMB. And you see it in our customer and product mix, which, let me remind you, was positive contribution to revenue per piece. And that's really the first time we've had that in a number of years. And so, it\u2019s a foundation of transformation. It\u2019s not just about how do we reduce costs, but it\u2019s the customer mixed and making sure we have that appropriate. Scott?","Scott Price","So, I think you can look on the shape of the 2019 guidance that there\u2019s a very significant amount of activity going on in terms of the transformation program. We\u2019re talking hundreds of initiatives. And I think what you're saying is a reflection of those initiatives funding significant investment in technology and capability and as well platforms and partnerships to drive that mix change. We've made that guidance in terms of by 2021, and we continue to confirm that.","In the shape of 2019, you're seeing a pretty important and pivotable year for us to continue to drive down these costs and change the shape of our growth and revenue mix through many of the savings being reinvested back into the business.","Christian Wetherbee","Okay. But to be clear, it\u2019s the VRP in 2019 specifically. That's really what we should be focused on?","Scott Price","Yeah. The 2019 VRP absolutely does continue to flow through. And we continue to use those savings for investments in other areas. Kate mentioned Where To Go, that is an area that we\u2019re investing in, to be able to drive SMB e-commerce. So, it\u2019s a combination of cost reduction programs. We\u2019re using those to investing as well to ensure that there's a flow through to the bottom line.","One area that I also would to highlight is the 2018 program. You're also seeing in 2019 was the progress we're making in procurement, centralizing our global buy and really leveraging that spending power as we reduce our cost to operate and reinvest.","Christian Wetherbee","Okay, thank you.","Scott Childress","We\u2019re going to take an online question. This question is coming in about our fulfillment partnership. And can you please provide some color around UPS\u2019 long-term strategy around what we\u2019re doing to help mid and small customers?","Scott Price","Thanks for the question. This is Scott. So, if you look at the transformation programs in terms of the overall approach, we do see that there is an enormous opportunity to leverage the megatrend of small and midsize businesses, both in the B2B, but as well B2C e-commerce.","Kate mentioned a couple of the relationships that we've established in exception [ph], ShopRunner. Those are beginning to support our customers and we see that as an enormous opportunity for us to continue to build SMB B2B market share, which is part of our overall revenue mix. We will see those platforms in the future coming together and creating quite a powerful proposition. And Kate?","Kathleen Gutmann","Yeah. And I would just add, Sarah, tied [ph] to fulfillment, we see the macro trend with small\/medium-size businesses partaking in e-commerce, needing help with that fulfillment option in the marketplace. And we have both our e-fulfillment strategies, where the smaller customers can grow into out of their garage or what have you and then graduate to what Scott is talking about with Where To Go. So, we do intend to meet the full spectrum of needs for our small and medium-size businesses to ensure that we stay market leader.","James Barber","I\u2019d add something to both what Scott and Kate just mentioned, is that remember in David\u2019s opening remarks, we have just brought Philippe Gilbert on to really help us look now from an outside-in perspective at things like an LLP provider and how that works in distribution these days, how supply chains are moving across the world and, ultimately, that's his first task with us, was to help us make sure that our distribution strategy continues to be and stay connected to the core businesses and create value going forward. So, we\u2019re happy to have Philippe on board to help us assess those going forward as well. ","Operator","That concludes our Q&A session for today. Now, I will turn the program back over to Mr. Childress. Please go ahead, sir.","Scott Childress ","Obviously, thank you for joining us today. And, David, if you\u2019ve got any closing remarks. ","David Abney","I do, Scott. Our plan going in today is to show that UPS is on a different path than some other companies. Our transformation initiatives are underway \u2013 well underway. They're enabling our strategy. And we\u2019ve made great progress this quarter. Strong, strong international results. The revenue yields, the expansion that was led by our US business and how they performed during peak from a service and a cost standpoint, and really how our investments are just really timed the way they should be and they're adding efficiency and flexibility to our network.","So, we continue to see strong growth opportunities. And, again, I'm more convinced than ever that UPS is on the right track to create that value that\u2019s so important for our shareholders and for our customers and, of course, for our people. So, again, thank you very much for joining us.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference call today. We\u2019d like to thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day.

My name is Stephen, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations' Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Andy Dolny, UPS Investor -- Treasurer and Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.","Andy Dolny","Good morning. Today, I'm joined by Scott Davis, our CEO; and Kurt Kuehn, our CFO, to discuss the company's results for the quarter and future expectations. In addition, in an effort to increase access to UPS leadership, we have asked David Abney, our COO; Dan Brutto, International President; Alan Gershenhorn, Chief Sales and Marketing Officer; and Myron Gray, President of U.S. Operations, to participate today and in future calls.","Before we begin, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the company. These anticipated results are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2011 Form 10-K and 2012 10-Q reports. These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the Securities and Exchange Commission.","In August, we announced restructuring of the New England Teamsters and Trucking Industry Pension Fund. As a result, in our third quarter earnings, UPS recorded a noncash charge of $896 million. On an after tax basis, the impact was $559 million or $0.58 per share. Excluding the effect of this transaction, diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $1.06. In our remarks today, we will refer to UPS third quarter 2012 results excluding the impact of this charge.","Additionally, all 2012 full year references and comparisons to 2011 will refer to adjusted results. We believe this is a more accurate picture of the company's performance. Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures and free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, are explained in the schedules that accompanied our earnings news release. These schedules, along with the webcast of today's call, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website.","A couple of reminders, any guidance that we provide does not include any operating results, synergies or post-closing integration expense related to TNT. Also, our outlook does not include any potential pension, mark-to-market entry. If interest rates stay as low as they are, UPS will likely record a sizable mark-to-market charge in the fourth quarter. Keep in mind, this will not affect cash flow or require funding. While this charge would impact our GAAP earnings, it will be excluded in adjusted results. [Operator Instructions]","Now let me turn it over to Scott.","D. Scott Davis","Thanks, Andy, and good morning. Our third quarter results reflect the ability of UPSers to meet the needs of our customers while making the necessary adjustments in an environment of shifting market conditions. The U.S. Domestic business benefited from e-commerce. International results have rebounded as exports from Asia grew slightly. Europe was steady, however, U.S. exports remained weak. The Supply Chain & Freight segment continued to deliver strong operating margins.","Now let's take a quick look at the global economy. In Europe, more countries are slipping into recession as they impose austerity measures. Though the economy there has contracted, the small package market has not.","In Asia, although projections have come down, economic growth there leads the world. Although as I said last quarter, exports continue to lag GDP growth.","Here in the U.S., where some of the recent economic indicators provide optimism, general economists have lowered their expectations for the remainder of the year. The lack of clear direction on future tax and spending policy has and will continue to slow business investment. This will clearly impact the B2B small package market.","Regardless of the outcome in November, the U.S. is on the edge of a fiscal cliff, and there is concern whether our politicians can reach an agreement that solves these issues. The lack of political will to fix our debt problem adds to the uncertainty in our economy, just what we don't need.","That's why we are supporting Fix The Debt, the organization founded by former U.S. Senator Alan Simpson and Clinton Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles. Our goal is to have a bipartisan debt reduction plan drafted when Congress returns in January, and we believe it's realistic to have it passed in early 2013. If solutions are in place to both reduce our deficit and eliminate the threat of a fiscal cliff, the U.S. will be in a much better position for sustained economic growth.","During the quarter, UPS began formal negotiations with the Teamsters more than 10 months early. We believe an early start will lead to an early conclusion, and this is beneficial for all stakeholders.","In addition, UPS successfully completed the largest nonmilitary logistics event ever when the 2012 London Olympic and Paralympic Games closed. I personally want to thank the thousands of UPSers who worked to ensure the success of these games. Great job. The logistic support of the London Olympics is a prime example of our transformation and the trust the international community has placed in UPS. We've invested over the decades to build unique capabilities, trading the world's logistics provider.","Further demonstrating the UPS strategy of investing to grow is our planned acquisition of TNT Express. We recently received a Statement of Objection from the European Commission. This is not uncommon. We're evaluating this confidential document and will respond in due course.","UPS still expects to close this transaction early next year. We have committed to complete this acquisition and enhance our position in the logistics industry. We are further strengthening the UPS brand and positioning the company for worldwide growth, well into the future.","Speaking of brand, earlier this month, Interbrand announced their 2012 list of 100 Best Global Brands, and UPS, once again, ranked #1 in our industry. Finally, UPSers around the world are gearing up for the holiday rush, and I'm confident that no matter what Mother Nature throws our way, UPS will deliver.","Now Kurt will review our results for the quarter.","Kurt P. Kuehn","Well, thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Given the economic climate, UPS executed well during the quarter with earnings per share of $1.06. This is down slightly compared to last year, primarily due to a lower tax rate in 2011. Total UPS daily volume grew 2.9%. Revenue was down slightly due to one less operating day while operating profit and margin were flat with last year.","During last quarter's call, we discussed our concern for global economic expansion, particularly here in the U.S., and we've taken the necessary steps with network changes and other adjustments. Over the next few minutes, I'll share with you what we've accomplished over the past 3 months.","Starting with U.S. Domestic, the segment generated operating margin of 13%. Operating profits were down slightly compared to last year as the quarter was negatively impacted by $60 million in fuel surcharge lag, as well as the one less operating day that I just mentioned. While business-to-business declined a bit, average daily volume growth was slightly higher than anticipated across all products, advanced entirely by B2C.","Ground rose 3% fueled by both lightweight and traditional residential products. Not only are e-commerce shippers leveraging our extensive Ground solutions, but they also continue to look to UPS premium products to enhance their competitive edge. As a result, Next Day Air volume increased almost 6% and our Deferred air products jumped more than 9%.","Total revenue per piece declined by about 1%. Base rate improvement was more than offset by significantly lower fuel surcharges, as well as changes in both product and customer mix. The rapid growth in lightweight B2C shipments continue to push average weight per package lower. Ground revenue per piece was up slightly while Next Day Air and Deferred were down 4.6% and 5.1%, respectively. Next Day Saver growth continues to outpace A.M. products as shippers realize its value for residential deliveries.","Once again, UPS technology innovations contributed to better cost control and efficiency gains in the network. In fact, paid hours, miles driven and aircraft block hours all increased less than volume. While U.S. Domestic results were solid, UPS remains constructively dissatisfied. As B2C expands, we are continuing to adapt both our business model and revenue strategies. UPS technology will ensure that our integrated network remains flexible, providing the ability to react quickly to evolving dynamics in the marketplace.","Now let's review our International results. This segment rebounded after a few tough quarters in a row. In fact, we had a record third quarter operating profit of $449 million. Clearly, the results of our initiatives are bearing fruit. Network adjustments, combined with in-country cost management, resulted in operating profit growth of 7.7%. Operating margin expanded 170 basis points to 15.3%. Benefits derived from currency exceeded the headwind generated by higher fuel costs. We also incurred about $20 million in acquisition-related expenses, which were offset by other onetime items, including a pension adjustment.","UPS average daily export volume was up 1.2% with slight increases in Asia and Europe while U.S. exports continue to disappoint. Non-U.S. Domestic average daily volume declined 2.7% due to the slowing global economy and UPS's revenue management initiatives in Europe. Fluctuations in currency and the lower fuel surcharge drove the revenue decline of 3.7%. When adjusted for these, third quarter revenue was up slightly. Looking at revenue per piece on a currency-neutral basis, non-U.S. Domestic improved 3% and export was relatively flat, reflecting the continuing shift in trade patterns and customer migration to less premium products.","Now for Supply Chain & Freight. This segment, once again, generated an operating margin in excess of 8%. Although revenue fell $75 million, operating profit was down just $15 million. Declines in our Forwarding unit were partially offset by improved UPS Freight results. UPS Freight revenue improved 3.6%, due to growth in LTL tonnage and revenue per hundredweight.","UPS technology innovations, like pickup notification, have proven very popular with our customers. Yield gains and productivity improvements contributed to another quarter of operating margin expansion. Poor industry conditions due to overcapacity in the Asia airfreight market pushed revenue and margin lower in the Forwarding unit.","Meanwhile, in Distribution, demand for UPS healthcare solutions was a strong contributor to revenue growth, although investments in healthcare technology infrastructure and facilities did weigh on margins. Recently, UPS opened 3 new state-of-the-art facilities in China and Australia, adding more than 350,000 square feet of healthcare-compliant capacity in Asia.","Looking now at cash in our balance sheet. UPS generated more than $3.6 billion in free cash flow after capital expenditures of $1.6 billion. The company also paid $1.6 billion in dividends.","During the quarter, UPS took advantage of market opportunities to acquire more than 7 million shares. Year-to-date, the company has repurchased 18.5 million shares for approximately $1.4 billion. Our target for full year purchases remains unchanged at $1.5 billion. Total outstanding shares for the fourth quarter are expected to be about 5 million shares lower than in the third quarter.","The financial quality of UPS was obvious during our recent bond offering, which was oversubscribed sevenfold. The $1.75 billion in 5-, 10- and 30-year notes is being used to replace debt maturing in January. We made the decision to go to the market a few months early, given the historically low rates. We achieved an average yield of 2.45% on debt with an average maturity of 13 years. As a result of this issuance and in anticipation of closing the TNT acquisition next year, UPS ended the quarter with more than $9 billion in cash and marketable securities.","And now to guidance. The UPS business model performed well during the quarter, and the macro environment was, for the most part, consistent with our assumptions. Given our performance and greater confidence in fourth quarter execution, we have enhanced our full year earnings guidance to a range of $4.55 to $4.65 per share, an increase of 5% to 7% over last year. We are basically reaffirming guidance around our previous midpoint, but narrowing the range to reflect the higher degree of earning certainty.","If you remember, 4Q '11 was a record quarter for UPS. That being said, in fourth quarter of this year, we expect all 3 segments to increase operating profits and to generate margins similar to or slightly above last year.","In U.S. Domestic segment for the quarter, we anticipate operating margin will once again exceed 15%, and average daily volume growth should be about 3%, driven by B2C in both lightweight and Saver.","For International, we expect mid-single-digit operating profit growth in Q4 with slight improvement in average daily volume growth trends. This guidance includes a similar amount of acquisition-related expenses to what we saw in the third quarter.","In Supply Chain & Freight, though we expect the challenging airfreight environment to continue, for the fourth quarter, operating profit should increase moderately on relatively flat revenue.","Certainly, consumer behavior during the upcoming holidays will affect where UPS earnings fall within the $4.55 to $4.65 range. As we demonstrated during the 2011 peak season, UPS is ready and more than able to handle whatever comes our way.","But before I turn it over to Alan Gershenhorn for an update on peak season, I do want to encourage all of you consumers out there to indulge during the upcoming holidays, purchase lots of gifts and, of course, have them shipped UPS. Alan?","Alan Gershenhorn","Thanks, Kurt. As everyone knows, the holidays are a busy time around UPS. Every peak season, millions of customers count on more than 400,000 UPSers to successfully manage the sharp and sudden increase in deliveries. This surge will take our daily average of about 15 million packages up to 28 million on this year's peak day, the most ever in our 105-year history. It is truly awe-inspiring, and in my 32-peak seasons, I've always been impressed for how our people get the job done. This year will be no exception.","The dramatic rise of e-commerce continues to alter consumer behavior and shipping patterns. Historically, peak season volume ramped up from Thanksgiving to Christmas. This year, we are planning for 2 peak periods: one that revolves around Black Friday and Cyber Monday, the other compressed into the 2 weeks before Christmas.","Speaking to our global customer base about their expectations for this holiday season, they tell us they are cautious. However, they also remain optimistic. Economic uncertainty around the world has them uneasy about how their consumers will respond this year. On another note, the retail inventory to sales ratio is still historically low. So their supply chain is constrained to keep up if demand is more than predicted.","And although consumer confidence has increased recently, there is still concern relative to political and fiscal uncertainty. According to a recent survey, 70% of Americans say the current state of the economy is impacting their spending plans, and as a result, forecast for holiday retail sales call for lower growth. The National Retail Federation is projecting a 4.1% rise in holiday sales, which is below last year's 5.6% but still above the 10-year average. More importantly for UPS, e-commerce sales are expected to jump 12% over last year, so demand for our lightweight and Deferred air products is expected to be high.","As the season develops, UPS will be ready. In fact, we already started the hiring process for temporary employees. This peak, they will help deliver more than 0.5 billion packages around the globe.","And to support both shippers and consumers during the holidays, UPS offers many unique solutions. For example, UPS My Choice, which was launched at this time last year, is unmatched in the industry. Almost 2 million households have signed up and are enjoying the benefits. Advantages like providing delivery alerts by e-mail or SMS the day before your package is delivered, eliminating those \"sorry we missed you\" notices left on your door or the ability to reschedule or reroute deliveries or one of the most popular features, authorizing UPS to deliver without a signature. So if you haven't signed up for UPS My Choice yet, I strongly encourage you to join the almost 2 million who have and enjoy an exceptional package delivery experience this holiday season courtesy of UPS.","Thanks, and now we'll be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question will come from the line of Mr. Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Wanted to ask you about the domestic side and a couple of things going on with mix. Can you give us a sense of how much B2C was up and how much B2B was down? And then also I guess in terms of that topic, how would you look at margins going forward if you continue to see that trend of B2C growth and slower, I guess -- or modestly declining B2B?","Kurt P. Kuehn","Tom, yes, B2C has continued to show slight declines. So we're -- it didn't get significantly worse from Q2 to Q3. But clearly, with some of the challenges in the industrial sector and some of those areas, we're just not seeing a lot of strength there. So B2C was absolutely the primary driver of the volume growth. And as we've said, this is one of the big market changes that we're adapting our business model to, so it -- the B2C is a little more challenging. But as you've seen, both the operational technology side and the consumer side, we're focusing enhancements to address that.","D. Scott Davis","And, Tom, our long-term targets on Domestic are 14% to 15% margins, 2014 to 2016. We're not backing off those margins as we move forward.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can you give the actual numbers of what B2B and B2C were, Kurt, or you don't care to be that specific?","Kurt P. Kuehn","B2C was upper single digits, and the B2B was slightly negative.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citi.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Maybe a question just on the International side. You mentioned the Asia outbound picking up a little bit. I just wanted to get a sense of whether that was specifically around product launches, maybe the sustainability of that, and how we should think about that relative to capacity. Do we get a sense that you kind of got to the right point of capacity relative to demand right now? And how do you think about the fourth quarter?","Kurt P. Kuehn","Right, yes. It certainly was great to see Asia get into positive numbers again, and I think it is a little bit of both of the issues that you mentioned. I'll let Dan Brutto talk about that a little bit.","Daniel J. Brutto","Sure. I guess what I would say as far as the network cutbacks, certainly, we've done that. But I would also say that we've also added in aircraft. We just added our fifth gateway in China. It started the middle of September at Hangzhou, primarily for the high-tech sector. And that kind of coincides with what's going on in China, this whole go-west strategy. So you've got a lot of manufacturers now in China that are moving off the east coast to the west. Last year, we opened up another gateway in Chengdu, essentially for the high tech. So we're moving our equipment where the customers are, and certainly, it was good to see, finally, a small uptick in Asia this quarter.","D. Scott Davis","We think that this slow global trade is cyclical and that it will come back. I think one of the things we talk a lot about is this fiscal cliff in the U.S., if we resolve that, get the U.S. economy consumer going again, that will help demand, I think, U.S. from Asia. So we see it coming back some next year.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter of Bank of America.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. Can you just talk a little bit, Kurt, maybe about what gives you that confidence in the fourth quarter? If I look at the target range, it seems like you're almost raising the fourth quarter by $0.05. Are you expecting a break after the elections? Do you already see that kicking in? And then just on the confidential letter, was there anything substantial in TNT or should that keep moving forward?","Kurt P. Kuehn","I think we're not expecting a significant rebound in the economy. So this outlook is for kind of steady-as-she-goes economic conditions. We've not seen a real change in momentum sequentially, month-to-month and going into October. We're looking for about 3% volume growth, in aggregate, for the fourth quarter, slightly less than the current momentum. But I think based just on the progress and the execution across all of the business units, we've adapted to the challenging conditions. Certainly, you've seen it with International, and Domestic continues to operate well and -- albeit in a changing environment. So we feel a little more confident, at least, with narrowing the range and clearly being able to deliver a decent fourth quarter.","D. Scott Davis","Ken, there are also several positives out there, I think, for the holiday season. Housing is starting to improve. We have lower fuel costs, low interest rates, stock market's been strong. That usually correlates to good consumer behavior. So that helps. Now there are negatives, and I don't want to be repetitive on the fiscal cliff, but sometime about end of November, after the election, fiscal cliff will be front and center, and that will cause some uncertainty. So there are some risks. On the question on TNT, the Statement of Objection is absolutely a normal step in a Phase II merger review. It is expected. It happens in almost all Phase II reviews. So it's -- and it doesn't obviously -- it's basically the EC laying out their position, but it does not prejudge the final outcome. We got a lot of work to do on it. We've been working very closely with the commission over the last several months. We'll continue with the open dialogue. We'll respond in the next couple of weeks. But the document is confidential, and we can't share the details of it at this point in time.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Nate Brochmann of William Blair & Company.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I wanted to talk a little bit -- obviously, you guys have been kind of doing this and showing great results on the margin side in terms of kind of \"adjusting the network\" to kind of compensate for the new shipping patterns. Could you talk a little bit more in detail of exactly what you're doing, and then longer term, in terms of the strategy to take advantage of that? And also, how with such a big network, how do you remain flexible? As obviously, we've seen that things change so quickly. How do you make sure that you're always in the right competitive position to take advantage of the changes?","Kurt P. Kuehn","Well, a lot of pieces to that, Nate. I guess, for starters, the big focus that we have with the changing mix of B2C is really the -- our -- enriching our technology, both for customers and operations, so that we can keep the margins. Myron, maybe you can talk at a high level on some of the things we've been doing.","Myron A. Gray","Yes, Kurt. We're in a constant transformation of our business model here in the U.S. to adapt to the changing mode of the market, particularly the B2C. Our use of operational technology has real-time optimization that we'll use moving forward. As you've seen in the past, we've talked specifically about telematics. But moving forward, we'll utilize new delivery route optimization that will give us real-time optimization of the routes that will allow us to reduce the miles driven and direct labor hours.","Kurt P. Kuehn","Yes. And I guess one other real component, if you talk to global network, is our fleet composition and our ability to -- we have a very harmonized young feet. So maybe, Dave Abney, you could talk a little bit about how the airlines' reacting to these trade flows.","David P. Abney","Yes, certainly can, Kurt. One thing I want to point out about the third quarter, block hours were down 5%. On an export volume, it increased 1%. And that is certainly due to leveraging Worldport to the strategic composition of our fleet, where we've continued to add 767s, bigger containers and our superior technology. In fact, if you go back 19 -- excuse me, 2008 through 2011, you see that we've actually increased our packages per block hour by 15%, and that just shows that we are leveraging this network. And when it comes to the International side, we have reduced our Asian network, cut it down 10% year-over-year. But as Dan said, as we do have trade lanes that demand it, we certainly will put up block hours as necessary.","D. Scott Davis","And I think, historically, we've always shown the ability to perform, I think, in good times and bad times better than most of the industry because we have such a flexible workforce, and we can flex it based on the volume on a daily basis.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Sterne Agee.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Normally, the old rule of thumb used to be that you could get a read on the economy based on what was happening in average weight per piece. Obviously, for reasons B2C, B2B, the lower weight per piece might not necessarily be as accurate an indicator as it used to be. But what's your take on that? And kind of if I look at your average weight per package, how do I segregate what's kind of a structural shift versus maybe cyclical weakness?","Kurt P. Kuehn","Yes. That's a great question, Jeff, and it's the stuff we've been looking at ourselves and trying to isolate. I think if you go back to the more traditional view of weight, which was kind of the indicator of how many widgets are in the box, you could see that packages would get lighter during lean times than heavier. There's a slight weight drop if you look kind of at same-store sales on the B2B for similar industries. So there are certainly -- things continue to get a little smaller, and the economy isn't robust. The vast majority of the weight declines, and we are continuing to see substantial ones, is really this B2B-to-B2C mix. Because we have all of that mixed in the same network, it does create some very big changes in average weight and also is the biggest single driver, by far, of the revenue per piece comps that can be challenging. So our trick is to continue to find creative ways to manage through that, and we're doing pretty well so far.","D. Scott Davis","And, Jeff, as -- for the last 20 years, the B2C has become sort of 1% more of the pie each year. In the last probably year, 1.5 years, that pace has picked up to maybe 2% a year more of the pie. So that evolution is speeding up as we speak.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I was wondering if you can just clarify something that's in the press release. You talked about International benefiting from improving sort of exports, I think, you said out of Asia, product launches, et cetera. But then supply chain got hurt by overcapacity in Asia. So I'm not sure why you would have differing trends in that regard, and maybe you could talk about what's happened so far in October then.","Kurt P. Kuehn","Yes, absolutely. And Dan Brutto, clearly, can fill you a little more on the product launches but also the balance of Forwarding and our International package business. So, Dan, why don't you take that on?","Daniel J. Brutto","Yes, sure. I guess what's happening now primarily in the airfreight market out of Asia is there's overcapacity in the market. Whenever there's overcapacity, even though our kilos are up, certainly, the rates are down, and that's pretty much consistent across the whole forwarding industry. On a positive side though, we did see an uptick in HACTL and PACTL in the month of September. Year-to-date, they're still both down on the export side, HACTL being much more down than PACTL, which is the Hong Kong index versus the Shanghai index. So certainly, we're seeing that. Why the small package? Small package is up because of use of our network and, certainly, some product launches that came out of Asia, as well as some easier comps last year in the third quarter.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Chris Ceraso of Credit Suisse.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Actually, I wanted to follow up on that subject as well. Is there market share gains that you can talk about in tech that maybe helped you disproportionate to your competitors, and then maybe if you can say that the strength that you saw in September has carried into October?","Kurt P. Kuehn","We're continuing to execute. Clearly, we have a very long history of continued share gains in the international sector. The product launches in September, clearly, was a boost that made September the better growth month. So we're not trying to overplay this. Plus, we've seen sometimes there's a broader ecosystem around product launches. We're peripheral suppliers in some of that launch. So we like to think we're gaining share. Clearly, the profitability was great this quarter. But it's too soon to say that either we or the industry is out of the woods as far as long-term Asia exports.","D. Scott Davis","Yes. I think we said all year, we expect the third quarter to have easier comps and start seeing better comparisons, and you saw that. So there's really no surprise. I would not say that global exports out of Asia are growing at a fast pace. We have ways to go there.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So, Kurt, with $9 billion in cash on the balance sheet right now, that's obviously well in excess of the TNT acquisition price. Can we assume that that's going to be 100% cash, or will you actually be levering up a little bit to close that deal?","Kurt P. Kuehn","Well, no. We'll be -- we did do the debt issuance a few weeks ago, and we were just thrilled to see the demand for that. As I said, it was more than 7x oversubscribed. That $1.75 billion really was an early draw to replace debt that comes due in early January. So basically, a couple of billion of that cash and marketable securities is just a pre-funding for that debt. So you take that out, and we're in pretty good shape. We'll use a little commercial paper, as we said. We have some commercial paper outstanding, but we want to be in good position to address the cash needs to close that. So our intentions remain the same as we've said before, that we don't anticipate a need to do any long-term issuance to fund the TNT acquisition.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So the $5 billion in cash number, is that still a good number to think about, or do you think it'll be a little higher than that?","Kurt P. Kuehn","That's still a good number.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Art Hatfield of Raymond James.","Arthur W. Hatfield - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just real quick follow-up on your comments on Europe. You talked about in the press release that while Europe has slowed, your small package growth remains positive. Can you -- and you've talked in the past about how the market is shifting towards small package. Can you talk about that and where you see yourself from the competitive environment, and if any of that positive growth is market share gains within Europe?","Kurt P. Kuehn","Well, clearly, we're long-term observers of Europe and have operated there for a long time, facilitating the transporter movements. I'll let Dan talk a little about the competitive environment there.","Daniel J. Brutto","Yes. I would say that Europe is a very competitive environment. We're slightly up, which is good, but just slightly above positive on the exports for Europe. And certainly, we've reported negative on the domestics, primarily negative on the domestic from the southern periphery countries that are going through austerity programs right now, that they're going through difficulties. So I would say the European market, we're very bullish on Europe, although it is a very competitive marketplace.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Peter Nesvold of Jefferies & Company.","H. Peter Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I want to ask a question on the Deferred yields in the Domestic side of the business. So they started to step down in fourth quarter of last year, presumably on Amazon Prime. That starts to anniversary in now. So I'm curious, optically, should we expect Deferred to continue to be down, the yield on that business continue to be down year-over-year? And if I can add a compound to that question, when you think about the increasing mix towards B2C, lower weights, lower lane density, how do you add this business on without it being dilutive to overall corporate average returns for the business?","Kurt P. Kuehn","Yes, I'll talk about the returns issue and then maybe Alan can talk about the market trends and the customer mix change. Clearly, we spend a lot of time focusing on adjusting our domestic network, as Myron talked about, to extract and maintain, by far, the industry's highest returns on capital and, by far, the highest aggregate margins. This growth in lightweight Deferred packages, whether they're B2C, residential or the premium residential packages, does create some different operational challenges, but the returns on capital are very high. They tend not to consume as much in the way of assets. And with our increased focus on the productivity of the last mile that we've been doing, clearly, we're continuing to generate good returns. As far as the yields and the changing mix, we've talked about that a little bit, but Alan can give a little more color to it.","Alan Gershenhorn","I guess, first, I wouldn't characterize the lightweight product as any specific customer. We have a broad base of customers that are using the lightweight SurePost product. But it is a relatively new product, and we are going to be lapping some very significant growth in that product. So I think that you should see some yields firm up into 2013 in that regard. And by the way, on the previous question on the -- on weight in general, I think one of the things we've been able to accomplish with the SurePost product is we're now capturing the disproportionate share of that market. That wasn't necessarily a market that we played in even with our Ground residential, and now we're able to go after lightweight, less time-sensitive economic type of products in the marketplace that we weren't necessarily competitive for in the past.","D. Scott Davis","And, Peter, we are, as Kurt said, focused on return on invested capital. Our long-term targets have minimum of 25% ROIC 2014 and on. That's based on this mix of products. So we're focused on return on invested capital. We'll keep great ROICs going despite the mix we're looking at here.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Ed Wolfe of Wolfe Trahan.","Edward M. Wolfe - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Can you comment a little bit -- I mean, this was the first quarter where Domestic packages operating income was down for 10 quarters or so, and yet the volume's been so strong. Can you talk a little bit about how much of this has to do with mix with the B2C growing faster and how much of this has to do with maybe trying to take a little more volume and give up a little bit pricing? And then what impact you saw, if any, on fuel? It's hard to tell the expense is down year-over-year, but obviously, so is the fuel surcharge.","Kurt P. Kuehn","Yes. Sure, Ed. Let me -- I'll be glad to unfold that for you a little bit. The 2 most notable issues that were headwinds in the third quarter, and frankly, we guided at least some of those last quarter, the first was the fuel surcharge lag, which I think we did estimate was about $60 million. In addition, there was a one less good working day this quarter, which, as a ballpark, we usually say that's about $50 million, plus or minus, per working day. So if you factor those 2 in, we did also say in Q2, we had a $60 million tailwind for fuel. So if you average out those 2 quarters, you can actually see the business trends remain fairly stable, and we would have shown solid increases in profits. So we feel that things are working pretty well. We knew third quarter was going to be a challenge. That's part of why we had to talk a little more about that last quarter. The mix -- changing mix is a challenge that we're continuing to work through, but we feel pretty good so far. So in general, we think the business is steady in the U.S. The operational enhancements are helping to offset the challenges that we're facing with the lighter weight packages, and we expect that to continue.","D. Scott Davis","Ed, we expect to see, obviously, Domestic operating profit improvement in the fourth quarter at a margin of 15% or over. So we feel like we're moving in the right direction there.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just on the U.S. Domestic small package side. I guess from what I've heard, at least it sounded like the workaround on some of the large customer impact sounds more operational in terms of how you guys are thinking about this and taking costs out of the network to try to offset some of that negative mix impact. But I mean, when you think about that business, how actively are you pushing back or managing volumes with those customers to make sure that, that mix is appropriate? Or does it really just take a reinvigoration, to your point, Scott, with fiscal cliff worries and all of that on the small- to medium-sized customers to start coming back and adding growth to that mix in order to see a more, I guess, healthy yield profile coming out of that business?","Kurt P. Kuehn","I think no. The -- clearly, we've talked a lot about the cost and the technology enhancements, but equally important is the revenue management and extracting the value from all of these new capabilities. So, Alan, maybe you can talk a little bit about how we're enhancing on the revenue side.","Alan Gershenhorn","Yes. So it's certainly noteworthy that on year-on-year basis, that the product and the customer mix continues to negatively impact the yields. And again, I think a lot of those base rate improvements are being masked by the continued growth in lightweight products. But clearly, the portfolio we have out there, whether it's for B2B customers or B2C customers, allows them to certainly optimize their transportation and pick the service that they need at the -- provide the service they need at a cost point they're looking for. The other thing I would just add is that the core pricing certainly remains firm, around 2.5% base price increase, a little bit stronger on the Air side.","D. Scott Davis","Justin, to your point on small-, medium-sized enterprises is a focal point for UPS. I know Myron and Alan's teams are looking for different ways to go to that market, I think. They have not been spending. They have not been stocking inventory. They have not been hiring because of all the certainly out there, and they will get it going once the government makes some decisions. But we are bringing a lot more solutions to this group. I think solutions originally were focused to the larger companies, larger businesses. Now we're bringing those solutions to the small- and medium-sized companies, which will help us grow the middle market going forward.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Kevin Sterling of BB&T Capital Markets.","Kevin W. Sterling - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Kurt, I want to let you know that my wife is taking your advice and is indulging in some online holiday shopping these days.","Kurt P. Kuehn","That's great. Just got to make sure she signs up for My Choice, Kevin.","Kevin W. Sterling - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Yes. Kind of talking about this question of shifting International patterns. Have you kind of seen any major shifts in International shipping patterns, say, from the Air to the Ocean or is it mainly to Deferred products?","Kurt P. Kuehn","Certainly, we've seen shifts geographically quite a bit with some of the intercontinental moves slowing, which we've talked about for a couple of quarters. I'll let Dan maybe add a little color on what we're seeing in our Forwarding unit and express.","Daniel J. Brutto","Yes. I wouldn't say -- the answer to that, I've seen -- we've seen some nontraditional Ocean customers. And what I mean is some airfreight and some express taking, at least, a look at sending some of their lower-margin products via Ocean. And we've made it easy for those customers, certainly, with our broad portfolio and also with our preferred less-than-container-load Ocean product that lets the customer, either from the high tech or the medical field, at least test out Ocean in a way that is quick and certainly allows them to move along this product portfolio on an efficient manner, but nothing to a major extent yet in the marketplace.","D. Scott Davis","Yes. Back to geography that Kurt talked about, clearly, the European demand is down. That's impacting the Asia exports and U.S. exports pretty dramatically as we move forward. So hopefully, we can get some European imports going again in the future.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","You highlighted that you've already opened discussions with the Teamsters here. So can you just talk about some of the objectives that you're looking to accomplish with this new contract round, especially in the face of the shifting mix domestically to more B2C traffic, more of the lightweight, lower-yielding packages?","D. Scott Davis","I will let Dave Abney talk about that. He probably won't be able to tell you an awful lot because we're keeping the negotiations at the table.","David P. Abney","All right. Yes, the negotiations did start in September, and we do believe that the early start is good for the employees, customers and the shareholders. In the past 2 negotiations, we have been able to reach early conclusions. We've got a positive relationship with the Teamsters. We both recognize that UPS success translates into jobs. Many of the issues that come up have been discussed over the last couple of years through the competition committee. As far as the particular issues, we just believe negotiations are best left at the bargaining table, so we won't reveal that today. But we're satisfied with the pace of discussions.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Helane Becker of Dahlman Rose.","Helane R. Becker - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but just one point of clarification. Did you say how many people you would need to hire for the peak shipping season or -- and how that compares to prior years?","Kurt P. Kuehn","No. We'll be releasing more details about the peak season and the holidays in a couple of weeks or so. As Alan said, we do expect over 0.5 billion packages between Thanksgiving and Christmas. So we'll be very busy, and there'll be plenty of temporary hires that start with the company, like myself, during the holidays. But we'll give you more details in a couple of weeks.","D. Scott Davis","Will you be driving during the holidays?","Kurt P. Kuehn","If I need to.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of David Campbell of Thompson, Davis.","David P. Campbell - Thompson, Davis & Company","I'm just a little surprised that you're relatively optimistic about the fourth quarter Forwarding unit, given the fact that you're a little unsure about September's volume growth continuing in the Asia Pacific region. What changed from -- what changes from the third quarter to the fourth quarter that allows you to be optimistic that earnings will be up in that division year-to-year?","Kurt P. Kuehn","David, that's good question. I wouldn't interpret our guidance to be optimism, specifically around the International Forwarding. More important than that segment, as far as contributing to profit improvements, is our UPS Freight and our Distribution business. So no, we expect Forwarding to have another challenging quarter. Clearly, the buy rates are low but the revenues are also being pushed down quite a bit. So it's more an expression of optimism of the continued momentum in our Freight and in our Distribution business, which is benefiting from the healthcare growth.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Ben Hartford of Baird.","Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Dan, I guess to that point, can you talk a little bit about gross profit per unit, both on the Air Freight side and on the Ocean Freight side, here in the third quarter relative to the second quarter and then maybe what the expectations are as we go into the fourth, and then wrapping again -- discussing the competitiveness of the Forwarding environment in the light of available capacity but continued weakness in volumes?","Kurt P. Kuehn","Yes. We did see some margin compression quarter-over-quarter. Clearly, we didn't quite hit the overall segment margin that we'd hope. We hoped to get to 9% this quarter and ended up coming in still at a healthy 8.3%, and the biggest driver of that was the margins on the Forwarding. We don't disclose the exact margins of our Ocean and Air Forwarding. Clearly, the Ocean has been actually doing a little better than the Air Forwarding since that's an industry-wide trend. And as Dan mentioned, with our less-than-container-load in expedited Ocean, we're finding what we think is a profitable niche. So we think the quarter -- fourth quarter will again be a challenging one for the -- for all of the forwarders, frankly.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of John Barnes of RBC Capital Markets.","John L. Barnes - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Quick question on the subject of B2B and B2C and that ratio. Is there any seasonality in the fluctuation in those ratios of traffic, or are you starting to see B2B -- or B2C, I'm sorry, being more consistent level of your business? I know, Scott, you said it was growing at 2% of the pie or whatever. But is that, quarter-to-quarter, very consistent, or are you seeing some seasonality in it?","D. Scott Davis","I think as far as the evolution, B2B to B2C, it's pretty steady. But clearly, the fourth quarter holiday season, B2C has a bigger piece of the mix, as it always is during Christmas season.","John L. Barnes - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes. But the -- yes, I'm sorry. I -- But the other 3 quarters, 1Q through 3Q, is it still very consistent among those 3 quarters, taking out 4Q?","D. Scott Davis","Yes, it's pretty consistent.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of David Ross of Stifel, Nicolaus.","David G. Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","There's the article that came out highlighting Walmart's experimentation with same-day delivery a couple of weeks ago and that they're using UPS to deliver to their customers' homes. Could you comment a little bit on that project and whether or not you're doing same-day delivery with others, and whether you think same-day delivery is actually a viable method that people are going to be using and if you're going to be able to charge enough to account for the delivery density problems with same-day delivery?","Kurt P. Kuehn","Great, good question. I'll let Alan talk about some of those areas of innovation.","Alan Gershenhorn","Clearly, there's a heck of a lot going on in the B2C market. Certainly, SurePost postal injection is one of those areas what UPS is doing, with UPS My Choice is another, and certainly, a lot of noise out there with same-day type delivery options. I think it's really still too early to tell precisely how that's going to shape up, but that's really an incubating part of the market at this time. I think more importantly is what the retailers are looking at out there and what UPS is helping them do in terms of what is being called like omni-channel out there. So we're out there helping both e-tailers and e-tailers with brick-and-mortar leverage all the assets they have. And what you're seeing now is retailers that want to fulfill directly from their store to consumer or fulfill from their dot.coms directly to their stores and create an ecosystem out there, where customers have the maximum access and the maximum number of options out there. And I think another area is if you can fulfill from a store and provide customer a late pickup, then you can get next-day delivery or near same-day delivery with the late pickup.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I noticed you opened a few more healthcare distribution facilities and wondering if you can give some color on what portion of Forwarding and Logistics is in the healthcare distribution area. And also, sort of in the current laboratory of economic uncertainty, what sort of performance you're seeing from your healthcare logistics relative to the cyclicality and uncertainty of sort of the broader market?","Kurt P. Kuehn","Well, we did see healthcare grow approximately 20% from a revenue perspective, especially in those locations where we do a part of the distribution also. We don't share exact numbers, but I think the great thing about healthcare is that it's an industry that really makes full utilization of the integrated network and the broad portfolio of UPS. So Dan even mentioned, in some cases, healthcare customers are using Ocean. Clearly, our Air Freight Forwarding and temperature control configuration and our express services all come together. So it is an industry where we can really stretch our wings and take advantage of the entire portfolio.","D. Scott Davis","And the revenue shows up in Domestic package, International package, obviously Freight, Forwarding, Distribution, so across-the-board.","Daniel J. Brutto","And we have now 5 million square feet of healthcare facilities around the world and 36 facilities. And just these last few months, we've opened 3 in Asia for around 400,000 square feet. So it's a growing part of our business.","Operator","Our next question will be a follow-up from the line of Mr. Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes. Scott, I figured you might be disappointed if you didn't get at least a second question on TNT. So I'll try to give you one more on that. I think there have been -- there's been a lot of noise about what the EC is going to do and the idea that they are being really granular in how they're defining markets, that, that might be a challenge. Is there any kind of a high-level comments you can give us in terms of the SO? Did this end up being a bit more challenging, more stringent than you would've expected? Would you say, at the end of the day, it's pretty reasonable what you have in there? Can you kind of shade it in terms of being a little better or a little worse than you would've expected on the SO?","D. Scott Davis","I think that it's a complex transaction. And whenever you get into Phase II, you spent a lot of time with the Commission, and our team has spent a lot of time with Commission. I think it's been good, open dialogue. I think we're exchanging information. We got a ways to go. And certainly, we just got the SO Friday night. So we're obviously going through that right now. Over next couple of weeks, we'll spend a lot of time responding to that. I know Dan Brutto has spent a lot of the last couple of months in Europe on this project. Any comments, Dan?","Daniel J. Brutto","Yes, sure. I think what I could say is we both have -- they have a case team. We have a team that's working constructively. As Scott said, it's very complex. It's all the 27 member states of the EU that they're tasked with taking a hard look at, and it's just part of the process. The SO is part of the process. We'll go through that. We'll have our response back. But the good news is the team have -- the teams have open dialogue, and certainly, we're going to turn in the documents that is required by the Commission within the timeframe.","D. Scott Davis","And we're confident we'll get clearance and we'll get it early in 2013, and we're committed to the transaction.","Operator","Due to time constraints, our last question will be a follow-up from the line of Mr. Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes. I just wanted to ask, we used to talk about B2C being around 1\/3 of the business. I'm curious where it is. You just mentioned it sort of accelerated as a percent of the pie. Where does it ultimately top out at? Because I would sort of think at some point, you'd rather say like, \"Look, let's just start raising prices on this stuff more aggressively because we don't want too much of it given the mix affect.\"","Kurt P. Kuehn","Yes. Certainly, it's our goal to optimize the value, create the premium services, either by speed or by My Choice and, at same time, for those lightweight, low-value products to keep prices down. Right now, B2B is -- or B2C is running about 40%. And clearly, given the holidays, it'll be significantly over 50%. But we hope that the core B2B economy also picks up and so the balance remains healthy, although we'll take whatever the market gives us and find a way to be profitable and generate good returns for it.","D. Scott Davis","And, Bill, we adjust. 80 to 90 years ago, B2C was 100% of our business. So we will adjust based on how the market changes.","Operator","I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Andy Dolny.","Andy Dolny","Yes, I'm going to turn it to Scott for some closing comments.","D. Scott Davis","Thanks, Andy. Unfortunately, global trade continues to be slower than any of us would like at this point in time. But I think UPS has made the necessary adjustments. You started to see it in the third quarter results. I think we did a nice turnaround in International. We're going in the right direction. But in the fourth quarter, we actually expect to hit on all cylinders. Each segment anticipates operating profit improvement with margin equal to or better than last year. This is not only a testament of UPS business model, but also the capabilities and dedication of the UPS team.","Thanks so much for joining us today, and we'll see you next quarter."],"21206":["United Parcel Service, Inc.

At this time, I would like to welcome, everyone, to the UPS Investor Relations Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise.","And after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Scott Childress, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Good morning, and welcome to the UPS Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. Joining me today are David Abney, our CEO; Richard Peretz, our CFO; along with International President, Jim Barber; President of U.S. Operations, Myron Gray; and Chief Commercial Officer, Alan Gershenhorn. Also joining us today is Kate Gutmann, our Chief Sales and Solutions Officer.","Before we begin, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements and address our expectation for the future performance or results of operations of our company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty, which are described in detail in our 2016 Form 10-K and 2017 10-Qs. These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the Securities and Exchange Commission.","The webcast of today's call, along with the reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website. Webcast users can submit live questions during today's call. We will focus on answering questions of a long-term and strategic nature. Callers are asked to submit only one question, so that we may allow as many as possible to participate.","Now, I will turn the call over to David.","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Thanks, Scott; and good morning, everyone. Again this quarter, we are reporting solid UPS results with revenue gains and good execution in our segments. Our performance is driven by UPS's high-value solutions, broad portfolio of services, efficient global network, and strategic investments.","Let me first take a moment to recognize the difficult conditions created by several recent natural disasters and the incredible way our team responded to these challenges. Some of the communities we serve have been severely impacted and we've been focused on restoring service to those areas. I want to express my personal appreciation to thousands of UPSers around the world for their dedication, working side-by-side in their communities and on their routes delivering life-sustaining supplies.","In addition, the UPS Foundation committed more than $3 million to support the relief efforts throughout the U.S., Caribbean and Mexico. I can't emphasize enough how proud we are of the UPS team and their great work. It's this kind of teamwork that gives me confidence that we're well prepared to carry momentum forward to deliver a successful peak season.","Kate Gutmann will provide details on peak at the conclusion of my comments.","Now, let's take a look at the company's performance. During the quarter our focused execution, combined with our ability to capitalize on market opportunities, enabled UPS to meet our financial expectations. Our e-commerce and cross-border solutions help UPS deliver strong revenue growth of 7% on a 4.6% increase in daily shipments. In the U.S. increasing demand for UPS Next Day Air and Ground products drove revenue growth. Focus on fundamentals, combined with the benefits of recent investments, produce good results, especially when you consider the unexpected headwinds we faced.","The International segment continues to serve as a growth engine for the business; producing record third quarter operating profits. Several actions taken this quarter were designed to accelerate that growth in the future. In Europe, UPS's enhanced network capabilities enabled market share gains, clearly about 20% growth in intra-Europe exports shipments is evidence of that success.","In Asia, our joint venture with SF Express was approved. We're moving forward with plans to develop a cobranded, highly-competitive export product for Chinese businesses shipping to the U.S., positioning us for more growth in the small and medium-size customer base. We will expand this offering to other markets in the future to ensure UPS has enough international air capacity to meet growing needs, we took delivery this month of two 747-8 aircraft with another on the way this year. We're quickly putting them into high-demand transpacific routes in time for peak season.","Another encouraging development this quarter was the early initiation of contract talks. We've worked with the Teamsters for more than 80 years with the objective of providing industry-leading service to our customers, so we can create new jobs and reward employees for contributing to the company's success. We expect the negotiations to move forward in a constructive manner and we know that when employees are engaged, connected and committed to the company's priorities, UPS customers, share owners and employees all will benefit.","As we move into the fourth quarter, the macroeconomic environment looks solid. In the U.S. in the third quarter, we saw a slight reduction in economic growth forecast. As a result, industrial production slowed in the third quarter, but forecast for the coming months have a more optimistic outlook that should bode well for B2B demand. We also remain confident about the holiday season, as consumer sentiment remains elevated, although there is some inflationary pressure on wages due to high employment levels.","Looking outside the U.S., global growth projections have moved higher as performance in Europe and China continues to exceed expectations. While the economic outlook remains fairly promising, we see further upside potential from U.S. tax reform, which we strongly support. The current proposal will provide great incentives for companies to both reinvest and create jobs at home.","Against this backdrop, we are well prepared to capitalize on growth opportunities and serve UPS customers' needs as we head into our peak season.","And to give you an update on the preparations, planning and expectations for peak, I'll turn things over to Kate. Kate?","Kathleen M. Gutmann - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. It's great to be here to review our strategies for the 2017 peak season. Our peak strategies are designed to efficiently and reliably serve all UPS customers, whether those who experienced the highest seasonal spikes in demand, to small and medium-size customers, as well as our B2B customers like those in healthcare. The UPS team has worked throughout the year to prepare for the e-commerce growth we anticipate this year. In fact, between Thanksgiving and New Year's Eve, we expect to complete a record 750 million deliveries worldwide, about 40 million more than last year.","In the U.S., the National Retail Federation expects total holiday retail sales to increase between 3.6% and 4%. They also expect non-store retail, or online sales, to be higher this year, up between 11% and 15%.","At UPS, we're focused on delivering a successful peak season for customers and investors through more collaboration, more capacity, better control, and a strong commitment to service. First, we're focused on improved collaboration with customers for better forecasts, so we can collectively smooth work across the network. We are helping customers optimize the experience they provide their customers, from the first click to the final delivery. More extensive collaboration this year will better align UPS solutions and capacity with seasonal promotions and fulfillment strategies. We work closely to obtain daily shipping estimates by location and even by product. We've built operating and communication plans that allow us to respond to changes quickly.","A second area of focus this year is expanding capacity. UPS customers will benefit from several facility expansions and the technology investments that we've made throughout the year. We've increased UPS delivery capacity through a combination of permanent and temporary facility expansion.","Across the U.S. network, we've increased both package delivery and sorting capacity by about 6% over the past year. This represents the addition of more than 1 million square feet of added permanent and automated capacity available for peak. The permanent facilities are located across the country in key locations like Los Angeles, Chicago, and Kansas City. The deployment of Saturday operations with both pickup and delivery provides us with new and more efficient capabilities to serve customer growth. We will also take advantage of the flexible solutions from our partners at Coyote Logistics again this year.","The third focus area is control, both control of deliveries for UPS customers and control of the UPS network. UPS My Choice will provide greater control to more than 40 million global members, an increase of 10 million from last year. Through My Choice, more than one in four U.S. households communicate directly with UPS to enhance their delivery experience. The combination of My Choice and UPS Access Point creates a highly-efficient solution that provides customers with the assurance of on-time delivery and higher first-attempt delivery completion.","To enhance customer support and our network decision-making, we will again operate control towers in the U.S., Canada, and Europe, and this year we've added this process in Asia as well. As unplanned customers' needs arise, the control towers will make a timely assessment of available network capacity and ensure we are properly compensated. Revenue management is an ongoing exercise at UPS as demonstrated by our 2018 general rate increase of approximately 4.9%, which was announced yesterday.","In addition, we've introduced our first peak-season surcharge and customer acceptance is progressing as planned. These surcharges target specific residential, heavy volume periods and large items that require special handling. This strategy is designed to encourage smoothing of volume across the period between Thanksgiving and Christmas, and ensures we are appropriately compensated for the value provided to customers.","The final area of focus for UPS is commitment. The entire UPS team will work diligently to provide world-class value and service during this upcoming holiday season. Global markets are evolving and customer demands are ever-increasing, so developing optimal, peak-season plans is a dynamic process each year. We take future expectations and learnings from previous peak seasons and apply them to continually improve the company's service levels and financial results during this critical time of year.","Our plans are comprehensive, our networks and employees are prepared, and we are ready to deliver.","Thank you for your time today. Now, I'll turn it over to Richard.","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Thanks, Kate. UPS had another successful quarter. Our results highlight the flexibility of the global UPS business model and the power of our investments. We've managed through headwinds in the U.S., delivered broad-based strong growth in the International business, and continued generating excellent results in the Supply Chain and Freight group. The UPS team's execution this quarter generated earnings of $1.45 per share, driven by sustained revenue expansion in all segments.","Looking closer at the business segment, in the U.S., revenue and costs were negatively impacted by natural disasters in Texas, Florida, and California, creating a drag of about $50 million of operating profit. However, growth in package volume was positive, up 3.4%, with revenue up nearly 4%. We've had strong growth in our business going back to mid-2016. Higher growth in both Next Day Air and Ground products was driven by e-commerce demand as average daily shipments increased 8% for Next Day Air, while Ground was up 3.4%. Package yields improved 2% year-over-year, and base rates came in at the higher end of our 2%-to-3% range.","Fuel surcharges added to the yields by approximately 40 basis points. Fuel and base rate improvements completely offset a drag from customer and product mix this quarter. The U.S. operating profit came in at $1.2 billion. After adjusting for the unplanned events, our profits were in line with our expectations.","Results this quarter include one-less operating day, about $40 million of costs from our previously-discussed ongoing investments in new buildings, and the deployment of Saturday operations.","Now, let's turn to the International segment. It was another great quarter. The third quarter reported profits were up almost 9%. And on a currency-neutral basis, operating profit was up 20%, making this the 11th straight quarter of double-digit growth.","The largest operating profit gains were in Asia and Europe. Revenue increased more than 11% in the third quarter. Growth was evenly balanced across the world between premium and deferred products, both increasing at double-digit pace.","Export shipments jumped nearly 20%, led by robust cross-border shipping. Growth was higher in all regions on all major products, driven by expanded portfolio of services and market-focused strategies. The story was similar for the domestic shipments in International; growth was broad, up about 6% with year-over-year gains in all key countries we serve.","Currency-neutral international package yields were up 2.3% as base rate improvements and fuel offset trade lane and product mix. Our global investments are allowing us to grow faster than the market by expanding capabilities across the regions. We are adding aircraft to support our export products, and we're about halfway through the five-year, $2-billion investment in the European network. Our international strategies produced another successful quarter driven by strong volume growth and expanding yields, moving on our optimized integrated network.","Now, turning to the Supply Chain and Freight group, which produced another great quarter of growth in revenue and operating profit. Revenue increased 13% with gains in all the major business units. Forwarding, Coyote, and UPS Freight had the highest growth in the quarter, and they were assisted by the concentration of our middle-market customer wins.","In the Forwarding group, revenue growth in the International and North American Air Freight markets were elevated by high-single-digit tonnage gains. UPS Freight increased revenue 11% on LTL tonnage growth of nearly 6%, combined with a 3.6% improvement in LTL per hundredweight pricing.","In the Distribution unit, revenue management and efficiency fueled double-digit operating profit expansion, driven by the aerospace and retail sectors. Operating profit in this segment increased $20 million, or 10% over last year, making this the best third quarter ever and one of the most profitable quarters in our history.","Now, looking at the balance sheet; through the first nine months of 2017, UPS generated $4.4 billion in cash from operations, paid $2.1 billion in dividends, and repurchased more than 12 million shares for about $1.4 billion.","On a year-to-date basis, the company has made capital expenses of $3.7 billion as we transform our network for tremendous growth opportunity, more efficiency, and long-term value. Our investment strategies will help ensure we achieve the $800 million to $1 billion in cost savings and avoidance that we have laid out earlier this year.","Now, I'll turn to guidance; let me start by level-setting; the year-over-year comparisons in the fourth quarter. First, we received about $40 million of benefits from discrete tax events in the fourth quarter of 2016, benefiting last year's adjusted earnings per share of $1.63 by about $0.05.","Next, we have a potential currency drag in the fourth quarter of 2017 of around $100 million, or about $0.07 adjusted earnings per share. The final currency affect will depend on what the rates do in the coming months.","Turning to the business, we have performed well through September as global e-commerce strategies are evolving with increased seasonality. We expect this to continue moving forward.","In the U.S. segment, recent economic news is encouraging. Consumer, retail, and business conditions hold promise, but we also see some caution as the effects from the natural disasters linger into the fourth quarter. Additionally, we are seeing some cost pressures on temporary peak hiring and purchase transportation in specific markets and locations in the U.S. And lastly, we predict continued strong volume and revenue growth for the remainder of the year.","Turning to the International segment; we expect positive momentum as we move forward, allowing market share gains to continue, yet at the same time currency will remain a headwind. And in the Supply Chain and Freight segment, we're well-positioned to take advantage of firming rate conditions and support peak season small package strategies. We anticipate this segments growth trends will continue.","At the total company level, revenue growth is expected to be at the high end of our full year guidance of 5% to 7%. We now anticipate fourth quarter taxes should remain around 35%.","Considering our current momentum and reviewing all the economic data and our internal initiatives, we are confident that we're moving higher in our full-year guidance range. We now anticipate 2017 adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.85 to $6.10, which includes currency transition of approximately $0.30 per share, or $400 million.","Before I open the line, let me summarize. UPS is focused on making the necessary adjustments to adapt to current conditions as we implement our long-term strategies. As Kate mentioned, UPS is bringing new capabilities into this year's peak season. Saturday operations, new surcharges, and more efficient capacity. These initiatives position us for success.","As we look ahead, these investments we are making today will serve as a springboard to deliver new solutions and long-term value for years to come.","Before I turn it over to the operator, I want to remind you that the webcast users can submit live questions during today's call.","Thank you for taking the time this morning, and now I'll ask the operator to open the line. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","I will now turn the program back over to our Investor Relations Officer, Mr. Scott Childress, please go ahead.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Thank you very much. Our first question, we're going to take an online question from Dave Ross of Stifel Nicolaus. David's question is, now that the SF Express joint venture has received regulatory approval, what are the next steps? What is the expected impact, if any, on the business from the JV in 2018?","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Okay. This is David and I'll take the first part of that question then I'll pass it over to Jim. We were excited that we did get approval and approval on a timely basis. The reason that's so important to us is there's just so many opportunities between China and the U.S.","And this joint venture just combines SF Express' deep China presents with our UPS integrated global networks that we just see as a very good combination. That being said, Jim, why don't you give a little more detail?","James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Sure. I'd be glad to. So David, I think on the back of David's comments, we've been working on this for well over a year by the way. I would tell you, it's very significant in our mind as a big step for us inside and crossing borders in and out of China. Really what it does for us is it gets us and gives us the ability to go to new places, to reach new customer segments with new products that we haven't had in this market, obviously, for 110 years at UPS. It's going to synergize with our Forwarding business, and it's going to really continue to let us grow in cross-border trade.","Just a data point for you that I get very excited with is in the network that SF and their team has, are 173,000 touch-points in China that are made up of couriers and service centers in retail stores that will be able to actually participate very differently going forward than we have in the past. And I think the other thing lastly, because, obviously, the specifics of what's going to happen in 2018 and beyond will become more apparent as we move. I would say that we planned them to be material, obviously. But the team at SF, as well, I think partners very nicely with our team in Asia, and I think we can't undersell that partnership concept as well. So appreciate the question.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","We're going to take another online question. This question is coming from Brandon Oglenski from Barclay Capital (sic) [Barclays Capital. Fourth quarter results have been volatile in the past year, with both service and cost challenges impacting profitability for UPS. With another strong peak season expected, can management discuss how the additional resources and costs added this quarter can be better scaled to actual volume demands, while still meeting service commitments?","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Okay. Brandon, thank you for that question. And we're going to spend a little time on that because it's got just a few different angles. So I'll say a few words and then going to hear from Myron and Jim from their business units, and then Kate from a customer and revenue perspective. But I believe we're well-positioned to have a successful peak season, both from a customer standpoint and an investor standpoint. And it's coming quickly. We've been working a long time on this, and I think there's a lot of confidence throughout the group.","So that being said, why don't go ahead with you, Myron.","Myron A. Gray - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Good morning. There are several factors that give us confidence in our ability to perform this peak season. Considering the tremendous amount of time that's been spent with our customers to develop accurate forecasts, preparing to hire and train seasonal staff, as well as expanding our permanent and seasonal capacity, we believe that Saturday deployments of our operations will have a tremendous impact on this peak. It'll give us five additional delivery days. We're planning to process 40% more volume on Saturdays, and 80% of the volume we plan to deliver over the weekends will be through the facilities where we've already established Saturday operations.","Once again, we plan to hire 95,000 seasonal helpers, in which 35% over the last three years have later been hired into permanent jobs with UPS. The onboarding process will be significantly improved through new technology advancements. It will also help increase productivity through our mobile delivery apps, as well as our abilities to give dynamic sort instructions through Wi-Fi capabilities. We have also added an additional 1 million square feet under roof that will allow us to have additional sort capacities, and we've implemented 10 additional peak hubs, so we feel like we are positioned for success.","James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.","This is Jim. I'm going to add a couple of points that I think are material in nature outside the U.S. I'll start in Europe and then I'll go quickly to Asia. Europe, quite frankly, has been one of those years that we've had kind of peak volumes all year long, which is one of the advantages to going into this peak season. Our growth in Europe all year long has approached double digits every quarter, so we've had to add, obviously, both human and capital investment to support that. We've opened three new hubs this year, 170,000 pieces an hour in Europe.","Obviously, we've had the unfortunate situation of the cyber-attack in the middle of the year that pushed volume into our network that we needed to respond to. We've added Lyft in Cologne, so the Europe infrastructure as we move into this fourth quarter, I feel like is in a very unique and positive position.","And then we go out to Asia. Obviously, we've talked about the arrival of the 747-8s. The first one we took on the ground in Hong Kong on October 18. The next one is October 28. We get another one on November 24th, and then we move into next year. So they also have had a year of very high demand out of Asia that we've had to scale the network. And so in both cases, as a kind of front end of the engine, I think we're in great shape honestly for a great peak season to connect back, obviously, with Myron's network as well in the U.S.","Kathleen M. Gutmann - United Parcel Service, Inc.","From a customer perspective, I would add that as I mentioned in the opening, collaboration is critical, deep and broad, and the UPS team is now considered trusted advisors to our customers. We've gone through an extensive forecasting process. And also enhanced by some of the learnings from last year, we do this now by location, by product, and we've gone further within our customers' organizations, so that we encompass merchandising, marketing, fulfillment, as well as transportation. All of that leads to mutual success.","We've jointly agreed upon special operating plans to help smooth out some of the peak periods, such as the Monday spikes that would be leveled off by operations opening on Cyber Weekend, as well as Super Weekend, and the customers are absolutely participating in that. Better utilizing for the first time Saturday delivery and Saturday pickup, which is market-leading and has been embraced by our customers.","And then, of course, the control tower, which we continue to enhance over the years, finding ways to say, yes, more often to un-forecasted needs, and aligning it with the availability in our network.","And along those lines, we've continued to reinforce that it's important to align the price with cost of delivering this value and customers are working to ship volume in two weeks to minimize the impact of the surcharge. But if needed in those weeks, the surcharge applies to those packages. So a joint effort and, again, one that we're confident and will lead to success at peak season.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Chris Wetherbee, Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey, great. Thanks, and good morning, everybody. I wanted to ask about some of the cost headwinds that we've seen in the Domestic segment. It looks like you're pulling forward maybe some costs into the fourth quarter with $60 million, which is up from the third quarter's performance. I guess I just wanted to get a sense how we should be thinking about maybe beyond fourth quarter. It sounds like you're ramping up for peak season, but as we start to move into 2018, how should that cadence to sort of these cost headwinds as you roll out Saturday and build up the Domestic network look?","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Sure. Chris, this is Richard. And I think, first, it's a little early to guide, because we are just putting all of our plans together for 2018. What we did earlier this year, say, this $100 million to $200 million operating penalty would be ongoing for the next three years as we continue to not only open the Saturday operations. And the reason the fourth quarter is large is because that's when you have most of the operations open.","But it's also, as we operate new buildings and start construction or operating new buildings, there's some penalties as we get these buildings up to the same standard from when they first start to the UPS full implementation, because it's a step function. So again, on the next call, we'll talk about 2018, but we did call out that there would be between $100 million and $200 million for each of the next few years.","Myron A. Gray - United Parcel Service, Inc.","When you look beyond this peak season, Brandon (sic) [Chris], take into consideration that we'll be continuing to implement Saturday operations next year. At the onset of peak this year, we will have deployed Saturday operations in over 200 locations. We would expect that to be a bit greater than 90 locations for next year, as well as the additional capacity that we will add for next year. We're going to bring on 5 million additional square feet that will bring into the network next year, so it'll be the onboarding of those locations and the additional head count associated with it.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks.","Operator","We have a question from the line of David Vernon, Bernstein. Please go ahead.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. So it looks like the underlying sort of growth is accelerating here as International supply chain are happening, but I want to kind of get some feedback from you guys on the direction of the Domestic margin as you think over the next two or three years. You've got the implementation costs kind of in the base over the next couple of years. Should we be expecting that the operating profit in Domestic is going to be growing kind of with the top-line from here? Or do you think there is still some possibility that 2017 \u2013 or 2018 could be a little bit lower on the Domestic margin side?","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Yeah. Again, it's a little early, because we are just putting these plans together, David. This is Richard, obviously. But I think the first thing you should think about is that next year with 5.5 million square feet of buildings opening, it will be muted as well next year, but it really is part of a deliberate plan. One of the things is we've been looking at buildings and trying to do this as fast as we can. And we've said all along we were balancing the opening of the buildings with the disruption to the network. And so we have seen that putting about a million square feet in this year and next year it's 5 million square feet. So the velocity is a little different than we originally planned.","But at the same time, as we get our plans finalized we'll share that, but I would expect that it would be a little bit muted on the lower end of where we guided for next year. But we're still putting plans together, so it's a little early for me to say exactly where we're going to land.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yeah. No, I'm not looking for like an exact number, I'm just trying to think like, I think what's keeping a lot of folks nervous about the stock, quite frankly is, is either a lack of commitment, or a feeling that there is a lack of controllability about where that Domestic margin is going to go over the next kind of 2, 3 years. Year-to-year, quarter-to-quarter is not the issue. The issue really is, is the management team feel like they can get a flat to up Domestic margin? And what are the incentives around that to make sure that actually happens?","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","So I think the first thing is we're looking at this much longer term. I mean we're investing in order to build out our network, not just for the next year or two but really for the next generation. And that plays into it, and if we can move a little faster, it's always going to be the best thing we can do, because our highest return is going to be, of course, reinvesting in the business.","And not all growth is going to be linear because, look at our revenue line right now, we're having some of the fastest revenue growth that we've had in over five years. And we think that that's healthy and we'll continue to adjust the network for that kind of growth because we historically have not had that kind of growth.","So I would tell you that you should be thinking about we're preparing this for the future, we're looking at the return on invested capital, and all of our goals are aligned with making sure that we continue to increase value and bring the proper return, not only for UPS, but for our investors going forward.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","All right. Thanks for the additional color.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","We're going to take an online question from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer & Company. Can you please address the drivers of the recent improvement in global air freight markets and global trade? How is UPS positioning strategically to capitalize on this momentum?","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Okay. This is David, I'll start that and then hand it to Jim. But we are encouraged by the recent improvements in global trade and we think that the global economy certainly has a part with that. But exports are growing pretty much throughout the world, and this is just an important part of our growth strategy. We see Jim's International unit as really a primary growth engine and this is feeding a lot of that growth engine. Jim?","James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Yes, Scott, I would add three points to what David has said. First, obviously, inventory levels continue to be at levels that are going to push more through that supply chain both, and I'm talking kind of air freight and ocean in this discussion.","In the most recent quarter, the data that we see has the ocean utilization at over 97%. So you have a high, high, demand environment now with capacity really becoming tight. Obviously, that's driving the rates up and you can see that across the industry and across, obviously, the players.","And then you get up in the air, this is the fourth consecutive quarter where you really had demand outpacing capacity. Obviously, it started with pilots coming out of the air in China, capacity came with it, the air freight rates have tightened, obviously, we all have to manage through that, and then manage the connections.","But then in the middle, the third event, obviously, is weather. When all of those three combinations hit you get an air freight and an ocean market that exists as it is today, obviously it will drive transportation rates up, and we have to respond to that. And I think actually the UPS team beginning in Asia moving back out to the west has done a great job. So we look forward to our fourth quarter as well. Appreciate the question.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Please go ahead.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah, good morning. So I'll maybe stick with that topic of international strength and it's pretty impressive the acceleration in export volume growth. I was wondering if you could give us a little more perspective on some of the pieces of that. I know obviously, you don't talk about market, but how much of that is kind of benefit from TNT cyber-attack that volumes come over? In the future, maybe, how much do you think we ought to consider the SF Express stepping things up?","Just trying to get a sense of kind of what might be temporary and what might be you ought to put into the model a double-digit export volume growth for the next couple of quarters or couple of years?","James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Okay, Tom. That's a broad question. I'll do my best to skinny it down. First of all, let me start with \u2013 I think Rich had some opening comments as did David. I think that the way we think about this is, this is just another step that our customers are choosing UPS. We've had 11 quarters in a row of continued momentum. This one, obviously, when you see 19% export volume growth, that is certainly a big one.","You pointed to Europe but if you take a look at Europe back in 2016 when we started this, the growth has been accelerating for almost two years now. The intra-European growth started in early 2016 at 6% and then the quarters went up from there. They went to 8%, 11%, 15%, 12%, now 19%. So this has been a very deliberate investment in that market with all of the dynamics that were going on. We started in early 2016.","Yes. There is some additional lift in the most recent quarter from the malware event; no question about that. But this growth is more than just Europe, this is a broad-based growth. Richard touched on it as well. We're really growing across the globe. I can't tell you what to put in your models, but certainly from my perspective this is about many years into the future, not just the next quarter. So we're pretty pleased with where we are and we look to the future and tomorrow to keep it going.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Were the numbers you mentioned just the total International export, or those were Europe numbers, you mentioned before?","James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Those were intra-European export numbers.","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Overall, exports grew in all regions. And, actually, it was pretty much aligned to both with the number we had for intra-Europe for all exports. And, Tom, we recognize that there probably was a little extra in this quarter, but to Jim's point we've been on a two-year improvement and we still expect that. Obviously, it doesn't mean that we'll stay at these current levels, because of what happened in the third quarter elsewhere, but we do expect to continue to grow strongly and we've guided that International is an important part of the growth story, and it's something Jim and his team have done a really good job doing in the last few years.","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","And just to expand on Richard's comments about the two-year story, this has really been about a 10-year story, and then we committed to the $2 billion a couple of years ago and we're probably 40% of the way through that. But we've had big, big success in Europe and in our International exports for the last 10 years, so it's just been a very consistent story. All right?","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Thank you for the time.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Thanks, Tom. We're going to take another online question. This question comes from Brian Ossenbeck of JPMorgan.","How has the first 747-8s performed in the early testing, which customers are utilizing the domestic air service most frequently? And can the service become more cost effective when cascading the international fleet to the domestic routes?","James Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.","This is Jim, again. As I mentioned, the kind of rollout plan of the 747s, the 10\/18 was the first one, and then the next one is coming in the next few weeks, which is great timing for us.","With respect to how are they performing, obviously, as you would know that any time you do get new aircraft you got to make sure that they perform properly, the airline led by Louisville did a great job to make sure we tested them as quickly as we could when they came off the line. We advanced that knowing the demand and the capacity issues that we had. So to get the first one there on 10\/18 was a bit earlier than we had seen when we started.","The actual first flight that left, those 747-8s can carry 288,000 pounds, and that one carried 288,000 pounds. So it was full to the brim as they say with small package revenue. They couldn't come at any better time, because we've been running, if you look at our block hours, year-over-year increases of almost 5% in our block hours to actually take care of this demand.","And so for the bigger ones to come that can carry the extra payload in a more effective and efficient way, it is great for every participant in the actual supply chain. The customers love it. Obviously, we do. The economics love it, and the service loves it as well. So I think Myron wants to add a couple of points from an airline perspective and\/or Alan does.","Alan Gershenhorn - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Hey, Brian. This is Alan. Yes, from the domestic perspective to your question about the customers, I would just say that we've been gaining air share each quarter during the last three years, and we'd emerged as the air-share leader. And part of that is our expansion of our 10:30 and noon and Next Day Air early service to more postal codes than any other carrier here in the United States. And we're doing that similarly with our International Express and our International Express Plus services around the globe.","And that's very, very attractive to our health care and high tech and professional services industry segments. And then on the e-commerce side, we're obviously growing that quite well also with our Next Day Air Saver, as well as our deferred services. And you can see the strong growth that we had in Next Day Air this past quarter at 8%. Thanks for the question.","Operator","A question from the line of Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Just if I could follow-up on those International questions from earlier, could you please elaborate? You call out the revenue growth, 11%, driven by premium products. Could you specify, was that uniquely in any one area? You've talked about broad-based, but curious about the premium products? And then also, nice movement on yield growth in the quarter in International, could you speak about that, particularly export yield growth? Thanks.","Myron A. Gray - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Let me start with the yield growth, I guess, is that I appreciate you noticing that because there's a lot of hard work that goes into that. Certainly, we recognized over the last couple of quarters we thought we needed to do a bit better job there to match it. Kate's talked about that in her opening comments. So that yield movement was purposeful and a couple of quarters in the making, and we think it's right for us long-term and the shareholders.","With respect to the balance, look, I mean, I think the team's doing a great job. It's growth in Mexico. It's growth in Canada. It's growth in Europe. It's growth in Asia. It's growth in our intra-Asia networks. And, obviously, you start to layer in the likes of partnerships of the SF Expresses in the future and the Middle East investments that we've made, we feel like we've got some good momentum that will continue. So I think the key word is balance and, hopefully, you can see that across the talk we're having today and in the continued dialogue we will have in the future.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","We're going to take an online question. This comes from Kevin Sterling from Seaport Global Securities. Purchase transportation cost as a percentage of revenue has been creeping up over the past two years. Can you talk about your purchase transportation costs jumping as a percentage of revenue during the quarter?","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Sure. And this is Richard, Kevin, and, obviously, I'll take this question. I think the first thing you have to do is think about the last two years. And while purchase transportation cost is up, there are two big buckets of purchase transportation. There's what we do internationally, and Jim just talked about how revenue has grown and we've been on a two-year, really, continued improvement plan that him and his team have been working.","And then the other side is Supply Chain and Freight. And to give you an example, if you go back and look at our history prior to last year, our revenue growth in the Supply Chain and Freight group has been pretty muted. But yes, last year we grew at 8% and year-to-date we're right now just under 13% growth. Obviously, as Coyote, Freight Forwarding, those all play into the purchase transportation.","And so, I think when we look at purchase transportation we think it's healthy. This quarter alone, over 60%, between 60% and 65%, was really driven by International and Supply Chain and Freight. And then when you get into what's going on in domestic, there's a piece of it because SurePost is growing a little faster than the average domestic.","And then there's just a normal increases that you would expect. So when we look at it, I know it's a big number reported change, but if you look at what's going on with the business underlying it, I think you see that that goes right in line. And that's why you've seen both International profit growth and then what the Supply Chain and Freight segment has done and really called out in January that we've continue to see improvement this year. And that's what's happened as well.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Ken Hoexter of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Good morning. David or Richard, can you talk about the accelerating CapEx? You talked about adding new aircraft and now you are jumping from 1 million square feet to 5 million square feet. Maybe talk about the scale going forward? And did your original CapEx targets account for the switch from upgrading your service at your sort centers to the building of new ones that you now plan?","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Sure Ken, this is Richard. Obviously, we just talked about it, and hopefully everyone in the call is getting that, part of this is about growth, and the emphasis that growth we talked about it in February. I've said on the call we think we're going to beat the higher end of the range for revenue for the total enterprise. And so when you think about year-to-date 7% growth across the entire enterprise, that's better than we've seen in over five years. Really, really coming out of the recession was the only other time we saw this kind of growth number. And it's about growth today and going into the future. So we're building and expanding the network, optimizing the investments, to look for what's best for UPS.","Very early in the CapEx, we said we would continue to tweak, understanding we couldn't disrupt the network too fast because you still need to provide the right service for our customers, but we wanted to go as fast as we could.","In the first earnings call in April of this year we did move forward a 747-8 that we actually have in operation today. And then we bought some land over the last year. It's really for buildings going all the way until the next five years, and that's because strategically it was the right place and the right size, and we did not want to lose that land because we knew what are roadmap plans were.","When you put all that together, we likely think we'll be closer to 8%or around 8% instead of our initial guidance. But given the return on invested capital and when we do put new assets and investments in the business, the return they get, we think it's the best use for not only UPS but for our investors as well.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, Richard.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Our next question will come from Dave Ross. And Dave's questions are: Are you more or less positive on 2018 UPS and global economic perspectives than you were during the last call in July?","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","This is David, I'll answer that. From a macroeconomic standpoint I would say that a little bit more positive about 2018. And just a couple of things, we talked about global trade seems to be growing, Europe is holding up well, there is concerns about Brexit, but for now Europe is holding up well. China has kind of been better than expected, and then exports in general are growing.","And then from the U.S. side you see a couple of things. Obviously, the consumer is still driving the economy and especially from the e-commerce, we think that's just going to continue to grow. Excuse me, there's also optimism about the tax reform and what that can do to stimulate the economy. And we believe that that is getting more and more interest. And the last part was the industrial production was affected a little bit this quarter by the natural disasters. Maybe won't bounce back completely in the fourth quarter, but we certainly think that will continue the first part of next year. So good question. I think we are little more positive. Thank you.","Operator","Next question will come from the line of Ben Hartford of Baird. Please go ahead.","Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, good morning, all. Thanks for the question. Just maybe for Alan and Myron on the new peak season holiday surcharge. Interested in what the receptivity from the customers have been. Have we seen any changes in behavior yet? What are the planning discussions like in the context of that new holiday peak season surcharge program?","How do you expect flows to play out? Do you expect customers to largely avoid that and shift volumes into some the weeks not governed by the surcharges? Do you expect behavior to be unaffected? And maybe in the context of all of that, any sort of incremental risk or concern regarding access to capacity in December, given the looming ELD mandate on the truckload side? Thanks.","Kathleen M. Gutmann - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Thanks, Ben. This is Kate. I'll actually address the question. We've been working extensively with customers tied to the peak planning. And so to address some of the points in your question, definitely, consumer demand being what it is, some of it can be steered to other weeks but others will actually, of course, maintain in the period. So there will be a mix with the surcharge, but customers are looking at things like self-gifting. And if somebody's buying something for themselves at the holidays, if it can take extra time, then they will actually activate that to smooth the volume out of say something like a Cyber Monday. That helps their fulfillment centers. It helps also the level of peak spike that occurs. So that's one of the mechanisms, the surcharge, to help steer some of that controllable aspect of consumer demand while other aspects, of course, are committed times and needing to flow as committed. So that's some of it.","And then the operating plans and the use of Saturday delivery and pickup, as I mentioned previously, are items that are helping to steer where possible, activating our Saturday pickup, which is market-leading. Enables packages to be delivered on Monday from shipped on Saturday. And that's proving to be popular with customers and very positively received. Thank you.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","We're going to take an Internet question from Allison Landry. Allison's question is:","How much B2C growth did you see during the quarter with brick-and-mortar? And is it outpacing growth from Amazon? What are you expecting? Are you expecting these trends to continue in the upcoming peak season?","Alan Gershenhorn - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Hey, this is Alan. I'll take that. Yeah. So as you saw in our results, we had another strong quarter of B2C growth, up high-single digits in U.S. domestic. But I do want to also note that it's up mid-teens in our International business, and we certainly expect this to continue. The customers out there, both in the U.S. and internationally are responding well to the UPS industry-leading e-commerce value stack. And that's broad-based growth. It's really coming from the bricks and clicks, brick-and-mortar retailers, along with the e-commerce pure-plays. And it's also coming broad-based from a customer size perspective in middle-market, small and medium businesses, and also enterprise.","Some of the solutions out there that are really resonating are our newly created Saturday operations that includes Saturday pickup in addition to Saturday delivery that expedites shipments for Monday delivery. And then, obviously, on My Choice, our UPS lockers, our Marketplace Shipping tools and Access Points.","And the one thing I want to note, this past quarter, we launched our UPS returns manager, which is a free online tool that enables merchants of all sizes to customize their consumer return services and processes, and our consumers get hassle-free return services. And we launched that in the U.S. plus 43 countries around the world. So we're building that e-commerce value stack both in the U.S. and internationally. Thanks for the question.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Pat Gruck (56:42) of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, guys. It's Scott. So I apologize if this is a repeat. I've been bouncing around a couple of calls and hopefully you can coordinate better next time. But Richard, just on the fourth quarter guidance, since it's a decently wide range here, just wanted to clarify. Are you expecting domestic margin improvement in the fourth quarter? And are you still expecting Domestic margin improvement for the year? And then did you say if on the TNT benefit in the third quarter, if you are expecting any of that to continue in the fourth quarter?","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Sure, Scott. First of all, I think you asked specifically, first around the fourth quarter EPS guidance. And at the end of the day, in my talk, and you can pull the transcript, I went through unveiling the one-offs that occurred in 2016 around the tax and then the impact of the currency this year. And if you pull those out and do the math, the underlying growth is one of the stronger quarters we've had. That's the first point.","The second point is we recognize that we'll continue to see both on International and Supply-Chain about what we expected, but we also know in the U.S., IP has come down a little bit post hurricane. We looked at Sandy and Katrina and saw recovery was about a 6 to 12 month process. And so overall we think Domestic is about where we expected it to be, and it's about where we expect it to be given the one-time hurricane and weather. And year-over-year for the fourth quarter we do expect operating margin to increase for the U.S. Domestic.","So we've put it all together, we feel really comfortable, and that's why we moved up our range. And at the end as Kate and Myron and Alan have talked about, we spent a lot of time planning and working with our customers to ensure the fourth quarter is good and we deliver a good peak season for customers and investors. Thank you.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","So just if I'm clear, so if we kind of normalize for the hurricane, you're still expecting Domestic package margin improvement for the year.","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","You've got to normalize for the call it \u2013 there was also some other quarters where there were some one times, but overall we think we're right on plan if you go back and look at what we've talked about.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you, guys","Operator","We have another question from the line of Brian Ossenbeck of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to come back to the topic of facility expansions. I know you said you're added 1 million square feet this year and looking at 5.5 million square feet next year. If you could just remind us over the next three to five years. I think, Richard, on the last call you mentioned it was about 28 million to 35 million square footage that you might need to add. Is there a potential that that could come down as you get better efficiency built into these facilities? And what sort of capital investments do you think that fully deploying that square footage might entail over the next three to five years? Thank you.","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","So, Brian, I'm going to specifically talk about where we are right now. We have moved forward some of our especially outer-year land purchases. But what we're also seeing as a growth rate that's at the higher end of where we originally guided to. And so I think we said all along there are tweaks as I mentioned a moment ago, based on how volume comes in, capabilities, you know technology keeps changing, and as technology changes there's additional capabilities we have to think about in terms of how do we automate it? Because anytime we can automate that it helps the efficiency and the movement in the network.","It's a little early to talk about the three-to-five year other than what we've guided, but I think as we close out the planning for 2018 I'll come back to it.","The one thing we should talk about though is if you look at the Next Day Air and the International growth rates obviously, and the air capacity, we've now grown probably closer to 25% since we last bought a plane in either the International or the Domestic. So we keep looking at that to make sure that we have the right capital because at the end of the day those are great returns and investment in the business is the right thing to do. Thank you.","Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","That concludes our Q&A segment for today. I would now like to turn the program back over to Mr. Scott Childress. Please go ahead, sir.","Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.","I'll hand the call to Richard for some comments.","Richard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Yeah. I just wanted to make a few brief comments around some of what's going on around tax reform because with the potential that's unique for UPS is where taxpayers that pays between 34% and 35%. So because of that we continue to look at how do we optimize based on knowing the changes that might occur, and what's in front of us. And what that means is we continue to look at all of our strategies and make sure we're making the necessary adjustments.","So we will continue to do that. David is actively engaged, along with the rest of the senior management team, and getting our story out about why we think the competitiveness in the U.S. improves when you bring the tax rate down because we create jobs, and we also can invest in a different way than we currently are.","So, there's a lot more to come in this area, but I thought it was important for you all to hear our view that obviously with this change it's a generational thing, and we are planning for it and thinking about it in the right way. And with that I'll turn it over to David.","David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Rich. As you can see, we are transforming our network for growth and long-term value. We're making great progress, especially in our Smart Logistics Network. Our strategies and investments are paying off, providing good positive returns, and we continue to see good growth opportunities for UPS. And, of course, for the next month or two, we're focused on delivering a successful holiday, both for our customers and our investors, and thank you for joining the call. I appreciate it. See you."]}}
