Welcome to the Q2 2014 Earnings Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, August 5, 2014.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Nancy Christal, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.","Nancy R. Christal","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I\u2019m here this morning with Larry Merlo, President and CEO, who will provide a business update; and Dave Denton, Executive Vice President and CFO, who will review our second quarter results as well as guidance for the third quarter and year.","Jon Roberts, President of PBM; and Helena Foulkes, President of the Retail Business, are also with us today and will participate in the question-and-answer session following our prepared remarks. During the Q&A, please limit yourself to no more than one question with a quick follow-up, so we can provide more callers with the chance to ask their question.","Now I have one key date to announce this morning. We plan to host our annual Analyst Day on the morning of Tuesday, December 16 in New York City. At that time, you\u2019ll have the opportunity to hear from several members of our senior management team who will provide 2015 guidance as well as a comprehensive update on our growth strategy. We plan to send invitations with more specific details via email sometime in August, so please save the date. Again, that\u2019s Tuesday, December 16. If you don\u2019t receive an invitation and would like to attend, please contact me at your earliest convenience.","Please note that just before this call, we posted a slide presentation on our website that summarizes the information you will hear today as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance. Additionally, our quarterly report on Form 10-Q will be filed by the close of business today and it will be available on our website at that time.","During today\u2019s presentation, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. By their nature, all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements for a number of reasons as described in our SEC filings including the Risk Factors section and cautionary statement disclosures in those filings.","During this call, we\u2019ll also use some non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company\u2019s performance including free cash flow and adjusted EPS. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find the definitions of these non-GAAP items as well as reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of our website.","As always, today\u2019s call is being simulcast on our website and it will be archived there following the call for one year.","Now, let me turn this over to Larry Merlo.","Larry J. Merlo","Thanks, Nancy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us to hear more about the strong results we posted for the second quarter. I\u2019m pleased to say that we met or exceeded our expectations on every key major performance. Our adjusted earnings per share increased 16.5% to $1.13 per share. That\u2019s $0.02 above the high end of our guidance range.","Both the PMB and Retail segments exceeded our revenue expectations and delivered strong gross margins. And as a result, operating profit in the Retail business grew 6.5% and profit in the PBM grew 30% exceeding our expectations. Additionally, we generated nearly 400 million of free cash keeping us on track to achieve our full year free cash flow goal.","Now given our strong performance year-to-date, we are raising and narrowing our adjusted earnings per share guidance for the year to a range of $4.43 to $4.51 and that\u2019s up from our previous range of $4.36 to $4.50, and Dave will provide the details behind our financial results and guidance during his review. But before I move on, I do want to say that I\u2019m extremely proud of the work our colleagues are doing to drive continued strong results across the enterprise.","So let me turn to a brief business update and I\u2019ll start by level-setting how we see the current state of health reform. I think as everybody knows, there are reported to be about 8 million individuals who have enrolled in the public exchanges and we saw the biggest increase occur toward the end of open enrollment. The mix of individuals who were newly insured as opposed to those who previously had coverage, it still remains unclear with various sources quoting anywhere from a low of 27% of individuals newly insured up to a high of 85% with multiple data points suggesting it might be somewhere in between.","With regard to Medicaid, available data indicates that 6.7 million individuals have gained coverage, which is up from 3 million at the time of our last earnings call. Now while the net number of newly insured remains somewhat of a mystery, we can be confident that several million Americans have gained coverage in recent months and this should provide a positive secular trend in pharmacy volume growth for the next several years. Our experience to-date with respect for the combined impact of both public exchanges and the expansion of Medicaid is consistent overall with our expectations and is expected to yield a modest benefit in '14.","We continue to expand our focus on building strategic enterprise relationships with health plans whether or not we\u2019re the PBM. We support more than 25 commercial health plans, co-ops and Medicaid managed care organizations across 26 states as their PBM and we expect this number to grow. We have also implemented preferred pharmacy networks or Maintenance Choice in more than 20 states, and as we emphasized at our December Analyst Day we are well positioned across the enterprise to partner with health plans in a variety of ways and we\u2019re actively helping them advance their strategies in their respective markets while growing our enterprise share.","Now let me update you on our 10-year agreement with Cardinal Health that\u2019s built upon our combined sourcing expertise. As you\u2019re aware, last month we completed the formation of Red Oak Sourcing, the largest generic sourcing entity here in the U.S. and located in Foxborough, Massachusetts. And at that time, the employees and functional responsibilities were transitioned from CVS Caremark and Cardinal to Red Oak Sourcing.","As we worked together to get the venture up and running, we further refined certain aspects of our agreement and the structure of the final agreement is slightly different than what we\u2019ve talked about previously, so Dave will walk through how the venture works during his financial review highlighting the three ways in which the venture is expected to deliver value. So we remain excited about Red Oak and we look forward to its future contributions.","Moving to our PBM business, I\u2019ll start with an update on the 2015 selling season. And as we noted on our last call, the marketplace has been active. Pricing remains competitive, yet rationale and I\u2019m pleased to report that to-date we have been very successful in this selling season. Gross wins for '15 currently stand at 5.4 billion and span across all client segments while net new business stands at 2.6 billion, and this net new number includes business lost through acquisition, which makes up more than 60% of the lost business. These net new business numbers do not account for any impact from our individual Med-D prescription drug plan, which I\u2019ll touch on a little later.","As for renewals, we\u2019ve completed nearly 70% of the 26 billion in business up for renewal with the retention rate of nearly 97%. And I think our selling season success reflects our track record of generating savings for our clients through our unique suite of capabilities, top of mind for clients this selling season is achieving better control of their specialty spend. Among our clients, specialty represents about 22.5% of total drug spend under the pharmacy benefit and projections have this continuing to grow at a mid-teens rate.","Now all specialty spend including that paid under the medical benefit will likely to grow to as much as 50% of total drug spend by 2018. So I think you can see it\u2019s critical that we bring meaningful solutions to the challenges. Our specialty business remains strong in the second quarter as revenues were up about 53% year-over-year. In addition to benefits from new business and the addition of Coram, another driver of specialty revenue growth was Sovaldi, the new hep C drug.","There are estimated to be roughly 3 million people in the U.S. requiring treatment and as everyone knows, the potential costs of treatment is very high. As you might imagine, the growing costs in this category are of significant concern to our clients and we have a number of programs in place to ensure appropriate utilization and cost management. And as competing products become available late this year and next, we will look for opportunities to introduce formulary management to further drive down costs.","At CVS Caremark, we continued to differentiate our specialty offerings in the marketplace with a goal of providing a high level of clinical support to patients, while managing trend for our clients and driving continued share gains. As an example, our Specialty Connect offering has been rolled out. It has been well received by both clients and patients and you\u2019ll recall that Specialty Connect integrates our mail and retail capabilities providing choice and convenience for patients while preserving the central clinical expertise that leads to better health outcomes. No other PBM can offer this today.","As of late July, more than 60,000 specialty patients have been transitioned to this specialty service model, which again offers enhanced clinical and benefit support. The program is generating high satisfaction scores with patients, it resonates with clients as a differentiated approach to simplifying the specialty process for members and physicians appreciate the ease of use in getting patients started on therapy.","Our medical pharmacy management program also continues to enjoy strong interest and uptake in the marketplace with several new implementations underway and our site of care offering through our Coram infusion business enables us to provide patients more convenient, low cost alternatives to hospital infusions whether at the physician\u2019s office, a retail infusion site or even the patient\u2019s home.","The Coram organization has been fully integrated into the specialty group and our new capabilities have been a topic of discussion in the current selling season for specialty business on a carve-in or standalone basis. So we remain optimistic that we can continue to gain specialty pharmacy share, as we work to develop innovative offerings that capitalize on our unique ability to optimize cost, quality and access.","Another important way that we manage trend for clients is through our highly proactive approach to formulary management, which is you\u2019ll recall we introduced to the marketplace back in 2011 for the 2012 planned year. Since then we have updated our formulary on an annual basis with a mission of being able to manage trend for our clients while providing comprehensive, cost effective and clinically appropriate options for their plan members.","Now building on our formulary success of the last three years, we recently notified our clients that we will be removing 22 products in addition to select diabetes test strips for the 2015 formulary. And from 2012 through 2015, our rigorous approach to formulary management is expected to result in total savings to our clients of more than $3.5 billion.","Before turning to Retail, let me touch briefly on our Med-D PDP SilverScript. As expected, we currently have approximately 3 million lives in our individual PDP. And for the first half of 2014, our normal monthly attrition has been only partially offset by choosers and auto-assignees. And as we came out of sanction earlier this year, we began to enroll choosers in February and received dual auto assignees in May.","Additionally, as the dual demonstration projects continue to progress in certain states, we do expect to see some transition of dual eligible lives through the second half of this year. And while we may recapture some of these lives through our health planned partners, it is likely we will lose a modest number of lives as a result. So we expect to end the year with about 2.9 million lives in our individual PDP and we continue to see significant opportunity to grow the individual PDP business over the long term.","As a matter of fact, last Thursday, we received the preliminary benchmark results from CMS for 2015 and I\u2019m pleased to report that SilverScript was below the benchmark and therefore qualified in 32 of the 34 regions. The only regions we didn\u2019t qualify were Alaska and Nevada, consistent with prior years. So the strong benchmark results should enable us to retain the vast majority of the auto-assignees we currently serve, so we\u2019re very pleased with the outcome.","Moving on to the Retail business, following the effects of the difficult weather and flu season that we experienced in Q1, total same-store sales reaccelerated sequentially in Q2 increasing 3.3%. Pharmacy same-store sales increased 5% versus the year ago and were negatively impacted by about 160 basis points due to recent generic introductions. Pharmacy comps were also negatively impacted by approximately 130 basis points due to the transfer of specialty scripts from our Retail segment to our PBM segment as a result of the new Specialty Connect offering and Dave will talk more about that later. Pharmacy script comps increased 3.9% on a 30-day equivalent basis and we continued to gain pharmacy share.","I want to touch on a topic that has received a lot of attention lately based on some competitor commentary, that being generic inflation and pharmacy reimbursement pressures. You\u2019ll recall that when we gave our 2014 guidance last December, we told you that we expected continued pressure on pharmacy reimbursement, and the market is generally consistent with what we anticipated.","As to generic inflation, while the cost of goods inflation does exist on some generic items, it is not material in the context of our overall purchasing volume and again was generally within our expectations. On balance, the deflationary nature of the generic pharmaceutical market remains intact and overall, our pharmacy margins increased this quarter for multiple reasons were in line with our expectations, and again Dave will talk more about this in the financial review.","As for the front store business, comps decreased 0.4%. Our front store comps were positively impacted by approximately 80 basis points from the shift of the Easter holiday. And as plan for exiting the tobacco category this fall, we have begun to see a sales impact. Our front store comps would have been approximately 110 basis points higher if you exclude tobacco in the estimated associated basket sales.","Now adjusting for this tobacco impact and the Easter shift, front store comps were roughly flat in the quarter, sequentially improving from Q1. Front store traffic declined, as customers continued to aggregate their trips and at the same time, our average basket size continued to increase reflecting the strength of our loyalty program and the personalization it enables us to offer. And consistent with our prior statements, we are making responsible investments in profitable promotions and remain committed to not chasing empty sales.","Driving higher margin store brand sales continues to be another area of focus. We saw notable growth in share gains and store brands this quarter with store brands as a percent of front store sales increasing about 80 basis points to 18%. And we see significant opportunities to continue to expand our share of strong brand products by building on our core equities and health and beauty while also seeking opportunistic growth in other areas.","Additionally, in order to drive better results, we continued to explore innovative personalization strategies through insights from ExtraCare. As an example, during the second quarter, we expanded our send to card digital coupon option for all ExtraCare personalized offers that were historically only available either at the ExtraCare coupon center or on the bottom of a customer\u2019s register receipt. Adoption has been very strong with over half of our registered users already trying this new feature and we also continue to turbocharge our personalized email promotions with our active email subscriber list growing 21% versus the same quarter last year.","Turning to our retail drugstore program, we opened 34 new stores, relocated eight and closed four, resulting in 30 net new stores in the quarter and we\u2019re on track to achieve square footage growth of 2% to 3% for the year. In the quarter, we recently announced that we have a definitive agreement to purchase Navarro Discount Pharmacy. Navarro is the largest Hispanic-owned drug store chain in the U.S. with 33 retail drugstore locations in the Miami-Dade county area in addition to Navarro Health Services, a specialty pharmacy serving patients with complex or chronic diseases.","We expect to maintain the current product mix and we\u2019ll learn from our Navarro colleagues about Hispanic marketing and merchandizing, and we expect these lessons to be transferable to certain other CVS markets. The Navarro brand is one of the most recognizable in the Hispanic marketplace. We plan to retain it. If you recall, we adopted a similar strategy in maintaining the Longs Drugs name for our acquired locations in Hawaii. That has been successful. And we expect to complete the Navarro transaction later this year.","Let me touch briefly on MinuteClinic, which continues on its healthy growth trajectory. In the second quarter, revenues increased 24% versus a year ago. We opened 32 net new clinics in the quarter bringing our total to 60 year-to-date and keeping us on track to open at least 150 new clinics this year. We currently operate 860 clinics in 28 states plus the District of Columbia and in recent news, a new partnership with USA Football named MinuteClinic, their official retail medical clinic and sports physical provider and we will offer a special discount for sports physicals to more than 1 million young athletes and their coaches.","CVS Caremark and MinuteClinic also added four new health system alliances during the quarter and another four in July bringing our total number of affiliations with major U.S. health systems to 40.","So with that, let me turn it over to Dave for the financial review.","David M. Denton","Thank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. As I typically do, I\u2019ll begin this morning by highlighting how our disciplined approach to capital allocations continues to enhance shareholder value. I\u2019ll follow that discussion with a detailed review of our strong second quarter followed by an update on our guidance. So let\u2019s begin.","During the second quarter, we continued our long track record of paying quarterly dividends to our shareholders with payments totaling $322 million. With a strong earnings outlook for the remainder of this year, we expect our dividend payout ratio to surpass 25% at some point during 2014. We\u2019re making continued good progress towards achieving our 35% payout target by 2018.","Additionally, we repurchased 16 million shares for approximately $1.2 billion at an average price of $74.91 per share. Year-to-date, we repurchased more than 27 million shares or $2 billion and we still expect to complete at least $4 billion of share repurchases with the full year of 2014. So between dividends and share repurchases, we\u2019ve returned more than $1.5 billion to our shareholders in the second quarter alone and have returned more than $2.6 billion during the first half of this year. Our goal has been to return more than $5 billion in 2014 and we remain on track to meet that goal.","As Larry said, we generated nearly $400 million of free cash in the second quarter bringing our total for the first six months of the year to approximately $2.2 billion. The key driver continues to be our healthy growth in earnings coupled with improvements in our working capital performance fueled mainly by the PBM\u2019s growth. All-in, we continue to expect to generate free cash between $5.5 billion and $5.8 billion in 2014.","Turning to the income statement. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations came in at $1.13 per share, up 16.5% versus LY and $0.02 above the high end of our guidance range. The strong performance reflects solid growth across all of our operating segments.","The retail segment produced results at the high-end of our expectations while the enterprise\u2019s outperformance was driven primarily by better-than-expected results from the PBM. GAAP diluted EPS was $1.06 per share, and now let me quickly walk you through our results.","On a consolidated basis, revenues in the second quarter increased 10.7% or approximately $3.4 billion to $34.6 billion. PBM net revenues increased 16.2% or approximately $3 billion to $21.8 billion. The strong performance was driven by net new business, specialty pharmacy growth, drug inflation and product mix.","Offsetting this to some degree were lower mail choice claims reflecting the decline in traditional mail order volumes and an increase in generic dispensing. The PBM\u2019s generic dispensing rate increased approximately 180 basis points versus the same quarter of LY to 82%.","Now revenues in the retail business increased 4.5% in the quarter or approximately $730 million to $16.9 billion. Sales in the retail segment were better-than-expected driven primarily by branded drug inflation as well as volumes. Retail GDR increased by approximately 160 basis points versus the second quarter of '13 to 84%.","Let me point out that with the second quarter results, we have begun to experience the type of shift between segments that are highlighted at past Analyst Days. As you know, our focus isn\u2019t limited to just one channel, mail or retail, as it is for many of our competitors. Our channel and business segment agnostic offerings will enhance the performance of the enterprise and sometimes at the expense of one individual segment.","For that reason, recall that we have been suggesting that you focus on the growth of the enterprise rather than the individual segments to best gauge our success. And with the implementation of Specialty Connect this past quarter, we essentially transferred revenues out of the retail pharmacy segment and into the PBM segment as the PBM took over the dispensing of nearly all specialty prescriptions filled by CVS Caremark.","As anticipated, the transition had a larger impact on sales dollars than scripts given the high cost of specialty drugs. The impact on sales dollars in the second quarter was approximately $145 million and this impact will grow larger as we ramp up in the third and fourth quarters. Obviously, this shift dampened year-over-year top line growth at retail while enhancing revenue growth in the PBM. And as Larry said, it had an approximately 130 basis point negative impact on retail pharmacy comps but it had an insignificant impact on retail script volume.","Now turning to gross margin. The consolidated company posted an 18.3% margin in the quarter, a decline of approximately 40 basis points compared to Q2 of '13. This margin decline was the result of a mix shift as the lower margin PBM segment grew faster than the retail segment. Both operating segments saw their margins improve. Additionally, margins benefitted from the finalization of California\u2019s Medicaid reimbursement rates, which I referenced on our last earnings call. This finalization benefitted retail gross margin by $53 million in the quarter and PBM gross margin by $16 million. This impact was consistent with the guidance we provided earlier this year.","Within the PBM segment, gross margins increased approximately 35 basis points versus the same quarter of LY to 5.5% while gross profit dollars increased approximately 24% year-over-year. The increase year-over-year was primarily driven by growth in our specialty business, favorable purchasing economics and the increase in GDR. We continue to see these positive margin drivers partially offset by typical client price compression.","Now gross margin in the retail segment was 31.4%, up 40 basis points over LY. Gross profit dollars increased 5.9% year-over-year. Pharmacy margins improved in the quarter as we benefitted from the increase in GDR and the finalization of the reduction in California\u2019s Medicaid reimbursement rates that I noted earlier. Our pharmacy margins notably improved even without the impact of this rate finalization.","At the same time, we saw front store margins decline as anticipated in the quarter, driven mainly by the markdown of some tobacco products as well as the unexpected bankruptcy of one of our vendors. Total operating expenses as a percent of revenues improved by approximately 50 basis points from Q2 of '13 to 11.9% while total SG&A dollars grew by 6.4%.","The PBM segment\u2019s expenses grew by 10% and its SG&A rate was 1.5%, an improvement of approximately 10 basis points versus LY. In the retail segment, SG&A as a percent of sales declined approximately 20 basis points to 21.3% while expenses grew by 5.6%. This reflects the deleveraging effect of generics as well as the impact of Specialty Connect as the retail segment transitions sales to the PBM segment without a corresponding expense reduction.","Within the corporate segment, expenses were up $29 million to $205 million. This increase is primarily related to benefit costs as well as strategic initiatives. Now adding it all up, operating margin for the total enterprise improved approximately five basis points to 6.4%. Operating margin in the PBM improved approximately 45 basis points to 4%. Now operating margin at retail improved about 20 basis points to 10.1%.","For the quarter, PBM operating profit was strong growing 30.1%, which is higher than expected. Retail operating profit increased a very healthy 6.5% at the high end of our expectations. Now going below the line on the consolidated income statement, net interest expense in the quarter increased approximately $32 million from last year to $158 million. The debt we issued in the fourth quarter of LY was the primary driver of this increase. Our weighted average share count was 1.17 billion shares and finally our effective tax rate was 39.2%.","Now let me update you on our guidance. As always, I\u2019ll focus on the highlights. You can find the additional details of our guidance in the slide presentation that we posted on our website earlier this morning. As we stated in the press release, we are both raising and narrowing our full year 2014 EPS ranges given our strong results to-date. We currently expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share in 2014 in the range of $4.43 to $4.51 reflecting strong year-over-year growth of 11.75% to 14% and that\u2019s excluding the gain of approximately $0.04 associated with the legal settlement in the third quarter of '13.","GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $4.16 to $4.24. While we beat the high end of our guidance in the second quarter by $0.02, we increased the top of the range for the year by $0.01. This delta reflects a few moving pieces among them the minor shift in timing associated with the fixed payment we will receive from Cardinal as well as a slightly higher tax rate.","As Larry said, the structure of the final agreement is a bit different from what we have previously described. So let me explain how the venture works. There are three ways in which the arrangement can provide value to us. First, as we previously stated, we will receive a fixed quarterly payment from Cardinal that recognizes the greater relative purchasing volume that CVS Caremark has today.","Under the final agreement, we will receive 39 quarterly payments of $25.6 million beginning in the fourth quarter of this year rather than 40 quarterly payments of 25 million, which would have begun in the third quarter of this year. There is no change in the overall value of fixed payments. It\u2019s simply a timing shift that more accurately reflects the operational ramp up associated with this venture.","Second, there is a new component to our arrangement providing the potential for additional predetermined quarterly payments from Cardinal to CVS Caremark beginning in the third quarter of 2015. These payments will only occur to the extent that certain milestones are achieved. And finally, as we have explained previously, we believe there will be incremental value to our current generic procurement created through the combination of our purchasing volumes.","So while the fixed payments will now begin a quarter later than originally planned, the overall value of the fixed payments remains the same and the potential for incremental value resulting from the venture remains high. So we continue to be excited about this venture and we look forward to its future contributions.","With that, turning back to 2014 full year guidance, we now expect consolidated net revenue growth to be in the range of 8% to 9% raising the midpoint by approximately 260 basis points over our prior guidance. We\u2019ve increased our top line outlook in the PBM and now expect revenue growth of 13.75% to 14.75%, approximately 5 percentage points higher than our prior guidance. This revised guidance reflects our expectations for better-than-expected growth within specialty pharmacy, fueled by a combination of both inflation and new product mix.","Additionally, taken into account our performance in the second quarter, we are narrowing the top line outlook at retail, raising the bottom and the range and we now expect growth of 1.25% to 2%. And consistent with that outlook, we are also revising our guidance for total same-store sales and now expect growth between 0.25% and 1%. Keep in mind that these anticipated revenue growth rates reflect our expectations around the impact from our decision to exit the tobacco category.","Larry mentioned the impact to Q2 comps as we approach our target date to be out of the category in the fall, we expect the impact to grow. For the full year of 2014, the impact will be as high as 400 basis points from front store comps. And given what we\u2019ve seen to-date, we expect front store comps could be negatively impacted by 400 to 500 basis points in Q3 and roughly double that in Q4. So when you lay out your models, please keep this in mind.","Guidance for operating profit growth in our segments has also been revised. We are narrowing retail operating profit by 25 basis points on both ends. We now expect retail operating profit to increase 7.25% to 8.5% year-over-year. And in the PBM, given the outperformance in Q2 and increased confidence in the back half of the year, we now expect operating profit to increase 12.5% to 14.5%.","As for our tax rate this year, we now expect it to be approximately 39.4% with the narrowing and raising of our EPS guidance range, operating cash flow guidance also changes. We now expect between 7.2 billion and 7.5 billion of operating cash flow, an increase of $200 million. And as I said before, our free cash flow guidance for the year remains in the range of $5.5 billion to $5.8 billion as we expect capital expenditures to be slightly higher than we originally planned.","Now in the third quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.11 to $1.14 per share, reflecting growth of 5.25% to 8.25% versus Q3 of '13, again after removing the gain associated with the legal settlement from last year\u2019s results. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $1.04 to $1.07 in the third quarter.","Within the retail segment, we expect revenues to grow $0.25 to 1.75% versus the third quarter of last year. Adjusted script comps are expected to increase in the range of 3.75% to 4.75% while we expect total same-store sales in the range of down 1% to up 0.5%. As I noted before, if sales of tobacco and the associated baskets are excluded, our expectations for front store comps in the quarter would be 400 to 500 basis points higher.","In the PBM, we expect revenue growth of 14.25% and 15.25% driven by continued strong growth in specialty mix and inflation. We expect retail operating profit growth of 7% to 9% in the third quarter. We expect PBM operating profit growth of 1.5% to 4.5% in the third quarter.","So in closing, this was a great quarter with strong financial results across the board. And as a result, we both raised and narrowed our guidance for the full year and we continued to expect strong free cash flow and to deploy it in a way that maximizes value to our shareholders.","With that, let me turn it back over to Larry.","Larry J. Merlo","Okay. Thanks, Dave. I couldn\u2019t be happier with the work of our colleagues, they work that they\u2019re doing to provide good service to our clients and help people on their path to better health while delivering strong results for our shareholders. I think as we\u2019ve talked this morning and in prior meetings, our unmatched enterprise assets are enabling us to provide innovative integrated solutions in breakthrough products and as the healthcare environment evolves, we are uniquely positioned to address the quality, affordability and accessibility challenges in the healthcare system today. So we\u2019re highly focused on the unique opportunities we see for growth and we\u2019ll continue to take an active and growing role in shaping the future of healthcare.","So with that, let\u2019s go ahead and open it up for your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","Hi, Larry. So a strategic question. When you think about Specialty Connect, how is that starting to impact your dialogue with potential customers? And with that in mind, how do you think that will impact your ability to reduce drug spend, and does it become a game-changer in terms of market share on the PBM side with new accounts?","Larry J. Merlo","Good morning, John. I\u2019ll start and then I think Jon will probably jump in as well. And I think that we really have a surround sound specialty program, okay. I mean we highlighted Specialty Connect this morning and I think that\u2019s one important component, but I think our ability to not just manage the specialty drug but manage the specialty patient I think is what is the real differentiator in the marketplace. And I\u2019ll let Jon pick up from there and talk about the various ways we\u2019re doing that.","Jonathan C. Roberts","Yes, so John as I talk to clients about Specialty Connect, what they really like is opening up the access because specialty has historically been a mail order only access for their members with some retail outlets but not really that accessible. And as clients become more focused on it, they\u2019re really excited about this capability and they think of it like Maintenance Choice that as you know has been very successful in the marketplace. And one of our customers is also a physician, so as we talk to physicians they like the fact that we\u2019re opening up convenience for their patients. And specialty today has its business with our PBM clients but there\u2019s also a big open market in Medicare and fee-for-service Medicaid that again physicians have the ability to influence where those members go. So we expect to grow within our PBM base through clients selecting us because of these integrated capabilities but we also believe we\u2019re going to get a disproportionate amount of referrals from physicians as well.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","Okay. How much of an issue is compliance in that business and therefore is that a significant opportunity on the broader cost side?","Jonathan C. Roberts","As you look at it adherence \u2013 when you say compliance, I\u2019m thinking adherence to the medication.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","Yes.","Jonathan C. Roberts","Historically, retail has performed very much under what traditional specialty pharmacies have been able to perform at. And with Specialty Connect we have achieved the same levels of adherence with our Specialty Connect patients that we have with our specialty pharmacies because we\u2019re able to connect all the clinical capabilities and back-ins of specialty. I know that is a concern that pharma had when we talked to them, but we\u2019ve showed them results and have actually demonstrated an even higher level of adherence because now patients can select which channel they go to. So, we think we\u2019ve solved that and that\u2019s a real benefit.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","Okay, thank you.","Larry J. Merlo","Thanks, John.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs","Thanks for the questions. Larry, I want to go back to your comments on prescription utilization. You touched on a little bit of what you were seeing from ACA and Medicaid expansion. As I look at the script growth in the quarter 3.9% exceeding the guidance, it looks like the guide for the next quarter is 3.75% to 4.75%, so a little bit of acceleration. Could you maybe just parse out a little bit what you\u2019re seeing from ACA but also from the broader market utilization?","Larry J. Merlo","Bob, I think the broader market I think we\u2019re seeing utilization pretty flat I think from the exchanges I think as had previously talked, I think we\u2019re seeing more of a benefit coming out of the Medicaid expansion. I think there\u2019s still some uncertainty as we mentioned in our prepared remarks in terms of when you look at the exchange population, just how many of those are incremental to health insurance coverage. So I think we\u2019ve talked about the fact that we see '14 as a transition year. As we mentioned earlier, we do believe there is a modest benefit more of it coming from Medicaid in '14 but I think that we certainly see this ramping up as we move into '15 and beyond.","Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs","That\u2019s helpful. And then I guess just a quick follow up on the formulary changes you commented on I think at the Analyst Day. You mentioned that in 2014 you\u2019d save clients about $1 billion. I believe the update today was from 2012 to 2015 it\u2019s 3.5. I guess just maybe if you could isolate the most recent changes and what kind of savings those would generate? And then I guess more broadly and more importantly, how successful have you been in shifting clients to these more restrictive formularies?","Larry J. Merlo","Bob, I mean we\u2019re not going to provide any more granular information in terms of \u2013 to the first part of the your question. I think in terms of the second part, we have been able to manage transition across members as well as physicians in a very seamless fashion, recognize that. The formulary changes that we\u2019re talking about affect a very small percent of our member base. And that has allowed us to do a lot of, I\u2019ll call it seamless transition in terms of making it a nonevent for the patient as well as the physician.","Jonathan C. Roberts","This is Jon. The only thing that I would add is that we expect pharmacy trend, year-over-year growth to the pharmacy spend to grow due to continued AWP inflation, increase in utilization that we just spoke about and the growth in specialty sourcing and clients very open and much more receptive than they had been historically about narrowing formularies. We\u2019re about to about 95 exclusions now. I\u2019ll tell you as we\u2019re making these decisions and these decisions are made through a clinical filter that\u2019s reviewed by our P&T Committee, we are still generating tremendous value for our clients each year and we think there continues to be opportunity particularly in specialty.","Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thanks for the comment.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital","Good morning. I have one question about the frontend and then Eric Percher will have a question. I know you\u2019ve talked about the weakness in traffic in the frontend as a function of people consolidating trips. I was just wondering if you could talk \u2013 and of course your own initiatives, but if you could talk a little bit about what you think is going on both with the consumer, are they in fact pulling back and whether you\u2019ve seen any changes in the competitive environment; anybody responding to weak traffic?","Larry J. Merlo","Meredith, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re seeing any changes in the consumer. I think that the consumer continues to be a cautious purchaser of products. At the same time, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen a change in the competitive environment. We still see an awful lot of promotion across competitors. And we mentioned earlier, we\u2019re continuing to be very disciplined about and quite frankly find that sweet spot. Oftentimes we talk about the art and science in terms of investment spending to drive traffic but to be able to do that in such a way that we\u2019re driving profitable sales.","Helena B. Foulkes","I would just jump in and agree with that, Meredith. I think it\u2019s fairly consistent with what we\u2019ve been talking about in the last couple of calls. Consumers are still be a cautious. Where we really \u2013 our focus is health, beauty and personal care and we continue to be encouraged by our performance in those categories. Clearly, our decision on tobacco drove changes as you look at our share in the general mechanize business, but overall I would say competitors continue to be promoting more than they were last year and more than we are, so we\u2019re watching that carefully. We\u2019re really trying to make smart choices so that at the end of the day we\u2019re driving profitable growth.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital","Great. And Eric, you have a question right.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital","Yes, quickly on Specialty Connect, are most of the lives that are moving over from the pharmacy to PBM open market today, is that primarily who served at the pharmacy? And then the lives that we see in Specialty Connect beyond the movement over, have you begun to see traction in expanding the program or is that over the next several months?","Jonathan C. Roberts","Hi, Eric. So the mix of customers that are moving over is a combination of open and lives that we have. And as we think about growing Specialty Connect, it\u2019s going to be by driving a higher share of open lives which we\u2019ll do through working with physicians and through new client wins as new clients decide to move to us because of all of our integrated capabilities, Specialty Connect which is one of those.","Larry J. Merlo","Eric, the other thing that I think you\u2019ll find interesting, Jon touched on or maybe an analogy of Specialty Connect to Maintenance Choice and what we have seen out of the gate is about 50% of the customers choose to pick up the specialty script at retail which ironically is very consistent with what we saw from Maintenance Choice when we first highlighted the program a few years back.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital","That is interesting. Thank you.","Larry J. Merlo","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley","Hi. Good morning. Can you give us some additional color on the growth at 90-day at retail? And where do you think we are in kind of again that market shift?","Larry J. Merlo","Ricky, we have continued to see accelerated growth at 90 days scripts. I would say it\u2019s growing much faster than the 30-day bucket, if you will. Today it represents about \u2013 I think it\u2019s 29% of our retail prescription pie, if you will.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And when we think about the opportunity as the opportunity for that is kind of like 50% to 60% of scripts you\u2019re presenting kind of like the maintenance script. Is that how we should be thinking about it?","Larry J. Merlo","Yes, I mean I think you have it right in terms of how you\u2019re thinking about the maintenance bucket of scripts versus the acute side and yes, I think it\u2019s reasonable to expect it to continue its growth trajectory as we\u2019ve seen the last couple of years.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then the one follow up on generic inflation. Obviously you\u2019ve done a very good job in mitigating the impact. Can you share with us your expectations for generic inflation for the remainder of the year and any thoughts if this is kind of like sustainable trend that will continue just kind of like longer term?","David M. Denton","Hi, Ricky. This is Dave. We don\u2019t really provide a forecast for generic inflation. I\u2019ll just make on comment just from the nature of the generic marketplace and we\u2019re encouraged obviously with the joint venture that we\u2019ve created with Cardinal but also encouraged that we believe strongly that the generic marketplace is long term a deflationary market and we believe that we\u2019re well positioned to work hard in that marketplace to lower our cost and also lower the cost for our clients and the patients that we serve.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thank you.","Larry J. Merlo","Thanks, Ricky.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So first, wanted some clarity on the PBM operating growth in the third quarter, just remind us what \u2013 it\u2019s quite a bit less than we saw in the second quarter, so I was hoping to just get reminded on why we get some deceleration there?","David M. Denton","Hi, Scott, this is Dave. If you recall back to kind of even to Analyst Day, we fully expected that Q3 was going to be our softest quarter from a growth perspective. So this is very much in line with that expectation. Clearly, the cadence to profitability is tied to really two events is the time to break open generics and when they overlapped LY. And secondly the timing of profitability as we cycle through Medicare Part D. So both of those events are impacting Q3 and consistent as we thought they would impact Q3.","Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research","That\u2019s perfect. And then my second question really goes to I guess thinking about the asset and the asset turns as we move into the future, not next year but as we move out. It seems like CVS Caremark is uniquely positioned to kind of improve their asset turns with the clinics, with Specialty Connect. Can you guys take us out into the future? What will a store, if you really want to call it a store, three to five years look like as we move out? You guys have any thoughts around that. I know it\u2019s kind of a high in the sky question, but I was wondering if you had some thoughts there?","Larry J. Merlo","Scott, I think I\u2019ll start and others may jump in here. But I think you hypothesis is correct. It\u2019s going to evolve from what exist today and we\u2019ve talked a lot about the fixed asset base within the store and the fact that that next prescription has a disproportionate flow through to the bottom line, okay. At the same time, we do see opportunities to extend the pharmacy experience into the front store and I think that Helena has begun some work, some exciting work in terms of the opportunities that that creates. So we\u2019re certainly not in a position where we\u2019ve cracked the code on that or we\u2019re ready to talk to about it other than the fact that I do think that you will see something different in the future from what you see today.","David M. Denton","Scott, this is Dave. I think the most, at least mid-term opportunity we have to improve asset turns, if you will, first is \u2013 one\u2019s kind of the just the growth of the service model to the degree that we grow services in our outlets. We do that without deploying a bunch of capital from an asset perspective. And then secondly, as we talked about many times is we do have opportunities from an inventory perspective and making sure that we maximize I\u2019d say the supply chain across all of our channels will be important to us over the long term.","Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research","All right, guys. Thanks very much for taking my questions.","Larry J. Merlo","Thanks, Scott.","David M. Denton","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill. Please go ahead.","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan","Great. Thank you. Jon, I was wondering if I could just maybe start with some questions around the selling season, 5.4 billion of gross new wins. Can you just talk about what people are buying this year? Are you seeing Maintenance Choice, specialty? Is there anywhere that you can give us some metrics around who those new clients are and what programs they bought for 2015?","Jonathan C. Roberts","Well, Lisa, we\u2019re obviously very happy with this year\u2019s selling season and when you look at the mix of clients, I think it\u2019s very balanced with employer\u2019s health plans and government business. And I can\u2019t really point to really any one program that has moved up in their priority other than specialty, but we now continue to expand our integrated offerings and many of which are unique, such as Maintenance Choice and Specialty Connect, Pharmacy Advisor and MinuteClinic and all those combined resonate. And then when we talk about our ability to be able to touch members and influence their behavior and impact outcomes that results in lower prices to the client, that continues to resonate. And I think \u2013 I\u2019ve probably seen a little more interest in specialty which has become the top priority in the marketplace and I believe our assets are unmatched. We talked about Specialty Connect earlier, but we also have Accordant, which is a rare disease management company that we link to our specialty offering and that treats not just rare specialty disease state, but it treats the comorbidities. And most of these patients have other diseases that they\u2019re dealing with. We\u2019ve talked in the past about NovoLogix have to spend in the medical benefit not really being managed. We have that capability. Home infusion people are very interested in as well, moving people out of expensive hospital settings into their homes or infusion clinics.","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan","I guess really what I\u2019m trying to get at is more on the upside, Jon, as we think about 2015 and things that they\u2019ve signed up for, how does it impact profitability of those clients? So do the majority sign up for your specialty programs? Did you see people that were electing to do Maintenance Choice, I\u2019m trying to get some more of the finance side of it?","Jonathan C. Roberts","I would say it\u2019s pretty consistent with what we\u2019ve seen in prior years. With health plans probably don\u2019t take as many of our programs as employers do. W are seeing more uptake in our formulary strategy than we\u2019ve seen in the past. Maintenance Choice 2.0 we\u2019re beginning to see uptake in the health plans that historically haven\u2019t really emphasized a mail benefit. But I think I would think about it, Lisa, as consistently what we\u2019ve historically say.","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan","Okay, great. Thank you.","Larry J. Merlo","Thanks, Lisa.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Larsen with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","David Larsen - Leerink Partners","Hi. Can you please talk about the joint venture with Cardinal? And I guess there is some new aspects to it, like just on a very high level, what\u2019s sort of the nature of those incremental milestones might be? And I\u2019m assuming that if those milestones are met, it would mean more earnings for all parties involved. Thanks.","Larry J. Merlo","David, good morning. I guess I\u2019ll just start by saying that when we formalized the JV agreement, we had established some guiding principles that spoke to the goals of the entity to reduce cost for our clients, our customers while making the supply chain more efficient and to create win-win opportunities such that there\u2019s equity and fairness in the value that gets created. So obviously over the past six months, we\u2019ve had a lot more time to dig into the data. And it simply made sense to modify the agreement with those guiding principles that I outlined in mind. We\u2019re not going to provide any granularity around some of those milestones but I think we have had a terrific relationship with Cardinal for many years. I think that that\u2019s what led to the JV being created and I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with how the teams from CVS Caremark and Cardinal have come together in the spirit of how do we improve efficiency and drive down costs. And I think we\u2019re off to a terrific start.","David Larsen - Leerink Partners","Great. Thanks a lot.","Larry J. Merlo","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","George Hill - Deutsche Bank","Good morning, Larry and Dave, and thanks for his my question. I just wanted to quick check, I heard one point that you brought up. Did you say you expected long-term generic drugs to be inflationary or deflationary? Part of that broke up on my end.","Larry J. Merlo","I\u2019m sorry, very much deflationary, George.","George Hill - Deutsche Bank","Okay. And then maybe delving into the prepared comments a bit more. It sounds like you're seeing inflation in the small book of the business and then deflation, significant deflation in the rest of the book. And I would ask are you seeing that deflation in acquisition costs? And is that deflation finding its way all the way to kind of the list price or the AWP price from your perspective?","David M. Denton","George, this is Dave, maybe I\u2019ll start. Clearly, what we\u2019re signed up to do is our purpose in life is to work to reduce cost for the clients that we serve and the members that we serve that either use this via mail order or use this in our retail outlets or use this in various and sundry other matters. And so when we look at generic inflation, our focus is to control that and to push down those cost to goods sold at this point in time.","Larry J. Merlo","George, I think as Dave pointed out, overall we see a deflationary nature in the generic environment and we\u2019re really not going to comment on specific products or AWPs.","George Hill - Deutsche Bank","Okay, all right. Then maybe just a quick tack on. From what we hear you guys have been active in significant selling success tacking MinuteClinic onto health plans with the zero co-pay option this selling season. I guess can you talk about expected growth in MinuteClinic as we look out to \u201815?","Larry J. Merlo","I think as we pointed out this morning, we continue to see significant growth. Some of that is organic in terms of the ongoing growth of the existing clinics and some of that is being driving by our expansion. We said earlier we\u2019ll open up on 150 clinics this year. I think it certainly is a discussion in the selling season. I think that kind of the ticket to the game metrics are being right on price and service, but we\u2019ve got a lot of other elements with which we can offer clients the MinuteClinic option being one and one that it\u2019s getting a lot of attention.","George Hill - Deutsche Bank","All right, I appreciate the color. Thank you.","Larry J. Merlo","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with ISI Group. Please go ahead.","Ross Muken - ISI Group","Good morning, guys, and congrats. If we look at sort of the pacing of wins in the selling season, one of your competitors was sort of suggesting that as it sort of tailed off and then as we look into the out-year, the sort of momentum of their peers inclusive of you was sort of waning. If we looked at like your hit rate \u2013 your win rate over the course of the selling season, was it fairly consistent? Did you feel like you gained momentum as you put up some of these big wins? It seems like more recently we've seen a number of public names of size. I'm just trying to get a sense for kind of tone and how you feel like the business had momentum through the most recent RPs you been in?","Jonathan C. Roberts","Ross, so I would say we\u2019re continuing to win in the marketplace. I think this year has been particularly good and I think it has a lot to do with everything I was talking about to Lisa with our integrated assets, our ability to deliver cost has a lot to do with what we do with generics and our formulary strategy and the fact that we focus on service to both our clients and their members. So, they like our story and we\u2019re very happy with the wins that we\u2019ve had this year.","Ross Muken - ISI Group","And maybe Dave, M&A activity has kind of picked up. You guys have obviously been quite selective and strategic the last few years. As you look at sort of the environment, both in assets here and maybe also abroad, how would you kind of characterize the pipeline and your sort of intent to maybe deploy a little bit more of the balance sheet? Obviously, you've done a great job on returning free cash but you've also been historically pretty prudent on the tuck-in side.","David M. Denton","Yes, Ross, obviously M&A has been part of our DNA for a long time in our company. We\u2019ve been very clear that as we think about capital deployment, one area to deploy capital is in kind of investing backward in organically in our business and we will continue to do that. I would say that at the same time, we\u2019re going to be to your point very disciplined in how we approach the market. If you look at our asset base today, we don\u2019t have any glaring gaps or holes in capabilities at this point in time. But as we said, to a degree that we can bolt-on assets that make sense that we have line of sight to both synergies and returns, we\u2019ll do that. And I think that the market is still active in that perspective.","Ross Muken - ISI Group","Great. And congrats again guys.","Larry J. Merlo","Thanks, Ross.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with UBS. Please go ahead.","Steven Valiquette - UBS","Thanks. Good morning. So just one other quick one on the PBM selling season success that you've had, I'm just curious with it now 70% complete, can you draw any sort of conclusion that the decision to stop the retail tobacco sales may have helped you win some PBM business? I'm curious whether this has come up frequently in RFPs and investment (indiscernible) and has anybody cited that they chose you specifically because of that decision, just curious on that? Thanks.","Larry J. Merlo","Steve, I think it\u2019s hard to point any one win and attribute to the tobacco decision. I can tell you that it\u2019s had a lot of discussion with our clients. Obviously recognizing our clients and the fact that they\u2019re working hard to get their members or their employees to stop smoking, they have applauded our decision. Listen, I think it\u2019s one of those intangibles that again back to my earlier point about you got to be right on the basics and then once you\u2019re right on the basics there, I think we have a lot of intangibles that collectively I think become something very meaningful in the client\u2019s eyes.","Steven Valiquette - UBS","Okay. Just one other quick one on the formulary restrictions; pretty topical this week, but it seems a couple years ago this caused a little bit of negative PR for CVS back in 2011, 2012. But now it seems like these changes are helping you or at least the negativity seems almost nonexistent now. So I guess I'm just curious, any thoughts or color you may have on why the psychology may have changed a little bit among your customers on the better receptivity to formulary changes now, let's say, versus a few years ago?","Larry J. Merlo","Steve, it\u2019s a great question. I think if we rewind three of four years, I think what we learned with that decision was the strategy was right. And I remember talking \u2013 as we talked to clients back in late 2011 or early '12, the issue that they had that created the negatively was from an execution largely the timing of the communication, that\u2019s where we were out of sync. We weren\u2019t lined up with their benefit cycle. So I think once we made that course correction, which was an easy one to fix, I think that all the noise subsided.","Steven Valiquette - UBS","Okay, that's great. Thanks.","Larry J. Merlo","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Peter Costa - Wells Fargo Securities","Hi. Thanks, guys. Appreciate all the discussion about 2015. But moving back to the tobacco decision, is your view that it's still going to be about 2 billion in annualized sales that would be impacted by that decision or has that number changed given the fact you talked about sort of a double the 400 to 500 basis point impact on same-store for the fourth quarter?","Helena B. Foulkes","Yes, we\u2019re still tracking very much towards that $2 billion. The results we\u2019re seeing are in line with what we expected and we said early on it would have a $0.06 to $0.09 impact this year and we\u2019re tracking towards that.","Peter Costa - Wells Fargo Securities","And in terms of the impact on the same-store in the fourth quarter? That seems like that would be a bigger number.","David M. Denton","If you just look at what we communicated, we said that in the third quarter that the exit of the tobacco category would be somewhere between 400 and 500 basis points to front store comp impact, negatively impact. And that rate would essentially double as we cycle into Q4. And so that\u2019s essentially how you should think about modeling the progression of that.","Larry J. Merlo","And keep in mind that the $2 billion reflected tobacco sales, companion items within that basket and that is a full year revenue number.","Peter Costa - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. Thank you.","Larry J. Merlo","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Robert Willoughby - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just one left. Do you have any guess or forecast in terms of what your share of the Caremark accounts could be by year end?","Larry J. Merlo","You mean dispensing share within CVS pharmacy?","Robert Willoughby - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, CVS market share with Caremark plans. It was at 31% at the end of last year. Where does that trend to?","Larry J. Merlo","Yes, we don\u2019t forecast that and disclose that.","Robert Willoughby - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Would it be something you\u2019d give us at the end of the year at the Investor Day?","Larry J. Merlo","Typically it\u2019s something that we discuss at Investor Day, yes.","Robert Willoughby - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Larry J. Merlo","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company","Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Actually, I have another question on the exclusion lists. It seems like this time around from what I've read is you've kind of adopted more of also using prior authorization versus outright exclusion. Just curious on how you kind of make that decision? And then secondly, how do you manage for drugs that you exclude where companies \u2013 where the manufacturers then try to work around that? How do you communicate with your clients and how do you stop to make sure that your plans don't really \u2013 that you don't end up actually paying for that or your employers?","Jonathan C. Roberts","Yes. So, Charles, as far as manufacturers working around it, I think that\u2019s the beauty of the exclusion program. They used to try to work around our formulary tiering through co-pay coupons. So once the drug is excluded, the member will have to pay 100% so it would be hard for a manufacturer to work around that. Our strategy around excluding has really not changed. We\u2019ve always had prior authorizations. We do have the ability if a physician feels like a particular drug has a medical necessity that they have the ability to get to that drug, but it\u2019s a very, very small percent of patients that have physicians that want to get them on a particular drug. So it\u2019s really a safety outlook for them.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company","Great. And then just a follow up just on that in general. It seems like this is an area that not only yourself but some of your competitors are starting to really adopt more aggressively. Do you see that this is the next big tool for you to use and to really help manage costs down? So how do you see these lists expanding over time? Is this a big opportunity for you?","Jonathan C. Roberts","Well, we have the template exclusion that we\u2019ve been talking about but we also have more aggressive formularies that clients can opt into. So the next step up excludes 170 drugs and then there\u2019s another step that excludes 300 drugs which essentially is all generics. So we do see as we move into the out years, we\u2019re going to be moving towards some of the more restrictive formularies that we think clients are going to be very interested in. So there\u2019s a lot more work and a lot more runway here.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company","Great. Thank you.","Larry J. Merlo","Okay. We\u2019ll take two more questions please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Wiltamuth with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Mark Wiltamuth - Jefferies","Hi. Could you give us what the specialty growth was organically excluding acquisitions?","Larry J. Merlo","I don\u2019t think we have that, Mark. We can\u2026","David M. Denton","Hi, Mark. This is Dave. I don\u2019t know that we really had any significant acquisitions in that number. Most of that is of [Coram] (ph).","Mark Wiltamuth - Jefferies","But Coram is in there, right?","David M. Denton","Other than that.","Mark Wiltamuth - Jefferies","Okay.","David M. Denton","I don\u2019t know that off the top of my head. The growth rate is still organically significant.","Mark Wiltamuth - Jefferies","Okay. And then maybe just give us on the generics a little timing on how you look at the break open market for generics here in the next 12 months or so? Maybe by quarter, where you think we\u2019ll get some better opportunities on generic margins?","David M. Denton","Yes. This is Dave, maybe I\u2019ll touch that. I just want to say that the generic launch and break open schedules, if you kind of watch the market, those launch dates continue to evolve a bit. Some move out, some move in even since what we talked about at Analyst Day. And if you look at it, many of the '14 launches have been in flux. As we look into '15 I think some of the break open generics will look a little bit lower than we originally planned when we look back at Analyst Day in December of last year. But I would say it\u2019s still very fluid at this point in time. We\u2019ll continue to kind of assess the situation and give you updates as it becomes pertinent.","Mark Wiltamuth - Jefferies","And second half of '14 versus the first half of '14, better or worse for generics?","David M. Denton","You got to think about how we cycle to LY, so if you look at the cycle of our back half for this year to back half of last year is a little worse.","Mark Wiltamuth - Jefferies","Okay. Thank you very much.","Larry J. Merlo","Okay. Last question.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets","Good morning. I was hoping to get a little bit more color on the PDP (indiscernible) for the balance of the year, is there any chance that there might be conservatism in the assumptions about the auto-assignees or the choosers you're taking? And basically give us a longer term view how you see next year playing out as well? Thanks.","David M. Denton","Hi, Frank. This is Dave, maybe I\u2019ll start here. I think if you look just from a PDP perspective the number of lives, the real I guess opportunity to gain lives is early in the year. So I think if you look to the balance of the year, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a material change or opportunity that presents itself in the marketplace. As we cycle into '15, I think we\u2019re encouraged by what we heard from a benchmark perspective. I think that although that\u2019s what we\u2019ve heard, we don\u2019t really know what the opportunities are at this point in time. I think we have a very attractive product as we cycle into '15, but as far as the auto-assignees we\u2019ll need to understand more fully how the market will evolve and we won\u2019t know that for several more months yet.","Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets","Thank you.","Larry J. Merlo","Okay. And just limping back on Mark\u2019s question on specialty, in our remarks we said specialty growth was 53%. If you back Coram out of that number, the growth was around 40%, so just bringing closure to that.","So with that, let me thank everyone. I know this was a bit of a long call, but a lot of information and thanks for your continued interest in CVS Caremark.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference for today.

Welcome to the Third Quarter CVS Caremark Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Tuesday, November 6, 2012. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Nancy Christal, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Nancy Christal","Thank you, Silvanna. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. I'm here with Larry Merlo, President and CEO, who will provide a business update; and Dave Denton, Executive Vice President and CFO, who will review our financials. Per Lofberg, Executive Vice President of CVS Caremark; Jon Roberts, President of Caremark; and Mark Cosby, President of CVS\/pharmacy, are also with us today and will participate in the question and answer session following our prepared remarks.","[Operator Instructions] I have a couple of quick reminders today. First, we'll host our 2012 Analyst Day on the morning of Thursday, December 13 in New York City. At that time, we'll provide 2013 guidance, as well as a comprehensive update on our growth strategy. In addition to Larry, Dave, Per, Jon and Mark, you'll also have the opportunity to hear from Dr. Troy Brennan, our Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer; and Dr. Andy Sussman, our President of MinuteClinic and Associate Chief Medical Officer. If you haven't received an invitation and would like to attend, please contact my office. Expect a big crowd, and look forward to seeing many of you there. For those of you who can't attend in person, the meeting will, of course, be webcast.","Second, we posted a slide presentation on our website this morning, which summarizes the information on this call, as well as key facts and figures around our operating performance and guidance. I recommend that you take a look at the slides. Additionally, please note that we plan to file our Form 10-Q before the close of business today, and it will be available through our website at that time.","During this call, we'll discuss some non-GAAP financial measures in talking about our company\u2019s performance, namely free cash flow, EBITDA and adjusted EPS. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find the definitions of the non-GAAP items I mentioned, as well as the reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, on the Investor Relations portion of our website. And as always, today's call is being simulcast on our website, and it will be archived there following the call for 1 year.","Now before we continue, our attorneys have asked me to read the Safe Harbor statement. During this presentation, we'll make certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Accordingly, for these forward-looking statements, we claim the protection of the Safe Harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We strongly recommend that you become familiar with the specific risks and uncertainties that are described in the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and that you review the section entitled Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements in our most recently filed quarterly report on Form 10-Q.","And now I'll turn this over to Larry Merlo.","Larry J. Merlo","Okay, thank you, Nancy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. As Nancy said, we have our Analyst Day coming up next month. So our business update this morning will be a bit more compact than what you typically hear on our quarterly call.","Now that said, we're very pleased with the strong third quarter results we announced today. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.85. That's up 21% from the same quarter last year and $0.02 above the high end of our guidance. Results were strong across the enterprise. Operating profit in our Retail segment was up 16.1%, within the expected range, while operating profit in our PBM was up 19.4%, well ahead of our expectations.","Now in addition to posting strong third quarter results, we're raising and narrowing our guidance for the full year. We now expect to achieve adjusted EPS for 2012 in the range of $3.38 to $3.41. That's up from our previous range of $3.32 to $3.38. Our revised guidance reflects the overperformance in the third quarter along with the anticipated $0.01 per share benefit from the accelerated share repurchase program announced in September.","Additionally, it reflects our optimism about exceeding our initial goal related to the Walgreens-Express dispute. For year end, we now expect to retain at least 60% of the scripts we picked up during the impasse. So obviously, we're very pleased with the continued upward trend in our expectations. And Dave will provide the details of our third quarter results, as well as guidance for the fourth quarter during his financial review.","Now before we get to that, let me provide a brief business update, and I'll begin with our PBM. Now since our last call, we continued to make good progress on the 2013 selling season. Now with about 75% of our client renewals completed to date, our retention rate stands at 96%. As for new business, the numbers haven't changed materially from the second quarter update, and we'll provide a detailed review of the '13 selling season on Analyst Day. And by then we will also be able to provide a good estimate of the net effect of the Medicare Part D selling season, which includes the assignment of low-income subsidy lives along with the results of the open enrollment period, which ends on December 7.","And as we noted on our last earnings call, we qualified in 30 of the 33 regions that we participate in today. Now during the selling season, we continued to demonstrate superior value with our differentiated offerings, which continue to gain traction with existing clients, as well as help us attract new ones. So let me briefly review the progress on our 2 unique integration sweet-spot programs, Maintenance Choice and Pharmacy Advisor.","We now have approximately 14.5 million lives covered by 1,040 plans that have implemented or committed to implement our Maintenance Choice offerings through Q1 of '13. Now that number is up from 10.7 million lives at our last quarterly update, and it includes plans that have adopted our new 2.0 offering.","We continue to see more of our new clients adopting one of our Maintenance Choice offerings right out of the gate, and we believe that the rollout of 2.0 will ultimately improve adoption into the Maintenance Choice program once payors and their members begin to experience some of the savings and benefits of the program. And as we've discussed in the past, Pharmacy Advisor capitalizes on our integrated assets to lower health care costs and improve the health of those we serve. We currently have over 900 clients representing 16.3 million lives enrolled in the diabetes program and just under 600 clients with 11 million lives enrolled in the cardiovascular program. Now we expect to offer 5 more Pharmacy Advisor programs for additional chronic diseases in 2013, and we're also excited to announce the launch of Pharmacy Advisor to Medicare clients beginning next year.","Now let me touch on a few of our key growth drivers. Most notably, our Specialty Pharmacy business continued to achieve significant growth with revenues increasing a very strong 34% year-over-year. This Specialty growth was driven by new PBM clients, new product launches along with drug price inflation.","Just a quick update on Aetna. The client migration onto our platform is accelerating and it's proceeding very nicely. We have successfully transitioned multiple waves of Aetna clients, and we have further migration scheduled for the remainder of this year and into 2013.","And then as for our streamlining initiative, we remain on track to deliver over $1 billion of cumulative cost savings through 2015. Now we expect to hit the full run rate of annual savings, $225 million to $275 million, beginning in '14. And as we've talked in the past, this initiative is streamlining PBM operations to improve productivity, rationalizing capacity and consolidating our adjudication platforms to 1 destination platform with enhanced capabilities. We just launched our final migration wave for 2012, and we anticipate that approximately 2\/3 of our clients will be on that destination platform by the end of this year.","Let me now turn to the Retail business. In the third quarter, our same-store sales increased 4.3%. Pharmacy comps increased 5.3% in the quarter with front store comps increasing 2.2%. Now Pharmacy comps were negatively impacted by more than 900 basis points from the rapidly growing impact of generics, and that's up from about 500 basis points in the second quarter, and it's expected to grow to more than 1,000 basis points in Q4.","Script comps increased 11.1% on a 30-day supply basis, 8.7% when counting 90-day supplies as 1 script. Our script growth reflects healthy underlying growth across all major drug classes, as well as an increase in new related scripts. And the key drivers of improved script growth trends across the industry include an uptick in physician visits, we're seeing accelerating growth in Medicare Part D, along with improved adherence to maintenance medications driven by the greater use of generics.","Our strong script growth also reflects a significant benefit from the Walgreens-Express dispute. Now similar to last quarter, we estimate that the impasse added 400 to 430 basis points to our script comp in the third quarter, equating to about 6.5 million to 7 million scripts. Now we had expected a $0.05 per share benefit in the third and fourth quarters combined. And in Q3, we realized about a $0.035 benefit.","Now we have been tracking ahead of our retention expectations in the 7 weeks since Walgreens reentered the broadest Express Scripts network. So in the fourth quarter, we now expect at least another $0.025 benefit. And the new estimate assumes that we retain, as I mentioned earlier, at least 60% of the prescription volumes gained from the dispute in Q4, and that's up from our previous estimate of at least 50%. And again these estimates are net of the projected investments we are making to maximize retention, and we will certainly share more specifics with you at our Analyst Day as it relates to the 2013 outlook.","Now as for the front store business, both customer traffic and average front store ticket increased in the quarter. We estimate that the Walgreens-Express impasse positively impacted our front store comp by about 150 basis points in the quarter. Now we also saw strength in allergy, as well as flu-related sales in the front end. I think it's important to note that the latest data shows that CVS has gained front store share versus a year ago. And when compared to drug and multi-outlet competitors, our market share growth in the quarter was 103 and 6 basis points, respectively.","Now our ExtraCare loyalty program continues to be a key differentiator. And with 15 years of history, 70 million active cardholders, we have a significant lead on our competitors, and we deliver value to our customers every time they shop. Year-to-date, our ExtraCare members have received $2.7 billion, that's billion with a B, in value from savings and ExtraBucks rewards. And we have opportunities to make it even better. For example, we're enhancing our digital capabilities to improve the in-store, online and mobile experiences for our customers. And our digital strategy that's powered by the personalization of ExtraCare gives us a tremendous opportunity to bring truly customized communications and offers to our customers.","And while we don't believe our loyalty program is a customer acquisition tool, it is an excellent customer retention tool. And approximately 85% of our new, high-value Express Scripts customers have enrolled in ExtraCare, adding to our confidence in the retention estimates. As for our real estate program, we opened 63 new or relocated stores, closing 3. That resulted in 42 net new stores in the quarter, and we remain on track to increase our retail square footage by approximately 2% to 3% for the year.","Let me touch briefly on MinuteClinic. MinuteClinic continued its strong growth trajectory with revenues increasing 43% versus the third quarter last year. Now we opened 25 net new clinics ending the quarter with 609 clinics in 25 states and the District of Columbia.","Now building on our record for clinical quality, MinuteClinic was reaccredited by the Joint Commission, that's the independent certifying body for more than 19,000 health care organizations across the country. In addition, we continue to enhance MinuteClinic's role as a health care collaborator, adding 2 new affiliations, the UCLA Health System and the Oklahoma University Physicians, bringing us to 20 health system affiliations. And Andy Sussman will speak more about all of this on Analyst Day.","Now before I turn it over to Dave, I do want to touch on the estimated impact on our business from Hurricane Sandy. At the peak of the storm, more than 1,100 stores in the affected areas were closed, all but 20 have since reopened and about 15 stores have suffered extensive damage. And we do not have dates as to when they will reopen at this point in time.","All things considered, we're estimating a potential $0.01 per share negative impact to our EPS in the fourth quarter from Sandy, which is contemplated in the low end of the guidance range that Dave will provide for Q4. Now I also want to acknowledge those on this call that are probably still dealing with the aftermath. We certainly appreciate your time today and hope that your life is returning to normal. And I also want to thank our colleagues across the company, who have done extraordinary things to get our stores operational, in addition to helping the communities most affected.","So with that, let me turn it over to Dave for the financial review.","David M. Denton","Thank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will lead you through a quick review of our third quarter results. I'll also finish up with a look at our guidance for the full year of 2012, as well as our guidance for the fourth quarter specifically.","I'll start with a summary of how we're using our strong free cash flow to return value to our shareholders. In September, we announced that our board authorized another $6 billion of share repurchases. We quickly commenced an accelerated share repurchase program that completed our prior authorization and utilized $1 billion of this new authorization. And between open market repurchases on our prior authorization and the ASR, we repurchased a total of 30.1 million shares for approximately $2 billion in the third quarter at an average cost of $45.69 per share.","Additionally, we paid approximately $207 million in dividends. We still anticipate a payout ratio of approximately 21% this year and are on track to achieve our targeted payout ratio of 25% to 30% by 2015. So between dividends and share repurchases, we've returned more than $2.2 billion to our shareholders just in the third quarter alone. Our expectation is that between dividends and share repurchases, we will return more than $4.8 billion to our shareholders throughout 2012. Going forward, we expect to continue to generate very substantial free cash flow, and our disciplined approach to capital allocation will remain a vital component of our efforts to drive shareholder value.","We generated $4.1 billion of free cash flow year-to-date and $854 million in the third quarter, down about $650 million from the same period a year ago. As expected, this was driven by the timing of payments from CMS associated with our Medicare Part D business. We essentially benefited from an earlier payment in Q3 of last year, which did not recur this year, the impact of which was about $1 billion favorable in 2011. And now this does not affect the yearly cash flow, and we're well on track to reach our free cash flow target range for the year of $4.6 billion to $4.9 billion.","Inventory days within the Retail segment have improved by more than 3 days from the end of last year. Combined with gains in DPO and DSO, we have reduced our Retail cash cycle by nearly 5 days thus far this year. As we continue to make process improvements, the Retail team remains committed to its inventory reduction target of $500 million for the full year. And working capital improvements such as these are expected to continue to enhance our cash generation capabilities.","We had a fair amount of sale leaseback activity in the third quarter with net proceeds of $427 million. With gross capital expenditures of $496 million, net capital expenditures were $69 million for the quarter. As for the income statement, adjusted EPS and GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations came in $0.02 above the high end of our guidance at $0.85 per share and $0.79 per share, respectively. The EPS beat was driven primarily by the overperformance in the PBM, and I'll address that in a moment.","But first, let me quickly walk down the P&L. On a consolidated basis, revenues in the third quarter increased more than 13% to $30.2 billion. Within the segments, net revenues increased 22% in the PBM to $18.1 billion. The majority of growth over last year was driven by the significant number of new client starts along with increased volumes in Medicare Part D. The Medicare Part D growth was driven by both previous acquisitions and members gained in 2012. Additionally, PBM revenue growth was driven by drug price inflation, particularly in our Specialty business.","Partially offsetting these factors was the increase in the generic dispensing rate, which climbed 500 basis points higher in the quarter versus the same quarter of LY. In our Retail business, revenues increased 5.5% in the quarter to $15.5 billion. This growth was driven by our 4.3% same-store sales increase, as well as growth from new stores, relocations and MinuteClinic.","Turning to gross margin. We reported 18.7% for the consolidated company in the quarter, a contraction of approximately 75 basis points compared to Q3 of '11. As with prior quarters, the decline is mainly a mix issue given that the PBM revenue growth outpaced Retail growth. As you know, the PBM business has lower gross margins than Retail, hence the decline at the enterprise level. Within the PBM segment, gross profit dollars increased 18.3% year-over-year. The increase was considerably better than expected due to favorable GDR performance, as well as rebates. Gross profit margin was down approximately 20 basis points versus last year's third quarter. The positive effect of the 500 basis points increase in the PBM's generic dispensing rate was more than offset by price compression and changes within the PBM mix of business.","Gross margin in the Retail segment was 30.1%, up approximately 85 basis points over LY. This improvement was driven primarily by the 420 basis point increase in Retail GDR. That benefit was partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressures.","Total operating expenses as a percent of revenue improved by approximately 80 basis points versus the third quarter of '11. The PBM segment's SG&A rate improved approximately 10 basis points to 1.6%. This was primarily driven by strong revenue growth, as well as improvements derived from the streamlining effort. In the Retail segment, SG&A as a percent of sales was essentially flat to last year at 21.7% while expenses grew by 5.8%.","Within the Corporate segment, expenses were up approximately $15 million to $169 million in the quarter. So at the enterprise level, operating margin for the total enterprise was roughly flat, improving by approximately 5 basis points to 6%. Operating margin in the PBM was 4.3%, down only 10 basis points, while operating margin at Retail was 8.4%, up about 75 basis points.","Retail operating profit increased a very healthy 16.1% within our guidance range. PBM operating profit exceeded our expectations, increasing 19.4%. That was driven by outperformance in gross profit. And as I noted earlier, that was a result of better generic utilization and rebate performance.","Going below the line on the consolidated income statement. Net interest expense in the quarter declined approximately $21 million from last year to $134 million. Additionally, our effective income tax rate was 39.8%, higher than expected primarily due to an increase in reserves for state income taxes. Our weighted average share count was 1.27 billion shares, approximately 5 million shares lower than anticipated due to the commencement of the ASR in September, which had no material impact on our earnings for the quarter.","Now let me turn to our 2012 guidance, which we both raised and narrowed this morning. We currently expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share of $3.38 to $3.41 and GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $3.15 to $3.18 per share. This equates to growth of approximately 21% to 22%.","Our revised guidance reflects our strong performance throughout the first 9 months of this year, as well as our confidence in our outlook. Embedded in this guidance are share repurchases totaling $4 billion for the year. This includes the $0.01 per share accretive impact of the $1.2 billion accelerated share repurchase we announced in September. It also reflects our optimism about retaining in the fourth quarter at least 60% of the scripts we picked up during the Walgreen-Express Scripts impasse. Furthermore, the low end of our guidance contemplates a $0.01 per share negative impact to our EPS in the fourth quarter from Sandy. This includes storm damage, as well as any business interruption related to the significant storm.","Now let me walk you through the fourth quarter. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.08 per share to $1.11 per share, reflecting growth of approximately 21% to 24% from the $0.89 we reported last year. GAAP EPS from continuing operation is expected to be in a range of $1.02 to $1.05 per share. Keep in mind that due to the significant amount of repurchase activity in the last 4 months of the year and its effect on our weighted average share count, the sum of our reported quarterly EPS results is not expected to add up to our reported full year EPS.","As it stands right now, the year should be about $0.01 less than the sum of the quarters. This is simply mathematical rounding. So please take that into account when modeling your expectations.","We expect the PBM segment's operating profit to increase 38% to 41% in the fourth quarter. As expected, we are benefiting from a normal progression of increasing profitability as we move through the year in our Medicare Part D business. In addition, this strong growth expectation reflects the improvements in the net impact of the streamlining cost and benefits, as well as the positive impact of generics on our results.","We expect the Retail segment's operating profit to increase 6% to 8% in the fourth quarter. This growth is expected to be driven by solid performance in the underlying business. This includes the positive impact of new generics, as well as a strong start to the cough and cold business. It's also driven by the combined benefits -- the continued benefit we expect from the Walgreens-Express impasse.","For the PBM segment, we expect revenues to increase 15.5% to 16.5% in the fourth quarter. For the Retail segment, we expect revenue to increase 3% to 4%, same-store sales to increase 2% to 3%, and same-store scripts to increase 7% to 8% in the fourth quarter.","As a result, for the total enterprise in the quarter, we expect revenues to be up approximately 9.25% to 10.25% from 2011 levels. This is after intercompany eliminations, which are projected to equal about 9.75% of the combined segment revenues.  For the total company, gross profit margins are expected to be notably up from last year's fourth quarter as both the Retail and the PBM segments will experience expansion. Expectations are that gross margin in the Retail segment will be significantly up due to the substantial amount of new generics that have been introduced throughout the year while gross margin in the PBM segment will be notably up, also mostly due to new generics, partially offset by some price compression. For the total company, operating expenses are expected to be approximately 13% of consolidated revenues in the fourth quarter. The PBM should show modest improvement as we reap the benefits from streamlining.","As I noted on the second quarter call, Retail expense leverage should deteriorate significantly due to the impact of generics, the fact that we are comparing against disproportionately lower spending in Q4 of last year and the investments we're making in the business to drive longer-term performance. And we expect operating expenses in the Corporate segment to be approximately $180 million.","As a result, we expect operating margin for the total company in the quarter to be moderately up from last year's fourth quarter. We expect net interest expense of between $135 million and $140 million and a tax rate of approximately 38.6% in the fourth quarter. We anticipate that we'll have approximately 1.26 billion weighted average shares for the quarter, which would imply approximately 1.28 billion for the full year. In the fourth quarter, we expect total consolidated amortization to be approximately $120 million. Combined with estimated depreciation, we still project approximately $1.7 billion in D&A for the full year of '12.","As for capital spending for the year, we continue to expect net capital expenditures of between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion with proceeds from sale leasebacks of between $500 million and $600 million. We expect to generate cash flow from operations in the range of $6.2 billion to $6.4 billion for the year and free cash flow in the range of $4.6 billion to $4.9 billion.","As we've demonstrated throughout this year, we are keenly focused on enhancing our cash flow through solid working capital and capital expenditure discipline. The working capital improvements we've achieved and continue to drive, specifically within inventory, will continue to drive our free cash flow performance, building upon our strong year-to-date results. Again, we are focused on using our strong free cash flow to drive shareholder value now and as well into the future.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to Larry.","Larry J. Merlo","Okay. Thanks, Dave. As I said, we're certainly very pleased with our strong enterprise-wide results this quarter. And before we open it up for your questions, I just want to briefly acknowledge that with Election Day finally here, today's outcome will certainly have an impact on the direction of health care over the next several years. And that said, I believe that our business is well positioned regardless of the outcome of today's election. But we certainly know the issues around cost, quality and access facing our nation's health care system. And we are confident in our ability to provide innovative solutions to help address them however health care reform takes shape, and we'll certainly talk a lot more about that on Analyst Day.","So with that, we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig with Citi.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","If we look at the news on Monday from one of your competitors and from last night, both your pharmacy and PBM seemed to really be outperforming. What does that tell you about the competitive landscape at this point in the game?","Larry J. Merlo","Well, Deb, I think it's reflecting many of the things that we've been talking about that we believe are differentiators in our business. And whether it's the retention that we're seeing from the Walgreens-Express customers, as well as some of the programs that we have that are improving medication adherence. And we do have some favorable industry trends driving pharmacy performance as well. And we talked about physician visits being up over the past 6 months, as well as Med D scripts being up. We think that, that is being driven by more generics in the market making prescriptions more affordable, as well as seniors beginning to get some relief from the doughnut hole. And I think we also mentioned that we are seeing an uptick in flu-related prescriptions. But we're very happy with our performance. And we see again the programs that we have in the market making a meaningful difference.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","With such a unique positioning in the competitive landscape and as you continue to do more from a digital perspective, how do you think that you can continue to enhance your relationship with your customer?","Larry J. Merlo","Well, Deb, as we've often talked about, I'll kick it off, and then flip it over to Mark to provide some -- a few examples. But being in the loyalty card business for more than 15 years and having 70 million active cardholders, we have learned an awful lot from our customers about what they value, how they shop and how we can help to improve that experience. And I'll flip it over to Mark, and he can add some color to that.","Mark S. Cosby","Our loyalty program and personalization is a huge piece of our past. It's also a big part of our future. As Larry said, we do have the most successful and largest program in the country. 300 million cards issued, 70 million active, 15-year history. During that time, 6 billion personalized message delivered. So we know what our customers want, and we know how to deliver it. And we become smarter every year with how to drive those results across time. And one unique feature of the card is that we do deliver value every time that a customer purchases with us, and that has led to over $2.7 billion of savings for our customers this year. So we've rolled out a bunch of initiatives over the course of the last year, and we will continue to do so. The 2 biggest innovations around the loyalty campaign are our Beauty Club and our digital program. On the beauty front, this is the second year of the program, 10 million active members. They spend $50, they get $5 back. And it's a big contributor to why our beauty share is up over the course of the last year. And to your question, the other big piece that's happened within our loyalty program is a lot of innovation around digital. We've launched this past year a search to send card, where rewards are sent directly to the cards versus customers needing to use paper. We have a new digital application that allows our customers to scan the ExtraCare card, and they can use that as opposed to bringing their card around with them. We've done quite a bit around our circular to try to make that more personalized. So we can now deliver messages to customers, personalized to their spending history and to their spending future. So we have a comprehensive mobile strategy that we've developed, and we'll talk more about that when we get to the analyst meeting, as well as a number of personalization features that we feel very strong about coming into the future. So a very strong and successful loyalty program, big focus for our future. And game plan is to maintain our competitive advantage both on the digital front, as well as on the loyalty front in the coming years.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And I'll throw one quick one out there. I didn't know if it was also helping with the retention of the Walgreens customers, if there's anything you guys were doing in terms of medication adherence from a digital perspective, if that was helping as well.","Larry J. Merlo","Well, Deb, as we've talked, we've been able to enroll about 85% of the new customers that we've seen as a result of the impasse in ExtraCare. That allows us again, as Mark mentioned, to communicate in a very personalized fashion. And we're beginning to explore some of the opportunities around Refill Reminders digitally.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just had a couple of questions around -- on the PBM side around the selling season. I know you're going to give a lot more detail in December. But Per, Larry, Jon, if someone can maybe talk about what are the trends that you're seeing. It sounds to me like retention was very strong this year, that perhaps as you went in, you renewed clients, you were upselling them to Maintenance Choice, given the Maintenance Choice numbers you're talking about. Can you talk about what you saw around narrow networks? And also what are you seeing around group member attrition as we start to move forward? Do you see that plans are trying to make decisions as they think about 2014 in anticipation of the Affordable Care Act?","Jonathan C. Roberts","Lisa, this is Jon. So in the selling season, which it was an active selling season, we saw our fees up 7% over last year, we saw a lot of interest in low-cost channels and a lot of interest in low-cost products. So low-cost channels being mail service, Maintenance Choice and limited networks. With mail choice, Larry talked about 2013 and what we're going to expect to see from a growth. And that's a reflection of our Maintenance Choice 2.0 combined with our traditional Maintenance Choice. And we'll give more details about that as we get to Analyst Day. So as far as what's happening with group members, we really haven't seen a lot of activity there. And what we have seen is companies moving their retirees into EGWP, so we're seeing activity there. But they're essentially moving their entire block of retirees into EGWP plans, which we provide all the capabilities to service them. So all in all, a successful selling season. Haven't seen much of a change in the dynamics, but we have seen a lot of interest in our programs and a lot of adoption of our programs right out of the gate.","Per G. H. Lofberg","And Lisa, you asked about 2014, and it's obviously very early. Like most forecasts, I mean, we fully expect that there would be employers, probably mid-sized and small employers, who will begin to phase out their benefit programs and move people into exchanges where they will shop for individual coverage. And we're gearing up to deal with that transition, although I think it will probably be at least another year or so before we'll see any real activity in that area.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So you're not seeing any activity today, Per, in 2013, where you're seeing people start to move individuals away from providing benefits in 2013 in anticipation that they're going to be able to picked up in '14? So is it right to characterize that 2013 should still be a pretty status quo year around membership utilization and that the real opportunity for CVS Caremark is the fact that you've been able to move people into programs that are beneficial to them but also more beneficial to you from an earnings perspective, whether it's Maintenance Choice, narrow networks, getting more people into a CVS store? Is that the right way to characterize it?","Per G. H. Lofberg","Yes, I think the EGWP trend that Jon spoke about will probably, in all likelihood, continue into 2013 and beyond. But the exit of small and mid-sized employers from providing health coverage is probably a little further out than that.","Larry J. Merlo","And Lisa, as far as the economic climate, this is not a new issue, okay? As we all know, we've been dealing with this for a couple of years now in terms of a challenging economic environment. And as we move into '13, we don't see that environment changing materially from today, either getting better or getting worse.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","So Larry, if you look at some of the unique engagement initiatives you guys have, can you maybe give us a little color in terms of the degree to which you're raising compliance and the degree to which you are lowering the run rate in medical costs, just generally speaking? And at what point does that become, if it becomes a game changer, in being able to win new contracts that are out there? Or do you think it doesn't become a game changer for a while?","Larry J. Merlo","Yes, John, it's a great question. And we'll provide -- we'll go into a fair amount of detail on this at Analyst Day, and we'll actually quantify some of the benefits that we're seeing in terms of improving the medication possession ratio. I think we are beginning to see some of the step changes in terms of the importance. If you think about the Star ratings around some of the Medicare programs, that, prescription adherence and some of the clinical outcomes that we're working on and talking about make up a big portion of the evaluation of those Star ratings. So I think it is beginning to happen as we speak. I don't think it's years away. I think it's here today, and it will only grow from here.","Jonathan C. Roberts","John, this is Jon. I just wanted to add, as we're out talking to clients, we talk about managing the bad trend, which PBMs have traditionally done, but we also talk about managing good trend. And we've developed a pharmacy economic model that we can run against a client's member base and we can show them by therapeutic class that if they're able to improve their adherence with their members up to the 80% medication possession ratio, which is considered adherent, what the medical offset will be. And so we've seen a lot of interest from our clients in this and that's why the adoption of Pharmacy Advisor, which is really targeted around adherence, has really taken hold in the marketplace.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, so Larry, if you think a little bit longer term in the Retail business, as your EBIT margin has sort of crept to some record levels here and generics will kind of go by the wayside at some point or will be less of a driver in the next year or 2, what do you think -- as you put your strategic hat on, what do you guys think you need to do to keep driving EBIT margin higher on the Retail side? Is it more cost-related? Is it more mix-related? Things you're not selling, you should be selling? What do you think about that?","Larry J. Merlo","Yes, John, let me -- if you look at our operation, okay, and as we think about utilization, that next prescription becomes the most profitable one as it relates to leveraging the fixed costs we have in the Retail stores. And I think that's a little bit of what we're seeing this year, okay, as we've capitalized on the Walgreens-Express dispute and something that we'll continue to be focused on. And I think I'll flip it over to Mark to talk about some of the opportunities that we have around store brands, and that will be more to the margin side of things.","Mark S. Cosby","Thanks, Larry. Well, certainly growth is the primary thing. So we have a number of issues that we'll review at the Analyst Day to drive growth. But also a piece of the puzzle is to drive the margin and continue to focus on the margin. As Larry said, one of our big front store components that we will continue to push forward is on the store brand front. We have a number of new launches that will come into 2013. And then we're working on a plan as we speak that would take the number significantly above where we are today, both from a sales perspective but even more from a margin perspective.","Larry J. Merlo","John, I think the other one I mentioned, Dave talked a little bit about our inventory performance at Retail. That is still an opportunity for us. Even though we've made some improvements over the past 2 years, we still have more opportunity there. And that will also help from a productivity and efficiency point of view.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with ISI Group.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Can you talk a bit about some of the underlying trends on sort of the front end? I mean, can you tease out sort of what we've been seeing in terms of net benefit from more bodies in the store vis-\u00e0-vis the Express-WAG pickup versus some of the kind of changes you've made and strategic investments you've made on that side of the business in terms of either boosting traffic or basket, et cetera?","Larry J. Merlo","Yes, Ross. We have seen an increase in both customer traffic, as well as the average ticket. And again, at the risk of being redundant, I think that we continue to see ExtraCare as the differentiator that drives some of the shared growth that we're seeing. I think we have also done a number of things around promotion as we think about making our promotional program more efficient from an expense and a margin point of view. And we're pleased that those things are working.","Mark S. Cosby","I would just add in addition to ExtraCare and the personalization efforts that we have there, we've done quite a bit with our field team to try to enhance their focus around growth and around sales. And we've given them a number of tools to empower them and to help them be successful in driving their results. And I think if you walk our stores, you'll see a much greater focus there that will help us today and will help us into the future.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And maybe on Specialty, it seems like that continues to come, at least from an inflation basis, higher than expects and continues to be kind of a pain point for drug trend at the customer level. Could you talk a bit about sort of the conversations you had during the selling season or how you're thinking about that as we sort of transition into the next year and into the next few years just based on whether you think that moderates how you're delivering sort of a differentiated solution in that market and in total, how you're thinking about sort of the growth trajectory of that piece?","Jonathan C. Roberts","Yes, Ross. This is Jon. So great question. And when you look at Specialty trend, which is running in the high-teens, it's really driven by really 3 components. One is price inflation, which is pretty similar to what we see in the commercial space. But the 2 components that are driving it even higher are mix. So as new drugs come to the market and they're more expensive, that drives the average cost of specialty for a payor. And then the third thing is utilization. We're seeing utilization. So a new hepatitis C drug came on the market, boceprevir, and that was additive to the therapy that somebody with hepatitis C gets treated with. So you're seeing an increase in overall spend in that category, as an example. So it is first and foremost on the minds of our clients, and they're looking to us for help. And we have many programs that can help actually manage that trend. So things like our Specialty Guideline Management program, where we make sure that patients that are prescribed specialty drugs that it's appropriate for them to get the drugs. And then we manage it carefully around the guidelines that are provided to make sure that the dosage is right and the frequency of utilization is appropriate. And then we have other programs that help manage preferred drugs within the specialty categories, and then we have exclusive programs, where we manage through our channels. So all in all, we have programs that can deliver and take -- reduce trend by 20%. And so we think this is an important area. When you look at the pipeline, half the pipeline is specialty. So it's going to be a continued focus for our clients. And we think it's a significant growth opportunity for us moving forward.","Larry J. Merlo","And Ross, clients are also worried about that portion of specialty that's flowing through the medical benefit. And we'll look forward to sharing some information on some pilots that we have under way to manage that component of specialty that -- I know I've heard it from some clients that, \"Hey, you guys have done a great job managing the traditional spend, okay? And how do we bring some of those same tools to that component of specialty that's flowing through the medical benefits?\" So you'll hear more about that next month.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I was -- I'd like to maybe talk a little bit about the comments that Express Scripts made yesterday. And also I maybe didn't understand some of the comments about gross margin in the PBM for the third quarter and the outlook for the fourth quarter because I think they seemed to be different, more positive in the fourth quarter. And I don't know if that's related to what Express Scripts said. But maybe you could talk about pricing pressures and other things like that in the PBM.","David M. Denton","Meredith, it's Dave. Maybe I'll start with kind of the gross margin in the PBM. First and foremost, there's kind of 2 things driving gross margin performance in Q3, and we see that continuing into Q4. As we look at Q3, which really driven around higher-than-anticipated generic utilization trends, and secondly, our performance from a branded manufacturer rebate yield perspective. And we've been very focused on that, as you know, over the past several periods. And both of those outperformed our expectation. As we cycle into Q4, those trends continue plus we continue to step ourselves into the period of time from a Medicare Part D perspective, where the profitability accelerates in the back half of the year. So that is also a trend that from a PBM perspective that trends into Q4 that's driving our gross profit performance in that business. So we're very pleased with our progress there.","Larry J. Merlo","Meredith, let me just add one other point because we've talked an awful lot over the last couple of years about EBITDA per script. And the fact that, that is not a good measure of performance, you can get false positives and false negatives. And so even though the number is now better than it was a year ago, we're still saying the same thing. We don't believe that, that is the right measure of performance, that at the end of the day, it's about operating profit growth. And we're seeing that number favorable. Dave talked about the generics. We're also going to benefit later in the year as it relates to the Med D business. And that's why we, for the last couple of years, have been saying, \"Look at operating profit year-over-year growth as a measure of performance.\" Meredith, your first question. I mean, I think I addressed that earlier in terms of as it relates to the economic climate, we don't see it changing materially from where we sit today. And I think that's really the only comment we have on that.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess, I would like to just ask a little bit about just kind of a simple question, I think, about the retention of the former Walgreens customers. Obviously, with the Department of Defense not bringing Walgreens back into the network, there was naturally going to be an increment to you. But it sounds like the 60% retention is better. Can you maybe talk about how much Department of Defense would have benefited you? And then -- which I guess would lead us to believe that you're just generally doing better.","David M. Denton","Meredith, this is Dave. Maybe I'll address that real quickly. I mean, clearly, there's some clients within the Express' book has continued to go forward on, I'll say, a smaller network that might not include Walgreens, and Department of Defense TRICARE was one such client. Having said that, we knew there were some portions of that book that would occur as we cycled into Q4. I would just say that at the end of the day, when we look at our retention performance, we're doing better than we thought. We're actively engaging those customers on a day-in and day-out basis. And we think that our outlook's positive here. And I can't give you a specific around TRICARE, what it would or would not have been depending upon their choice.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallucci with Lazard Capital Markets.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Two quick ones. I think, first, on Part D. I was wondering how you sort of view that business as a retailer. Specifically, there seems to be more traction, at least some newer plans that have preferred networks. I know you're in some, you're not in all. So can you tell us a little bit more about the strategy on that front? And then second, Larry, I know there's been some headlines out west, in particular on sort of your auto refill program and maybe some other retailers. And I wasn't sure if you wanted the opportunity to at least give your two cents on that.","Larry J. Merlo","Yes, 2 good questions. I'll take the Med D one first. I think, as we all know, preferred relationships under Med D are not new. And keep in mind that different than a restricted or a narrow network, the customer can still choose the pharmacy with a co-pay differential in place. And there are plans out there with CVS as a preferred provider or a SilverScript plan, the Aetna CVS\/pharmacy offering, along with a number of other options. And there are plans where we're not in a preferred position. We believe that over time, we are well positioned in the Med D space to gain market share. Tom, in terms of your second question about some of the articles in the L.A. Times, we do not believe that, that article accurately characterizes our ReadyFill program or our business practices for that matter. And our primary concern is to help people on their path to better health. And if the core of that is a business-wide initiative, as we've been talking about this morning, that is promoting prescription adherence among patients. And everybody on this call knows the statistics here that nonadherence to medication is costing our health care system nearly $300 billion a year in unnecessary health care costs. And our programs are working to help patients take their meds as directed by their physicians. And we've created several innovative services that do that. Some as simple as the pharmacists speaking with the patient face-to-face, proactive outreach phone calls to support therapy continuation, and then ReadyFill, which is an opt-in program that helps patients stay on their meds by scheduling their enrolled prescriptions to be filled when due, and then notifying patients to pick them up at their convenience. And this -- we think this is pretty important because there are a number of reasons why people don't take their meds. Forgetfulness is just one of them. So these programs are popular with patients. They align with our clients' goals of increasing adherence and continuing to work to control overall health care costs. So thanks for the opportunity to add my three cents on that topic.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Jefferies.","Scott Andrew Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So my first one is on Maintenance Choice. Obviously, good growth. Back when you started the program, you had some big gains interyear. And I was wondering if 2013, we could see that. The second part of the Maintenance Choice question is you don't have full coverage in Retail. Is that something you would desire to continue to grow that program? So that's question one. My second question, it goes to the PBM. I guess, and not to be -- because it's such a great quarter, so it's hard to even point out anything negative here. But it seems like the growth in new accounts for '13 maybe was a little bit under what we thought, given the competitive environment. I'm wondering if we could have some comments on what maybe the hangups were so far at least with the data you've given us on the PBM selling season.","Larry J. Merlo","Yes, Scott, I'll address '13, and then we'll come back to the Maintenance Choice question. I mean, I think as I've mentioned and Jon mentioned earlier, we'll provide a detailed review of '13 selling season. As we mentioned, the numbers have not changed materially from our last update. And keep in mind that earlier in the year, everyone was talking about this was going to be a banner year for RFPs because of disruption in the marketplace and so on and so on. And that really never materialized as it was perhaps being talked about earlier in the year. We saw RFPs up 7% year-over-year. I think it was a pretty normal year from that regard.","David M. Denton","And Scott, this is Dave. As it relates to Maintenance Choice, maybe I'll say the uptake of Maintenance Choice throughout 2013, we are constantly in front of our existing client base in identifying ways in which they can improve their performance, either control cost or improve adherence. Maintenance Choice is one such program that allows them to do that. And so it will clearly depend upon, one, which clients have new programs in place that start mid-year; and two, the receptivity to those innovative programs. So probably more to come on that, Scott. We'll keep you updated as time progresses through 2013.","Jonathan C. Roberts","And then Scott, this is Jon. Let me address the question of fill-ins. Obviously, our clients would like CVS retail stores in every state. We've got great coverage. And they ask us about our growth plans, and we talk about where we plan to add stores. But that has not been an obstacle to them adopting Maintenance Choice. And I think that's reflected on what we've seen because if you don't have a CVS retail store, they can go to mail. And that's more of a priority to get the savings on a lower-cost channel as opposed to the few areas where we don't have CVS retail stores, so really hasn't been an issue for us.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Let me say, first, I'm glad to hear that you're not expecting any in-group member attrition in your PBM for 2013. But separately, you've also discussed in the past that the EPS contribution from new generics for the PBM could be even greater in 2013 than what it is in 2012, just given the calendar timing of launches. And I'm just curious if that's still seen to be somewhat likely for '13 the way you see things currently.","David M. Denton","Yes, this is Dave. I mean, our outlook for generics has not materially changed, given that we kind of last year gave a progression or an outlook of what we thought was going to happen from a generic break-open perspective over the next several years. I'll encourage you to go back and look at the slide at Analyst Day last year within my presentation that talks about the amount of new generics that are coming to the market, as well as the amount of -- cumulative amount of break-open generics that are available both now and into the next several years. And our outlook to those is still consistent with those expectations. And we'll give a little bit more clarity to that as we cycle into 2013 and the guidance that we'll provide for both the consolidated enterprise but also the PBM and Retail businesses.","Larry J. Merlo","So I just want to thank everybody for joining us this morning. And we look forward to hopefully seeing all of you on December 13. And as Nancy mentioned, we've got, I think, a great agenda to include providing our guidance for 2013. So we'll see you then. Thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what maybe indicated in the forward-looking statements.","We strongly encourage you to review the information in the reports we file with the SEC regarding these specific risks and uncertainties, in particular, those that are described in the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and the cautionary statement disclosures in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. You should also review the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in our earnings press release.","Additionally, we will use non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company's performance during this call. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find a discussion of these non-GAAP measures and the comparable GAAP measures in the associated reconciliation document to be posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website. And as always, today's call is being webcast on our website and it will be archived there following the call for one year.","Now, I'll turn this over to our President and CEO, Larry Merlo.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Thanks, Mike. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. We're pleased with the solid performance of our business in the third quarter, and strong revenue and adjusted earnings per share along with significant cash flow year-to-date demonstrate our success in driving value. And I would note that Aetna reported its quarterly results on October 30, which were also strong. And the performance of both companies highlights the very solid financial foundation on which we will build our revolutionary new model, which will transform the health care experience for consumers and, in the process, deliver substantial value for our shareholders.","Now as most of you know, we received Department of Justice approval of the transaction on October 10 and we're now in the final stages of the state approval process. Of the 28 states, we have approvals in 23 including Connecticut, our lead regulator, and we're well down the line with the remaining five and expect to close prior to Thanksgiving. In the meantime, our integration work continues to make great progress and our teams are working extremely well together to assure that once final approvals are obtained, we can immediately begin to execute our integration plans. Both CVS and Aetna are passionate about revolutionizing the consumer health care experience and while we have been clear that the cost savings are substantial, this transaction is about the significant value creation that will be realized as a result of growth.","We'll be able to share more of the specifics after our two teams come together to begin the real groundbreaking work, but we thought it would be helpful to get a bit more granular by highlighting the work streams we have underway. And our integration and innovation teams' immediate priorities in preparation for close fall into two broad categories: first, is successfully delivering on our stated goal for year-two synergies; and a second is executing on the foundational pieces of our new health care model to achieve longer-term growth and value creation.","Today, we have a clear line of sight into year-two synergies that now exceed our original $750 million goal by just combining our existing assets and capabilities. The majority of these synergies will be derived from the reduction of corporate expenses and the integration of our operations, along with some reductions in medical costs. We plan to accomplish the latter through actions that increase adherence to prescription regimens and close gaps in care, along with programs that optimize the site of care either to reduce unnecessary emergency room visits or move expensive therapies such as infusion to lower cost sites of care.","The longer term medical cost savings will come from new programs that are only made possible through the combination and close integration of our two companies. And we are targeting substantial savings through specific portfolio of products and services. One example is the better management of five common chronic conditions: diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, asthma and behavioral health. And we'll accomplish this by building upon our near-term medical cost savings through the tighter integration of pharmacy and medical claims, the rich clinical data set we will have, along with our community assets. Another example is the optimization and extension of primary care, by expanding the scope of services available at MinuteClinic to help with the early identification and ongoing management of chronic disease.","A third example is programs and services that reduce avoidable hospital readmissions by joining Aetna's clinical programs with the CVS' community presence to better support patients during and after the discharge process. And a fourth example is the development of comprehensive programs to better manage complex chronic diseases such as kidney disease where the goal is to reduce hospitalizations and delay the progression of the disease or oncology where our objective is to align provider incentives to focus on quality and outcomes, while enhancing patient support.","Importantly, our solutions will be accessible through a broad range of channels from local community-based assets, to virtual and digital solutions, all coordinated across the member's journey in order to simplify the process. And we will make these solutions not only available to our Aetna clients and their members, but also to the wide array of health care partners we work with today through an open platform model. Remaking the consumer experience will be an increasingly important competitive differentiator and we are hard at work creating a plan to differentiate CVS Health in these patient journeys with the goal of making them simpler and more personalized, while making care more accessible. As a cornerstone of this work, we will have our first concept stores up and running early next year. And through these stores, we will pilot the programs just mentioned and explore new services to better address the cost-quality-access challenges of consumers and identify the most effective and scalable solutions, so they can be rolled out more broadly across our footprint.","So in summary, our year-two synergy plan is largely complete and we're ready to begin implementation upon closing. At the same time, we've developed a foundational plan that will benefit post-close from a deeper dive into Aetna's strategies and operations, leading to longer term value-creation.","And in our posted material, we summarize how this integrated model comes to life through the focus areas just mentioned along with the enablers and tools necessary for implementation. And while it is early to provide detailed quantification of the foundational pieces of our plan that will drive value long-term, we can share with you the areas of value creation we're focused on, which includes substantial medical cost reductions, increased revenues through membership growth, increased customer satisfaction and retention, customer value expansion through CVS assets, and growth enabled by an open platform model. And as we look at the size of the opportunities across health care, it is defined in billions, and we expect to have much more to share in the coming weeks and months as we begin rolling out these new initiatives.","So with that, let me turn the call over to Eva Boratto to focus on the financials of our standalone CVS Health operations, which obviously continue to be very important. And as announced last month, Eva will be our CFO once the transaction closes. She has been an indispensable member of our executive team during her ten years with CVS Health, most recently as Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. And prior to joining CVS, she served in senior finance roles in the pharmaceutical manufacturing and PBM industries. Eva has experience in all aspects of the financial functions of a multifaceted organization along with a deep knowledge of our organization and we welcome Eva to her new role.","Eva C. Boratto - CVS Health Corp.","Thanks, Larry, and good morning, everyone. I look forward to seeing many of you in person in the weeks and months ahead. This is a transformational moment for our company and I'm excited to have the opportunity in this new role to help shape the future of our combined companies. Over the past number of months, I've been deeply involved in our integration and planning effort, and I look forward to helping lead the company in bringing this vision to life. This morning, I'll share some business and financial highlights and provide a brief update on our guidance. Additional details are included in the slide presentation we posted on our website as well as in our SEC filings.","Overall, our financial performance was solid as we met or exceeded all elements of our guidance in the quarter. Let me start with a review of our capital allocation program. Year-to-date through the third quarter, we have generated approximately $4.9 billion in free cash, in line with our expectation. Our full year expectations of approximately $7 billion for the standalone business remain on track. Due to the acquisition, our share repurchase program and our shareholder dividend increases remain suspended until we achieve a leverage ratio in the low 3 times adjusted debt-to-EBITDA.","In Q3, $2.25 billion of senior notes were paid at maturity, and upon the closing of the deal, we'll take on $8.2 billion of Aetna senior notes. As discussed previously, with the addition of Aetna's business and balance sheet and given the additional debt issued for the acquisition, our combined company pro forma trailing 12 months leverage ratio is expected to be approximately 4.6 times. We are committed to improving this ratio to about 3.5 times within two years after closing, utilizing the strength of our business and our strong cash-generating capabilities.","Turning to the third quarter income statement, we generated adjusted EPS of $1.73 per share, an increase of 15.5% over last year and at the high-end of our guidance range. These results are on a comparable basis and the reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted EPS can be found in the press release and on the Investor Relations portion of our website. GAAP diluted earnings from continuing operations was $1.36 per share. The increase year-over-year was driven by a lower effective tax rate combined with lower net interest expense. Better than expected interest and tax drove the results to the high-end of our guidance range for the quarter.","Consolidated revenue grew 2.4% in the quarter, in line with our expectations. Gross profit, operating expenses, operating profit, net interest expense and the tax rate reflect non-GAAP adjustments in both the current and prior periods, where applicable, and have been reconciled and posted on our website. Our guidance for the third quarter also reflected these adjustments.","Gross margin for the company improved slightly over Q3 of 2017 largely due to segment mix, while total enterprise gross profit dollars increased 2.9% year-over-year. Total operating expense dollars increased 6.4%, in line with our expectations, largely driven by investments in the business from a portion of the savings from tax reform.","We continue to make progress on our enterprise streamlining efforts that are driving process improvements and technology enhancements. In the third quarter, new improvements included enhanced specialty order routing to decrease the time to dispense medications. As a result of our ongoing efforts, we still expect to generate approximately $475 million in gross benefits this year from streamlining. Looking ahead to 2019, we expect these savings to ramp in line with our original expectations.","Operating profit for the enterprise declined 3.5% from last year to $2.4 billion, in line with expectations, while operating margin contracted approximately 30 basis points. The decline was primarily driven by pricing and reimbursement pressures we continue to see in both our operating segments as well as investments in the business from a portion of the savings from tax reform, offset to a large degree by growth in retail volume and improvements in purchasing.","Going below-the-line, net interest expense improved as did our effective income tax rate relative to our expectations. Our weighted average share count was in line with our expectations for the quarter.","Turning to the PBM segment, revenue grew 2.6% to $33.8 billion, in line with our expectations. Growth in claims volumes and brand inflation drove the year-over-year increase, partially offset by rebates, continued pricing pressure, and as we have stated previously, the administration of rebates for Aetna's Medicare Part D business, which is new this year. PBM adjusted claims grew by 5.7% largely driven by strong net new business and continued adoption of Maintenance Choice.","PBM gross margin increased about 20 basis points compared to Q3 2017, while gross profit dollars grew 6.5%, in line with our expectations. The growth was primarily due to volume increases. PBM operating expenses as a percentage of sales deteriorated slightly year-over-year as operating expenses increased. The expense increase was primarily driven by the reinstatement of the ACA's health insurer fee this year and the benefit realized in 2017 of partially-reserved receivables.","Given the gross profit and operating expenses results were mostly in line with expectations, PBM operating profit was also in line with expectations growing 1.4%, while operating margin remained relatively flat. The timing of client commitments discussed last quarter impacted the third quarter as expected. We continue to make progress on the implementation work for on-boarding Anthem members in 2020. The costs incurred through third quarter are in line with our expectations.","Looking at the 2019 selling season, our current gross wins stand at approximately $2.6 billion with net new business of approximately $875 million, an improvement of about $675 million from our last update. Keep in mind this does not include any impact from our Medicare Part D PDP. To-date, we've completed more than 90% of our client renewals, roughly in line with where we were at this time last year and our retention rate is about 98%.","As we turn our attention to a new selling season, CVS Caremark continues to innovate. Currently, we're excited about several new cost managing opportunities that allow us to demonstrate the power of our enterprise assets. For example, CMS recently announced its decision to allow the use of step therapy to help reduce costs for Medicare Advantage plan for drugs administered under Part B. The new rule which takes effect on January 1 of 2019, enables payors to direct patients who are new to treatment to the most cost effective, clinically-appropriate therapies first, before moving on to more expensive options.","Our solutions, which are enabled by NovoLogix, can help bring the same precision we apply to Part D plans to drugs administered under Part B. Using NovoLogix, payors can implement core PBM cost management strategies that help ensure appropriate use for Part B drugs. Additionally, we're talking with consultants and clients about new, simpler economic models, which better reflect alignment of incentives, while accounting for the changing market trends. Although it's too early to provide details, we expect that this will be another step demonstrating CVS Health's leadership in the market to bring pricing simplicity and alignment of incentive to pharmacy benefit management contracting.","Within our Retail\/Long-Term Care business, revenues increased 6.4% to $20.9 billion. This increase was primarily driven by strong comp script growth from continued adoption of our Patient Care Programs, successful partnering with PBMs and health plans across the industry, including our preferred position in a number of Med D networks this year. The expanded relationships we have built with other PBMs and health plans continues to favorably impact script growth and we continue to see opportunities ahead.","Our strong script growth contributed to an increase in our retail market share of about 150 basis points in the quarter to an all-time high of 25.2%. Same-store sales grew 6.7%, exceeding the high end of guidance by 45 basis points, while adjusted same-store prescription growth of 9.2% came in near the midpoint of the guidance range. Front store same-store sales increased 0.8%, driven by increased volume with continued strength in the health and beauty categories.","Gross margin in the Retail\/Long-Term Care segment was down approximately 120 basis points to 27.9%. This contraction was driven by continued pressure on reimbursement rates and partially offset by favorable purchasing driven by Red Oak as well as front store rate improvement. Gross profit dollars grew in line with expectations, mainly due to increased volume across the pharmacy and front store, partially offset by continued reimbursement pressure.","Retail\/Long-Term Care operating expenses were slightly above expectations for the quarter. The growth in expenses year-over-year was primarily due to investments in wages and benefits of savings from tax reform, also contributing to the increase were higher expenses related to script volume growth. Operating profit declined 6.3% to $1.5 billion within Retail\/Long-Term Care in line with expectations, while operating margin contracted 100 basis points to 7.2%.","Before moving on to Corporate, I want to touch on our long-term care pharmacy business. We continue to see challenges in the skilled nursing facility space as the market continues to experience bed loss in these facilities. Longer term, the opportunity is in the assisted and independent living markets. As we've discussed before, we have put our plan in place for growth into action and will update you with progress as we get further along.","Within the Corporate segment, expenses declined year-over-year and were generally in line with our expectations. In summary, we continue to push forward on our initiatives to drive growth. We're creating new service offerings and reaping the benefits from the enterprise streamlining initiative and we are generating script growth from our expanded relationships with PBMs and health plans.","Let me now provide an update on our outlook for the remainder of 2018, starting with the CVS Health standalone business. With third quarter results within our expectation, we remain comfortable with our outlook for consolidated revenue, adjusted operating profit, and adjusted EPS for the year.","Given some moving pieces within the segments, the PBM's operating profit growth is trending at the lower end of our prior guidance range, while operating profit in Retail\/Long-Term Care is expected to be solidly within the range we gave last quarter. Additionally, our revenue metrics also remain intact. The guidance is on an adjusted basis. You can find the reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted figures in our press release and on the Investor Relations portion of our website.","As we approach the closing of this transaction, there are few details to keep in mind. From a non-GAAP perspective, upon closing, the net interest expense associated with the deal-related debt raised in March will be included in the non-GAAP figures. We expect to issue approximately 285 million shares. There will be a slight increase in the combined company's tax rate relative to the CVS standalone rate. There will be an increase in our revenue eliminations to reflect the elimination of Aetna's fully insured pharmacy revenue, also recorded on Caremark's books.","And of course, we'll have Aetna's operating profit. Given the timing of the close, the impact of these items on adjusted EPS is expected to be dilutive in both Q4 and the year. Looking ahead to 2019, while we've done a great deal of work on integration planning, we have not had access to Aetna's detailed financials. Accordingly, we will not be providing specific earnings estimates for next year until our February earnings call.","Over the past several months, CVS has been planning for the transformational changes that will take place as we combine with Aetna. 2019 will be highly focused on the integration of the businesses and executing on this new health care model. And while we understand the importance of establishing a baseline, this unique model is groundbreaking and the appropriate amount of time needs to be spent to ensure we fully comprehend how our companies combine to form our 2019 goals. After we close the transaction, we'll be in a much better position to provide you with that clarity.","We're excited about the opportunities in front of us. We have a strong organization to support us in these efforts and we'll be as transparent as possible as soon as possible. This transaction is about growth. We feel great about the value we can create and I look forward to being at the forefront of the effort to realize the full potential of this transformational event.","And now, I'll turn it over to Larry.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Thanks, Eva. And as we near the close of the transaction, we are confident in the long-term value we believe this deal will create for shareholders and the clients and members we serve.","Before I turn the call over to your questions, I'd like to ask that you reserve time in your calendars for our CVS Health Analyst Day, which will be held on Tuesday, June 4 in New York City. Again, that's Tuesday, June 4. With several months of integration planning under our belts, our senior management team will be able to provide you with a deeper dive into our short and long-term strategies for growth, updates on our integration work, and the status of our efforts to drive both short and long-term synergies and medical cost savings.","In the meantime, as Eva mentioned, we won't be silent. We know how important it is that you thoroughly understand our strategy, our progress, and the benefits we expect to derive from the bold, disruptive, and truly unique model we are creating. Our companies have put in many hours of thoughtful and meaningful work to get to this point and I would like to thank both the CVS and Aetna teams for their contributions. And we certainly look forward to welcoming our new colleagues from Aetna upon closing. We know there is a lot more work ahead of us and we've got the team and the plan to get it done.","So, with that, Jon Roberts, our Chief Operating Officer, is joining us today for the Q&A. And let's go ahead and open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Your line is open.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, hi, good morning. Thank you for all the details, and Eva, welcome, I'm looking forward to working with you in the future. A couple of questions here. I appreciate it's a little bit early to talk about 2019 and 2020, but when you announced the deal you gave us some idea also of how we should think about the accretion in year two. Do you have any updated thoughts for us or give us some context of how we should be thinking about that or any changes from what you disclosed in the past?","Eva C. Boratto - CVS Health Corp.","So, hi, Ricky. This is Eva. I look forward to meeting you or working with you in the future. We have not changed our point of view on the value being created by the transaction. As you know, and as Larry stated earlier on the call, we have increased our synergy target to more than $750 million in year two and feel very comfortable with that. So overall, we're comfortable with our previous comments.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And when we think about the pilot program, the potential opportunity there, is the pilot really going to be focused on Aetna members? Or do you have early health plan customers that are \u2013 early adopters that are interested in participating as well? And if you can give us some more color on how we should think about the opportunity that relates both to your commercial customers but also to the faster-growing Medicare population that you manage?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Sure. Ricky, good morning. It's Larry. Ricky, we will start obviously with the Aetna members where, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, where the integration and innovation teams are working closely around that. But as you've heard us state many times, our goal is to create an open platform model that we can partner broadly. Today, we've got more than 70 health plan clients, and I do believe that there'll be elements of innovation that will apply broadly in the marketplace. But to be clear, we'll be starting first with our Aetna members.","Michael P. McGuire - CVS Health Corp.","Next question, operator.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Please proceed. Your line is open.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. I just want to go back to the \u2013 to exceeding the $750 million. Any way you can sort of help frame the size of that or how meaningful above the $750 million where that incremental savings is coming from, and maybe the visibility that you have on that? And then the last piece is just the pacing of it. Obviously, it's a two-year target. Is it half and half? Is the bulk of it front-end loaded? Just any consideration of timing around that capture (31:20).","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah, Ralph, it's Larry. Listen, we will talk more about that as we get into next year and talk more about 2019 and beyond. Obviously, the integration teams are doing a terrific job, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks. And listen, we're continuing to push the teams. I don't want to say that we're done yet. And again, we've talked about the areas of opportunity as part of the initial integration work. There's really nothing that has changed beyond that.","We've talked about some expense and operating savings as well as some elements of medical cost savings that are \u2013 I'll put it under the heading of low-hanging fruit from the two companies coming together. So again, we'll talk more about that as we get into next year in terms of quantifying the cadence of it as well as the dollar value.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. All right. Fair enough. And then just to follow up, can you give any more details around the new economic models you're discussing with consultants and customers? Is that largely fee-based with risk sharing? Any detail there? And then, maybe also what the reception has been to this point in going back to those customers and consultants? Thanks.","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah. Ralph, this is Jon. So yeah, today the model that is in the marketplace is based on unit discounts off of AWP, and we feel there's an opportunity to create better alignment and reduce the complexity. So when we talk about alignment, today we align around not only unit discounts, but we think there's an opportunity to align around drug mix, which also drives overall cost to our clients. And that's not in the pricing model today.","And when we think about complexity, there's 14 pricing levers, approximately, that consultants use to evaluate and compare price points. But again, there's no net cost to the client based on changes to drug mix that are driven by formularies that we have in the marketplace. So we feel like there's an opportunity to greatly simplify the model and create alignment. I would say the clients are very interested and I think the market is ripe for this type of change, and we'll have more to say about this next year.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please proceed.","Michael Cherny - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, and thanks for all the details as well. Thinking about the quarter, and I know, again, not trying to get to 2019 guidance, but if you think about the performance on the Retail\/LTC side, you've seen the strong script growth come in over the course of the year thanks to your payer partnerships and PBMs.","How do you think, especially in a future world where you own Aetna, some of those preferred or narrower networks start to develop for other payers that are not Aetna? And what is the appetite, as you've seen yourself setting up for 2019 network access, for either expansion or potentially even reductions of preferred networks?","Eva C. Boratto - CVS Health Corp.","Hi, Mike. This is Eva. Let me try to break apart your question. Overall, from a script performance, we're very \u2013 extremely pleased with the progress that we've made achieving nearly 9% script comp growth this year. That growth came from three different key areas: our clinical program, our network arrangements beyond Caremark as a PBM with other payers, and including our strong position in Med D. So we continue to see substantial opportunity here to continue to outpace the market and continue to grow our retail share.","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","And Michael, this is Jon. I think as CVS and Aetna comes together and with our programs, we can demonstrate the activities that pharmacies can drive around improving health and lowering overall healthcare costs. We think there's an opportunity to move the market to more performance-based networks where part of the pharmacies' reimbursement will be based on their ability to execute against clinical programs that do lower costs for our clients. So I think there's lots of opportunity here.","Michael Cherny - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. Just one quick housekeeping question. The five states that are left, I believe New York and California are two. Can you just update us on where the other three are?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Sure. Mike, it's Larry. Let me just talk about where we're at with the remaining states broadly. You mentioned New York, we're pretty far down the road in our engagement with the Department of Financial Services. We're in active and productive discussions. We look forward to bringing those conversations to a successful close in the very near term.","California, I am pleased that after productive discussions and engagement, we have reached agreement on all the material terms with the state. And we're in the process of finalizing the form of agreement and all the appropriate paperwork. We expect that that will be done over the next couple days.","As far as the remaining couple of states, what I can add is that New Jersey was the very last state to have a hearing. That took place yesterday. So the other couple of states are in the process of finalizing their orders and all of that's reflected in our earlier comments that we expect to close before Thanksgiving.","Michael Cherny - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Perfect. Thanks, Larry.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","All right. Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please proceed.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much. Eva, when we look at where current consensus is for 2019, I know that some people have the transaction included, some don't have it included. When we think about core CVS in 2019, is there a way to maybe think about some of the headwinds and tailwinds for the core business, so that everybody can get aligned? And then Aetna is going to be what it's going to be when you add that on top of it?","Eva C. Boratto - CVS Health Corp.","Yes. Thanks, Lisa, for the question. Obviously, we're going to have much more to say in February, but let me try to outline for you some of the moving pieces. As I think about tailwinds we just spoke about one of them, continued strength in our retail script growth and outpacing the market due to the programs I mentioned previously.","As you heard on the call, PBM had a net positive selling season albeit lower than the last few years still net positive and we continue to see specialty as a growth driver. Streamlining continues \u2013 our expectations continue to accelerate there to deliver the long term savings Dave outlined a couple of years ago.","From a headwind's perspective, I would say it's going to be a lighter year from a break-open generics perspective. You can think about pricing and reimbursement pressures at comparable levels to what we've seen the last few years. And obviously we'll have the wrap of the tax reform investment that started about mid-year this year.","The other thing is, there are also some unknowns with the regulatory changes. And some of those what HHS is talking about could be positive or negative. So we're going to continue to evaluate that and have our clarity on our call in February.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then, Larry, looking back at the slides where you talk about the building blocks of multiple levers being medical cost, membership, et cetera. As we think about the health plan business and growth in membership, there really hasn't been a lot of growth in membership for Aetna over the last several years. Can you talk about philosophically how you think about trading off membership growth for price in the market?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Well, Lisa, as you've heard us mention since we announced the transaction, actually it's coming up on a year, that we really view the opportunity of the two companies coming together as a growth story. And obviously, there's \u2013 continues to be tremendous opportunity in the Medicare space. And I do believe for the reasons that we've begun to talk about, to be clear we have a lot of work ahead of us. But you look at the billions of dollars that are being spent unnecessarily they could be prevented, avoided in just the management of chronic disease. And the opportunity through this new model to meaningfully help people achieve a better health outcome at a lower cost or reduced cost we believe can create a new model that will allow for membership growth in the marketplace. So, again, we've got a lot of work ahead of us, but that's the trajectory that we're working towards.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I appreciate the comments.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Thanks, Lisa.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please proceed.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for the questions. And it sounds like, we'll obviously get a lot more detail not only in February but in June. But Larry you guys did share a few more examples of kind of the longer-term goal of bringing these two companies together. You mentioned medical adherence, infusion, generally expanding the scope of care within the MinuteClinic the concept stores. So, I guess, it seems like we'll get more details and it's a little bit maybe down the road. But I was wondering, if you could maybe just share directionally how we should be thinking about the necessary infrastructure relative to kind of the current CVS footprint in order to accomplish some of these examples that you've laid out today?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah, Bob, it's Larry. Maybe I'll start, and then I'll ask Eva to jump in as well. But Bob, I think you've probably heard us talk a little bit about that. You look at the CVS community assets today. We've got 10,000 points of distribution in communities all across the country. And we envision a hub-and-spoke concept where as we've talked about the concept stores or some have referred to them as health hubs we don't know what we'll call them yet, okay. But think about those as the hubs, okay? And we would have those in a set number of stores within a given market and the balance of the stores would have a core set of offerings that would serve as a referral source to those hub stores.","So from a bricks-and-mortar perspective, I think we have the assets to create that local presence in communities again across the country. And let's not forget about the role that digital plays or the fact that we're going to have almost 40,000 healthcare professionals that not just work within those bricks-and-mortar assets, but \u2013 or within a few miles of where people live. So there's the concept of, we can come to them at their doorsteps as well. Maybe I'll flip it over to Eva to talk more about how we're thinking about the CapEx component of that.","Eva C. Boratto - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah. Hi, Bob. If you think about our capital allocations, between the two companies our CapEx is about $2.5 billion to $2.8 billion. As Larry said, what we'll be changing in the stores, think about that as a shifting of investment from our normal refreshes to investing in some of these health hub changes for which we will need. So largely, we expect to be able to do this within what you would consider normal CapEx spend.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And then, I guess, just one quick follow-up. If I look at the performance in the Retail gross margin, Eva you mentioned the strong script growth and how some of those programs could help carry that through to next year. The margin decline in the quarter seemed to be a little bit worse than what we saw in the first half. So I was just wondering was there anything worth calling out there? And then relative, again not looking for guidance, but just directionally relative to how script trends are going in the Retail Pharmacy segment. Anything you can share to help us think about how we should be modeling those margins going forward?","Eva C. Boratto - CVS Health Corp.","Sure. In terms of the quarter-to-quarter impact, Bob, I would say there was really nothing unique in the third quarter. As CIR (44:23) has become an increasing component and that's performance-based, relative Q2 versus Q3, you had some timing differences there year-over-year.","As we look at overall margin, things that will pressure our margins are success in Medicare Part D. We've spoken many times that those are at lower margins. Additionally, as we increase our 90-day penetration that carries a slightly lower margin as well.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Got it. Thanks so much.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from George Hill with RBC. Your line is open. Please proceed.","George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. And Eva, welcome to the call. I guess my question is two parts is, I guess, Larry and Eva, number one, can you talk about how you think about synergy delivery gross versus net? So, I guess, how much gets generated by the end of year two versus how much flows to the bottom line?","And then typically when you see transactions of this size, there's a significant level of investment spend that comes with executing the deal. I don't know if you've contemplated that as we think about 2019 and if there's any color that you can provide around that. Like is there either a big charge or a big investment spend number coming forward that investors should be looking towards?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah, George, it's Larry. I'll start. George, in terms of what we talked about in our prepared remarks around the synergies, those are net synergy numbers reflecting investments that we would need to make, I'll say, ongoing investments that would be tied to achieving those synergy dollars.","George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. That's all I have. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Please proceed. Your line is open.","Clayton Meyers - Nephron Research LLC","Hi. Good morning. This is actually Clayton Meyers on the line for Eric this morning. Eva, welcome to the team. Looking forward to working with you going forward. I know people have been kind of asking about the 2020 EPS number, and I want to try to come at it from a different direction. And when the time the deal was announced, it's expected to be accretive relative to consensus at that point. Is the way that we should think about it is to take that consensus number and then kind of adjust it for tax reform and then adjust it for the lines of the business that's happening, the increased operating investment that's happening in the business? Do you think that logic is kind of roughly sound as you think about where to base the accretion number as we go forward to 2020?","Eva C. Boratto - CVS Health Corp.","So Eric (sic) [Clayton], this is Eva. Obviously you're on the mark in terms of tax reform has occurred since we jumped off of that consensus number. So that's one of the biggest things that have happened. The base is no longer valid, so it's difficult with all of the moving pieces for us at this point to update that. But what I can say is as it pertains to the transaction, there have been no changes.","Clayton Meyers - Nephron Research LLC","Okay. Very cool. It helps. Thanks for the color. That's helpful. Then just one other question just going back to the Part B mechanisms that's coming through with step therapy. Is that an area that you think CVS's asset in Coram Infusion particularly could benefit as it comes to CVS? And how have the payers been responsive to CVS' PBM capabilities within the space, given that Part B hasn't really been a space that PBMs have played with \u2013 with in the past.","And then finally, just a follow-up to that. With the new advance notice for the Part B IPI, would that impact CVS' business in any way? And how should we think about the role that CVS could potentially play as a vendor for that proposal?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah, it's Larry. Let me just talk broadly about the proposals that we've seen in terms of [Part] B to [Part] D. And obviously we see a tremendous opportunity to be an important part of that solution for the reasons that I think have been well quantified in terms of there is more competition today in Part B with the various therapies from where the reimbursement model started with Part B many years ago when there were single source products and very little competition.","We would sit here today and say the Part B mimicking the role that the private sector plays as part of Part D is the answer. I would sit here and say it's highly unlikely that an international price index, the other proposal, would result in net prices that are lower than what the private sector can negotiate through competition and innovation as part of the processes that exist with Part D. And we're excited by the opportunity to play a bigger role there.","Michael P. McGuire - CVS Health Corp.","Melanie?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Please proceed.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. Good morning. My first question is just on your segment guidance. It appears the Retail business for the fourth quarter would be down mid-teens on an EBIT perspective with the PBM up high-single digits. So just with that divergence, if my math is correct in the first place, I was hoping you can share what is driving that seasonality and divergence versus the year-to-date results, and how we should think about that as informing our view into 2019, if at all?","Eva C. Boratto - CVS Health Corp.","Hi, Justin. This is Eva. As it pertains to our guidance, I think your math is \u2013 we said for the year down low-single digit, so in the quarter, obviously given our year-to-date performance, you would be down in the mid- to high-single digits, depending on what point you picked.","In terms of any context for 2019, it's really too early to provide as I earlier discussed some of the headwinds and tailwinds.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then just a follow-up on the debt side. Is there anything you could share with us in terms of where you expect your gross and net debt to look like at year end post the deal close?","Eva C. Boratto - CVS Health Corp.","Let me get back to you on that, Justin, if I could.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please proceed. Your line is open.","James Auh - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. It's actually James on for Charles. So, on Teladoc, recently you talked about the soft rollout of the telehealth capabilities in about 18 states and Washington D.C. Can you talk about how Teladoc affects your clinic strategy and when we should expect a full-blown rollout?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah, James, it's Larry. As you mentioned, we've been rolling it out state-by-state. There are some state processes that we're going through to turn them on. And once we get more of a critical mass, we will begin broader marketing of that. As you look at the complementary strategy to the clinics, it has the opportunity to expand our reach as well as expand our scope of practice. And those were the use cases that we've been piloting.","We're pleased with how it's going and we see more opportunities there, especially with the role that it can play after-hours, the role that it can play as part of what the announcement that you saw in terms of the role that telemedicine can play with Medicare, and more to come.","James Auh - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And so synergies are now expected to exceed $750 million by year two, which is ahead of the original expectations. Can you elaborate for us where the upside in synergies is coming from? Is it more corporate expenses, reduction in medical costs? Also can you maybe touch on the revenue synergy opportunities a little bit more? Thank you.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah, James. It's really \u2013 we're not going to break those out at this point. It's really the areas that we broadly talked about. And as I mentioned earlier, the teams are continuing to work hard in those areas. And we'll talk about the opportunities for revenue synergies as we work through our longer-term plans. And we'll get into more details around that next year.","So Melanie, we'll take \u2013 I think we have time for two more questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please proceed. Your line is open.","Steven Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So during the quarter, there was obviously a large expanded store-within-a-store deal announced away from you for greater lab services in the retail pharmacy setting. So I'm just curious if you can maybe just remind investors what your general preferences are in relation to that type of opportunity, or are you just kind of looking past that event in the marketplace and just focusing on the other concepts that you're talking about for your retail footprint? Thanks.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah, Steve, there are certainly opportunities in front of us as we think about the companies coming together. And you think about whether it's through integration and absolutely having aligned incentives, the value that can be created, that can't necessarily be achieved through partnerships. At the same time, I want to be clear, we are certainly not opposed to partnerships. And as I mentioned earlier, as we build out these new programs and service offerings, we intend to create an open platform for others to participate in and we'll go from there.","Steven Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. All right. Thanks.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of David Larsen with Leerink Partners. Please proceed, your line is open.","David Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Can you talk a bit about the PBM selling season? It looks like there was a pretty good increase there, the retention rate looks pretty high, Express Scripts reported a very high retention rate and pretty good core claims growth expectations for 2019. Just how is that shaping up? And what does that leave you to think preliminarily about 2019 growth expectations and operating income? Thanks.","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah, David, this is Jon. So, we saw less movement of business from one PBM to another this year, I think that has a lot to do with the mergers that are happening in healthcare. And yeah, our retention as Eva talked about was 98%, so very happy and a little higher than we've historically had.","As far as 2020, it's too early for us to really comment on the RFP activity, it's just starting to gear up. And then, as we mentioned, we do have the Anthem contract that's coming onboard for 1\/1\/2020, which is a very large health plan obviously.","Eva C. Boratto - CVS Health Corp.","And as we think about that Anthem contract, you can think about it in terms of a net accounting contract given the terms of that business.","David Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Has there been any sort of shift in the sort of profitability or nature of the PBM contracts that are going to roll on in 2019 and 2020, like any general thoughts there? Has it been a highly competitive selling season? Has pricing been aggressive? Or any comments there would be helpful.","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","This is Jon. The pricing environment, it's a very competitive industry as we all know, and it typically gets a little more competitive as you go through the season. I would say it's consistent with what we've seen over the last several years, so not really a step change. We do, from time-to-time, see some PBMs get very aggressive on certain accounts based on their own strategies, and I think this year is no different than what we've seen in years past.","David Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. And then just one more quick one for Eva. Can you talk a little bit about your streamlining effort there? And operating income sort of growth expectations in retail, retail's obviously been under a lot of pressure. Just any thoughts around cost reduction efforts and initiatives and when can that streamlining gross benefit turn into a net benefit? Any thoughts around that at a high level would be great Eva? Thanks.","Eva C. Boratto - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah. So overall as it pertains to the streamlining, we're extremely pleased with the results we've rolled out numerous programs, we highlighted the one in specialty today. We're also looking to reduce overall call volume that comes into the retail channels through better sharing of data between the PBMs not in the Caremark, but other PBMs, not only to reduce our cost but to make the customer experience better as well. We continue to expect to see these benefits ramp in 2019 to give broader color than that we'll provide more in February.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","And Dave, listen, we have \u2013 I think you know \u2013 we have always had a cost focus in terms of how can we do things better while continuing to enhance levels of service. So it's not just about cost cutting, okay, but it's about doing things faster, better and cheaper. And that's \u2013 we believe that that's in our DNA and that work never stops. Before we round out the call we're going to \u2013 let's go back to I think Justin had asked the question about the debt, so...","Eva C. Boratto - CVS Health Corp.","Justin, you'd asked the question about the total debt on the balance sheet post closure. It would be around $75 billion when you look at our existing debt plus bringing on Aetna steps.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","So with that, everyone, thanks again for your time this morning. And as always, if there are any follow-up questions, Mike's available. And we'll see many of you soon, and have a great Thanksgiving.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call.

Please go ahead.","Nancy R. Christal - CVS Health Corp.","Thank you, James. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. I'm here this morning with Larry Merlo, President and CEO; and Dave Denton, Executive Vice President and CFO. Jon Roberts, President of CVS Caremark; and Helena Foulkes, President of CVS Pharmacy are also with us today and will participate in the question-and-answer session following our prepared remarks. We want to leave as much time as possible for questions today. During the Q&A, please limit yourself to no more than one question with a quick follow-up, so we can provide more people with a chance to ask a question. We have a lot to cover this morning, and we plan to make only brief remarks about the third quarter, so we can spend the majority of our time talking about our guidance for the remainder of this year, our 2017 preliminary outlook, and our longer term targets.","You can find all the usual details of the quarter on the slides we posted on our website just before the call. We also filed our Form 10-Q this morning, and it's available on our website as well.","I have one quick reminder, Annual Analyst Day is scheduled for Thursday, December 15 in New York City.

And, as always, today's call is being simulcast on our website and it will be archived there, following the call, for one year.","And now, I'll turn this over to Larry Merlo.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Okay. Thank you Nancy and good morning everyone and thanks for joining us.","While we announced solid results this morning for the third quarter, as Nancy mentioned, we want to spend most of this call addressing the recent changes in the marketplace, what they mean for CVS Health in the short-term, and most important our plans to address these issues, so we can resume our robust growth trajectory. You can find the detailed business and financial review of the quarter in the slides we posted before the call.","So let me touch briefly on our strong third quarter we announced this morning. Net revenues increased 15.5%, rising 19.2% in the PBM, 12.5% in the Retail\/Long Term Care segment. Adjusted earnings per share increased 28% to $1.64, including approximately $0.05 related to a lower tax rate, primarily due to the resolution of certain tax matters previously anticipated to occur in Q4. So this is basically a timing shift benefiting the third quarter at the expense of Q4.","Our results in the third quarter also include another penny related to below the line items. So putting those benefits aside, we posted strong adjusted earnings per share growth at the high end of our guidance range.","The PBM performed slightly above the high end of our expectations, mostly due to Medicare Part D profitability, while the Retail\/Long Term Care segment performed at the lower end of our expectations.","Retail same store sales grew 2.3%, with Pharmacy comps up 3.4%, and comp scripts up 3%, and that's on a 30-day equivalent basis. Script growth was at the low end of our expectations, reflecting the slowing script growth trend in the overall market and a soft seasonal business. However, our retail pharmacy share grew more than 200 basis points to 23.8% versus the same quarter last year, and that was driven by the addition of Target, along with core CVS share growth.","In the front store, we posted a 1% decrease in same store sales while achieving a nice improvement in front store margins, as we continued to execute successfully on our personalization strategy. We generated $3.7 billion of free cash during the quarter, $6.6 billion year-to-date, and we are raising our forecast for the year to a range of $6.8 billion to $7 billion. And we'll continue to use this cash to create value for our shareholders.","Now, let me address what has changed in the marketplace, and the near-term implications for our business. As you know, there have been numerous headwinds over the past couple of months facing our industry that have impacted the overall sentiment on the company. The negative sentiment largely misplaced in our view, included competitors winning PBM business and the perceived impact on Caremark, broad industry concerns about drug pricing and the value of the PBM, and concerns about what the results of today's election might mean for the healthcare industry.","None of those are significant factors, in our view, of the current marketplace, or of our performance. However, very recently, there have been some unexpected marketplace actions that will have a negative impact on our results for the fourth quarter of this year, and a more meaningful impact on our outlook for 2017. So let me go into further detail. Over the past few months, Walgreens has been establishing various network relationships with a number of other PBMs. For example, they have 90-day offerings in the marketplace through both Express Scripts and OptumRx. And since the first announcement, we've said these are not expected to have a major impact, and we continue to believe this.","Very recently, however, we became aware of additional network changes that are putting a significant number of our retail scripts at risk, beginning in the current quarter. For example, there are new restricted network relationships between Walgreens and Prime Therapeutics as well as within the Department of Defense, TRICARE program that in both cases take CVS Pharmacies entirely out of those networks. In total, we believe these network actions will result in more than 40 million retail prescriptions shifting out of our stores on an annualized basis.","The DoD TRICARE action begins on December 1, but they have already notified members, and we expect to begin seeing these prescriptions migrate out of our stores. The Prime network changes will begin on January 1, and impacts CVS Pharmacy's participation in selected, fully insured networks in several key states. And while we continue to participate in Prime's Medicare Part D plans, in many cases it will be as a non-preferred provider.","Now, as you know, we have always said that our last script is our most profitable one given our ability to leverage our fixed costs with incremental volume. And unfortunately, this means that the scripts we lose will tend to be our most profitable scripts, and as a result, we will de-lever, as a result of, losing more than 40 million prescriptions. And as we stated many times in the past, margin compression is a factor in the business, and our strategy of driving more share through our channels is a key element to achieving our overall retail growth objectives. And this unexpected loss of share will make that a difficult proposition in the short-term.","Now, I'm going to turn this over to Dave to walk you through our updated guidance for 2016, our preliminary outlook for 2017, and our longer-term outlook, and then I'll be back to provide a high level outline of our plans for responding to these marketplace changes, and reaccelerating our growth.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Thank you Larry, and good morning to everyone. I'll start today with our revised guidance for this year. We currently expect to achieve adjusted earnings per share for 2016 of $5.77 to $5.83 per share, reflecting year-over-year growth of 11.75% to 13%. We've effectively lowered the midpoint by $0.05 per share compared to our prior range of $5.81 to $5.89 per share.","This takes into account the recent competitor actions restricting us from pharmacy networks as well as current trends in the Retail business, including the slowing script growth in the overall market and a soft seasonal business which is affecting both the Pharmacy as well as the front store.","GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $4.84 to $4.90 a share. This now includes the addition of the integration costs in the third quarter, which we explicitly excluded from our prior guidance. Keep in mind that our GAAP guidance for the remainder of the year excludes the impact of acquisition-related integration costs, and we will update for those costs at year end.","Before moving to the fourth quarter guidance, let me quickly remind you of the timing factor affecting Q3, Q4 profit cadence. As Larry mentioned, we had a timing shift related to a lower tax rate that benefited Q3 by approximately $0.05 a share, primarily due to the resolution of certain tax matters. These matters were previously anticipated to occur in Q4, which I talked about on our last earnings call.","So in the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.64 to $1.70, up 7% to 10.75% from Q4 of 2015. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $1.52 per share to $1.58 per share. And you can find the details of guidance in the slides that we posted online early today before the call. But let me take a moment to point out a few items. For the fourth quarter, we expect enterprise revenues to be up 12.25% to 14% driven primarily by PBM growth. Total same-store sales at Retail are expected to be flat to down 1.75%, and adjusted script comps are expected to increase 1% to 2%, a sequential decline that reflects the impact of the network changes and retail trends. Additionally, enterprise operating profit is expected to grow by 2% to 5.5%, again, driven primarily by the PBM.","The network changes and other factors will impact our business next year, so we want to provide you some early clarity on our outlook for 2017 today. In 2017, we currently expect to deliver $5.77 to $5.93 in adjusted earnings per share, with results contracting a 0.5% to up 2.5%.","It will be a tale of two parts. Our PBM is still expected to deliver healthy growth, while the Retail business is challenged. We currently expect an increase in PBM EBIT of about 8% and a decrease in Retail EBIT of about 8%.","As you know, we had another very successful PBM selling season, with significant new business wins and a retention rate of about 97%. Importantly, we have continued to win in the marketplace while maintaining our pricing discipline.","Our specialty business is expected to deliver strong growth next year, and our SilverScript's business is also expected to continue to perform very well. So the PBM continues its healthy growth trajectory into next year.","In the Retail business, we completed the integration of the Target pharmacies and clinics, and are now better positioned to drive growth. With CVS systems and branding in place, we are ramping up our patient care programs along with our marketing and member engagement campaigns that are expected to increase awareness and utilization of CVS at Target.","We also completed the vast majority of the Omnicare integration, although there's still much to do to sell our innovative new programs to the market.","In the front store, we continue to drive health and beauty sales, private label sales, and to build upon our personalization strategies as we drive value for customers. However, as we cycle into 2017, our Retail business will be challenged in a few areas, so let me review them now.","First, the combination all the network changes that Larry discussed earlier are causing a significant headwind as more than 40 million prescriptions are expected to cycle out of our stores next year.","Secondly, although both the Omnicare and Target pharmacy acquisitions are performing well, the ramp-up in the level of accretion is slightly slower than anticipated. Between them, the year-over-year improvement in accretion was initially forecasted at $0.26. However, we now currently expect the year-over-year incremental accretion to be about $0.17, which includes the script impact on the CVS Pharmacies within Target related to the network changes that we discussed.","We are making good progress on these acquisitions, but it's taking a little longer than expected to realize all of the benefits.","And finally, we continue to see ongoing margin declines related to both reimbursement pressures and the mix of business. The offsets to margin pressures, as you know, are lumpy and they relate to the anticipated timing of generics along with the timing of share gains. Recall that our growth model has been based on driving share through our channels to offset the ongoing reimbursement pressures in the business, which we have been very successful at accomplishing for the past several years. Given the recent network changes, it has become more difficult to grow our share, and therefore, offset the ongoing margin pressures in the near term. So 2017 will be a challenging year from that perspective.","As you know, we are committed to driving shareholder value, and our cash generation capabilities are a real asset to our shareholders. We will continue to increase our dividend on an annual basis and do value-enhancing share repurchases after considering strategic opportunities. To that end, our board has just approved a $15 billion share repurchase authorization. Combined with what we have left on our prior authorization, we now have $18.7 billion available for buy-backs. Our adjusted earnings per share estimates for 2017 assumes that we complete $5 billion in share repurchases.","In addition to providing our preliminary outlook for 2017, I wanted to provide a high-level summary of our long-term financial targets, particularly in light of today's news. Back in December of 2013, we provided our five-year financial targets which included many assumptions. If you look at our cumulative performance from our jump-off point in 2013, we're tracking to the higher end of our adjusted EPS targets with a compounded annual growth rate of about 13.6% from 2013 through 2016.","Given the sheer scale of our enterprise with about $180 billion in revenue and more than $10 billion in EBIT, we want to acknowledge that maintaining a 10% to 14% adjusted earnings per share growth rate off a much larger base is becoming more challenging. So going forward, we are targeting enterprise adjusted earnings per share growth of approximately 10% on average. Some years may be higher than 10% while some years may be a bit lower than that. And we expect that growth should generate $7 billion to $8 billion in free cash flow per year on average.","And again, we will provide more details at our Analyst Day coming up, and we continue to believe that we are very well positioned in the healthcare marketplace, and we will continue to work diligently to deliver on these targets.","And so with that, I'll now turn it back over to Larry.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Well, thanks, Dave. Well, obviously, we are not satisfied with next year's growth projection. We have a plan in place to return to healthy operating profit growth, and let me provide a high-level outline of that plan.","First, we will leverage our enterprise capabilities and CVS Pharmacy's compelling value proposition to partner more broadly with other PBMs and health plans. We have capabilities that generate results that other retail competitors simply cannot match, so we'll begin to offer a suite of bundled services, including exclusive capabilities such as MinuteClinic services, infusion and long-term care capabilities as a component of the CVS Pharmacy value proposition. And as the healthcare market continues its evolution to a value-based environment, the clinical capabilities that are resident today at CVS Pharmacies will become increasingly important, making us a clear partner of choice.","Second, we'll focus on driving growth through new PBM product introductions that capitalize on the benefits inherent in our unique integrated model. Some offerings by others in the market, they have attempted to mimic the success of our programs, such as Maintenance Choice, and while they may get part of the way there, we don't believe they can extract the full value that we do through our truly integrated model. Our ongoing innovations will encompass clinical solutions to support all stages of care: new value-based contracting approaches in specialty and traditional pharmacy, including partnering with pharma in different ways to drive savings; new CVS Caremark retail network strategies including performance-based networks; as well as a new generation of Maintenance Choice that will offer even more convenience and help drive further adoption.","Third, in this environment, it's critical to continue to be a low-cost provider. And to that end, we've begun work on a new multi-year enterprise operations improvement initiative that will generate significant annual savings beginning in 2017 and accelerating beyond. And while we've been efficient and productive in our business, we do see additional opportunities to leverage the technology investments that we have made to further improve enterprise-wide efficiencies.","And fourth, we'll continue to be very thoughtful with respect to using our strong cash generation capabilities to return value to our shareholders. We expect to continue to evaluate opportunities for acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial criteria, and we'll be disciplined about investing in the right opportunities that drive long-term growth.","So before closing, let me reiterate that we continue to be confident in our business model, and our ability to drive long-term growth. You know, we've always said that the beauty of our model is that we can pivot to address changes that take place in the market, and we'll continue to do that as the healthcare market evolves. We're the only company with the ability to impact not just patients, but also payers and providers with channel-agnostic solutions.","Furthermore, our goals around achieving higher quality at a lower cost are very much aligned with our partners, and we'll continue to find new and innovative ways to drive value for patients, payers and providers by making care more accessible, more affordable and more effective. And we certainly look forward to speaking with you in greater detail about all of the initiatives that I just outlined at our Analyst Day next month.","So with that, let's go ahead and open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question is from the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much for the detail, and good morning. Larry, I just want to better understand competitively what's happening on the retail side of the business. So you talked about Walgreens and their new relationship with Prime and Department of Defense, but yet said these 90-day programs not really having much of an impact. Can \u2013 one, can I just better understand the make-up of the 40 million prescriptions you're talking about? Is that just Prime and Department of Defense? Or is there some assumption around these 90-day programs? Or any other restrictions around network?","And then secondly, can you maybe just give us a better understanding of what the opportunities are in your own Caremark book of business to try to replace some of this volume over time? I know you've talked in the past that especially with health plan business, it takes time to work these programs in. But is that an incremental opportunity over the next couple of years of hey, you know what, they might be taking away some market share from others, but we've got this really big business that we've won over the last few years and we can pull it into our own store?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah, Lisa. It's Larry. Let me start, and then I'm sure others will jump in here. Lisa, if you go back to the 40 million scripts that we talked about, and if you looked at the make-up of that, it's probably about 40%; 40% of that 40 million is the TRICARE impact, and then the Prime impact, and the balance of that is just the normal churn that takes place in any particular selling season. So it's really a function of the restricting of those networks.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah, Lisa, this is Dave. Just to be clear, this is not necessarily a 90-day offering; these are restricted networks which takes CVS fully out of the network offerings.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","No. I understand that. I understand that, but I'm just saying that I think you made the comment that that's specific to this, but you're not really seeing any shift in the 90-day. Is there the risk, Dave, that we do start to see some of these 90-day programs pick up, and so it would be more than 40 million scripts that need to come out next year? That's what I was trying to get at.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Lisa, I think we've contemplated that into our outlook for 2017. As you know, when we sell in a 90-day network with co-pay incentives, either into our book or somebody sells it into their book, there is movement of scripts, and that's contemplated in our script forecast for next year. So those are fully contemplated. And then...","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then what about on the other side, though? Like, for your own book of business, do you see an opportunity? I just look at how much business you've won in the last few years. Is there that opportunity to start pulling more of that into your store, maybe not in 2017, but beyond 2017?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah, Lisa, listen, we think that we compete very effectively on price, and our network strategies are a critical part of that value proposition. We always offer our clients a variety of network options to meet their specific needs of their members, and certainly, the results prove out that CVS Pharmacy drives better outcomes and better overall performance as a result of our integrated model. And we look to aggressively sell that to our clients to help them achieve better outcomes and lower overall costs. And at the end of the day, we have multiple network options, and the choice is up to our clients.","We have continued to see steady progress, alluding to the new business that we picked up over the last couple of years, especially last year as we've talked about it, it is a longer tail, if you will, on the health plan side of the business than the employer side, but we've seen steady progress there, and there's certainly more opportunity that remains.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Thanks, Lisa.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","So, guys, if you think about that 10% growth rate long-term, that would sort of suggest I think mid-single digit EBIT growth. Is it fair to think the PBM would grow faster than Retail? And any thought on where you think Retail can grow? I assume you would think after 2017 you would be back to gaining share and leveraging the Retail business.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah, John, it's Dave. Obviously, we do expect to return to healthy growth in 2018 and beyond. And yes, I think if you look at our long-term growth rate at approximately 10%, the company generates a significant amount of cash. That cash can be effectively utilized to return value to shareholders through value-enhancing share repurchases, which if you look at the past practices, we've delivered somewhere between 4% to 5% to 6% adjusted earnings per share growth just from the cash that we generate out of the business, which is significant.","Obviously, we do believe that the underlying business organically is going to be able to grow healthy. We don't really provide guidance by segment because our businesses are really integrated today, but we do expect to return to that healthy growth outlook in 2018 and beyond.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","And, John, and keep in mind, to Dave's last point, we've got \u2013 as you look at our model, some of the dispensing channels that may fall traditionally under the Retail umbrella in other businesses like specialty or mail, that's flowing through the PBM segment in our reporting.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","And when you \u2013 do you think when you think about restrictive networks and your approach to them, do you think about that a little bit differently going forward, or pretty much the same as you had? And you talked about sort of going after enterprise-wide cost reduction. Does that tie-in at all to how you think about attacking restrictive networks?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Well, John, listen, in the environment in which we're all operating, being the most efficient and productive, that continues to be a key guiding principle, if you will. And we've done a number of things over the years. We have historically been a very efficient and productive provider when you look at our cost metrics, and as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, leveraging many of the investments that we've made in technology over the last few years, we have another opportunity to do that. And again, as Dave mentioned, we'll outline the details around that at Analyst Day.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Thanks, John.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks for the questions. I guess just \u2013 I have to imagine the Retail network rates needed to shift this level of share away from CVS, it'd obviously have to be pretty meaningful. Can you guys give us any sense of the discounts that you've seen offered in the marketplace to exclude CVS Pharmacies? And then I guess as it relates specifically to the Prime example, were you given the opportunity to match the pricing that was offered to create these restrictive networks?","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah, Bob, this is Dave. Maybe I'll start with that. I think what was interesting about these couple of market moves is that typically we see a pretty competitively bid process. These major network changes quite honestly happened without a chance for us to actively engage and really tell our value proposition as these changes were contemplated in both Prime and with TRICARE. So from that perspective, we were kind of caught a little bit off guard.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Understood. And then I guess just looking at the math for 2017, it seems like the majority of the kind of below long-term EPS growth is really from this share shift, these 40 million scripts you guys highlighted, but you did then put out the long-term expectation for 10% growth. Given that there does seem to be this price for volume trade-off occurring in the marketplace, how can you get comfortable that we really kind of see the end of this, or more of a stabilization of this as we move beyond 2017?","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","I think a little bit around that, if you look at the \u2013 some of the competitive pressures that we're seeing right now are not necessarily new. We face reimbursement pressures and network changes on an ongoing basis. And you think about it the way we've offset it really is three ways. One's, we've lowered our cost of goods sold, and our Red Oak joint venture is a great example of that. We've improved the efficiency, and we're continuing to launch a new program this year to further improve the efficiency across our network. And then finally, we've been able to increase the capture of dispensing share into one of our channels.","Obviously, in 2017 that lever is not really available to us. But I do think, if you look at how we're positioned in the marketplace, and our ability to plug in and really add a lot of value to the payers, that we serve, I think we're really nicely positioned in a world of which networks begin to narrow and outcomes become more important.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","And, Bob, it's Larry. Just a couple of other additional points. As we mentioned in our prepared remarks, the point about CVS Pharmacy's ability to provide incremental offerings, leveraging the assets that emanate out of CVS Pharmacy besides simply dispensing, I think that becomes an important component of the story, recognizing the cost savings opportunities that result from MinuteClinic or infusion, as it relates to site of care management, and now long-term care pharmacy. And we believe that we can enhance our value with other PBMs, okay, not just Caremark, in making those services available that will be very much aligned with their clients in an effort to provide high quality, and at the same time, lower costs. So we believe we can be a partner of choice as we go forward.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Make sense. Thank you.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just to look at the PBM side a little bit from this angle. I guess, Larry, can you talk about what you're seeing in the PBM selling season as it relates to pricing, and what I'm wondering is have Walgreens pharmacies, PBM competitors, ESI, Optum Prime with lower network rates that are going to pressure you on that side of the business as well, and make it harder to retain PBM business?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Well, George, it's Larry. I'll start. Others may want to jump in. As we've said for probably the last couple years now, pricing certainly is competitive, but we've seen it remain rational in the marketplace. We haven't seen anything on the horizon that changes our view of that, and we're beginning the 2018 selling season, as we speak. So obviously we'll be talking more about that as we get into the new year, but it seems to be lining up very consistent with prior years.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then maybe a quick follow-up with Dave, I guess, anything you can give us to make us more comfortable with that medium-term earnings growth profile of 10%, given that these issues in retail are likely to persist because these market share gains and these pricings and these multi-year contracts, it's going to be hard to turn in one year or even two years maybe. How do we think about the mix of operating earnings growth versus capital deployment? Just how do we get to the 10%?","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah, we'll talk, I'm sure, a little bit more about that in December, but I will go back to say if you look at our past track record, when you look at our ability to gain share both from a PBM perspective and then turning that share into dispensing channel share gain in our network, we've been quite productive at doing that, and I think the outlook for that remains strong. Keep in mind we still have a very robust specialty business. It continues to perform well. We have a very large Medicare Part D business that is performing quite well, and we've done two fairly sizable acquisitions in the form of Omnicare and Target, both while are not being as accretive as we once thought, as we cycle into 2017, but as we look long-term have a real opportunity for us to grow and develop that business in a meaningful way.","And again, and finally, not to put this \u2013 to minimize this, if you look at the cash that our organization throws off, we can get a substantial amount of accretion just from the share buy-back program as you look at deploying that capital in a very effective way, keeping in mind, we might also deploy that capital from a strategic lens to make sure that we bolt on the right businesses to enhance the infrastructure that we have today.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, guys, I appreciate the color.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","You're welcome.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Thanks, George.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Eric Percher from Barclays. Please proceed.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. Another question related to the profitability of the 40 million scripts, and maybe I'll come at it this way: if you hadn't seen the unexpected or kind of non-competitively bid pieces move away, would your earnings growth have been within shouting distance of the 10% guidance that you're providing?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah, Eric, the \u2013 as you think about the answer to that, it brings us back to \u2013 going \u2013 I guess it would've been 2012\/2013 when Walgreens and Express had a dispute, and certainly, many capitalized on that in the marketplace. And if you looked at the profitability associated with those incremental scripts at that point in time, it parallels what we talked about this morning, extracting from that the advertising and labor investments that we made in an effort to gain a disproportionate number of those scripts. So again, factoring that in, we certainly would have been within striking distance of that 10% target that Dave outlined.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah, Eric, just keep in mind, too, that if you look at the, as we cycle into 2017, there were really three, I guess, topics that I outlined that were headwinds. One is obviously the loss of prescriptions in the marketplace. Two is slightly less accretion in the two acquisitions. And third, I'll say the competitive reimbursement pressures and the mix in our business. All three of those contribute to our slower growth or lack of growth in 2017.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's helpful. And on the third one, if we look at the PDP performance, it looks like this quarter was in line with what you expected. We see fewer preferred relationships next year. Can you speak to the way in which that may be impacting the next year, kind of the outlook on PDP?","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah, we have, I think, a very nice growth plan for 2017 in SilverScripts. Our PDP business continues to take share and perform well, both this year, and we expect the same next year.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","And, Eric, obviously, we're in the annual enrollment period, so it's open for another month, and from early indications, we've gotten off to a good start. Obviously we'll provide a recap once the season closes, and we'll probably talk a little bit more about that at Analyst Day.","Eric, on the Retail side, I'm not sure if your question was really looking at SilverScript or CVS Pharmacy's presence in the Medicare Part D networks. It would be on par with our various relationships this year, absent some of the changes that took place in the Prime sponsored Med D network.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Larsen from Leerink Partners. Please proceed.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Hey. Can you talk about the timing of these retail network contracts? Like, how long do they last for? And are there any other sort of large, I guess, PBM contracts on the retail side that are up that would (39:16) perhaps enable you to win all or some of that business back over the next year or two?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Well, David, as you look at the retail contracting cycles, they are probably, I would describe them as more frequent than they once were, acknowledging that the Medicare space is an annual cycle. And some of this gets back to, in our prepared remarks, our plan to respond to these marketplace changes, the opportunity that we see us having with other PBMs, recognizing our goal of providing more bundled services. So we have \u2013 today we have contracts with \u2013 retail contracts with all the PBMs, and we'll be working with those goals and objectives in mind that we outlined, again, in our prepared remarks, to enhance our offerings with them.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. That's great. And then in terms of like drug pricing, like, let's say, there's been a deceleration of brand inflation, there's generic deflation. Has that had any impact on your 2017 guidance, or not? And then is there any update to the net new wins for the PBM and also your retention rate? Thanks.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah, David, this is Dave. I think from an inflation standpoint, no real material change to our outlook in both branded and generic, and that is not presenting either a headwind or a tailwind as we cycle into 2017. So that's not really a factor in all the prepared remarks that we just talked about.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","And, David, in terms of the update on the selling season, I believe we have a slide in there. It's pretty much on par with what we reported on the second quarter call. The net business is slightly lower, reflecting some of the changes that you've seen in terms of some of our health plan partners exiting the exchange business, and \u2013 but it's not really material. And our retention rate remains right around 97%.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Thank you.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Next question?","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research. Please proceed.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question; hopefully I can articulate it well. But I guess I'm kind of going back to Lisa's question and some of the questions earlier in the call. I'm trying to understand why your vertical model appears to have lost some steam in the marketplace compared to what Walgreens is doing with some of their partnerships, and why those partnerships seem to be having more success on restricted networks, at least right now, and more success on the 90-day retail? It's our understanding Texas is going to have a 90-day retail component in that contract. Is Walgreens and the health care plan attached to a PBM cost advantage to you guys when you look at it with your PBM retail model attached to a health plan? I'm just trying to understand if the model \u2013 where the model stands and how you guys are viewing that?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Well, Scott, let me \u2013 there's probably a couple questions in there, and let me start, and then I'll ask others to jump in.","That first of all, from an integrated model perspective, Scott, I don't believe that we have lost any steam whatsoever, okay? As you heard Dave mentioned in our prepared remarks, Caremark once again had another very successful selling season, despite some of the publicized losses that occurred back in the spring timeframe, with net new business well over $4 billion, compounding prior successful selling seasons. And as we talked, we continue to grow enterprise dispensing share. Obviously, for the reasons that we mentioned earlier, not enough share growth to offset the 40 million script headwind, but we continue to make progress. And back to Lisa's question, we continue to see opportunities beyond that.","In your question, Scott, around is Walgreens making some headwind here, listen, we can hypothesize that there may be a perception out there that CVS Pharmacy is not a neutral platform, okay? And by the way, that's reflected in our response to this environment and our efforts to demonstrate that we are the best partner to all PBMs and health plans, given our unique suite of capabilities along with our track record of delivering results.","So \u2013 and I think we're all very confident that that will make a difference. And obviously, as you've heard us say many times, we believe that we have the right assets in terms of the healthcare environment moving forward. I'm not talking about 2017 now, recognizing this retailization of healthcare and the role that the consumer will play and the migration from a fee-for-service system to one that's more value-based, acknowledging that that migration has been slower than what everyone would like to see, but it is happening.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","All right. That was it for me. Thanks, Larry, for the answer.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Priya Ohri-Gupta from Barclays. Please proceed.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. Dave, just given some of the moving pieces that we have over the short-term, and then given your moderation in terms of EPS growth over the medium-term, how should we think about your balance sheet usage? Leverage target? Ratings target? Was hoping to get your thoughts on that since we didn't hear that in your prepared remarks. Thank you.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Sure. We're very committed to maintaining our high BBB rating. We're still very committed to returning to the 2.7 times adjusted debt to EBITDA. As you heard as our cash flow performance this year has been quite strong, we're going to probably de-lever a bit more this year than we thought we were going to in our original plan, given that strong cash flow performance. As we cycle into 2017, kind of given all the moving parts and I'll say the headwinds that we have, our leverage will probably, year-over-year, our leverage will be essentially constant. We will not deleverage as we cycle into 2017. We will work to get back down to that leverage target in a reasonable amount of time.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. That's very helpful.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Peter Costa from Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for the question. Larry, do you see this as more of a response to your verticalization of the industry in terms of the industry becoming more vertical? Or do you see this as the start of a price war from Walgreens trying to take more share and fixing their pharmacy counter?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Well, Peter. Listen. There's certainly been competitive pressures; that's nothing new to the healthcare environment. As you've heard us talk many times, we've experienced them for several years now in both Retail and PBM segments. We have several ways in which we manage against those reimbursement pressures, whether it's lowering our cost of goods. And we've gotten some nice synergies from the Red Oak model, and that team continues to work to bring even more innovation. As we talk, continuing to be the most efficient and productive provider of care and then growing our share. And unfortunately, that third lever of growing share will not happen in 2017. And again, as we've been talking this morning, we have a response plan to the market dynamics and a plan to reaccelerate our growth there. So that's how we see the marketplace. And probably not changing beyond that dynamic anytime soon.","Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So just as a follow-up, do you see yourself then responding to this by trying to lower price to re-win some of those customers that went away from you, or get into those networks again? Or do you see them as vertical networks that have been separated away from you?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Well, Peter, again, as we talked about in our prepared remarks, I don't want to be redundant, but we're very confident that in responding to these market dynamics, the ability to enhance the CVS Pharmacy value proposition and include other services that have been proven to drive down costs, we believe will be appealing for PBMs, because it's very much aligned with the goals for their clients.","Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Alvin Concepcion from Citi. Please proceed.","Alvin Caezar Concepcion - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up on that. Just unclear. Beyond TRICARE and Prime, are you seeing the differentiation of your model, your integrated offering? Is that weighing less on the decision of payers? Or are they just more motivated by price at this point? And do you need to consider lowering your threshold on margins? Or are you sticking with your plan?","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Alvin, this is Dave. I think our value proposition continues to resonate in the marketplace, both from the PBM perspective and a Retail perspective. A couple of network changes obviously went the other way on us here. But I do believe that the power of our integrated model and the things that we can offer to payers when we're not the PBM or the things that we can offer to the ultimate payer when we are the PBM, really still quite relevant in the marketplace. It's getting a lot of traction, and we continue to perform well from that perspective. And we think the outlook beyond 2017 as we get into 2018 and the years out, I think is quite strong.","Alvin Caezar Concepcion - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. And just my follow-up, I don't know if you're planning on providing color on sales longer term relative to the 13% target. I know that the losses are probably impacting that, so I'm wondering if you could give any more color on that.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","We'll probably give a little bit more color on Analyst Day, but I expect to walk through the model at a macro level as I've done in prior years and make sure everybody understands our growth algorithm.","Alvin Caezar Concepcion - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Mohan Naidu from Oppenheimer & Company. Please proceed.","Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you so much for taking my questions. Larry, you talked about you're giving your clients option of various network coverages. Can you talk about what portion of your business has restrictive networks that were CVS exclusive?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","You know what, we have not provided it as a percentage. We've talked about the number of clients and members and Maintenance Choice, and I believe that number is now over 23 million lives, and that is \u2013 Maintenance Choice will constitute our most restrictive network.","Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Got it. Maybe if I can \u2013 one quick follow-up for Dave. So Dave, you're talking about the 40 million scripts for next year, and that includes the TRICARE and Walgreens. How much of that is unknown that you have baked in for further changes as you go into 2017?","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","I think as we said here for 2017, we have a pretty good handle on, I'd say, network changes. Keep in mind, most network changes happen kind of in late Q3, early Q4 as you cycle into next year. So we have a pretty good line of sight to our network participation and volume outlook as a network participant as we cycle into 2017. So I think we're pretty good there.","Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Charles Rhyee from Cowen. Please proceed.","James Auh - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. It's James Auh for Charles. So my question is, so you mentioned that you plan to infuse new PBM product in the future to drive growth. What kind of solutions can we expect? One of your competitors is taking a risk on price with inflation protection. Do you plan to provide a similar solution?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Well, Jim, we have that today in our offerings where we have price protection for our clients. In our prepared remarks, we talked about the four areas of new product innovation around clinical solutions, new value-based contracting approaches, both in specialty and traditional pharmacy, and then a new retail network strategies that would include performance-based networks. We have that a little bit today in Medicare Part D, but we see an opportunity to go further with that to be very much aligned with value-based reimbursement and outcomes management. And then a new generation of Maintenance Choice, so again we'll provide a lot more details next month at Analyst Day but that's how we're thinking about it. And by the way, there are elements of risk that we take today, whether it's in Medicare or some aspects of what we do with NovoLogix in terms of managing that portion of pharmacy flowing through the medical benefit.","James Auh - Cowen & Co. LLC","Also, how much capital deployment is assumed in the preliminary 2017 guidance?","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","We have $5 billion in share repurchase is within that guidance range, and we'll talk more about the dividend on Analyst Day. But we do expect over time that we will be deploying \u2013 raising our dividend up to our 35% payout ratio by 2018. That expectation is still consistent with our thoughts.","James Auh - Cowen & Co. LLC","All right. Great. Thank you.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, hi. Good morning. Two questions here. First one, obviously it seems that growth on the PBM side is going to be key to achieving the 10% long-term earnings growth. So can you just give us some context in how much business you have up for renewal, how much PBM business you have up for renewal for next year, i.e., for the 2017\/2018 selling season?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah, Ricky, it's Larry. We've got $22 billion to $24 billion up for renewal. Keep in mind that that's off a much higher denominator. So as a percentage, it would be pretty much on par with prior years.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. And --","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Ricky, I would also \u2013 I would just add that I think it was probably important to step back, and you talked about the PBM being the growth engine, and while it is, we need to really think about the enterprise. Our business is so integrated now that you need to really look at it in totality from that perspective.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, Larry, in response to one of the questions, you really talked about the fact that you think that you have all the assets that you need in your portfolio to succeed longer term. Off the (55:40) health plans are key to longer-term success as we see the Optum-United model developing further. So can you talk a little bit about how you think about that managed care model partnership versus ownership? And obviously, Anthem talked last week about putting an RFP out early next year. So how important do you feel an Anthem-like contract for your long-term strategy?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Well, Ricky, it's Larry. As you know, we typically do not talk about specific contracts or specific RFPs. And as you think about the healthcare business broadly or health plan business broadly, today we have over 70 health plan relationships with the PBM. Obviously, it's an important growth component of the business, and there's nothing that prevents us from adding to that list as we've done the last couple of years.","I do think that there is an ongoing evaluation of, does the health plan in-source their pharmacy PBM functionality, or do they outsource it? And we continue to believe that whether you're looking at size and scale or the fact that pharmacy is our focus and the clinical capabilities that we bring to that, along with the challenges of the regulatory environment from a compliance point of view and the investments that need to be made to comply with that for the Medicare and Medicaid businesses, we think that it makes a lot of sense for folks to outsource that business. And quite frankly, that's what we've seen this year, this past selling season, where I think everyone was trying to figure out that, well, wait a minute, how can everybody grow, okay? And part of the answer to that is that the pie got bigger because there were some health plans that outsourced their PBM, their pharmacy business.","Ricky, I think the only other point to add to that is we see opportunities that we have, recognizing the assets that we have assimilated are the ones that largely touch the patient or the consumer. And that gives us the opportunity to partner with health plans, whether we're the PBM or whether we're not the PBM. Obviously, if we are the PBM, there is enhanced offerings that we can provide as a result of the integration. But there are also capabilities that we have that we can partner with health plans in a very differentiated way without having to be the PBM.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And lastly, one last question. You talk about Target and Omnicare and the integration there. Can you maybe give us some more specific color on what's holding back Target and Omnicare from meeting your near-term accretion expectations?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah, Ricky, maybe I'll take Omnicare and ask Helena to comment on Target. With Omnicare, Ricky, it's certainly not a question of if; it's more a question of when. And one of the things that we learned this past year through our pilots in the assisted living space is that we found that we had to target both the needs of the residents in those facilities along with the facility operator needs.","And in doing that, we need to make some additional and incremental technology investments. Those investments are underway, and they really need to be completed for us to broadly sell the value proposition that we can bring to the assisted living space. So we'll be getting that work done in 2017, and I'm confident that we'll capitalize on the synergies once that work's complete.","Helena B. Foulkes - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah, and I would say we're actually very happy with Target. As we discussed earlier in the year, the integration certainly led to some disruption which we expected. We've been through a lot of integration and we're on track to achieve the performance we were looking for this year. The most exciting thing I would say is that the Target team has responded in a tremendous way to the new systems and programs that we've delivered to them. So the service levels in those pharmacies are quite strong. We're seeing them come out of the integrations and the system changes at a very strong pace. And what we're starting to do now is turn on our patient care programs which CVS historically had and Target did not. And given their ability to execute and how well they've done all year, we're actually feeling quite confident that they'll be able to do that well into 2017.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Okay. Thanks, Ricky.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Michael Cherny from UBS. Please proceed.","Michael Cherny - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning, guys, and thanks for all the details. So I want to dive in a little bit on -- the question came up about the assets that you have in place. You obviously spent a lot of time about focusing on the enterprise approach and drive incremental services in the business. As you think more broadly about those services, and this can be obviously the thought process on organic versus inorganic. And maybe using, for example, MinuteClinic and acute care as an option. What's the most sense to bundle in, outside of specialty, are you doing relative to the acute care base that you are ready touch?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Well, Mike, I don't think there's one answer to that question. And I think that the benefit that we have is that we have a series of assets that we can bundle in a whole variety of ways that would meet the needs of that particular client and their members. And so I actually think that will be an advantage to us.","Michael Cherny - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's all I have for now. Thank you.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Steven Valiquette from Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning. I guess just with TRICARE obviously as a government contract, and then Prime Therapeutics as sort of a different type of entity tied to Blue's plans, just curious if you see differences in appetite for restricted pharmacy networks among different customer types in the market. And I guess, just when thinking about government, versus commercial employers, versus health plan customers.","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah, Steven; this is Jon Roberts. With the employer clients, we clearly have seen a big appetite to restrict networks, narrow networks, so Maintenance Choice with 23 million members has been very successful. When you move over to health plans, you've seen a big appetite in Medicare with preferred networks, most preferred networks. Most Part D plans have preferred networks. In Managed Medicaid we see many of those plans willing to restrict networks. I think where there has been a reluctance historically has been in the fully-insured market, and I think with Prime making a move to narrow their network in fully-insured that may be a catalyst for the rest of the market. So we view that as an opportunity.","And I think with the government programs it's a little bit of a mixed bag. We see some willing to move into either restricted or Maintenance Choice networks and others like full access. So different parts of our client base really do have different priorities and willingness to narrow or restrict networks.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. So there are some changes in the market, maybe some growing appetite. But maybe just to confirm again, this is asked a bunch of different ways, but do you characterize these most recent changes as rational competition? Just to try to confirm that. Just given how some of these stocks are reacting today. I think people are worried about irrational pricing. But just would you characterize these last two changes as rational competition?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Well, Steve, I would say as we've talked many times, whether it's on the PBM or Retail side, we've continued to see margin compression. And I would say that we have not seen anything that we would put under the heading of irrational.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","And I guess I would \u2013 this is Dave. I guess I would just look at the Prime decision. And it appears to us \u2013 and listen, we're a little bit of an observer here is that Walgreens acquired their specialty pharmacy and their mail order pharmacy or at least partnered with them from that perspective. And I'm assuming that as part of the arrangement, there was some network participation agreement that was confirmed through Prime. So I think that might be a little bit of a unique animal compared to other network changes in the marketplace.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","And, Steve, again I think Dave mentioned this in response to one of the earlier questions that in the two cases that we've talked a fair amount this morning, we became aware of the network changes after the fact and were not given the opportunity to respond. So in an irrational pricing environment, you would not \u2013 you would expect a different type of process associated with that.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Got it. Okay. Thanks.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Okay. We'll take two more questions, please.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research Company. Please proceed.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Thanks. In terms of the updated long-term growth target, Dave, I understood some of the measures that you outlined, the size of the company. But curious if there's anything that you could help us with today in terms of different assumptions; if this is a different rate of you gaining share. If this is a different rate of underlying market growth, or an assumption that's different about profitability opportunities. Just curious if you could give us a little bit more color behind what's different with the long-term growth rate going forward.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah, Eric, obviously as I said, we're jumping off a lot bigger base at this point in time given where we were in 2013 as we've grown the company substantially. This is probably a deeper conversation that we probably have time for on the call today, but it was something that we'll talk about more at Analyst Day. I will say though that if you just look broadly, I don't believe the fundamentals of our growth algorithm has substantially changed. Obviously, the marketplace has moved a bit and there's been different offerings in the marketplace.","But I think our ability to compete in the market hasn't changed in a substantial fashion. And we do believe that if you look at the market probably where it was a few years ago to where it is now, obviously the government-sponsored plans and health plans have grown, and they continue to be a growth area. Whereas the employer book has been relatively modest and flattish from a growth perspective. So we'll see more of our growth coming out of government-sponsored plans over time. And again, I think we're nicely positioned with all of our assets to compete successfully and gaining share in that marketplace. So that's probably the biggest I'll say underlying change is to \u2013 as we pivot to make sure we service that need of the segment of the market.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","You're welcome.","Operator","And our final question is from the line of Todd Duvick from Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Todd Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thank you for the question. Dave, I had a follow-up for you with respect to your guidance about free cash flow. Given that free cash flow is a little stronger this year and you talked about de-levering in 2016 and probably flat in 2017. You have a debt maturing in December, a $750 million note. Should we assume that you're going to pay that note off as opposed to refinance it? And then with respect to share buybacks in 2017, should we assume that those are going to be fully funded from free cash flow as opposed to partially debt-financed?","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Yes. They will not be debt-financed, other than we might need to do a little short-term borrowing to just accommodate the timing of that. But we will not be issuing debt to support a share repurchase program into 2017. I can't really comment about our debt maturities. I do think at the end of the day, we will be expected to be de-levering over time as we grow our way out of our current capital structure. Just a little bit over 3 times, so probably 2.9 times at the end of the year down to 2.7 times in a reasonable amount of time.","Todd Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Okay. Well, let me just thank everyone for your time this morning. And just wrapping up, obviously we're not happy with our outlook for 2017. At the same time, we outlined our actions in response to some of the marketplace dynamics that are taking place. And we're confident that our response and our actions will allow us to reaccelerate our growth going forward, and we look forward to seeing all of you next month at Analyst Day where we'll provide additional details on many of the things we talked about this morning.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

Please go ahead.","Nancy Christal ","Thank you, Milan. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I\u2019m here this morning with Larry Merlo, President and CEO, who will provide a business update and Dave Denton, Executive Vice President and CFO, who will review our first quarter results as well as guidance for the second quarter and year. Jon Roberts, President of PBM and Helena Foulkes, President of the [Audio Gap] to no more than one question with a quick follow-up, so we can provide more callers with the chance to ask questions.","Just before this call, we posted a slide presentation on our website. The slide summarizes the information you'll hear today as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance. Additionally, our Form 10-Q will be filed later this afternoon and it will be available on our website at that time. Please note that during today\u2019s presentation, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. By their nature, all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements for a number of reasons as described in our SEC filings including the Risk Factors section and cautionary statement disclosures in those filings.

And as always, today\u2019s call is being simulcast on our website and it will be archived there following the call for one year.","And now, I\u2019ll turn this over to Larry Merlo.","Larry Merlo ","Okay, thanks, Nancy and Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us to hear more about the strong first quarter results we posted this morning. ","Adjusted earnings per share increased 12.2% to a $1.14 per share and that\u2019s $0.05 above the high-end of our guidance range. Operating profit in the retail business declined 1.3%, inline with expectations, reflecting the tougher comparison due to the tobacco exit. ","Operating profit in the PBM increased 14.6%, well ahead of our expectations. While we generated approximately $1.6 billion of free cash during the quarter and we continued to return significant value to our shareholders through our disciplined capital allocation practices. ","Now it\u2019s still early in the year, but given our outperformance in the first quarter, we are narrowing our adjusted EPS guidance range for 2015 to $5.08 to $5.19 and Dave will provide the details of our guidance during his financial review.","So let me turn to the business update. And I\u2019ll start with the 2015 PBM selling season. The expected revenue impact for 2015 has grown since our last update. Gross new business currently stands at $7.5 billion with net new business of $4.1 billion. And that\u2019s up about $0.5 billion on both the growth in that lines from our last update. ","The increase was driven primarily by the growth in membership within some health plan clients, as well as some additional wins. Now turning to the 2016 selling season, I would describe pricing in the industry is competitive yet rational and to-date we\u2019ve completed about a third of our client renewals which is typical at this time of the year. ","And while it\u2019s too early to give you specific data points for 2016, I will note that the selling season is off to a good start. Our integrated model allows us to provide differentiated products and services that continue to provide savings for our clients, while providing better health outcomes and convenience for our members. ","These unique products and services continue to resonate strongly in the market and as we typically do, we\u2019ll provide a more quantitative update on our 2Q call in August when we have a more complete picture. ","Now our recently released Insights report highlights our efforts to manage trend for our clients. In 2014, growth trends was 12.7% and that\u2019s up from 3.8% in 2013. Importantly, the report demonstrates that there are solutions to bend the cost curve. With brand price increases the accelerating growth in specialty, we are finding more clients receptive to these types of solutions. ","Our report identifies high performing clients, what we call are trendsetters and the solutions that they are using to improve the cost trend. Now we shared these results with our clients at our recent client forum last month and let me take a minute and give you just a couple of examples. ","Our first formulary management solution, our trendsetter solution, we call it the value formulary, and it promotes lower cost generics and provides limited access to brands. We employ category-specific management using drug exclusions, step therapies, prior authorization and quantity limits and with the 12.7% growth trend for our overall book of business, our clients using the value formulary achieved a growth trend of only one half of 1%, more than 1200 basis point better than the overall book. ","A second example is in managing specialty. Our book of business trend in specialty was 32.4%, nearly half of which can be attributed to the surge in prescribing for the new Hep C therapies. ","Our underlying principles for our management solutions include condition level management, a broader approach to clinical care, and a breakthrough specialty patient experience. Our trendsetter solutions for specialty include our advanced specialty formulary, Specialty Connect and specialty guideline management and you\u2019ll recall that Specialty Connect provides choice to receive a member specialty scrip at CVS pharmacy or through our mail channel, while preserving the central clinical expertise that leads to better health outcomes. ","The trendsetter results 23.9% specialty trends, nearly 1000 basis points better than the overall book. So as I said, there are solutions and we expect more clients to adopt these cost management tools. ","Now speaking of specialty, our specialty revenues continued on a very strong growth trajectory in the quarter increasing 46% and that was driven by volume, new products, inflation and the impact of Specialty Connect. ","Our infusion capabilities through Coram are another significant differentiator with clients and we are experiencing healthy growth in the business. In fact, the number of infusion patients we serviced in the quarter, jumped 15.7% from the prior year and that\u2019s after adjusting for the timing of the Coram deal close. ","Site of care management, another important component of managing costs for specialty patients and we offer clients solutions to effectively manage these costs. As we previously discussed, we\u2019ve been using our leading formulary strategies to effectively manage the high cost HEP C category and we envision employing similar tools to manage the anticipated new PCF K9 inhibitors which are expected to enter the market later this summer. ","However, given the significant number of people being treated for high cholesterol, they can be treated quite successfully with lower cost statins, we envision robust prior authorization guidelines to help control costs, while ensuring that the appropriate population gets access to these newer therapies. ","Before turning to retail, let me touch a minute on Biosimilars with the first Biosimilar approved. This is just the beginning of a pipeline that could unlock additional savings and provide options to our clients. We expect discounts to be available, but they will likely vary by product. ","And for the foreseeable future, we expect Biosimilars will behave more like brand than the traditional generics and as a result, we expect to employ our formulary strategies to generate savings for our clients. ","Our retail business, it produced results that were inline with our expectations, but pharmacy same-store prescription unit volumes increased 5.1% and that\u2019s on a 30-day equivalent basis and we continued to gain pharmacy share. Our retail pharmacy market share was 21.5% in the quarter and that\u2019s up about 50 basis points versus the same quarter a year ago. ","Pharmacy same-store sales increased 4.2% and reflect the positive impact of about 70 basis points related to the incidents of flu. Pharmacy same-store sales also include the negative impacts of about 280 basis points due to recent generic introductions and another 190 basis points from the implementation of Specialty Connect which as I mentioned earlier, transfers specialty scripts from our retail to our PBM segment. ","Our initiative to unlock adherence continues to make good progress and we anticipate launching some new products later this year that will be available to both patients and their care givers in order to help patients stay adherent to their medication. ","Turning to the front store, our performance in the quarter was very solid and while front store comps were down 6.1%, if you adjust for the tobacco impact, front store comps would have been up about 2%. The impact of the tobacco exit was around 800 basis points and that\u2019s about a 100 basis points less than originally anticipated. ","We saw solid growth in our core health and beauty categories including the strong cough cold season and we gained share in health and beauty in both the drug and multi-outlet markets. And while we experienced a decrease in front store traffic, that decrease was partially offset by an increase in the average customer basket. ","Our front store journey to position ourselves as a leading health and beauty destination continues. This year, we are launching Phase 1 of our healthy foods rollout offering customers more healthy choices in a select group of stores. ","Our beauty elevation program is also launching in several thousand stores and we continue to test the multitude of changes to further enhance our front store clustering efforts including a number of store resets that leveraged the knowledge that we\u2019re gaining from the Navarro acquisition. ","Extra care continues to be an important driver of profitable front store growth as about 80% of our sales now goes through our loyalty program providing us a longitudinal view of the customer and we have developed new internal tools to ensure that promotional investments are driving the right economics while delivering value for our customers. And these tools have allowed us to further develop our personalization efforts. ","Digital and specifically, mobile are also important tools in powering up our personalization reach and just as one example, today, we know that customers using our mobile app with extra care are spending four times more than our average customers. So we are encouraged by these results and believe that there is more opportunity for further innovation. ","Our front store margins in the quarter continued to benefit from these efforts as well as the tobacco exit. On a comparable basis to last year, including adjusting for the tobacco elimination, front store margins improved notably. And this underlying improvement in the front reflects our highly personalized promotional strategies, along with the continued growth in store brand sales. In fact, we made good progress in store brand penetration in the quarter with store brands increasing to 20.9% of front store sales. ","And that\u2019s up about 330 basis points from last year. Two-thirds of the improvement reflecting the removal of tobacco from our mix and one-third of the improvement reflecting underlying progress in our store brand penetration as we continue to make progress toward our 25% goal. ","Turning to store growth in the quarter, we opened 38 new stores, relocated 12, closed 10, resulting in 28 net new stores and we plan to add about \u2013 to an anticipated increase in retail square footage growth of around 2%. ","As for MinuteClinic,, we opened 15 net new clinics in the quarter, and we ended the quarter with 986 clinics across 31 states plus the District of Colombia. And continuing on its very strong growth trajectory, MinuteClinic\u2019s revenues increased about 21% versus the same quarter last year and 84% of MinuteClinic visits were paid for by third-parties with MinuteClinic included in most payer networks as an accessible and cost-effective provider. ","Now the rollout of the epic electronic medical record system remains on schedule or expected to be complete with that by mid-year. Additionally, we\u2019ve now seen more than 13,000 patients since the initiation of our telehealth pilots in California and Texas with very high level of customer satisfaction. We are continuing to test various uses for telehealth and believe that can\u2019t be part of a care model that improves access and lowers overall healthcare costs. ","Just a quick note on Red Oak Sourcing, our venture with Cardinal Health. We continue to be extremely pleased with the progress the team is making, they continue to execute very well. The expertise that Red Oak provides along with the simplicity of the business structure has enabled Red Oak to make great strides. ","They\u2019ve been working with suppliers on strategies that create value for all parties and have now transitioned nearly all suppliers to Red Oak within a relatively short timeframe. So we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with their performance and results. ","And with that, let me turn it over to Dave for the financial review. ","Dave Denton ","Thank you Larry, and good morning everyone. Today, I'll provide a detailed review of our first quarter results, followed by an update on our guidance. However, before I do that and as I often do, I want to highlight the ways in which we are using our strong free cash flow to enhance shareholder value through our disciplined capital allocation program. ","During the first quarter, we paid $399 million in dividends, our dividend payout ratio now stands at 28.7% and we remain well on track to achieve our target of 35% by 2018. ","Additionally, in January, we entered into a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase program. At that time, in exchange for $2 billion, we received approximately 16.8 million shares at a price of $94.49 per share, which represented 80% of the notional [Audio Gap] received approximately 3 million shares today making the average share price of the ASR $100.64 per share. For the full year, we still expect to complete $6 billion of share repurchases. ","So between dividends and share repurchases, we\u2019ve returned more than $2 billion to our shareholders in the first quarter alone and we continue to expect to return more than $7 billion for the full year, more than a 30% increase over last year\u2019s levels. ","As Larry mentioned, we generated approximately $1.6 billion of free cash in the first quarter and we continued to expect to produce free cash of between $5.9 billion and $6.2 billion this year. ","Now turning to the income statement, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations came in at $1.14 per share, $0.05 above our guidance range and up by 12.2% over LY. GAAP diluted EPS was $1.07 per share. ","The retail segment performed within expectations, while we saw strong results from the PBM segment which posted profit growth above the high-end. The outperformance in the quarter was primarily driven by stronger than expected prescription volumes as well as favorable purchasing and rebate economics in the PBM segment. ","On a consolidated basis, revenues in the first quarter increased 11.1% to $36.3 billion. In the PBM segment, net revenue growth surpassed expectations as revenues increased 18.2% to $23.9 billion. This growth was driven by specialty pharmacy, as well as increased volumes in the pharmacy network plans largely from the addition of new clients. ","Partially offsetting this growth was an increase in our generic expensing rates which grew approximately 150 basis points versus the same quarter of LY to 83.5%. We saw strength on the top-line versus our guidance due primarily to higher than expected volumes, drug price inflation and mix, including the new Hep C drugs. ","In our retail business, revenues increased 2.9% in the quarter to $17 billion at the high end of our guidance. This growth was driven primarily by solid pharmacy same-store sales growth, despite the transition of specialty revenues into the PBM segment due to Specialty Connect. ","Higher volumes in the pharmacy was fueled by a strong flu season and an uptick in 90-day prescriptions. ","Now turning to gross margins, we\u2019ve reported 17% for the consolidated company in the quarter, a contraction of approximately 120 basis points compared to the Q1 of 2014 and again, consistent with our expectations. The decline is due in part to a mix shift in our business as our lower margin PBM business is growing faster than our retail business. ","Within the PBM segment, gross margins declined approximately 35 basis points from Q1 of 2014 to 4.3%. This was primarily driven by price compression which was partially offset by the improvement in GDR as well as favorable purchasing and rebate economics. Despite the decline in gross margin rate, gross profit dollars were up 9.8% year-over-year given volume increases and mix. ","Gross margin in the retail segment was 31.2%, down approximately 20 basis points from LY. The continued pressure on reimbursement rates as well as the continuing mix shift towards pharmacy were partially offset by a number of positive factors. ","These positive factors include a 150 basis points increase in retail GDR to 84.4%, the benefit to function margins from the tobacco exit and the increased store brand penetration. And while gross margin rates were down, gross profit dollars increased 2.1% in the quarter. ","Total operating expense as a percent of revenues notably improved from Q1 2014 to 11.1%. The PBM segment\u2019s SG&A rate improved by approximately 25 basis points to 1.2% with operating expense dollars coming in a little lower than expected despite the over-delivery of revenues. ","As reported, SG&A as a percent of sales in the retail segment increased by approximately 20 basis points to 21%. However, the increase continues to be driven by the reduction in retail sales which is directly related to our decision to exit the tobacco category, as well as the impact of Specialty Connect, again shifting sales from our retail segment into the PBM. ","It\u2019s important to note that on a comparable basis, SG&A as a percentage of sales at retail actually improved approximately 50 basis points. Within the Corporate segment, expenses were essentially flat to LY at $189 million and lower than expected. ","Operating margin for the total enterprise declined approximately 35 basis points in the quarter to 5.9%. Operating margin in the PBM declined approximately 10 basis points to 3.1%, while operating margin at retail declined by approximately 45 basis points to 10.2%. ","As Larry noted, retail operating profit decreased 1.3% in the quarter and was within our expectations. On a comparable basis, excluding tobacco, retail operating profit increased approximately 1.7%. PBM operating profit increased 40%, greatly exceeding our expectations. ","So now, going below the line on the consolidated income statement, net interest expense in the quarter decreased approximately $24 million from LY to $134 million, due primarily to lower average interest rates on our debt. Additionally, our effective tax rate was 38.9%, slightly lower than expected. The tax rate drove less than $0.01 of the EPS. Our weighted average share count was 1.1 billion shares, again inline with our expectations. ","So with that, now let me update you on our guidance. I\u2019ll focus on the highlights here, you can find the additional details of our guidance in the slide presentation that we posted on our website earlier this morning. As Larry said, given our outperformance in the first quarter, we are nearing our 2015 EPS range by raising the bottom of the range by $0.03. ","While we are pleased with where we are year-to-date, it is still very early in the year. Our core business is performing well. We now expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share in 2015 in the range of $5.08 to $5.19 per share reflecting strong year-over-year growth of 13% to 15.5% after we removed the impact in 2014 related to the loss on the early extinguishment of debt. ","GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $4.90 to a $4.91 per share. Consolidated net revenue growth is still expected to be7% to 8.25%. However, we narrowed our top-line outlook in the PBM. We now expect PBM revenue growth of 11.25% to 12.25%, 25 basis points higher than our prior guidance on the low-end. ","This revised guidance reflects our expectations for stronger growth within specialty, fueled by a combination inflation and new product mix as well as the impact of the higher net new business. ","We continue to expect retail revenue growth of 1.25% to 2.5% year-over-year. And inter-company revenue eliminations are now expected to be approximately 10.8% of segment revenues. Given the narrowing of the PBM\u2019s top-line, as well as the favorable purchasing and rebate economics that we\u2019ve seen, we are also narrowing guidance for operating profit growth in the PBM segment. We now expect PBM operating profit to increase 7.75% to 10.75% year-over-year, an increase of 100 basis points on the low end. ","Retail operating profit growth expectations remain in the range of 4.75% to 6.5%. And as I said before, our free cash flow guidance for the year remains in the range of $5.9 billion to $6.2 billion. ","So with that, now let me provide guidance for the second quarter. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.17 to $1.20 per share in the second quarter, reflecting growth of $3.75% to 6% versus Q2 of 2014. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $1.10 per share, to $1.13 per share in the second quarter. ","Within the retail segment, we expect revenues to increase 1.5% to 2% versus the second quarter of LY. Adjusted script comps are expected to increase in the range of 4.25% to 5.25%, while we expect total same-store sales to be down 1.25% to up 0.25%. The impact of the mover of specialty scripts to the PBM via Specialty Connect will be very muted this quarter given that we began this shift in May of last year. ","Additionally, recall that we expect the tobacco exit to have approximately 800 basis points negative impact on front store comps in the second quarter. In the PBM, we expect second quarter revenue growth of between 11.25% and 12.5% driven by continued strong growth in specialty and volumes. ","We expect retail operating to decrease 2% to 4% and PBM operating profit to increase 65% to 9% in the second quarter. Keep in mind that margins in last year\u2019s second quarter benefited from the finalization of California\u2019s Medicaid reimbursement rates. Recall, that that this finalization of the benefits, benefited retail gross margins by $53 million in the quarter and PBM gross margins by $60 million in the quarter. ","After removing the impact of that from the last year\u2019s results, operating profit growth in the PBM would be approximately 200 basis points higher and on a comparable basis, excluding the California Medicaid impact from last year\u2019s results, as well as tobacco, retail operating profit growth would be approximately 490 basis points higher. ","And again, starting with Analyst Day, over the past several months, we have been highlighting several timing factors that affect the cadence of profit delivery throughout this year. The timing of breakout for generics, our tobacco exits, and the investments that we\u2019ve made in the PBM\u2019s welcome seasons, are the factors expected to impact our cadence the most. ","And while we delivered a very strong first quarter, the cadence of profit growth is still expected to be back-half weighted. All things considered, we expect a strong back-half of the year. ","So in closing, let me leave you with three key thoughts. First, we posted solid comparable growth this quarter and we are off to a very good start for the year. Second, our 2015 outlook for both businesses as well as the enterprise overall is strong and we continue to benefit from the unique solutions we are delivering to the marketplace. ","And finally, we expect to continue to generate significant free cash and we are committed to use this capability to maximize the value we return to our shareholders through a disciplined capital allocation program. ","And so, with that, let me turn it back over to Larry. ","Larry Merlo ","Okay. Thanks, Dave and again, we are very pleased with our solid start to the year and our strong competitive position and our distinctive channel-agnostic solutions are resonating strongly in the marketplace. ","Now before we open it up for your questions, just a couple comments that, we\u2019ve all witnessed the unfortunate events unfold in Baltimore over the past several days and I think as you know, we operate countless stores in major cities and urban centers all across the country. ","And despite these acts of violence, we remain committed to these markets. We look forward to working together with community and business leaders in the rebuilding process. I want to take a minute and pay a special thanks to our colleagues who have worked tirelessly this past week to ensure that Baltimore residents continue to have access to need of medications and prescriptions, I think we are \u2013 all of us are very proud of the job that they\u2019ve been doing in a very difficult environment. So with that, let\u2019s go ahead and open it up for your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of George Hill, Deutsche Bank. Go ahead. ","George Hill ","Hey, good morning Dave and Larry and thanks for taking the question. I guess, why would sort of first is, did the cost containment and SG&A in the PBM has been pretty impressive and the cost cuts are pretty good. How much room should we think is left there to do considering the growth in the higher touch specialty medications and I guess, how should we think about how much lower SG&A can go? ","Larry Merlo ","Well, George, I\u2019ll start and I think Jon will jump in as well, but, keep in mind that, we had embarked upon a pretty sizable initiative as part of our platform consolidation that was targeted to deliver well over $200 million in tangible SG&A savings and we have largely completed that initiative and obviously, we are always looking to being more efficient and then and identify opportunities and I\u2019ll let Jon pick up from there. ","Jon Roberts","Yes, George, so the way we are thinking about our cost structure in the PBM is continuous improvement. So, how can we leverage automation, technology, streamline processes to make those processes more predictable and deliver them faster and at a lower cost. I think specialty is an opportunity as we look forward. PCS K9s are coming to the market. They are going to be lower cost and then typical for the average specialty drugs in the market today. So, we are actually looking at the delivery in a more efficient way than generally specialty which is higher touch, higher cost than what we see in there. So, it\u2019s \u2013 we are continuing to focus on it and we make progress every year. ","George Hill ","Okay, that\u2019s helpful and maybe a couple of quick housekeeping items. Larry, did you say that $4.1, that was net wins for 1-1-2016 starts? ","Larry Merlo ","No that\u2019s \u2013 that was 2015, George. That was the true-up of the 2015 selling season and as I mentioned, it\u2019s up about $0.5 billion from our update on our fourth quarter call. And then there were some late new wins that got added to 2015 and probably for the most part mid-year introductions. ","George Hill ","Okay, I wrote that wrong. And then the adjustment for the California Medicaid comp, that was combined retail PBM or it\u2019s just the retail side? ","Dave Denton","On the retail side, between California and tobacco, it\u2019s about 490 basis points, just in retail, it is about 200 basis points as it relates specifically to the PBM in the quarter.","Larry Merlo ","In terms of operating profit. ","George Hill ","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much guys. ","Larry Merlo ","Okay, thanks, George.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly, Credit Suisse. Go ahead.","Edward Kelly ","Yes, hi, good morning guys. Nice quarter. I wanted to ask a question actually about the PBM and EBIT growth, I mean, you actually, you meaningfully exceeded your guidance this quarter. Could you maybe just talk a little bit more about the drivers outside there relative to your expectation? And then, just a question on the outlook, because the only raise to lowering of the outlook into PBM as well as for the company in terms of EPS, is that just conservatism, is there something we should think \u2013 we are thinking about there? ","Dave Denton","Yes, hey, Ed, this is Dave, maybe I\u2019ll touch upon that. As you know, we obviously had a very solid \u2013 we are off to a very solid start to the year. Quite frankly of both businesses and certainly within the PBM versus our expectations. Just a couple of things, obviously, volumes in the PBM continued to be strong and we continue to be pleased with that. ","Secondly, we\u2019ve worked hard both from a cost of goods sold perspective and some of the buy side economics as well as the rebate yield has been productive for us and as you know, the vast majority \u2013 go back to our clients in the form of lower cost into their pharmacy benefit. As we see \u2013 so that\u2019s really produced the overdelivery in the first quarter. ","As we look through the balance of the year, it is very early. We\u2019ve gone through a quarter, we had a great quarter. I think core businesses are performing well and nicely. I think, there as you know we have a philosophy of looking through the full year. We are still focused on delivering a very solid year. Continually, there tends to be shifts in the marketplace as relates [Audio Gap] on that as time goes on. ","Edward Kelly ","Okay, great. And just one quick follow-up, you did mentioned reimbursement rate pressure in the release this quarter, I don\u2019t think \u2013 didn\u2019t there, there is something new or different or more intense as about that or we are just reading too much into that? ","Dave Denton","Ed, this is Dave. We continually talk about that. So there is nothing new or unique about that at this point in time. ","Edward Kelly ","Okay, great. Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel, Guggenheim Investments. Go ahead. ","John Heinbockel ","So Larry, a strategic question, obviously, you have the financial wherewithal to do a lot of things, but when you think about the footprint in the US versus where you are globally. Is there a priority of you\u2019d like to fill in and I am thinking different kinds of businesses, but filling in the US, as opposed to accelerate the global footprint or there of equal priority? ","Larry Merlo ","Well, John, I think, as you know, we\u2019ve talked a lot about \u2013 we feel very good about the opportunities that we still have here domestically and we\u2019ve been talking about that for the last couple of years and we continue to feel good about it. And as you think about the international, again as we\u2019ve alluded to in the past, we wanted to understand and build some \u2013 I describe it as muscle in terms of [Audio Gap]. ","That\u2019s what led to the Brazil decision and we\u2019ve been added about two years now. We\u2019ve got some very good learnings and I think it\u2019s \u2013 any next steps there would be pursued with the same financial discipline that I think we\u2019ve demonstrated in the past. ","John Heinbockel ","And just, going back to the PBM EBIT issue. Most of the time, right in the last 2.5 years, you\u2019ve exceeded expectations, this has been our quarter where you haven\u2019t been in line, but have exceeded pretty significantly and that sort of dovetailed with volume. Is it really sort of that simple that as you can beat on the volume side, you will handily beat on the bottom-line and does that speak to, I guess, the \u2013 right, the incremental flow through margin is simply that high. ","Dave Denton","John, this is Dave. I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s exactly should \u2013 within, as you know, within the PBM business, obviously, volumes certainly helps, but there is a lot of factors that drive profitability in that business and I\u2019d just take a good example, Medicare Part D within our insurance company additional volumes and categories there, actually you heard of profitability from an insurance perspective. ","So there is a lot of different lever there. I\u2019ll just conclude with saying that, we\u2019ve had a great first quarter. I think our outlook for the year remains extremely strong within the PBM and quite frankly within retail. ","John Heinbockel ","Okay, thanks. ","Larry Merlo ","Thanks, John.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Larsen, Leerink. Please go ahead. ","David Larsen ","Hi, congratulations on a very good quarter. Can you just talk about the 2016 and 2017 selling seasons? Where are you? Is the 2016 selling season, are you largely through it, most half \u2013 most of their decisions, and what are they looking for this year that maybe new relative to last year? Thanks.","Larry Merlo ","Dave, it\u2019s Larry. I\u2019ll go ahead and start and then, I am sure, others will jump in, but, Dave, I think we mentioned this in the past that, if I start with our renewals, we said that this is 2016 renewal season with typical recognizing we didn\u2019t have the big FEP contract. We said it was around $14 billion to $16 billion and as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we are about a third of the way through the renewal process which is, typical at this time of the year. I would say, the selling season again has gotten off to a solid start. ","We are seeing RFP activity pretty similar to what it was last year, which was a big increase over the prior year recognizing the, two years ago, there was \u2013 I think there was kind of a [Audio Gap] in the 2016 selling season and we\u2019ll have a lot more talk about on the second quarter call. ","Jon Roberts","Hey, David, just to build on what Larry has said, this is Jon. We are through most of the health plan opportunities, probably half way through the large employer opportunities and then you move into the balance of the market. And as far as, what people are looking for, they are obviously looking for us to be competitive on price and we have to be delivering good service to our members and clients. ","So the \u2013 has helped us from a service reputational standpoint, and obviously we continue to be competitive, rational on price. And then you add to that, all the things that we can do that are unique to our model that quite frankly is, it supports our clients with where healthcare is going. ","The fact that we\u2019ve integrated assets and can deliver capabilities like maintenance choice, Specialty Connect, MinuteClinic, our leadership position in specialty. So our ability to manage specialty, it\u2019s been not only under the pharmacy benefit and the medical benefits and this is as we talked about a very fast growing parts of the overall spend. And then third, our leadership in consultative services and Medicare Part D. ","So, as I am out talking to clients, they are looking for somebody that they know can deliver great service, deliver savings, and then all these unique offerings we bring, I think has really had a lot to do with our success. 2017, we are beginning to see some activity in 2017, again, large health plans, but I would say, we are very, very early with any 2017 opportunity. ","David Larsen ","Thanks a lot. ","Larry Merlo ","And David, I\u2019ll just emphasize one other point, we had our client forum back in April. We had record attendance. There was an extremely high level of engagement recognizing as I mentioned, clients have seen cost trend to go from around 4% to double-digits. So, we have \u2013 to Jon\u2019s point, we have solutions for them and there was an awful lot of engagement and education and understanding in terms of what that can specifically mean for their respective business. ","So there is certainly a lot of follow-up for it from the client forum, but I think, we feel very good about the tools and products and services that can be an important part of the solution for our clients. ","David Larsen ","Terrific. Thank you. ","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler, Barclays. Please go ahead.","Meredith Adler ","Hey, thanks for taking my question and great quarter. I was wondering if there is any update you can give us on whether Specialty Connect has led to an increase in volume? Are people responding? I know you are talking about everybody \u2013 the customers liking everything you are doing, but can you identify anything specific from Specialty Connect? ","Larry Merlo ","Well, Meredith, if you look at our specialty revenues, we are growing faster than the market even after adjusting for Coram. So, we believe Specialty Connect is delivering additional share and it is outperforming our initial expectations and we already have more than 50,000 patients \u2013 new patients that are utilizing the Specialty Connect product. ","Meredith Adler ","Great. And then, I was just wondering if you could talk about, what the benefit so far if you\u2019ve seen anything from eliminating tobacco? Have you seen a meaningful change in either the partnerships, or the dialog you are having with physician and hospital groups?","Larry Merlo ","Well, Meredith, the answer to that is yes, I mean, it\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019ve said in some of those meetings where we are talking about things that we can do and then historically the question will come up about you guys sold tobacco products don\u2019t you and literally deflects all the energy out of the room. ","So, I think it\u2019s reflected in the fact that, since the announcement just over a year ago, now we\u2019ve been able to accelerate the partnerships that are been established with leading health systems across the country. I think we are approaching 60 of those affiliations and while it\u2019s a category of one at this point and it did get some publicity. ","We\u2019ve talked about pharmacy networks migrating to more performance-based networks and we had one particular client, City of Philadelphia that decided to \u2013 as the nucleus of that performance network tied around pharmacy providers that do not sell tobacco products. So, I think we see some tangible benefits that they are probably more qualitative than quantitative at this point in time. But, I think we all believe that it will lead to further differentiation of our business model as we go forward. ","Meredith Adler ","Great. Thank you very much. ","Larry Merlo ","Thanks, Meredith.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays. Go ahead. ","Priya Ohri-Gupta ","Hey, thank you so much for taking my question. Dave, you guys have been pretty clear about your lease adjusted leverage, are you continuing to have some capacity in the balance sheet to manage towards that? But can you just remind us about sort of how much flexibility you have around moderating some of your future share repurchase activity where you have to engage in some sort of strategic activity that might temporarily take you above that leverage target in order to maintain your current rating? ","Dave Denton","That\u2019s a great question. We, as you know have been very focused on our leverage target at 2.7 times adjusted debt to EBITDA. We currently have been cycling a bit above that target, but we have additional capacity as we see here today. We \u2013 as you know have continued to have many dialogues with the rating agencies. ","We are very focused on maintaining our Triple D rating status. We do think we have flexibility over time to move our leverage target. It\u2019s strategically at $0.08 to be a tag over that as long as we commit to get ourselves back down to that level. We\u2019ve been very focused over time to make sure that our balance sheet maintained its leverage target at 2.7 times and we will work aggressively to get there. We think it\u2019s important that we have \u2013 we will maintain that rating. ","Priya Ohri-Gupta ","Thank you so much. ","Dave Denton","You are welcome. ","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill, JPMorgan. Go ahead.","Lisa Gill ","Thank you and good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on a couple of things. First, you have talked about earlier Larry, about the formulary management and the trend there. Can you or Jon just give us any indication as to the penetration that you have currently with your client base around these kinds of programs? Just to get an idea of how much future opportunity there is? ","Larry Merlo ","Yes, Lisa, it\u2019s a great question and today, we\u2019ve got about probably about half of our book that is in our formulary program, at the same time, there are \u2013 and by the way, that\u2019s largely in the employer space. There are health plans that adopts components of the formulary programs. So, I think there is certainly white space for that to grow and I think as our program continues to evolve and further develops and drive additional savings, I think that, there will \u2013 there is already additional dialog on those programs. ","Jon Robert","And then Lisa, this is Jon. As Larry talked about our trends for 2014 at 12.7%, about 60% of that trend is really driven by brands at inflation and the best way for our clients to manage overall trend and inflation is through formulary. ","So, we believe the marketplace is going to get much more aggressive, or clients are going to get much more aggressive in adopting even more aggressive formulary strategies beyond what they already have. It\u2019s probably the best way to manage our benefits. ","Lisa Gill ","And so would you expect that uptick as we go into 2016? I know, I saw Jon recently, we talked about your client forum and people really focused on where costs are going and what we are seeing as far as price increases go from the manufacturers. Should we see some kind of inflection in 2016 if you are having the conversations today? Or is it you think it\u2019s going to be a several year play out around increase in penetration? ","Jon Robert","Yes, I mean, Lisa, that\u2019s a good question. Yes, as Larry said, our employers which is half our book of business, the vast majority of those \u2013 80% of those have adopted our template formulary strategy that we introduced back in 2012. So, they\u2019ve actually taken a big step forward and then there are other opportunities for them that you can get more aggressive. ","With health plans, the majority of our health plans have adopted our Med D formulary strategies which again are very tightly controlled. So the market I think is primed and I think coming off this double-digit trend year of 2014, I have never seen people more open to understanding what opportunities they have to manage and as I said formulary is going to be a big part of that. So, we are talking to people now. ","I think we\u2019ll see, I do think it\u2019s going to take a few years to play out just like everything in our space. So I don\u2019t know that there is going to be a single inflection point. But I do very strongly believe that this is going to be a significant lever for our clients to manage the strength. ","Lisa Gill ","And if I can just understand, Dave, on the \u2013 if you think about, you hold the rebates in the first quarter, if I remember correctly, it\u2019s usually on a lag, so should we expect rebates to get better as we move throughout the year based on the programs that Jon is talking about, just you are trying to figure out the timing. So the rebates that we saw in the first quarter, was that primarily from things you initiated in the back half of 2015 and is that part of the driver for the back-half results? And then I\u2019ll stop there. ","Dave Denton","Lisa, that\u2019s a great question. I am not going to get into too much detail there. I would just tell you that, as we think about the long-term view of our business, we\u2019ve been very focused on \u2013 from a buy side economics perspective, what can we do to further reduce the cost to our clients and think about that as our procurement efforts around generics and then secondly, how do we reduce cost and continue to control cost in the branded category and that continues to be focus from a rebates perspective and the formulary management. I expect those to be continued to be drivers for this business at some level in the longer-term.","Lisa Gill ","Okay, great. Congratulations on a great quarter. ","Dave Denton","Thank you, Lisa. ","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Go ahead. ","Robert Jones ","Thanks for the questions. I guess,, maybe just move over to the retail side, David, I know you walk through the retail gross margin, pushes and pulls in your prepared remarks. So I wanted to make sure I understood the dynamics in the quarter, especially relative to your full year guidance for this margin to be flat. ","So, I know tobacco would have been a good guy year-over-year for the margins. So I was hoping you could maybe just walk through again what weighed on the margin in the quarter? Was there anything abnormal with pharmacy reimbursement, promotional activities? Just looking for a little more insight there. ","Dave Denton","No, I don\u2019t think there is anything that\u2019s really unique in the quarter from that perspective. As we said many times, is that the cadence of profit delivery will be back-half weighted versus front-half weighted and most of that ties to - obviously the tobacco exit and how we overlapped that. The California Medicaid comparison in Q2 of 2014, but probably more importantly the delivery of breakout for generics and the time to that driven really more back-half weighted versus front-half weighted. ","Robert Jones ","Okay, and then, just one more on a timing technical side, I was wondering if there was anything between 1Q and 2Q that maybe pulled 1Q up as far as the timing around EPS. I mean, I know the foresaid headwind from the California Medicaid reimbursement benefit a year ago will make 2Q a little bit worse off, but anything else that we should be aware of as far as just timing between 1Q and 2Q?","Dave Denton","No, I don\u2019t think there is anything that\u2019s really material in nature there. ","Robert Jones ","Okay, great. Thanks. ","Dave Denton","You are welcome. ","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin, Wolfe Research. Go ahead. ","Scott Mushkin ","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So I want to follow-up a little bit on John Heinbockel\u2019s question on \u2013 but a little bit different take on it not necessarily acquisitions, but kind of looking internally, Larry, when you look at opportunities in front of you with your current assets, where do you think there is the biggest potential to kind of improve what you are already doing. I mean, obviously the business is coming along, but where do you see some of the levers to get things even better? ","Larry Merlo ","Well, Scott, we are always looking to do better, whether it\u2019s to be more efficient with our business and in terms of attempting to deliver high levels of service at the lowest possible cost and we are always focused on opportunities there. And, we continue to be focused on share growth opportunities. ","We\u2019ve \u2013 and I think we\u2019ve gotten some tractions in terms of some of the things that we\u2019ve been able to do through our partnerships, whether it\u2019s with health plans, or other providers. Obviously, there is a lot that we can do when we happen to be the PBM. But, those opportunities are not limited to employers or health plans where we have to be the PBM and we\u2019ve gotten some traction there. ","Dave Denton","Hey, Scott, this is Dave. We\u2019ve been talking a lot on the call about the PBM and some of the growth engines around pharmacy. Maybe, we\u2019ll just spend a minute, I\u2019ll ask Helena to talk a bit about what we are doing to drive growth in the front of our business in the retail business.","Helena Foulkes","Yes, I think that, one of the things that I am encouraged by and it goes back to Meredith\u2019s question as well as since we announced our exit of tobacco, I think the marketplace we are seeing, a real focus that we have around driving health and beauty and we talked about at the Analyst Day in December, but the journey that we are on to really reposition ourselves as a leading health and beauty destination. ","So, when [Audio Gap] one was better health made easy, elevating beauty or customer-driven personalization, My CVS Store and digital innovation and I am really pleased we are making a lot progress on each of these areas. Just a couple examples, this year we are launching Phase 1 of our healthy food rollout that got expanded fresh offerings and healthy snacks. ","We\u2019ve also have a beauty elevation program which is launching across several thousand stores this year and really there we are in the process of repositioning CVS as the leader in beauty. We\u2019ve always had a leading market share, but we are really sort of doubling down on the in-store experience and differentiating for our customers. We talk a lot about personalization, Larry mentioned in his speech, but I think there is even more opportunity there to grow share and be more relevant for consumers and ultimately drive traffic and profitable sales. ","And then we have a focus this year, we are resetting 500 stores with something we call take high higher and these takes several of these elements together. We have expanded beauty, we\u2019ve got this healthy food set and so this really starts to take the old photo department out and put in healthy food and give customers a very different feel. Those stores are performing well. ","We\u2019ve also within this My CVS Store piece, really been looking at different clusters, and I think the things that we are very excited about is the Hispanic dominant cluster. We are starting to learn from our Navarro. And we\u2019ve actually started to reset some CVS Stores to take those learnings into place. ","And then we continue to invest in digital and innovation and see a lot of opportunity as Larry mentioned there to drive adoption and have people using both our stores and digital assets. So, a lot of things happening that we really haven\u2019t talked about, I am really proud of the team and I think both the merchants and the operators have a very strong focus on how we want to be unique and different and really own health and beauty. ","Scott Mushkin ","That\u2019s perfect. Thank you for such detailed answer.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette UBS. Go ahead.","Steven Valiquette"," All right, thanks. Good morning. ","Dave Denton","Good morning, Steve.","Steven Valiquette","Good morning, Dave. So, I guess, just for me the, obviously the 46% revenue growth in 1Q in specialty is pretty impressive. How do you think that stacks up versus your estimation of industry growth in specialty pharmacy in early 2015? And also, beyond Hep C, are there any other therapeutic categories worth mentioning that were growth drivers?","Dave Denton","Well, Steve, we actually see it outperforming the market growth and I think as I mentioned earlier to one of the questions even after adjusting for Coram, acknowledging that Coram was not comparable for the full quarter. I think we closed towards the end of January. So, we are pleased with the results that we are seeing and some of it\u2019s coming from new customer growth. Some of it\u2019s coming from our unique products and I\u2019ll ask Jon to comment on therapeutic classes.","Jon Robert","Yes, what we have seen over the last three years is over a 100 new indications for existing specialty drugs. So we are seeing growth really across all categories. Obviously, Hep C is the poster trial for growth, but we are seeing growth in RA and oncology is an example. ","And the other factor is as the population gets older, the older population uses six times as many specialty drugs as the balance of the population. So we are just seeing really tremendous growth across the entire spectrum of specialty and that\u2019s going to be fueled even further by new drug introductions, 88 new drugs over the last three years, we are going to see the PCS K9s be introduced later this year. ","While we think that\u2019s going to be a slow ramp, we think one in four people that are on stance today could be candidates for these new therapies are quite frankly more expensive than the generic statins that are available today. So we really view specialty as a growth driver as we look forward. ","Larry Merlo","And Steve, I\u2019ll just conclude this question a bit which is to be just a data point. As you said, specialty in the first quarter grew by about 40% - 46%. It\u2019s not just Hep C, if you take away Hep C and you look at our underlying growth in specialty, it\u2019s in the mid-30s. So we continue to perform well at the core in this business. ","Steven Valiquette ","Okay that's helpful. The one quick tie-in to this, I forgot if you disclosed this at the Analyst Day or not, but the - within the PBM, I forgot, are you disclosing just a rough range of what percent of the total PBM is sales that you categorize as specialty? I am guessing it somewhere maybe in the 20%, 25% range, but is that a just a good approximation? ","Dave Denton","No, there is the chart in Jon Robert\u2019s presentation and\/or Alan Lotvin's presentation that shows that number, last year's number which I believe is around $31 billion, moving to $37 billion was our expectations for this year. ","Steven Valiquette ","Got it. ","Jon Robert","And Steve, just to add-on to that, because those are a couple important points. We talked about the addressable specialty market we described that is excluding infused oncology. And I think in 2014, we estimated that market at $86 billion growing to more than $150 billion by 2018. So, we see a lot of opportunity for growth even without including the oncology space. ","Steven Valiquette ","Okay, that\u2019s great. Thanks.","Jon Robert","Thanks Steve.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser, Morgan Stanley. Go ahead. ","Ricky Goldwasser ","Yes, hi, good morning and thank you for taking my question. I have two follow-up questions here, first of all, about the membership growth, the script growth. Obviously, very strong claim growth. What percent of the growth is coming from your PBM members?","Dave Denton","Ricky, are you talking about on the retail side? ","Ricky Goldwasser ","No, I'm talking about pharmacy network claims?","Dave Denton","Yes, Ricky, maybe we are not following the question, because we would\u2026","Ricky Goldwasser ","So you know that.","Dave Denton"," I am seeing.","Ricky Goldwasser ","I think that in the past, you kind of you gave some details on Caremark membership accounting for 34% or 35% of your pharmacy scripts. ","Dave Denton","Yes. ","Ricky Goldwasser ","So when you think about kind of the growth that you've seen year-over-year, obviously it's pretty impressive, what percent of it is coming from kind of like your PBM client? Just trying to assess like the share gains within Caremark versus the rest of the market? ","Dave Denton","Yes, we kind of report that on an annual basis, you can \u2013 we monitor I believe reported on an annual basis, because when we went to clients, typically, we then \u2013 the work begins in a sense of understanding how to help that client become more productive and manage our cost better and part of that might be narrowing or introducing a product and are narrowing a network in to one of our channels and so that kind of grows over time. ","So we\u2019ve chosen to do that on an annual basis because of that. I will say just from a Caremark perspective, one thing that we do disclose, you can see it in the press release, you also see in the Q later today, is that we do talk about the \u2013 just the network claims volumes that we process on a quarterly basis and so you can see that kind of within those releases. ","Larry Merlo","Ricky, we have shown in the past that if you looked at on the retail side of the business if you looked at the script growth and the share growth, about half of it was coming from the Caremark book of business and the balance from the rest of the marketplace. ","Ricky Goldwasser ","Okay, that's very helpful. And then one follow-up on the specialty side, when you think about kind of like your membership, what percent of your PBM clients manage their specialty spend through you? And what percent carving out? Just to kind of like understand the opportunity there, in terms of penetration?","Dave Denton","Yes, Ricky it\u2019s about \u2013 today, it\u2019s about 60%.","Ricky Goldwasser ","Okay and that 60% of the employers or 60% of the total?","Dave Denton","Of the total. ","Ricky Goldwasser ","Okay, thank you.","Dave Denton","Thanks, Ricky.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Mark Wiltamuth with Jefferies. Go ahead","Mark Wiltamuth ","Hi, good morning. I wanted to dig in a little bit on the generic drug margin swing factors you see over the next couple of years and maybe if could let us know how you feel relative to your December analyst pronouncements, because it seems like Nexium launched earlier than you expected and I am curious where you stand on - and just in general, how are you feeling about the break-open pipeline?","Dave Denton","Mark, this is Dave. I think, it obviously is as we discussed a little bit earlier, the generic launch dates obviously move around a little bit. I\u2019ll just characterize this is not a matter of if these drugs are going to be productive for us from a break-open status, it\u2019s more of an issue of when they become productive for us from a generic stand \u2013 break-open status. ","Our main thesis, as we talked about kind of the three categories of drugs, be it branded drugs, limited supply generics and break-open generics or thesis over the long-term continues to hold as you increase both savings to customers and clients, when you move down that spectrum but also increased profitability to us as you move down that spectrum.","Mark Wiltamuth ","Okay and just on generics, maybe give us an update on Red Oak, you said you transferred the sourcing over to Red Oak and where do you stand on I guess, achieving cost savings there?","Dave Denton","That\u2019s a great question. We have transitioned all of that into Red Oak. We now have virtually all of our generic manufacturers on our program and we continue to be very excited about where we are but off to the opportunity over time to execute it to drive value from that program. Kind of beyond that, we don\u2019t disclose much more the math from a buy side perspective. ","Larry Merlo","Mark, I\u2019d just reiterate, we\u2019ve talked about this, the three ways in which value was extracted from Red Oak, one is the fixed payment schedule from Cardinal which began in Q4 last year. The second ability is through some established achievement of milestones that have been established between the two parents and then the third is just further reductions in our overall cost of products. So, and as Dave mentioned, we\u2019ve kind of \u2013 we\u2019ve framed that up under that umbrella, but we haven\u2019t gotten more granular.","Mark Wiltamuth ","And on that third point on the achieving of actual cost savings, is that something that ramps over like a two- to three-year period or does it happen pretty quickly?","Dave Denton","Well, Mark we have never done, okay, in terms of how to make the supply chain more efficient. So, I think it\u2019s something that will be ongoing. ","Mark Wiltamuth ","Okay, thank you. ","Dave Denton","Okay, thanks. We\u2019ll take one more question please.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Ross Muken, Evercore. Go ahead.","Ross Muken ","Thanks, guys. So I am going to ask a big picture question to close. So, Larry, lot going on in your industry, so one of your competitors is attempting to mimic your model at a smaller scale, another one of your competitors is moving more in the direction of retail and beauty and one of your PBM competitors was acquired, another is declaring its independence. ","As you think about CVS's positioning and strategy, how do you continue to evolve the model? What are the things you are looking for as the industry changes that kind of give you further confirmation that the share gains you've enjoyed are sort of sustainable and that you have all the assets and pieces you need to continue to do what you've done, which is put up tremendous results for many years here?","Larry Merlo","Ross, you did a really good job of summarizing the marketplace. But, I mean, we have always believed that the integrated PBM retail model, we think is the optimal model and I think that gets further highlighted by the fact that we are entering an era of we\u2019ve been describing as the retailization of healthcare, others are talking about it in terms of an era of consumer directed healthcare and you think about our model. ","It\u2019s really the only one that has deep connections and expertise in dealing with both payers of healthcare as well as consumers of healthcare and we\u2019ve talked about and we reiterated it on the call today all the different ways in which we can help solve this cost quality access conundrum that our healthcare system faces. ","So, I think as I mentioned earlier, we believe that we are in a great place. And at the same time we are always looking for ways that we can be more efficient and speak to payers and customers in a more surround sound fashion. And, I think we see opportunities domestically to continue to do that. ","Ross Muken ","Great. Thanks, guys.","Larry Merlo","Okay, thanks to everyone for your ongoing interest in CVS and as always, if you have any follow-up questions, you can reach Nancy. ","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude the conference for today. We thank you for your participation and have a great rest of the day everyone. "],"6186":["CVS Health Corp.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Monday, November 6, 2017.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike McGuire, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael P. McGuire - CVS Health Corp.","Thank you, Nelson. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I'm here this morning with Larry Merlo, President and CEO, and Dave Denton, Executive Vice President and CFO. Jon Roberts, Chief Operating Officer, and Helena Foulkes, President of CVS Pharmacy, are also with us today and will participate in the question-and-answer session following our prepared remarks. During the Q&A, please keep in mind that it is our policy to not comment on rumors or speculation in the marketplace.","Also, in order to provide more people with a chance to ask their questions, please limit yourself to no more than one question with a quick follow-up. Please note that we have posted a slide presentation on our website that summarizes the information in our prepared remarks, as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance. Our Form 10-Q will be filed this afternoon and that too will be available on our website.","I do have one quick reminder. Our annual Analyst Day is scheduled for Tuesday, December 12 in New York City. During it, you'll have the opportunity to hear from several members of our senior management team, who will provide a comprehensive update of our strategies for driving long-term growth as well as our 2018 guidance.

In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find the reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of our website. And as always, today's call is being webcast on our website, and it will be archived there following the call for one year.","Now, I'll turn this over to Larry Merlo.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Okay. Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today.","Starting with our third quarter results, total company revenues increased 3.5%, at the midpoint of our guidance range. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.50, at the high-end of our guidance, despite the impact from the devastating hurricanes that swept through Texas, Louisiana, Florida and Puerto Rico. And I'll have more on that in just a few minutes.","On an adjusted basis, operating profit was down 13.1%, within expectations, reflecting performance in the PBM business that was in line with expectations, along with performance in the Retail\/Long-Term Care segment that was below expectations due to the hurricanes. We generated approximately $2.4 billion of free cash during the quarter and $7 billion year to date.","Now, given our year-to-date performance and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are narrowing our full-year adjusted EPS guidance range and raising the midpoint. We currently expect to achieve adjusted earnings per share for 2017 of $5.87 to $5.91, reflecting year-over-year growth of 0.5% to 1.25%, and that compares to our previous range of $5.83 to $5.93. And Dave will discuss the details of both our results and guidance in more detail in his remarks.","Now, before turning to the business update, I want to provide some color on the hurricanes, not only in regard to the financial impact to our business, but also in regard to the recovery efforts. The considerable damage these storms left in their paths cannot be understated, and our stores and colleagues were not immune to this destruction. In total, about 925 of our stores were closed for some period of time, and today, 11 remain closed. And we estimate that the financial impact is approximately $55 million, which are costs primarily to cover insurance deductibles.","Now, as a vital part of these communities, we played roles both in advance of the storms and afterwards to aid recovery efforts. Our proprietary messaging platform enabled rapid and urgent communications to patients who were in the hurricanes' paths, and this helped ensure delivery of specialty and other medications for patients in transition between their homes and safe shelter locations.","Additionally, more than $10 million in cash, products and supplies has been raised and donated to support the impacted communities, and we are incredibly grateful to our colleagues who, while dealing with their own personal challenges, made extraordinary efforts in helping and aiding our customers. The rebuilding process for many of these communities will take a long time, and we'll continue to do our part in providing support.","Now, turning to the business update, and I'll start with PBM. As you're all aware, we signed a five-year agreement with Anthem to provide services to support their new PBM, IngenioRx, beginning in January 2020. As part of the agreement, we'll manage certain services for IngenioRx, including claims processing and prescription fulfillment through our mail order and specialty pharmacies.","These services will be private labeled to IngenioRx in order to ensure a seamless experience for Anthem members. And through this relationship, Anthem will have the ability to grow their business and enhance their value proposition, as we help them improve their financial performance, execute operationally and optimize IngenioRx's control of critical PBM functions.","Additionally, Anthem is very focused on improving patient health outcomes and will be relying on our expertise in patient messaging and engagement at the point-of-sale through our multiple patient touch points to support IngenioRx in this goal. So, we're very excited about this new relationship, and we look forward to starting the implementation and to working with Anthem to provide services to help ensure coordinated holistic care for their members.","Combined with our continuing success in winning new business, we believe that this contract is further validation of the important role that CVS Health's integrated and innovative pharmacy care model plays in today's healthcare system. Now, as for the 2018 selling season, we've continued to make good progress. With another $600 million in new wins, we currently have gross wins of approximately $6 billion and net new business of $2.3 billion.","As I said last quarter, these new business numbers include the previously announced loss of the FEP specialty contract, but do not include any impact from our individual Med D PDP, which I'll touch on shortly. To-date, we've completed more than 90% of our client renewals for 2018, and that's roughly in line with where we were at this point last year, and our retention rate stands at about 97%.","Additionally, we recently announced the new 30,000-store performance-based pharmacy network that will be anchored by CVS Pharmacy and Walgreens, along with up to 10,000 community-based independently-owned pharmacies. The network is designed not only to deliver unit cost savings, but also to improve clinical outcomes that will help lower overall healthcare costs for clients and their members.","This network is an innovative solution that utilizes a value-based management approach in order to achieve improved outcomes through adherence for five high-impact, highly-utilized drug classes. It also helps to provide cost savings through formulary compliance. So, we're excited to make this available to our clients for implementation beginning in March of next year, and we look forward to improving overall health and wellness, while lowering cost for patients and payers.","Turning to our specialty business, revenue growth in the quarter was 10.6%, and the slowdown in revenue growth compared to prior years is being driven by several factors. First, we are seeing lower levels of inflation on specialty drugs, consistent with the marketplace.","Second, we're seeing an increase in generic dispensing within specialty, which as you know is a drag on the top line, but a benefit to margin. And lastly, the mix of drugs within our book is shifting towards lower-priced therapies as well as fewer hep C scripts. And despite these top line pressures, overall growth in specialty pharmacy remains strong and our specialty business continues to expand and gain share.","Before turning to Retail, let me touch briefly on SilverScript, our Med D PDP. As we reported last quarter, SilverScript qualified in 32 of the 34 regions, which enables us to retain all of the auto-assignees we currently serve, and importantly, receive new auto-assignees in all 32 regions. The 2018 annual enrollment period is currently underway, and for enrollees, we have worked to reduce premiums for the majority of SilverScript plans across the country, providing plan beneficiaries continued access to a $0-deductible for drugs on all tiers.","I'm also pleased to note that, for the third consecutive year, SilverScript achieved a 4-star performance rating from CMS for 2018, surpassing industry standards in delivering value, clinical outcomes and customer service. And of the Med D lives under Caremark management, 83% achieved a 4 or a 5-star rating, which speaks to the outstanding value we deliver for our health plan clients.","Now, moving on to third quarter results in the Retail\/Long-Term Care segment, total same-store sales decreased 3.2%, slightly better than expectations, with pharmacy same-store sales down 3.4%. Pharmacy sales comps were negatively impacted by approximately 435 basis points due to recent generic introductions.","Same-store prescription volumes increased 0.3% on a 30-day equivalent basis, slightly ahead of expectations, and the decisions to restrict CVS Pharmacy from participating in the TRICARE and fully-insured prime networks continued to negatively impact pharmacy sales and script comps. The network changes had about a 420 basis point negative impact on volumes. And when adjusting for the network changes, same-store prescription volumes would have been up 4.5% in the quarter, again, on a 30-day equivalent basis.","Now, as we look to return to healthy growth, we continue to be very focused on partnering with all payers to drive volumes and capture share, and our partnerships with Optum, Cigna and Express Scripts have seen some uptake from clients and the pipeline of additional opportunities in the coming years remains promising.","Additionally, CVS Pharmacy will be preferred in several more Med D networks for the 2018 plan year, and these include the SilverScript Choice plan as well as the preferred networks for Aetna\/First Health and WellCare. And we believe that being preferred in these networks will help us to further drive prescription volume in the growing Med D market.","Now, turning to the front store, comps decreased 2.8%, sequentially in line with Q2 comps after adjusting for the Easter shift, and as it's been the case this year, the decline in front store comps reflects a number of factors, including our decision to rationalize our promotional strategies by scaling back on mass promotions and reducing our circular page count. Softer customer traffic was partially offset by the continued increase in the average front store customer basket.","Our personalization and promotional strategies have been successfully contributing to growth in front store profitability, as has our growth in store brands. Our store brands represented 23.2% of front store sales in the quarter, and that's up about 25 basis points from a year ago, and it remains an area of strength and opportunity. As a result of all of these factors, front store gross margin once again improved in the quarter versus last year, despite the decline in front store comps.","Now, before I turn it over to Dave, I would like to say a word about a critical crisis in American healthcare, and that's the alarming and heartbreaking opioid epidemic. As you know, in September, we announced an expansion of our enterprise-wide initiatives to fight the epidemic, leveraging the national presence of CVS Pharmacy with the capabilities of CVS Caremark.","With this expansion, we are further strengthening our commitment to help providers and patients balance the need for these powerful medications with the risk of abuse and misuse. Over the past few years, we've been focused on prevention, collection and partnership, and as a result, we've collected and safely disposed of more than 100 metric tons of unwanted medications.","We've also worked with 43 states to expand access without a prescription to the opioid overdose-reversal drug, naloxone, to help save lives and give people a chance to get the help they need for recovery. And through our Pharmacists Teach program that connects CVS pharmacists with schools in their local communities, we have educated nearly 300,000 students on the dangers of prescription drug abuse.","However, there's more that needs to be done. And as a leading provider of pharmacy care, we believe it is time to institute limits on the quantity of opioids dispensed to patients who are receiving an opioid for the first time in the treatment of acute injuries and to ensure that the prescription fits the medical condition.","So utilizing our retail pharmacies and our PBM services, we will work with physicians, patients, plan sponsors, and other stakeholders to limit the supply of opioids dispensed for certain acute prescriptions to seven days while continuing to ensure patients with critical needs have access to appropriate care.","And with that, let me turn it over to Dave for the financial review.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Thank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. First, as I typically do, I'd like to begin by highlighting how our disciplined approach to capital allocation continues to enhance shareholder value. I'll follow that discussion with a detailed review of our third quarter results, and then discuss our expectations for the remainder of 2017.","As it relates to our capital allocation program, let's begin with our dividend payout. We paid $511 million in dividends in the third quarter and $1.5 billion year to date. Our dividend payout ratio stands at approximately 39.6% over the trailing four quarters, which includes the impact of the non-GAAP items in both years. Excluding these non-GAAP items, we remain well on our way to our target of 35% by the end of 2018.","During the third quarter, we've repurchased approximately 5 million shares for $400 million. Year to date, we've repurchased approximately 55 million shares for approximately $4.4 billion or $78.68 per share. For the full year, our guidance includes the completion of $5 billion of share repurchases, reflecting an increase of approximately 11% versus last year. So again, between dividends and share repurchases, we've returned nearly $6 billion to our shareholders in the first nine months of 2017, and we expect to return more than $7 billion for the full year once the repurchases are complete.","As Larry mentioned, we have generated nearly $7 billion of free cash in the first nine months of the year. The strong year-to-date performance is abnormally high due to the build-up of a payable for CMS associated with the current Medicare Part D plan year as well as the timing of receipts.","In Q4, we are expecting negative free cash flow for the first time in a long time, as we plan to settle the CMS payable associated with the 2016 plan year that was built up last year. Given this, we are maintaining our prior guidance for the full year and continue to expect to produce free cash of between $6 billion and $6.4 billion in 2017.","Now turning to the income statement, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.50 per share, at the high end of our guidance range. These results are on a comparable basis, and the reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted earnings per share can be found in the press release as well as in the Investor Relations portion of our website.","As Larry noted, the PBM segment delivered profit within our expectations while the Retail\/Long-Term Care segment's profit declined more than expected, primarily driven by the effects of the recent hurricanes. Excluding the impact of the hurricanes, Retail\/Long-Term Care's profit was within our expectations.","Our effective tax rate beat our forecast, allowing us to deliver adjusted earnings per share at the high end of our guidance. GAAP diluted EPS was $1.26 per share, above our expectations, with the negative impact of the hurricanes offset by the lower than expected loss on the settlement of the defined benefit pension plan as well as the better tax rate.","Let me quickly walk down the P&L to provide some additional color. On a consolidated basis, revenues in the third quarter increased 3.5% to $46.2 billion. In the PBM segment, revenues increased 8.1% to $32.9 billion. PBM growth in the quarter was 40 basis points below the low end of the guidance range. This was primarily driven by lower than expected volumes.","The year-over-year growth was driven largely by increases in the pharmacy network claims, brand inflation, and growth in specialty pharmacy. Partially offsetting this growth was an approximate 100 basis point increase in our generic dispensing rate versus the same quarter of LY to 87%.","In our Retail\/Long-Term Care business, revenues decreased 2.7% in the quarter to $19.6 billion, beating our expectations. This was driven primarily by stronger than expected pharmacy same-store sales and script growth, despite the network changes we've been discussing. Retail\/Long-Term Care's generic dispensing rate increased approximately 140 basis points to 87.2%.","Turning to gross margin, operating expenses, operating profit, and the tax rate, the numbers that I'll cite reflect non-GAAP adjustments in both current and prior periods when applicable, which have been reconciled on our website. Keep in mind that our guidance for the third quarter also reflected these adjustments. The consolidated company gross margin was 15.4% in the quarter, a contraction of approximately 135 basis points compared to Q3 of 2016.","In addition to each segment's performance, the decline is due in part to a mix shift in our business, as the lower-margin PBM business continues to grow faster than our Retail\/Long-Term Care business.","Gross profit dollars decreased 4.9% versus the same quarter of last year, primarily due to the loss of scripts in the Retail\/Long-Term Care segment from the network changes we have previously discussed, as well as the continued pricing and reimbursement pressures across the enterprise.","Within the PBM segment, gross margin declined 90 basis points from Q3 of 2016 to 5%. This was primarily driven by the ongoing timing of profits within Medicare Part D operations, as members worked through their benefits more slowly this year versus last year. This was primarily offset with the improvement in GDR as well as favorable purchasing economics. Gross profit dollars were down 8.4%, also primarily due to the shift in the timing of Medicare Part D profits into the fourth quarter.","Gross margin in the Retail\/Long-Term Care segment was 29%, down approximately 25 basis points from last year. The decline in gross margin rate was primarily driven by lower reimbursement rates that continued to pressure pharmacy margins. This pressure was partially offset by an increasing generic dispensing rate as well as the increased front store margin that Larry mentioned earlier. Gross profit dollars decreased 3.6% year over year, mainly due to the loss of scripts from the network changes as well as the continued reimbursement pressures.","Consolidated operating expenses as a percent of revenues improved approximately 35 basis points to 10% compared to Q3 of 2016, primarily driven by expense leverage from the PBM's growth in revenues during the quarter. We saw a consolidated operating profit decline which was consistent with our expectations. Operating margin for the total enterprise declined by 105 basis points in the quarter to 5.4%.","Operating margin at PBM declined approximately 70 basis points to 4.1%, while operating margin in Retail\/Long-Term Care declined by approximately 110 basis points to 8% on an adjusted basis. For the quarter, operating profit for the PBM was within expectations, while operating profit for Retail\/Long-Term Care was less than expected. The PBM segment posted an operating profit decline of 7.2%, reflecting the shift in Medicare Part D profits to Q4 of this year compared to 2016.","If the Medicare PDP business was excluded from all periods, PBM year-over-year growth in Q3 was more in line with the growth that we saw in Q2, as I've mentioned last quarter, and we expect a similar cadence in Q4. The Retail\/Long-Term Care segment posted an operating profit decline of 14.3%, which includes the impact of the recent hurricanes. Excluding the hurricane costs, the operating profit decline for Retail\/Long-Term Care would have been within our expectations.","Now, going below the line in the consolidated income statement, net interest expense in the quarter decreased approximately $8 million from last year to $245 million, due primarily to paying down debt in the fourth quarter of 2016 and a lower average interest rate on the debt that remains outstanding.","Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 37.9%, which was better than expected. This was driven in part by the delta between our estimate of the discrete tax benefits we'd see from share-based payment accounting and what we actually experienced during the quarter. As we discussed in prior earnings call, the increased tax rate volatility is caused by changes in both share price and the discretionary actions of employees that can exercise vested options. Our weighted average share count was just over 1 billion shares, in line with our expectations.","So with that, let me now turn to our 2017 guidance, and I'll start with our revised guidance for this year. We currently expect to achieve adjusted EPS for 2017 of $5.87 to $5.91, reflecting year-over-year growth of 0.5% to up 1.25%, while narrowing the previous range of $5.83 to $5.93, we've also raised the midpoint by $0.01 per share. This takes into account the third quarter results at the top of expectations despite the impact of the hurricanes as well as favorability in the tax rate for the remainder of this year.","GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $4.98 to $5.02, and includes the lower than anticipated defined benefit pension plan settlements. You can find a reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted EPS in our press release and on the Investor Relations portion of our website. Now with only a few months left in the year, we are updating our revenue and operating profit guidance to better reflect our current expectations.","In the PBM segment, we are lowering the top end of the revenue guidance to a range of 8% to 8.5%, reflecting lower drug price inflation and slightly lower claims growth of 1.77 billion to 1.79 billion claims. In the Retail\/Long-Term Care segment, we are narrowing and raising guidance for revenues due to higher script volume expectations.","We now expect Retail\/Long-Term Care revenues to decline 2.25% to 2.75%, total comps to decline 2.75% to 3.25% and script comps of flat to up 0.25%. These changes result in a narrowing of our consolidated net revenue growth range to 3.25% to 3.75%.","Turning to operating profit. We are narrowing the PBM's operating profit guidance range to 6% to 6.5%, to better reflect current volume expectations and changes in the drug mix. We are lowering the Retail\/Long-Term Care operating profit guidance range to down 9.5% to 10.25% to reflect the impact of the hurricanes.","Taking these changes into account, we'd lower the top end of the consolidated operating profit guidance range and now expect operating profit to decrease 5% to 5.75%. This change in operating profit was offset by the improved outlook on the effective tax rate for the full year 2017, allowing us to take the midpoint of our adjusted EPS range up by $0.01.","Before moving to the fourth quarter guidance, let me quickly remind you of the timing factor affecting Q3, Q4 profit cadence. In 2017, we are seeing Medicare Part D members move more slowly through their benefits that we did in 2016.","As I said earlier, this negatively affected Q3 profitability in 2017, we expect it to positively affect Q4. So on the fourth quarter, excluding certain non-GAAP items described on our website, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.88 to $1.92, up 10% to 12.5% from Q4 of 2016.","GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $1.75 per share to $1.79 per share. You can find the details of guidance in the slides that we posted online before this call, but let me take a moment to point out a few items.","For the fourth quarter, we expect enterprise revenues to be up 2.5% to 4.25%, driven primarily by PBM growth. Total same-store sales at retail are expected to be down 1% to 2.75%, and adjusted script comps are expected to increase by 1% to 2%.","Additionally, enterprise operating profit is expected to grow by 5.75% to 8%, again, driven primarily by PBM growth and the shift in timing of Medicare Part D profitability. And as Mike said, we'll provide 2018 guidance at our Analyst Day in December.","Our results in the third quarter and our expectations for the remainder of this year are evidence of our ability to execute on the plans that we've provided earlier this year. We are committed to returning to healthy earnings growth and continuing to drive shareholder value. The steps we have taken over the past year position us well for the opportunities that lie ahead in the healthcare marketplace. We continue to work diligently towards the long-term targets that we provided at last year's Analyst Day.","And with that, I will now turn it back over to Larry Merlo.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Okay. Thanks, Dave, and before we move into the Q&A, I do want to spend a few minutes talking about the evolving consumer expectations and what that may mean in being a convenient and affordable pharmacy destination.","We have always been focused on making pharmacy and everyday healthcare better for patients. It has been and continues to be, for us, a point of differentiation. At the same time, we know there's more to be done.","In terms of convenience, consumers want their medications on their schedules, and we've built a comprehensive network to serve those patients with a combination of 9,700 retail pharmacies in local communities all across the country and sophisticated mail order facilities, all of this powered by more than 30,000 clinical professionals.","Our mail order services provide a convenience that meets the needs of certain patients on maintenance medications. However, some patients prefer to get their medications immediately. And for this group, there's no faster way than by walking into a CVS Pharmacy.","Our pharmacists are readily available to provide counseling, answer questions and get a prescription in a patient's hands in 15 minutes.","It's also important to remember that one in five prescriptions have some type of clinical intervention that requires pharmacists' involvement. And with that in mind, despite the complexity and variation of regulations across all states, we built streamline connections utilizing both people and technology with insurance companies PBMs and providers to significantly and safely reduce the amount of time consumers have to wait for these issues to be resolved.","But there are also those with an immediate need who are unable to make it to a CVS either because of time transportation or mobility issues. And today, we are announcing that starting next year we will bring the pharmacy to our patients' doorsteps, with nationwide next-day delivery from our stores.","And in select metro areas, we will even offer same-day delivery. Additionally, we're also announcing that we will offer free same-day delivery for pharmacy and a curated selection of front store products in Manhattan starting on December 4.","And with nearly 70% of the U.S. population living within 3 miles of one of our stores, CVS Pharmacy is the most convenient choice for delivery to your doorstep. We also recognize that medication costs are a concern for all patients. And it's important to know that more than 50% of the prescriptions we fill in our stores cost patients $4 or less and 75% of those prescriptions cost patients $10 or less.","We use our deep connections with PBMs and insurance providers to help patients maximize their insurance benefit using our clinical expertise to find the lowest cost therapeutically equivalent option on their plans.","And we are investing in tools to make it easier for patients to navigate the confusing healthcare market and improve the understanding of their benefit designs. And we apply manufacturer coupons to help further reduce the cost. On average, our patients are realizing $55 in savings on each prescription that is coupon-eligible.","In addition, we aggressively source generic alternatives for consumers and use our scale to make care more affordable as we did with Adrenaclick, a lower-cost alternative to EpiPen.","We also continue to invest in our digital properties, including our highly rated retail mobile app. It helps patients manage when and how they want to receive their medications, set reminders and manage medications for their families all in one place.","And to-date, the CVS Pharmacy app has been downloaded more than 21 million times. At the same time, we currently have 50 million people enrolled in our text message program which enables them to easily refill their prescriptions through their mobile devices and it's as simple as typing yes when prompted. So I think you can see we have a solid foundation that's been built on compelling scale, unsurpassed reach and extensive pharmacy expertise.","And we have a plan for how to do even more to make pharmacy an everyday healthcare even better. And we look forward to sharing this in more detail with you at our December 12th Analyst Day.","So with that, let's go ahead and open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Mohan Naidu with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.","Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks for taking my questions. Larry, can you comment a little bit on what do you think of vertical integration to leverage your physical store location that can possibly influence the plan design in such a way that you can actually use the stores to deliver more care? Thanks.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Yes, Mohan, we have always been very thoughtful in terms of how we can improve access, okay, and at the same time, ensure that the care that we're providing meets our quality standards. And you put those two together, okay, it results in improving outcomes and lowering cost. And I think we've demonstrated capabilities of doing that, whether it's the role it MinuteClinic plays or the role that home infusion plays. And it's something that we continue to evaluate and something that's always on our radar screen for evaluating and deciding what's next.","Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Just to follow-up on that, around the MinuteClinic, do you have any immediate plans to add more services than what you do right now?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah, Mohan, we have been \u2013 I think you've seen over the last couple of years where we have added services. And we have in partnership with some of the health system affiliations that we have. We have begun to triage patients, where we are actively managing patients who have been diagnosed with some type of chronic care condition, in an effort to ensure that they're following their regimens of care, in an effort to keep them healthy.","Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Larry.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Hill with RBC. Please proceed.","George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. Good morning. Thanks guys for taking the question. I'm going to follow-up on Mohan's question, Larry, a little bit, and there's obviously been a lot of talk about vertical integration. Can you talk about what you've seen in your non-pharmacy businesses as it relates to beneficiary steerage where you partner with payers? I'm sure you see the claims information for people who walk into MinuteClinics or who use the home infusion business.","I guess, from plans that you are more tightly aligned with, versus plans that you are tightly aligned with. And I guess, there's a lot of us sit here and think about the vertical integration story that plays out in the market. I guess, could you just walk through how you've seen between different partnerships and different segments in the book of business, how much the beneficiary steerage capability kind of enhances the offering?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Look, George, listen, I'll start and I'm sure others will jump in. But when you refer to steerage, we think about the role that plan design plays, okay. And if you look at MinuteClinic as an example, that's an offering that's available to our PBM clients, okay. And there are many examples out there where as you look at overall healthcare costs adjusted for age and health status, you see overall healthcare savings anywhere from 8% to 12% lower. And in some respects, it's a simple as some of the treatment and visits migrating out of the emergency room and into the retail clinics.","I think one of the other elements that we focus on is how does site of care become a variable, recognizing that there is a cost delta when you look at where that care is being administered. So if you jump over to infusion, we know that providing that care in the home versus in an ambulatory infusion site or perhaps in an outpatient segment of the hospital, there is a pretty dramatic cost differential there. And so I think we have been able to demonstrate that our local presence, the fact that that can lead to direct engagement with customers and patients and as a result, produce better outcomes at a reduced cost.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Hey, George, it's Dave here. I'd just add to that. If you think about moving members into one of our channels because we now touch many elements of healthcare given all the assets that we have, when those members move in our channel, typically what we have been able to prove quantitatively is we deliver better outcomes in totality to those members. So there's an incentive to do that, number one, just from an outcomes perspective.","And then secondly, it's not always about care delivery in the MinuteClinics, it's really about patient engagement. And to the degree that we engage with those patients, we can educate them on where is the best site of care or how best can they engage in the healthcare system at the most cost-effective point of entry. I think those two components really demonstrate our ability to improve outcomes and engage with that member to advance their journey on improving their healthcare.","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","Hey, George, this is Jon. The only other thing I would add is that we see our clients offering an X or a range of plan designs that allow us to move patients into our channel. So one can simply be access to the patient where we explain to them that they don't need to go to the hospital for infusion, but they can actually get it done at home. And so we see a lot of patients not even realizing they can do that, so that becomes an incentive. We see plans creating incentives to move them into one of our channels, which is \u2013 Larry talked about that with MinuteClinic and the reduction of copays. And finally, there's the actual narrowing of the networks which we'll see for both Coram and some of our other assets.","George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's super-helpful. And I guess for my quick follow-up, either Larry or Dave, I think we're scratching our heads a little bit on what I would call the macro Rx softness. If you guys were trying to pick one driver to attribute to it, is it benefit design, is it copay design, is it payer mix, are you seeing an uptick in abandonment? I'm just intrigued that volumes across the space continue to be pretty soft.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","George, we're not seeing anything that would tell us that patients are not taking their prescriptions as prescribed. And I think if you look in the quarter, we've talked a little bit about the hurricanes, and I think that was tremendously disruptive because you see boluses of activity leading up. During the peak periods, you certainly see some unevenness in volume. And I would say that as you look at the seasonal related scripts, people are getting their flu shots, but we're certainly not seeing any incidence of the cold and flu season at this point in time. So that may be contributing a little bit to some of what we're seeing currently.","George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, I appreciate the color. Thank you.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee with Cowen and Company. Please proceed.","James Auh - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi, this is James on for Charles. Same-store sales this quarter were better than expected despite the hurricane. Can you give us some insight into what drove that performance?","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Hey, James, this is Dave. I think what we've continued to do is, I'll say, rationalize our promotional spend across the channel. And I think what's important as you look at same-store sales, it's probably more important to look at the gross profit yield on those. You're seeing our gross profit, certainly in the front, continue to improve on a sequential basis and a year-over-year basis. And naturally the focus that we have. I would say, we were slightly better than expected, but I don't think our performance was out of line any major respects.","James Auh - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, great. And also, it seems like the uptake on the PBM side for Part D is more in 4Q compared to last year. Could you just explain why the shift in timing compared to last year?","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","So mostly this was driven by the rate of beneficiaries using their Medicare Part D policy. And so they're moving through that benefit this year more slowly than what they moved through last year. And as you know, as the insurance company hits certain reinsurance corridors, the insurance company either earns, I'll say, higher profits during that period or actually can even be in a loss position during the timing. Given that cadence of beneficiary utilization, profits this year are being shifted out of Q3 and into Q4. And so we have very good line of sight to that.","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","And this is Jon. Just to add a couple more specifics, so the initial coverage limit was raised this year by $400, so that means members got to the donut hole a little slower. And then we're seeing less inflation. So I think those two factors is exactly what's causing what Dave explained.","James Auh - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Thank you.","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much and good morning. Larry, I just want to talk about the business model. And listening to what you had to say earlier of being paid for better outcomes, Dave talking about patient engagement, education getting paid around that, how do you get paid? Do you have to own the vertical integration to truly be paid for that, or do you see a shift in the model where you start to take more risk like you do with other risk products, where the dollar amount that you're paid is based on some outcome or your pharmacist is getting paid for that incremental patient engagement, or is it just simply the script versus the MinuteClinic visit?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Lisa, it's Larry. Listen, when you think about our business model, you think about the fact that over several years now, we've assembled a series of assets that create countless touch points with which we can engage with the patient, with the consumer, in an effort not just to improve access to care, but create better outcomes, and in doing so, reduce costs.","So from an economics point of view, if we're not providing that fulfillment, then there's not an opportunity to do those other things. So we benefit from that share of going through one of our distribution channels. I think you've heard us begin to talk about the next evolution of that, taking elements of risk, and Jon can touch on the Transform Care programs, which we're in the process of marketing, at least beginning with diabetes and going from there.","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","And I'll use diabetes as an example. It continues to be a trend driver for plan sponsors, and that's both on the pharmacy side and medical side with 30 million people with diabetes. And so our Transform Care Diabetes program delivers on the objectives of lowering drug costs plus lowering overall healthcare cost. And so, we combine a managed formulary with our diabetes network to control cost and guarantee a year-over-year diabetes trend of 10% or less, and that really depends on the clients mix.","And then, for patients, we provide clinical support through diabetes coaching, pharmacist counseling, MinuteClinic monitoring, as well as digital solutions like a connected glucometer to help patients better manage their condition. So, that's an example where payers are willing to move those members into our channel. We get value there, and we're delivering unit cost savings on the drug as well as lower overall healthcare cost.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And then, just as a follow-up, Larry, your comments around CVS Health value proposition sounds like it's really geared towards all of the talk around Amazon and why CVS is well positioned even in the face of potentially Amazon coming into this market. Is there anything that you think you could do better or how do you think about the Amazon's threat as it pertains to CVS?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Lisa, listen, I'll start and maybe I'll ask Helena to jump in as well. But your \u2013 in our organization and in our culture, we're never done, okay. So, we're always listening to our customers, and I think being good listeners helps us understand where they have friction points that we need to work to eliminate. So, we think we do a good job, we think we've got a lot of ways in which we can serve the customer, and we're always looking for ways in which we can do that better.","Helena B. Foulkes - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah. I would agree. I think, Lisa, what we spend a lot of time talking about is serving the customer wherever, whenever and however she wants. And as Larry said earlier, getting a prescription in 15 minutes or less is super convenient, but we wanted to add on to that. And so, that's why you see us announcing what we did today. But we're also doing even more just to make the in-store experience great, adding clinical programs. So, we keep pushing ourselves very hard to solve the customer pain points.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks so much.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Thanks, Lisa.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for the questions. I guess just to follow-up on some of the announcements with the next-day delivery for all products and same-day for some, is there anything you can share as far as what you would expect the potential impact to be from this from a same-store basis and how it might impact the front-end? I know it's early, but just curious if this \u2013 you guys see this as potentially a needle-mover on either of those fronts. And then, any costs you would highlight that would be needed to accomplish these accelerated timelines?","Helena B. Foulkes - CVS Health Corp.","Sure, let me just start by saying that we have had 1,600 stores who've been doing home delivery for a long time. And part of what we did is we've really looked at that experience and said, how do we make it even better there. It's still fairly small there even in those stores, and I would say that's because ultimately, we think the best experience for the consumer is one where she can toggle back and forth and decide, some days she wants to come into the stores, and some days she just can't get out of the house and we need her to do it \u2013 we need to get those prescriptions to her.","So, whether it's our drive-through locations, it's our Curbside Pickup, we've been actively involved with Instacart, which we're now delivering from 2,800 stores. We're pushing the envelope on basically serving the patient wherever she is. And so, it's too soon to know exactly what the impact will be. But we do know it's this holistic experience that the consumer is looking for, and I think we've got a set of experiences that gives us confidence this is an add-on to her holistic experience.","In terms of the cost side of it, we do know that the cost per market can vary, but we've been able to use our scale to negotiate a low-cost competitive option that we think consumers will be willing to pay for, both in same and next-day delivery. And we've been piloting, as I said, different options, so we have a good sense for the elasticity and price. But we'll also be looking at options where maybe there will be free delivery with a purchase of some front store items. So we think it's that holistic review again of wherever, whenever and however she wants.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And I guess just a quick follow-up. The last two years, you guys used 3Q as an opportunity to give a preliminary outlook for the following year. I think in both cases, it seemed that the Street maybe was a little bit ahead of where that initial guide came out. This year, I'm assuming we'll have to wait till December for guidance. But could you share maybe the major swing factors that we should be thinking about as we look out into 2018 on a year-over-year basis?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Well, Bob, it's Larry. Maybe I'll start and Dave will jump in. And Bob, just for \u2013 our goal has always been to provide guidance for the following year in December at our Analyst Day. And as you heard from both Mike and Dave, that's what we'll be doing next month, and you shouldn't read anything into that.","In terms of what you would think about as, I'll say, headwinds, tailwinds for 2018, I'll start with some of the tailwinds. A lot of the network arrangements that we've been talking about, that certainly will drive Retail share next year. As you heard this morning, we've had another strong PBM selling season. And the enterprise streamlining initiative that we began earlier this year will be in year two and the savings will outweigh the costs.","On the headwinds side, we've talked \u2013 we'll continue to see the reimbursement pricing pressures. And I think when you think about what are the offsets to that, obviously, generic introductions play a role in that. And at least at this point in time, we see 2018 contributing, but probably to a lesser extent than what we've seen the last couple of years.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great, thanks for all that. I appreciate it.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","So, Larry, I wanted to start with \u2013 you're obviously doing a lot of partnerships with competitors, maybe people you hadn't partnered with in the past. Maybe talk a little bit what's changed the last year or two, and you're doing it successfully, managing conflicts and then other natural limitations to working with those partners?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah. John, listen, I think that we have \u2013 the capabilities that we have created and the guiding principle of partnering with individuals or entities that as they grow, we grow, okay. I think that that has helped to create a real partnership where we can create a win-win scenario with that most important win being the clients and customers that we serve, okay.","And so, we have \u2013 whether you're talking about health plans or \u2013 we've got relationships with more than 70 health plans, and we've talked a lot about how \u2013 in the Med D space, how we've created a compelling offering, where SilverScript can be a competitor in the market. But we can also support the Med D products for other health plans and how we've seen in the market that, through that relationship, they're growing faster than the overall market.","And I think the opportunities that we continue to see for innovation, I think, gives us the comfort level that even on the Retail side, we can partner with \u2013 as you pointed out, with \u2013 in a differentiated way from perhaps how we've thought about that in the past. So, I think we're pleased with the capabilities that we're able to offer and the value that that can create in the marketplace.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","And then, just as a follow-up, one of those partnerships to a degree, I guess, is this performance-preferred plan with Walgreens. Where do you think that specific plan goes and more offerings like that go, correct? Because I think you probably agree that the two of you are probably the lowest cost providers out there. So, is this a way to get maybe one of the lowest-cost networks in the market?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Well, John, let me start and then I'll flip it over to Jon. You've heard us say for a while now that the market has been focused on network constructs with CVS or Walgreens, pick one, okay?","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yeah, yeah.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","And we've been talking about, as healthcare migrates to more value-based care or outcomes, that the market may not be thinking about it in the right way that the networks are not going to be based simply on unit costs. They're going to be based on unit cost and the ability to affect outcomes through clinical performance measures. So, at the end of the day, that's what this network is all about.","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","And John, this is Jon. If you just think about diabetes, and we have all the pharmacies that are serving a client's diabetic members, working on adherence, and if they can lower the A1C by 1%, that actually saves $5,800 over the course of the year. So, the power of being able to lower overall healthcare cost, I think, really has been underappreciated by the market. And so, this network with \u2013 that we're calling high performance network with CVS, Walgreens and independents does deliver unit cost savings.","But I think even more importantly, it delivers clinical outcomes. And part of the reimbursement to these pharmacies will be based on their ability to deliver clinical outcomes. So, we've selected providers that we believe have the best capability. And as I am out in the market talking to clients, we have not seen as much penetration in narrow networks as we historically have seen, because it was historically unit cost savings. But as we add this clinical component, we're seeing much more interest in moving down this path.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Please proceed.","Eric Percher - Nephron Research LLC","Thank you. So, maybe combining those questions around partnership and profit, it seems very clear that the relationships you've created have come based on clinical outcomes in part and that also we've seen a change in market pricing and there's that ability to deliver lower cost. How should we think about the impact next year? You spoke about reimbursement. Is there a change in the way that you've looked at the returns required in order to enter these contracts and any type of material impact for 2018 or even looking out further? What's the balance between partnership and profit?","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah. Hey, Eric, this is Dave. We can't give you a ton of color on that at this point in time. It'll be something we'll discuss at Analyst Day. I will say that our \u2013 that conceptually, intellectually how we've thought about this has not changed. Obviously, we underwrite each one of these \u2013 I'll say underwrite. We look financially at each one of these relationships and make sure that it's both good for the client, good for the member and good for us, both short-term and long-term. So, I think our approach to this is pretty disciplined.","Eric Percher - Nephron Research LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alvin Concepcion with Citi. Please proceed.","Alvin Caezar Concepcion - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my question. Generally, could you \u2013 just wondering if you could reach your vision of improving outcomes, creating a holistic experience, driving share to your distribution channels, can you do that with your current business? I know you've been doing more partnerships to improve those. But down the road, is it becoming harder to create a win-win scenario, as there's more encroachment on your PBM business, for example? And with that backdrop, do you view M&A as more of a necessity to accelerate that vision?","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Hey, Alvin, this is Dave. I think our business model, as we think about how it stands today and we think about the evolving healthcare marketplace and landscape, I think we're very nicely positioned here. The assets that we've assembled really engage members and lower cost and provides a really robust access point into healthcare. And I think if you look for the next 3, 5, 10 years, those elements are really critical. So, we do like our business model. M&A and continuing to supplement our business model has always been at the core of our business, and we will continue to do that as we look forward.","Alvin Caezar Concepcion - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. And you've talked in the past about people migrating into retail out of mail. I'm wondering if you could elaborate more on that. Can you talk about what happens when a network that may have been very restrictive in favoring mail order allows a retail option, how sizable are those very restrictive networks, and what have you seen when people switch over?","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Our experience is pretty complete in this area, because if you look at our book of business at Caremark when we've sold-in Maintenance Choice and given members now options to either utilize the mail channel or utilize the retail channel, within six months, we see about half of the volume move out of the mail channel into the retail channel.","I think what's unique about our business model, and Helena touched upon this a bit, is we're creating a model here where the consumer doesn't necessarily have to choose consistently they're going to use mail or they're going to use retail. They're going to be able to pivot and choose what's best for them and engage with us what's best for them at that period of time. So I think this is a real differentiator in our business model going forward.","Alvin Caezar Concepcion - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Can you hear me?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Yes, we can.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Yes, we can hear you. Good morning.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Good morning. We have a new phone system here. So thank you for all the commentary. I want to follow up on the just Amazon question. You talk about the steps you're taking on the Retail side and really bringing pharma to your doorstep. But how should we think about an Amazon potential entry to the drug supply side from a PBM perspective? If you can, just talk about how you think about including Amazon in PBM networks or potentially partnering with them? We get a lot of questions on this topic.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Ricky, it's Larry. When you look \u2013 when you think about partnering, you sit here and you ask the question. If somebody's able to do something that perhaps doesn't exist in the marketplace, we're certainly open to understanding and working with them in that regard. I think that you've heard this morning from us and quite frankly from others in terms of some of the \u2013 whether you're talking about capabilities or some of the challenges to entry that we're sitting here saying, there's a lot that we're doing today and there's more that can be done. So, you would never close the door on any type of partnership, but you have to look at what those capabilities may bring that aren't being met in the marketplace today.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then a follow-up on what you're seeing for the 2018-2019 selling season just in terms of opportunities and mix between health plan, commercial, and government.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Hey, Ricky, this is Dave. That's probably something that we'll cover in more depth at Analyst Day. So I'm going to ask you to hold that question until then. We'll go through that in some detail.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, thank you.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Caliendo with Needham & Company. Please proceed.","Kevin Caliendo - Needham & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I know it's preliminary, but have you done any analysis on the initial Republican tax plan and how it might impact CVS in the future?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Kevin, it's Larry. We've talked a lot about tax, and the fact that our effective tax rate is over 39% or around there, that any type of meaningful comprehensive reform should be beneficial to our business. And we've got our folks going through the House version that was released last week. And listen, there will be a lot more to say about that in the coming days and weeks as it goes through Ways and Means and then the Senate weighs in.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Kevin, I just think at the end of the day, given our profile from being a really high taxpayer that most scenarios would have us benefiting at the end of the day.","Kevin Caliendo - Needham & Co. LLC","Understood that CVS is clearly positioned to be one of the beneficiaries. I'm just looking at some of the things that they're talking about in terms of deductions, maybe less so on interest and depreciation and more so on CapEx, is that in any way \u2013 looking at that, would you potentially change business practices, or are there ways to work through this that might be even more beneficial versus what the company is doing now?","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","It's probably too early to tell on that. I will say though that to the degree that we have relief, there's a lot of investments that we think we can make within our business model that can more rapidly expand our business model across the country and deliver better care and higher quality and lower cost. So we would look to take the benefit of that and invest it clearly.","Kevin Caliendo - Needham & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks, guys.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","You're welcome.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Nelson, we'll go ahead and take two more questions.","Operator","Okay, thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, guys. A lot's been asked. I have just some odds and ends, so I was going to try to fire them off here a little bit. The partially reserved receivable, the relinquishment of that, Dave, what was that, and is that one-time on the cost side?","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Yes, it is one-time. One of our states has a receivable that we've essentially factored, if you think about that one.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, so that is one-time gain in the third quarter?","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","It is, it is.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then, I know \u2013 this is a combination of questions here. So the clinics, you guys haven't really been adding that many, and I think the growth rate was up 0.7%. So I was wondering if you can give us some thoughts there on what's going on. I know it's a pretty small part of the business, but there's been talk about vertical integration on the call.","And then the last one is your comfort level regarding leverage, and then I'll yield. Thanks.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Hey, Scott, it's Dave. A couple things, one is from a clinic perspective, we took a somewhat pause on expanding clinics geographically, only really due to two things. One is we wanted to make sure that we had the EPIC system fully up and running across our enterprise. We've done that. And two, as we purchased the clinics within the Target pharmacies, we want to make sure \u2013 the Target locations, we want to make sure that we're fully integrated from that perspective. We'll get back on a growth rate trajectory going forward. There's no doubt about that.","And then from a leverage perspective, as you know, at this point in time, our balance sheet and our ratings are very important to us. We've been very focused on that. We've been very committed to managing that. At the moment, we're a bit, I'll say, over-levered in the sense of our target at 2.7 times. We hover around 3 times. Our objective, obviously, is to begin to delever over time, and we'll grow our way out of that over the next several periods.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Would you ever do a deal that made you subject to a downgrade?","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","It's actually a really big speculatory question. We would make the right investments in our business model to do what's best for us long term, and we would evaluate it on each transaction point at time.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","And then, say, the size of that one-time charge, and then I'll definitely yield. Thanks, guys.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","It's immaterial.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Perfect. Thank you.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays. Please proceed.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you so much for squeezing me in. I guess, Dave, just picking up on that last question a little bit, in the past, you've talked about how important the high BBB rating is in the context of your access to the sale-leaseback market as well as the access to commercial paper market. If you were to think just more strategically around the flexibility you have within the BBB spectrum, would there be a willingness to trade off, say, Tier 2 commercial paper access for a short time if they gave you sort of greater access in the long-term debt markets?","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","We're not focused on that, Priya. We're focused on maintaining our high BBB rating, and that's consistent with our leverage targets that we've established at 2.7 times. So that's not what we're focusing on as of this point.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, and then just a quick follow-up. Can you talk about how you've been funding your sale-leasebacks? It looks like you've been absent from the 144A market for a little bit. Have you been primarily using the private market?","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","We have \u2013 we've been a little low on the sale-leaseback offering at this point in time. Keep in mind that with the Target pharmacy acquisition, we kind of scaled back, if you will, our organic store development program just a tad. So, because of that business decision, the sale-leaseback offering has been relatively anemic.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right, thank you so much.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","You're welcome.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Okay. So, just wrapping up, we appreciate everybody's time bright and early on a Monday morning. And if anyone has any follow-up items, Mike McGuire is available for that as well. So, thanks everyone and we'll see you next month.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

During the presentation all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, the call is being recorded Tuesday, May 3, 2016.","And I'd now like to turn the call over to Nancy Christal, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Nancy R. Christal - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, James. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. I'm here this morning with Larry Merlo, President and CEO; and Dave Denton, Executive Vice President and CFO. John Roberts, President of CVS Caremark; and Helena Foulkes, President of CVS Pharmacy, are also with us today and will participate in the question-and-answer session following our prepared remarks. During the Q&A, please limit yourself to no more than one question with a quick follow up so we can provide more people a chance to ask their questions.","Please note that we posted a slide presentation on our website before the call. It summarizes the information in our prepared remarks as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance.","Later this afternoon, we'll be filing our Form 10-Q and it will also be available on our website at that time.

In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP items to comparable GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of our website. And as always, today's call is being simulcast on our website and it will be archived there following the call for one year.","And now, I'll turn this over to Larry Merlo","Larry J. Merlo - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, thanks Nancy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us to hear about the solid first quarter results we posted today. Adjusted earnings per share increased 4% to $1.18, that's $0.01 above the high end of our guidance. And total company revenues increased a very healthy 19%, also above our high-end guidance number. Excluding acquisition-related integration costs and the true-up of a legal charge, operating profit increased 5% enterprise-wide, with operating profit in the Retail\/Long Term Care segment in line with our expectations, and operating profit in the PBM notably exceeding expectations.","We generated $1.8 billion of free cash during the quarter and continued to return significant value to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. Now it's still early in the year, so we are maintaining our adjusted EPS guidance range that we provided to you at our December Analyst Day, and Dave will get into the details of our results and guidance in his remarks.","So let me turn to the business update, and I'll start with the PBM selling season. Since our last update, the expected revenue impact for 2016 has grown. With gross new business at $15.2 billion, net new business of $13.1 billion, both up about $400 million from our last update. And the vast majority of this increase relates to a new health plan client, which will increase our revenues in both 2016 and 2017. We also closed out the 16th selling season with the retention rate of 97.3%.","Now, turning to the 2017 selling season, it's early, but we are off to a very good start. To-date, we have completed just over a third of our client renewals, which is pretty typical for this time of year. As for new business, our integrated model continues to resonate strongly and we've already had some nice wins. Prospective clients value our strong service and execution, competitive pricing, unmatched products and services, along with our ability to meet their unique needs.","Now many of you've asked about the magnitude of the 2017 selling season, and at this point we are seeing more RFPs and potential revenues in the marketplace than we did at the same time last year. But keep in mind that it ebbs and flows throughout the season, and some of that could simply be timing. Now, given that it's still early and consistent with our past practices, we will provide a quantitative update on our next earnings call once we have a more complete picture of the selling season.","Now, we held our client forum in late March, which was attended by about 900 people, and clients acknowledged that their top concern is cost management, with service running a close second. And I'm pleased to report that we have been able to deliver on both fronts. Now in this environment of rising healthcare costs, clients are looking to us for proactive cost management solutions that anticipate market changes that impact trend. And they are adopting more aggressive strategies, particularly formulary design and specialty management, to mitigate these trend drivers.","Now, we believe we are offering our clients the most comprehensive suite of formulary choices to achieve their savings goals, while addressing member impact and transition to new therapies. In addition, specialty drug management has been emphasized in the plan design elections, and clients are looking for solutions for managing specialty in both the pharmacy and the medical benefits. Among our unique specialty management programs, we are seeing a growing interest in our infusion and site-of-care services as well as our medical claims management services.","In addition, innovations in specialty include indication-specific pricing where the cost to the payer is aligned with a drug's effectiveness for a specific indication.","In the first quarter, specialty revenues increased 23%, and our volumes continued to outpace the market. So through our unique suite of specialty capabilities, we remain highly focused on helping our clients manage costs and improve outcomes.","Now let me turn to the Retail\/Long Term Care segment, and I'll start with an update on the integrations of Target and Omnicare. The integration of the acquired Target pharmacies and clinics is proceeding according to plan, and as of the end of April about half of the 1,670 acquired pharmacies have been successfully converted to the CVS Pharmacy brand and systems. As planned, we expect that all store conversions will be completed by the end of this summer. And as the stores are converted and rebranded, we are launching our additional core pharmacy offerings, and these include Specialty Connect, ExtraCare Pharmacy Rewards, and our digital tools, and this is in addition to Maintenance Choice, which has been available since the transaction closed. So we're pleased with our early progress and remain very enthusiastic about this opportunity to drive growth.","Turning to Omnicare, the Long-term Care Pharmacy business performed in line with our expectations, as we benefited from some of the anticipated costs and sourcing synergies. Currently, we are working to combine operational infrastructures and further develop programs to improve work-streams and enhance service delivery, and we're on track to complete the vast majority of the Omnicare integration activities by year end. Now, in addition to the integration work, we have several initiatives underway. We piloted and have already rolled out the use of CVS pharmacies as an extension of the Omnicare pharmacies to speed the delivery of first fills or emergency order prescriptions in the skilled nursing facilities.","We're also currently piloting an integrated service offering to the assisted and independent-living communities where we can offer residents enhanced medication delivery options based on their preference and acuity level, all supported by our high-touch patient care teams. And with a targeted marketing approach that focuses on when people enter these facilities, along with our name-brand recognition, we are confident that we can increase our penetration in these segments. And pending the pilot results, this program will begin to roll out later this year. So with the combination of CVS and Omnicare, we remain very excited about our enhanced ability to serve seniors along their continuum of care.","Now, moving on to first quarter results in the retail business, total same-store sales increased 4.2% and were positively affected by approximately 125 basis points due to the additional day related to leap year. Pharmacy same-store sales increased 5.5%. This was negatively impacted by approximately 360 basis points due to recent generic introductions and about 50 basis points related to the softer flu season. And the flu was pretty soft in the first two months of the quarter, but strong in March, somewhat mitigating the quarterly impact. Pharmacy comps were positively impacted by about 130 basis points related to the extra leap day, and pharmacy same-store prescription volumes increased 5.9% on a 30-day equivalent basis, continuing to outperform overall market growth.","And our retail pharmacy market share on a 30-day equivalent basis was 23.9% in Q1, and that's up about 245 basis points versus the same quarter a year ago. And while the primary driver of share growth is the addition of the Target pharmacies, we continued to experience strong organic share growth as well. Now an important driver of script growth has been our clinical outreach programs, which have allowed us to continue to improve adherence and provide patients helpful reminders. Part of the strength of these programs has been the integration of our digital tools. And today, nearly 19 million people receive text alerts from CVS on a variety of topics, all of which help to enhance the service experience.","Among other recent pharmacy innovations, ScriptSync at Retail is expected to continue to improve medication adherence and patient satisfaction. Since the launch, more than two-thirds of the patients offered ScriptSync have adopted the service. And with nearly 350,000 patients enrolled in ScriptSync during the first quarter, we now have more than 1 million patients enrolled since its launch in the third quarter of last year. In the front store business, comps increased 0.7%, and this includes the benefit of the extra day from leap year of approximately 105 basis points, as well as the shift of the Easter holiday from April last year to March this year, positively impacting front store comps by about 80 basis points.","And the negative impact of a late flu season was immaterial to the front store in the quarter. Now, we've continued to pull back on broad-based promotions, which has resulted in fewer visits from lower-value customers. Front store margins once again increased notably in the quarter, benefiting from these efforts to rationalize our promotional strategies, along with growth in the higher-margin health and beauty businesses. So we continue to test, learn and refine strategies to achieve the optimal balance between traffic and profitable growth.","Now, ExtraCare continues to reward our loyal customers with savings and we continue to leverage our ExtraCare data to create even more relevant and personalized communications. And we know that our top customers drive a disproportionate amount of our sales and margin, so while store traffic overall is down, our loyal customers are shopping frequently and driving our front store sales and margins. As for store brands, they represented 21.9% of front store sales in the quarter. That's up 100 basis points from the same quarter last year. And there remain significant opportunities to expand our share of store brand products by building on core equities in health and beauty and seeking opportunistic growth in other areas where we can provide customers a superior value.","Among our recent front store innovations, we recently announced the partnership with Curbside to bring a new level of convenience to our customers. CVS Express is the industry's first retail solution that integrates Curbside's market-leading technology right into the CVS Pharmacy app. Customers can make mobile, in-app purchases from their local CVS Pharmacy and have the products directly delivered to them when they pull up to the store, all in about an hour with no added costs. This service is currently available in select markets including San Francisco, Charlotte, and Atlanta. And pending a successful pilot, our goal is to roll out the program to the majority of our markets later this year. This exciting new initiative really embodies the digital mission of CVS Health to make healthy lifestyles more accessible and convenient for our customers all across the country.","Now turning to store openings, in the first quarter, we opened 24 new stores, relocated 14 others, closed five, resulting in 19 net new stores, and we expect to open about 100 net new stores for the full year.","As for MinuteClinic, the Target integration was completed in 24 clinics, converting them to MinuteClinic's branding, electronic health records, systems and health offerings. And we expect the balance of the clinics to be converted by the end of the summer. We now operate 1,136 clinics across 33 states plus the District of Columbia and including Target, MinuteClinic's revenues increased 17.7% versus the same quarter last year, despite the mild and late flu season.","Another digital innovation is what we call the hold my place in line online queuing tool that was launched nationally at MinuteClinic in late March, and this tool enhances convenience by allowing patients to view wait times online and hold their place in line through any digital channel. So MinuteClinic continues to advance in innovative ways to increase convenience and access to care.","So with that, let me turn it over to Dave for the financial review.","David M. Denton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will provide a detailed review of first quarter results, followed briefly with an update on our guidance. And as always, I'll start first with a summary of the various ways we continue to enhance shareholder value through our capital allocation program. Throughout the quarter, our quarterly cash dividend increased by 21% per share, and we paid approximately $470 million in dividends. Our dividend payout ratio currently stands at 31.9%, and we remain well on track to achieve our target of 35% by 2018.","In addition, we have continued to repurchase our shares. In the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 22.4 million shares for $2.1 billion, or approximately $98.52 per share. So between dividends and share repurchases, we've returned approximately $2.5 billion to our shareholders in the first quarter alone. Looking forward to remainder of the year, we continue to expect to repurchase an additional $1.8 billion worth of our stock, completing the planned $4 billion in repurchases for the full year.","Our expectation is that we'll return more than $5 billion to our shareholders in 2016 through a combination of both dividends and share repurchases. As Larry mentioned, we generated approximately $1.8 billion of free cash in the first quarter, and we continue to expect to produce free cash of between $5.3 billion and $5.6 billion this year.","Turning to the income statement, adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.18 per share, $0.01 above the top our guidance range and 4% over LY. GAAP-diluted EPS was $1.04 per share. The Retail\/Long Term Care segment delivered solid earnings within expectations, while the PBM segment posted profit growth above the high end of our guidance. The outperformance in the quarter was primarily driven by stronger-than-expected volumes and better purchasing economics within the PBM. With that, let me quickly walk down the P&L.","On a consolidated basis, revenues in the first quarter increased 18.9% to $43.2 billion, and the PBM segment net revenues increased 20.5% to $28.8 billion. Given the large amount of new business that came on board on 1\/1, this growth is attributable to the increased volume in pharmacy network claims, as well as growth in specialty pharmacy. Overall, PBM adjusted claims grew 19.4% in the quarter, partially offsetting the sales growth was 170 basis point increase in our generic dispensing rate to 85.2%. In our Retail\/Long Term Care business, revenues increased 18.6% in the quarter to $20.1 billion, driven primarily by the addition of Omnicare and the Target pharmacies.","Solid pharmacy same-store sales contributed as well. This revenue growth was just below our guidance range, while script unit growth remained strong, the mix of branded drugs differed slightly from our plan, resulting in a lower average script price. To be clear, we have not seen a change in the level of branded drug inflation, it was simply mix that affected the weighted average script price. In addition, front store revenues were impacted by our promotional strategies in our non-health and beauty categories, as we gave up some lower-value customer traffic to drive an increasingly profitable front store sales mix. GDR increased by approximately 125 basis points to 85.7%.","Turning to gross margin, operating expenses, operating profit and the tax rate, the numbers, I'll cite, exclude non-GAAP adjustments, mainly amortization, acquisition-related costs, and a legal charge where applicable. Keep in mind that our guidance for the quarter also excluded these items. We reported gross margin of 15.6% for the consolidated company in the quarter, a contraction of approximately 135 basis points compared to Q1 2015. Gross profit dollars increased a healthy 9.5%, in line with our expectations. Within the PBM segment, gross margins contracted by approximately 45 basis points versus Q1 of 2015 to 3.8%. Primarily due to the mix of new business and price compression, partially offset by the GDR improvement and favorable purchasing economics.","However, gross profit dollars increased 7.4% year-over-year, due in part to strong volumes, specialty pharmacy, the improvement in GDR, and again favorable purchasing economics. Partially offsetting these drivers was continued price compression. Gross profit dollars increased approximately 10% year-over-year in the Retail\/Long Term Care segment, while gross margin declined approximately 225 basis points to 29%.","Now about 40% of the decline in the gross margin rate was mix driven, due to the inclusion of the Omnicare and Target businesses that we acquired. The decline in gross margin was also due to continued reimbursement pressures. Gross margin was positively impacted by the increase in GDR, as well as increased front store margins due to our continued rationalization of our promotional strategies and improved mix of the products that we sold.","Turning to expenses, we saw strong improvement in total operating expenses as a percent of revenues from Q1 of 2015 to 10.4%. The PBM segment's SG&A rate improved about 10 basis points to 1.1%, benefiting from the additional sales leverage. SG&A as a percent of sales in the Retail\/Long Term Care segment improved significantly by approximately 120 basis points to 19.9%. This too was driven by leverage from revenue growth, as well as the addition of the Omnicare business, which carries a lower SG&A relative to sales. Within the Corporate segment, expenses were up approximately $20 million to $209 million, slightly better than expectations.","Operating margin for the total enterprise decreased approximately 70 basis points in the quarter to 5.2%. Operating margin in the PBM decreased approximately 35 basis points to 2.7%, while operating margin at Retail\/Long Term Care decreased approximately 105 basis points to 9.1%. For the quarter, operating profit growth in each segment was in line with or better than expectations, with the PBM increasing 6.6% and Retail\/Long Term Care growing 6.4%. Going below the line on the consolidated income statement, net interest expense in the quarter increased approximately $149 million from LY to $283 million. This is due primarily to the debt associated with the acquisitions that we took on last year. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 39.3%, and our weighted average share count was 1.1 billion shares.","Now let me update you on our guidance. I'll focus on the highlights and you can find the additional details of our guidance in the slide presentation that we posted on our website earlier his morning. As Larry said, we are confirming our 2016 adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $5.73 to $5.88, which reflects strong year-over-year growth of 11% to 14%. We are very pleased with our strong performance year-to-date and it's still early in the year.","With respect to GAAP diluted EPS, we are revising our full-year guidance to reflect the integration costs and the legal charge that we saw in the first quarter, which we explicitly excluded from our initial guidance. So we now expect GAAP-diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.24 to $5.39. Keep in mind that our GAAP guidance for future periods excludes the impact of acquisition-related integration costs and we will update for these costs that we incur throughout the year.","In the PBM segment, with the better-than-expected increase in network volume from our new business in Q1 expected to flow throughout the full year, we are increasing revenue guidance by 150 basis points to a range of 21.75% to 23.25%. This increase takes into account lower-than-anticipated volumes of the Hep C and PCSK9 therapies. As a result of this, along with stronger expected purchasing economics, we are narrowing and raising the midpoint of the PBM's operating profit guidance by taking the lower end up 125 basis points, resulting in a new range of 11% to 13.25%. In the Retail\/Long Term Care segment, we are lowering our revenue growth guidance and maintaining our operating profit growth guidance.","The reduction in our revenue growth expectations reflects several factors, including our decision to discontinue certain RxCrossroads programs to more fully align this business with our focus on cost, quality, and access. Additionally, the reduction in revenue growth reflects the shift in the mix of branded drugs along with the earlier-than-anticipated launch of generic Nasonex, as well as slightly weaker front store sales trends as we continue to execute on our targeted promotional strategies.","We now expect Retail\/Long Term Care revenue growth of 13% to 14.25%, a reduction of 125 basis points on both ends. And we now expect total cost of 1.75% to 3%, while continuing to expect script comps of 3.5% to 4.5%. Despite the revenue change, we remain confident in our prior operating profit expectations, given the immaterial impact the changes I noted are expected to have on profitability. Consolidated net revenue growth is now expected to be 17.5% to 19%. With the increase in network volume and a higher GDR, intercompany revenue eliminations are now expected to be approximately 11.4% of segment revenues. And as the mix of generics increases within our Maintenance Choice product, we expect higher intercompany profit eliminations. This change essentially offsets the improvement in PBM operating profits. And as I said before, our free cash guidance for the full year remains in the range of $5.3 billion to $5.6 billion.","And with that, now let me provide guidance for the second quarter which excludes all acquisition-related integration costs. We expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $1.28 to $1.31 per share in the second quarter, reflecting growth of 4.75% to 7.5% versus Q2 of 2015. GAAP-diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.17 to $1.20 per share in the second quarter.","Starting with Analyst Day and continuing over the past several months, we have been highlighting several timing factors that will affect the cadence of profit delivery throughout this year. I want to take a moment and remind you of those factors. The introduction and timing of break-open in generics, the timing of profitability in our Medicare Part D business, the timing of the benefits from our strategies to drive growth in their front end, and the timing of share repurchases and certain tax benefits were all factors expected to impact the cadence the most. And while we delivered a strong first quarter slightly above our own expectations, the cadence of profit growth is still expected to be very much back-half weighted.","Our EPS guidance for the second quarter is very much in line with our budget and what we said at Analyst Day. All things considered, we see a ramp-up in growth and we still expect a strong back half of the year. Within the retail segment, we expect revenues to increase 15.5% to 17% versus the second quarter of LY, driven in part by the addition of the acquired businesses. Adjusted script comps are expected to increase in the range of 3% to 4%, while we expect total same-store sales to be up 1.25% to up 2.5%. The Easter shift out of Q2 is expected to have about a 20 basis point impact on comp growth.","In the PBM business, we expect second quarter revenue growth of between 22% and 23.25%, driven by continued strong growth in both volumes and specialty. Consolidated revenues are expected to grow 18.5% to 20%. We expect retail operating profit to increase 5% to 7% and PBM operating profit to increase 4% to 8% in the second quarter. Consolidated operating profit is expected to grow 3.75% to 6.5%.","In closing, I'm very pleased with our solid first quarter results and remain confident in our full-year outlook. As we noted when we gave guidance at Analyst Day, our growth this year will be back-half weighted and that is playing out just as we anticipated. We continue to expect to deliver solid growth in our core businesses, along with the anticipated benefits from our acquisitions and more importantly our growth will be very strong at the enterprise level. This growth will help us maintain and generate substantial free cash flow and we'll continue to execute on our commitment to return significant value to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases.","And with that, I'll now turn it back over to Larry.","Larry J. Merlo - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thanks, Dave. Again, I think as you heard from Dave and myself, we're off to a solid start in 2016 and our distinctive channel-agnostic solutions are resonating strongly in the market as they continue to control patient and client costs, while improving health outcomes. And we continue to believe that we have the right strategy for success in this evolving healthcare marketplace.","And with that, let's go ahead and open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question is from the line of Peter Costa from Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for the question, guys. I'd like to get to understand a little more about the second quarter guidance and some of the factors that you mentioned seem to mostly argue for improving dynamics over the course of the year towards the back half, but yet you showed stronger growth in Q1 relative to what you're sort of projecting for Q2. Can you help me understand what's making the pressure on Q2 or is it just some earnings move from Q2 into Q1? Help me understand what's going on there.","David M. Denton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Peter. This is Dave. I would say that our budget and our cadence of profit delivery in Q2 is essentially on plan with what we created at the beginning of the year. There's been no movement from that perspective. Again, all the factors that I cited are really first half versus second half versus first quarter versus second quarter. So again, our plan remains largely intact. Our EPS guidance for the second quarter is very consistent with our budget and our outlook as we created our plan for 2016.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay.","Larry J. Merlo - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Next question?","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Charles Rhyee from Cowen. Please proceed.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I just had a question around the Target stores and what you're seeing in terms of the traffic into the stores now that \u2013 in the ones that you've now rebranded in CVS relative to sort of what the volumes they were doing before. Have we seen a sort of a pickup there? Well, what do you see in terms of traffic around other stores, regular CVS stores outside of the Target areas?","Larry J. Merlo - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, Charles, I'll start and then I'll flip it over to Helena. But keep in mind that, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we're about halfway through the heavy lifting part where we're rebranding the system conversion, everything to create the look and feel of a CVS, along with all the products and services that we offer. So, as I mentioned earlier, that work won't be done until the end of summer. And I'll flip it over to Helena to pick up from there.","Helena B. Foulkes - Executive Vice President, President - CVS Pharmacy","Yeah, I would say we're pleased so far with the performance. I would start, actually, with the fact that we have a retention rate of those Target employees of over 98%. So the first thing we know when customers come into those stores is they want to know that their Target pharmacists are still with them, and so we feel very good about that. The store conversions are going well, as Larry and Dave said, and our service scores are strong. So we're coming out of these resets feeling good about the service experience. I would say it's too soon to see any impact on script trends. We're continuing to phase in our clinical programs, and we'll see more of that in the second half of the year.","Larry J. Merlo - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And, Charles, keep in mind that you won't see any broad-based marketing until we've completed the integration activities. So in terms of awareness and all of those things that ultimately drive utilization, you won't see that until the fall timeframe.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah, I just wanted to see what the early kind of signals were, and is the purchasing seamless? Like if someone just bought like a wellness product that might be still under Target? Can they still pay for it at the pharmacy desk?","Helena B. Foulkes - Executive Vice President, President - CVS Pharmacy","Yes, absolutely.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay.","Helena B. Foulkes - Executive Vice President, President - CVS Pharmacy","It feels very similar to what it was before. We wanted to make sure that those Target guests have a great experience, and I would say our pharmacists in those stores are still out in the aisles and talking to patients and customers and so the feedback so far has been very good.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Nathan Rich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. This is Nathan Rich on for Bob this morning. Dave, I just wanted to go back to your comment on generic Nasonex coming a little bit earlier than expected. And it seems like there's a pretty kind of healthy calendar of new launches coming over the next several months. Just wanted to ask around the profitability of those launches; is there any reason why the profitability of the new generics that are coming this year would be any different than what we've seen in past years or maybe even a little bit better now that you guys are able to buy through Red Oak?","David M. Denton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Nathan. The profitability is, I wouldn't say better or worse, I think it's dependent upon how those products are launched. Many of those products are single-sourced generics and have an exclusivity period typically of several months. So during that exclusivity period, those products behave more like a branded product versus a break-open generic product. And again, our profits are maximized once those products break open. So if you just look at the cadence of delivery this year, a lot of those products as they come to market are in the exclusivity period.","Nathan Rich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. So the break-open period would probably be more kind of late this year and into 2017 for those drugs that are launching?","David M. Denton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's correct. You would see it happen late in the year, which is part of the cadence of our profit delivery, number one, and you'll see that wrapped into 2017.","Nathan Rich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, makes sense. And then if I could just ask one follow-up going back to your comments on the selling season. You guys highlighted an increase in RFP activity. Should we think about this kind of mainly coming from health plans, given where we are in the selling season at this point? And any color on kind of what you think is driving this kind of overall increase in RFP activity his year?","Jonathan C. Roberts - Executive Vice President & President, CVS Caremark","Yeah, Nathan, this is Jon. So, health plans are pretty much completed. They've made their decisions and we saw similar activity the prior years. So we're in the process of working through employer and government. It's really too early to say whether overall RFP activity is going to be up or it's just the cadence and the timing. But we feel pretty good about our value prop, and as we're out with clients, our integrated model continues to resonate. And you combine that with our high levels of service, it creates a compelling value proposition. So, as Larry said, we'll give you more details in August on our Q2 earnings call.","Nathan Rich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, Larry and Dave, and thanks for taking the question. Maybe just talking about the retail pharmacy business for a second, two questions; first is, can you talk about the demand that you're seeing from the retail pharmacy side as it relates to preferred pharmacy networks and the impact on pricing? And then the second question is, post the close of the Target acquisition, have you guys seen any positive lift on reimbursement rates in the Target pharmacies now that they're owned by you guys?","Larry J. Merlo - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, George, it's Larry. I'll start with your first question and in terms of the preferred Med D networks, George, I don't think there's anything new to reference from what we've talked about in the past. From a contracting perspective, we look at the makeup of the Med D population in terms of the, we call them the choosers versus the low-income subsidies and evaluate potential share shift against margin pressure as a determinant of our desire to participate in the preferred network. And from a consumer perspective, that carries the fact that the low-income subsidies are not subject to the co-pay differentials that you see in the chooser market and the fact that the Med D plans have a variety of options in terms of what those deltas are. So, I would say, at this point, we're not seeing anything that would surprise us from those guiding principles that I just referenced.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Larry, I'm sorry if I misspoke. I didn't mean to say Med D, I was thinking more about the commercial book and what's happening in the growth of some of the (39:56) exchange business and the Medicaid business versus Med D. I'm sorry.","David M. Denton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I don't know that \u2013 George, this is Dave. I don't know if you've seen anything substantially different. The commercial business is probably hasn't adopted, I'll say, a narrow or preferred network as rapidly or as completely as Medicare has. In the Medicaid market, it's a little bit more narrow network focused and that's really where we as CVS Health from a PBM and a retail and a MinuteClinic perspective can really plugs into these Medicaid programs \u2013 managed Medicaid programs in a pretty meaningful way. And so I think it's a little bit of a sweet spot for us right now.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Larry J. Merlo - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And George, on the second question, I'd just simply say that as we think about contracting, our retail pharmacy group is contracting for CVS Pharmacy in totality, which would include the Target pharmacies as well as our Long Term Care pharmacies.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for the color.","Larry J. Merlo - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hey, guys. So two things; you said the 40% of the retail margin pressure was the new business mix. I don't think the other 60% was reimbursement pressure or was that right? And just how would you characterize the reimbursement compression say versus a year ago?","David M. Denton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, John, this is Dave. As I said, obviously 40% of the downdraft in the margin was related to the mix of the business which we acquired.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Right.","David M. Denton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The remainder of that is largely the effect of the reimbursement pressure within the marketplace. So that is in fact the case. You think about, we have been focused from a front store perspective on really, I'll say, tailing our promotional strategies to drive improvements in front store margin rate, and we've seen that play out at the \u2013 I guess at the detriment of probably some top-line trade off.","Larry J. Merlo - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And John, keep in mind as you've heard us reference that margin compression in pharmacy is \u2013 you really have two drivers behind it. You've got the mix change into some of the lower-margin businesses, principally Medicare and Medicaid. Again, very productive on top line, okay? And then you have on an apples-to-apples basis just the sheer step-down in profitability. So you've got both of those forces creating some downward pressure.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. And then secondly, different topic; when you think about creatively other ways for you to work with Target? And you're already obviously collaborating a little bit on with respect to the pharmacy, but you think about whether it be HBA, OTC, loyalty, are there any other ways creatively to \u2013 for you guys to work together, either kind of drive success in pharmacy versus HBA or is that \u2013 it really will end up being limited to pharmacy alone?","Helena B. Foulkes - Executive Vice President, President - CVS Pharmacy","Well, this is Helena. It's something we talked a lot about with the Target folks, and essentially what we've agreed to is for right now all hands on deck and making sure that the pharmacy conversion goes really well. And as I said before, we're happy with where we are. There's a lot of work that goes into converting all of those pharmacies over and having a great experience. But we certainly think there are other opportunities for both of us when we think about, for example, loyalty, we think about different categories in the front where we have relative strength or Target has relative strength. And we haven't gone into the specifics of those because again we wanted to focus on the pharmacy, but those things could come down the road.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Larry J. Merlo - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, John.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, hi. Good morning. When you talked about kind of like the top line results in the retail segment, you talked a lot about kind of like the generic comps. But was wondering what you're seeing in the marketplace in terms of branded inflation, because there's some conflicting data points in the marketplace that we are hearing. That's one.","And second of all, from your seat and all this data you see both kind of like the PBM side and the retail, so you have a very unique perspective. How do you think \u2013 what do you think we'll see in terms of just kind of like the branded price increases in the environment for the remainder of the year? And maybe even into 2017 in light of the controversy and the very public debate around the gross versus net trend.","Larry J. Merlo - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Ricky, it's Larry. I mean on the branded side, we're really not seeing anything out of the norm from \u2013 I mean, if you go back and look historically, this industry has seen branded inflation in the low-to-mid double digits, and so far this year, we're not seeing anything different than that. And really don't anticipate seeing anything different based on our view of the marketplace. I think what Dave was alluding to in his remarks in terms of brand mix that, again, no change in the inflation or in the assumptions that we've made around that. And we may be seeing the impact of consumer-directed health plans in terms of driving some mix changes within brand where you can say that the patient is becoming more of a payer until they reach their out of pocket max deductibles. And this is really driving patients to lower cost brand options where a generic is not available. And that's why what we see is simply an impact on revenue, but not an impact on prescription unit growth or profitability.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And do you expect any kind of like changes in the gross product versus rebate dynamic on more of the longer term aspect?","David M. Denton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, Ricky, this is Dave. I do believe as you've seen over the past several years, Jon and his team in the PBM have really introduced a pretty comprehensive formulary management strategy, and with the exclusionary strategy, you've seen us improve our rebates and therefore essentially as you know the vast majority of those rebates go back to our clients in the form of a buy down in cost, and I think we will continue to innovate in that category and that process to continue to drive value for our clients.","Jonathan C. Roberts - Executive Vice President & President, CVS Caremark","And Ricky, just to add to this, this is Jon. I mean obviously we've demonstrated we can move market share based on access when we introduced our formulary strategy back in 2012. That has created a significant amount of value. But we've also evolved this strategy to begin to negotiate price protection so that as manufacturers raise prices, a portion of that comes back to our clients in the form of a rebate. And I think some of the next things we're beginning to see is contracting by disease state.","So, as an example, in the autoimmune category, we might have one rate for drugs that treat rheumatoid arthritis where you have 13 drugs that can treat that condition and a different rate for those same drugs that are prescribed for Crohn's disease where there is only four drugs in that category. So \u2013 and we see similar opportunities in oncology. So I think we're going to continue to see these negotiations and opportunities evolve, and we believe we're very innovative in this area and actually leading the industry.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research. Please proceed.","Mike D. Otway - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey. Good morning, everyone. This is Mike Otway in for Scott. Thank you for taking the questions. I guess first question, I think mail choice was up 6.6% in the quarter, driven mostly by Maintenance Choice. Are you guys seeing some initial success with the health plan clients in adoption of the company's proprietary programs like Maintenance Choice or Pharmacy Advisor? I think, Larry, you said the new business won since the last update was a health plan. I'm just wondering what's driving that and what are you guys seeing?","Larry J. Merlo - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Mike, it's Larry. I'll start and then Jon I'm sure will jump in. But if you go back and look at the new business, almost half of the new business adopted one of the Maintenance Choice programs. And I think consistent with what we've talked about in the past, we have begun to see some uptake of Maintenance Choice in the health plan segment, recognizing that that lifecycle is longer for the reasons that we've got to sell those programs through the sales organization and I think Jon's team has done a good job in terms of creating more alignment across all the stakeholders so that we have shared goals and incentives in that regard.","Jonathan C. Roberts - Executive Vice President & President, CVS Caremark","And then, Mike, this is Jon. So we have begun to see health plans adopt this. I would say it's still slower than what we would like to see, so we think there continues to be significant opportunity to see even more adoption and a good place for health plans to start is Maintenance Choice 2.0 that has been very successful in the marketplace. And as clients get experience with Maintenance Choice 2.0, we see them move up to the Maintenance Choice 1.0 product that moves more the volume through the Maintenance Choice channel. So we're still very bullish on this plan design.","Mike D. Otway - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you both. And I guess the next one probably for Helena. It sounds like the front end traffic is negative in the quarter and you guys pulled back on some promotions, targeted promotions. It's clearly a much smaller portion of the overall business these days, but to some extent it's how consumers see CVS. You guys have invested in Curbside, but Helena can you talk about the longer-term strategy in the front end to make sure that you guys are still continuing to stay relevant given things like online incursion and I guess ultimately what's your vision for how you want consumers to interact with the front end and with CVS?","Helena B. Foulkes - Executive Vice President, President - CVS Pharmacy","Yeah, it's a great question, something we spent a lot of time thinking about because ultimately we see the role of the front store as essentially a door into the pharmacy. This is where consumers get connected to CVS, and ultimately over time, they start using us for prescription. So it's a very important part of the business is consumers think about us. And it's why we've been shifting more and more of our focus towards health and beauty. Because when our customers think about healthcare, obviously they think pharmacy first, but they think health and beauty. And so we're in the process essentially of putting more and more effort around the health and beauty businesses and our top customers. Those have been the thrust of the two places we spent time and energy. And I'm actually quite pleased with where we are.","And if you look at our health and beauty category, for example, we continue to grow share across the marketplace in health and beauty. Now, where we're pulling back are the categories Dave was speaking to earlier, it's the promotional business where it might be edibles or general merchandise, not categories we need to win in from the consumers' perspective as we think about healthcare. So I think that piece of it is sort of generally how we're thinking about the role of the front. Connected to that is the role of ExtraCare and loyalty and personalization. So we know 30% of our customers drive 80% of our sales and profit.","Again, we're focused on those customers, giving them more value, more reasons to shop. And we're very happy so far. We continue to see more trips and more sales and more profit from those customer segments. And then as you said, we certainly are looking very hard at the world of digital. We know that the consumer is living in an omni-channel world and we need to be relevant. We're excited about Curbside because we thought to ourselves we don't need to out-Amazon Amazon.","We certainly have an e-commerce play, but we really wanted to take advantage of 7,800 convenient locations and the fact that when the consumer needs health and beauty aid products or some milk on the way home from work or diapers, we're the convenient go-to location for her. So the fact that she can order online, let's say, from the office and pick it up on the way home and not have to get out of her car, we think is a very big winning proposition. And as Larry said, we're still in the early stages of testing that in some markets, but the research we've done with consumers is really quite encouraging.","Larry J. Merlo - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And just one other point to emphasize that when you drop the two acquisitions into our revenue denominator, the front now represents about 11% of our revenues. So it really affords us the opportunity to think about the front store in a very differentiated way with a different set of goals and objectives as Helena outlined.","Mike D. Otway - Wolfe Research LLC","That's really helpful. I appreciate the time. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Please proceed.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Good morning, gentlemen. So, as we think about just going back to the selling season, are you seeing any change in competitiveness within certain segments whether it be health plan or government or employer or any notable trends that are different year-on-year relative to benefit design requests or interest in one service versus another or some new program you have that's maybe garnering more traction? I'm just trying to get a feel for how all of the RFP interest in sort of your recent success can kind of translate to the ultimate outcome here?","Larry J. Merlo - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Ross, it's Larry. I'll start and then flip it over to Jon. But I'll just share my observation from our client forum an if you go back to our Analyst Day and remember the tool that Jon demoed, our RX insights tool that can provide real-time meaningful data for clients in terms of kind of where they're at and what they can do to bend that cost curve. There was a lot more discussion around that at the client forum. And my observation was a tremendous amount of excitement and enthusiasm in terms of the ability to make that very, very actionable and to serve as a decision tool for payers in terms of the options and choices that they have.","Jonathan C. Roberts - Executive Vice President & President, CVS Caremark","Ross, this is Jon. The other thing I would add is, pharmacy is a meaningful piece of the overall healthcare cost now. So I think what's changed is the C suite is much more involved in the process than what we have seen historically. And I think what that's translated to is, very focused on cost, very focused on service, and that means that they're looking for a PBM that can implement plan designs and move their members to either new channels or new therapies, so much more of a focus on their members or their employees. And so as we're out in the marketplace, our integrated assets really position us to work with their employees or their members through all the touch points that we have to communicate and transition them to the new plan design.","So this is really resonating I think to an even greater degree today than what we've seen historically. So I think from a competitive standpoint, not much change in what we've seen historically. But from a capability perspective, people are much more interested in what we can do to help them manage cost and deliver great service to their members.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","That's helpful. And just maybe quickly, can you just update us, last year you had a very successful health plan selling season. One of the big focus points is sort of converting some of those new members into the drugstore into a Maintenance Choice-like program. How does that sort of progress? What are the key sort of benchmarks we should be looking at to sort of judge how much progress you're making there?","Jonathan C. Roberts - Executive Vice President & President, CVS Caremark","Yeah, well, so if we start with employers, I mean, no surprise there. They continue to move faster to these solutions. We've seen that historically. We continue to see that. I think health plans are much more interested than what we've seen in the past, but they do continue to make decisions at a slower pace. And they have to sell to their downstream clients. So we've done a lot to work with them on educating them on the programs, as well as incentivizing their teams to sell our products and services to their downstream clients.","And it's a win for them if health plans can help their clients save money. It turns into a retention tool for them if they're doing a good job on their clients' behalf and it's a win for us. As they implement plan designs, we will generally see more share. So, I think the metrics that we've shown at Analyst Day around enterprise share will continue to be how we'll measure our success in this area.","Larry J. Merlo - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I do think as you think forward and if you look at the contributions from generics, okay, through a payer lens, the fact that they will still contribute but the year-over-year benefit is not going to be what it's been for the last couple years. I do think it's going to very much align to what Jon was talking about in terms of people looking at some of the things that have been available, but maybe I didn't need to go there because I had another avenue to achieve my objectives.","So I do think that it will be looked at differently as we go forward, and I think the point that was made earlier in terms of we've worked hard to create more alignment around goals and incentives, I think we're in a good place with that in mind.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Makes total sense.","Larry J. Merlo - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks very much. I just wanted to follow up as to one of your comments, Larry, where you talked about more aggressive plan design, formulary, et cetera. Do you see incremental opportunities for mid-year plan design changes where it could actually impact the back half of this year? Or is that what you're seeing that was implemented for 01\/01\/2016 or is that your future thoughts on 2017?","Larry J. Merlo - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, Lisa, I'll start and flip it over to Jon. I do think, Lisa, there is the option for that to happen, largely because that design tool that I referenced earlier, it gives people real-time data. I do think that there are going to be some employer groups that are going to find that probably more challenging or difficult, especially if they have a bargaining unit, as an example. I don't think it would happen there, for obvious reasons. And I think that would break the paradigm that has existed within employers in terms of they've kind of got their cycle of when information goes out and then it gets updated on an annual basis. But there may be an opportunity to make some subtle changes along the way that I think could be meaningful.","Jonathan C. Roberts - Executive Vice President & President, CVS Caremark","So, one example, Lisa is, particularly around as it pertains to formulary, we now are rolling out programs on a quarterly basis. So in April, we rolled out a dermatological bundle that really focused on UM programs to manage the cost in this area. So, I would say that helps clients manage their cost much more effectively, and they're willing to do that throughout the year as opposed to just once a year. And we'll continue to look for opportunities not just around therapeutic categories, but even specific drugs that we think we need to take action against. I think the broader moves, network moves, as an example, will probably still happen on the cadence that we've historically seen them occur. It's a little more disruptive, and they like to do that when they're making all the other changes.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then I guess my second question would really be around the new Optum Walgreens Boots Alliance offering in the marketplace. Can you just comment, Jon, do you think that's going to have any impact this year's selling season, them trying to replicate or emulate something that you have at CVS? And secondly, Helena or Larry, do you see any of that impact in their ability to be able to shift scripts away from your CVS stores?","Larry J. Merlo - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, Lisa, it's Larry. I'll go ahead and start and then others may jump in. But I think, as you know, this is not the first time that a competitor has tried to create a Maintenance Choice-like program. And we've been able to effectively compete against those programs in the past. We're still the only ones with a fully integrated product, and you think about that integration, it applies both clinically as well as operationally. And Maintenance Choice is the only 90-day program that is truly channel-agnostic with the ability to realize the same enterprise economics regardless of the channel that the patient chooses. And our offering is becoming even more relevant with the addition of Target's 1,600 pharmacies into the Maintenance Choice network.","And I guess just one other example of that clinical and operational integration, as you know, as we've talked about Specialty Connect, which is a more recent rollout, we've simply defined that as a Maintenance Choice product for the specialty patients. So, I think that's another proof point in terms of the real integration that exists that does provide elements of differentiation from those other programs that are attempting to mimic Maintenance Choice.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Larry J. Merlo - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Lisa.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Robert Willoughby from Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Just one. Larry or Dave, you mentioned that the CVS retail and mail penetration of the PBM volume had been in the 40% range. It obviously comes down after the big selling season you had last year. But could you hazard a guess maybe where that stands and how quickly you could ratchet that back up to the 40% range and any longer term target you might have for that metric?","David M. Denton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, hey, Bob, it's Dave. We'll update that more broadly at Analyst Day coming up in December. I will say that as Jon indicated earlier, clearly we have a lot of programs that have been adopted pretty completely within our employer book, and that continues to resonate. The opportunity we have really is in our health plan book. And not all health plans are created alike. Those health plans that are largely Medicare focused will have a different solution set and product offering that we will sell into that group of health plans that will likely not have all the mechanisms to aggressively move share compared to health plans that are more, I'll say, commercially focused that can sell in Maintenance Choice as an example. So, they will happen over different cadences. I think clearly with the adoption of and the onboarding of a bunch of new clients on 1\/1, our first job was to get them onboard, get their service levels at very stable levels, and then work to sell them new programs as we cycle into 2017, so probably more to come on that, Bob.","Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And would there be a general rule of thumb I could think about, though, if you win X amount of business one year by the end of year three you'd kind of be at that range or is it just absolutely impossible?","David M. Denton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think it's impossible and the reason being is each one of those health plans, they have very different business models and they compete in very different business segments. And so again a Medicare dominated health plan, the share is going to move very slowly compared to a commercially dominated health plan.","Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Right. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Larsen from Leerink. Please proceed.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Hey, guys. Congratulations on a good quarter. Can you talk a bit more about your indications pricing capabilities? It sounds to me like that gives you a bit of a head start with this proposed Part B rule that was recently published. And also can you talk about ScriptSync? Exactly what is that and how does that serve your client base? Thank you.","Jonathan C. Roberts - Executive Vice President & President, CVS Caremark","Yes, David, this is Jon. So we're \u2013 I talked about the autoimmune opportunity RA for \u2013 where there's more drugs that treat that disease state, so more competition, we believe we can get better rebates versus Crohn's disease. I think there are similar opportunities in oncology. So we're still early, but we're working on that. I think again there's been a lot of talk about outcomes-based contracting. We think that is a good idea, but practically very challenging. So EHRs don't communicate with each other. Members move between health plans. The information often doesn't move with them. But we believe with the tools and capabilities we have that we're best situated to make progress in this area, and we're continuing to look at it and work it then \u2013 and we'll be able to talk more about it we believe on Analyst Day.","Helena B. Foulkes - Executive Vice President, President - CVS Pharmacy","And then I'll pick up on ScriptSync. So this program is really as you can imagine the million people who signed up for it are basically those patients who are filling roughly four prescriptions or more per month, and as we did our research with them, what we saw and heard is their number one pain point is they've got a lot of complexity healthcare wise in their lives. The pharmacy is a piece, but there's other elements of it. So, they're making lots of trips to the pharmacy and that's hard for many of them. So a big solve for them is consolidating all of it. The way it works is we help those patients, and we line them up to one date per month, which they can come in. It sounds simple, but as you can imagine with all of the insurance plans out there, we've got to work behind the scenes to get them synced up.","So that's sort of the hard part behind the solution from a consumer perspective. I think what's exciting for both the patients and the plans that we're serving is that ultimately this leads to very high consumer satisfaction and much higher levels of adherence. And that's ultimately the healthcare outcome that we were looking for as we developed ScriptSync.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Steve Halper from FBR. Please proceed.","Steve P. Halper - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","I appreciate your comments on the Target pharmacies, but one point of clarification. Would you suggest that the performance of the Target pharmacies at least on a volume perspectives are equal to where they were before the acquisition?","Jonathan C. Roberts - Executive Vice President & President, CVS Caremark","Steve, I guess you have to look at that based on timing from a seasonal perspective given year-over-year overlap with the flu. I would say we've not seen a material change in the volumes at this point in time absent that.","Steve P. Halper - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Of course. Thank you.","Jonathan C. Roberts - Executive Vice President & President, CVS Caremark","Yep.","Larry J. Merlo - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Next question?","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Mohan Naidu from Oppenheimer. Please proceed.","Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks for taking my questions. This question maybe is for Jon or Larry. So given the focus from clients on the costs and an increasing mix of the specialty prescriptions, how are you guys seeing the change in the PBM landscape, especially with the smaller PBMs who presumably cannot impact the specialty drug cost as much as you guys can do? Is this coming up in an ongoing selling season with the clients?","Larry J. Merlo - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, Mohan, there's no question that size and scale in this business matters probably more today than it ever has, with costs in mind. And I do believe that, as we go through the RFP process, it starts with price and service, and you've got to be right there. And then we can certainly add to our offering with the differentiation that we provide in the marketplace. So, yeah, I do believe that if it is harder, if one is lacking size and scale to effectively compete.","Jonathan C. Roberts - Executive Vice President & President, CVS Caremark","And then, Mohan, this is Jon. So, clients' biggest concern when they think about cost they're really thinking about specialty. And about half of their specialty spend is in the pharmacy benefit, which PBMs historically have managed. And the other half of the specialty spend is under the medical benefit, which is not being managed very well today by the health plans. The platforms that they manage specialty medical on just weren't built for managed drugs. So we actually have a capability to manage that benefit across the pharmacy in medical benefit. And we think about unit cost, Larry talked about that. And so size, scale, and capabilities really make a difference there. And we're seeing specialty drugs come to market and be limited to a few providers. So our capabilities enable us to have access to those limited distribution drugs.","The other side of it is, what can we do clinically to manage the 3% of our clients' patients that are driving 25% of their overall healthcare costs. And so we've integrated a capability that allows us not to just manage the specialty prescription, but to manage that patient, not just with their specialty condition, but with all their comorbidities and we've demonstrated that we can reduce overall healthcare costs. So, as we tell that story to clients, it resonates and it's a \u2013 I think it's a key decision point for them as they're making a selection in the marketplace.","Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you so much, Jon and Larry.","Larry J. Merlo - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thank you. And we'll take one more question, please.","Operator","And our final question is from the line of Mark Wiltamuth from Jefferies. Please proceed.","Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC","Thank you. So wanted to ask a little bit for, Helena, on the front-end margins, do you think there's a case to be made for more margin discipline for the industry in general? You're clearly working a margin strategy here. Walgreens is trying to enhance their margins. And I'm also just curious if right aid has been behaving any differently while we're waiting for their deal to close?","Helena B. Foulkes - Executive Vice President, President - CVS Pharmacy","Yeah, I think we're seeing a pretty rational marketplace, especially in the drugstore business. We haven't seen any major moves, I would say, the last six months or so. It may be even longer among our key drugstore competitors. And so I feel like it allows us to continue to focus on what I said before, which is driving profitable growth, focusing on that 30% of our customers where we really are seeing some nice sales and margin growth and being aware of the marketplace, but being rational as you said in terms of our approach here.","David M. Denton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And, Mark, probably one thing that is a little different with CVS is just given our tenure and the depth of expertise we have from the loyalty card program, we know who our best customers are. We're engaging with them. And we design strategies that's allowed us to really tailor our market programs and our promotional offers to them. So we're probably in a different spot than some of the other industry participants at this point in time. I think we have the ability, if you will, and you saw it through this quarter to trade off a little bit of top line, but really focus our promotional dollars on those customers that really matter to drive margin expansion in the front.","Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC","And Walgreens is also emphasizing cosmetics and beauty. Do you feel that at all? You mentioned your share is still gaining there. But have you noticed them changing things and has that affected your sales at all?","Helena B. Foulkes - Executive Vice President, President - CVS Pharmacy","No, I think that we continue to watch them. They're doing a nice job. But it's a big marketplace, and as I said, we're growing share in that category.","Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Larry J. Merlo - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Everyone, thanks for your time this morning, and again, we appreciate your ongoing interest in CVS Health. And if you have any follow-up questions, you can reach out to Nancy or Mike.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

And as always, today's call is being simulcast on our website and it will be archived there following the call for one year.","And now, I'll turn this over to Larry Merlo.","Larry J. Merlo - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Well, thanks, Nancy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I'm very pleased with the solid third quarter results we posted today. Revenues increased 10.3%, while adjusted earnings per share increased 12.5% to $1.29, coming in at the higher end of our guidance range. And adjusted EPS excludes any acquisition-related items, consistent with how we provided guidance.","And Dave will cover how you should be modeling our adjusted EPS for the rest of the year now that the Omnicare acquisition has closed. For those of you who may not be aware, I'm pleased to announce that Rocky Kraft, previously CFO of Omnicare, is now the President of our Long-Term Care Pharmacy group and you'll have an opportunity to hear from Rocky at our Analyst Day.","In the third quarter, excluding transaction and integration costs, operating profit in the Retail Long-Term Care business increased 8.4%, while operating profit in the Pharmacy Services Segment increased 7%. Now those numbers do include Omnicare's operating results as of August 18. On an underlying basis, versus our guidance, excluding the acquisition, Retail operating profit growth was in line with expectations, while the PBM was just above our guidance range.","We generated approximately $1.3 billion of free cash during the quarter, $3.4 billion year-to-date, enabling us to continue to return significant value to our shareholders. Now given our solid performance this quarter and the closing of the Omnicare transaction, we are narrowing our guidance range by raising the lower end. We currently expect to achieve adjusted EPS for 2015 of $5.14 to $5.18. And this guidance includes the Omnicare operations and the debt we issued in July. It excludes acquisition-related bridge financing, transaction and integration costs. And Dave will provide more detail during his financial review.","Before providing a business update, acknowledging the complexities in modeling our business, as a result of two acquisitions, we want to provide you with some early clarity for 2016.","We outlined it in this morning's press release and I'm going to turn it over to Dave to cover the details.","David M. Denton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. As you know, there are a lot of moving parts in our business, especially with the recent debt financing, the timing of the Omnicare acquisition and the pending acquisition of Target pharmacies. So this morning, I'm going to try to help you model the company and level-set our expectations for next year starting with a wider-than-normal EPS range. We'll provide detailed guidance as usual on Analyst Day once our comprehensive plan is finalized.","Back in December of 2013, we provided our five-year financial targets, which included many assumptions. We said that we expect our top-line to grow faster than our operating profit, suggesting continued margin compression. And we said that our growth strategy is to focus on winning lives and gaining share across the enterprise to offset those pressures, and that we assumed that we would continue to gain share in our core business and make value-enhancing acquisitions to accomplish these targets.","We also said that we would employ a disciplined approach to capital allocation that would further enhance our EPS growth rate and we reiterated those expectations at our last Analyst Day. And none of that has changed.","From our jump-off point of $3.96 in 2013, we said that we would target adjusted EPS to grow 10% to 14% on average from 2013 through 2018. Today, we are providing a preliminary outlook for 2016 in the range of $5.68 to $5.88, reflecting growth in adjusted EPS of approximately 10% to 14% in 2016, again, right in line with our five-year compounded annual growth rate target using the $5.16 midpoint of our 2015 guidance range. Now, if you look at our cumulative performance from our jump-off point in 2013, we are tracking to the higher end of our targets with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 13% to 14% from 2013 through 2016.","Our preliminary outlook for 2016 assumes the completion of the Target pharmacy acquisition near the end of 2015 and excludes any integration and transaction costs associated with both the Omnicare and Target acquisitions, again, consistent with our prior comments.","Our preliminary outlook also assumes that we complete $4 billion in share repurchases in 2016. We can't provide all the usual guidance details today since we haven't finalized our comprehensive 2016 plan, but let me highlight some of the key factors to keep in mind as you begin to review your models.","The Omnicare business, which we acquired in mid-August, is split across our segments. As noted in our press release today, the long-term care operations, commercialization services, supply chain solutions and patient support services within Omnicare are included in our newly-named Retail Long-Term Care Segment. And Omnicare specialty business is included in the Pharmacy Services Segment. While it is early, we remain very optimistic about Omnicare. Consistent with our previously-stated expectations, we expect Omnicare to be approximately $0.20 accretive to our earnings per share in 2016, excluding any transaction and integration costs.","Additionally, for modeling purposes, we are assuming the acquisition of Target pharmacies and clinics closes near the end of this year. And again, as previously stated, we expect the acquisition of Target pharmacies and clinics to be approximately $0.06 dilutive to adjusted earnings per share in 2016.","Those expectations are included in our preliminary outlook for next year. As laid out in the slides that we posted on our website when we announced the deal, this includes accretion from operating the pharmacies and clinics, which will be more than offset by the impact of the previously-announced reduction in 2015 share repurchases, as well as financing costs. And once again, it excludes any transaction and integration costs.","Overall, we expect the total enterprise to deliver operating profit growth in the mid-to-high single digits in 2016. Recall that we are focused on an integrated enterprise strategy to drive long-term growth and we believe our channel-agnostic approach and our enhanced ability with Omnicare to both maintain and grow our share across the entire continuum of care will enable us to continue to drive enterprise growth.","We expect the Retail Long-Term Care Segment to deliver growth and operating profit in the mid-single digits in 2016. In Retail, we continue to grow and gain share. At the same time, we continue to be faced with margin compression, which comes from two main sources. One is the mix shift of our business toward lower-margin lines of business, mainly Medicare and Medicaid. And the other is the ongoing reimbursement pressure from payers. Note that while reimbursement pressure continues, it is not accelerated and the typical offsets across our business do ebb and flow over time.","As for the PBM segment, we expect to deliver growth in operating profit in the high-single to low-double digits in 2016, including Omnicare specialty business. As you know, in addition to the usual margin compression, we won a significant amount of new business for 2016 and about 80% of our gross new business is in the health plan space. Typically, year one of a contract has fair margins, and health plans typically have lower margins than other lines of business because they typically don't adopt all of our unique programs that help drive cost savings for clients right away. In fact, they're sold in over time.","As an example, when an employer client, they can make a decision to offer Maintenance Choice for its membership with a stroke of a pen, the health plan client has to sell these unique offerings throughout their book of business, account-by-account. A good way to think about all this is that reimbursement and pricing pressure is immediate, while share gains occur over time.","So overall, the Pharmacy Services Segment will also see margin compression in 2016, but continued share gains and operating profit growth. So you need to keep all these factors in mind as you firm up your models for next year. We have long believed that we would need to offset ongoing margin pressures by winning lives, gaining an increased share of wallet and growing our enterprise share. We are pleased to continue to deliver growth at our targeted rates. We continue to grow and gain share, both organically and through acquisitions, again in line with our long-term financial targets.","And so with that, I'll turn it back over to Larry and I'll come back for the rest of my financial review in a few moments.","Larry J. Merlo - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thanks, Dave. I think you can see that 2016 is shaping up to be a very good year. Our long-term outlook remains strong and we remain confident in the multi-year targets that we provided at previous analyst days. And consistently growing an organization of this size at this very healthy pace is really a testament to the quality of our people, and I want to take a minute to thank everyone in the CVS Health family for their contributions and dedication. So with that, let me update you on current developments in the business.","Turning to the PBM, and let me start with the 2016 selling season, which continues on its healthy trajectory. Gross wins currently total approximately $13.3 billion with net new business of $11.4 billion. Now these net new numbers do not include any impact from our individual Med D PDP, which I'll touch on shortly.","Today, we've completed 80% of our client renewals for 2016, that's consistent with past years and we continue to have a strong retention rate of about 98%.","Our specialty business continues to outpace the market and gain share. In the third quarter, specialty revenues increased 32%. This was driven by claims growth, inflation and the inclusion of Omnicare's complementary specialty business.","As you know, we've developed a comprehensive set of programs to effectively manage specialty trend and we'll provide a deep dive on those strategies at our Analyst Day.","Before turning to Retail, let me touch briefly on our Med D PDP, SilverScript. As we reported last quarter, SilverScript once again qualified in 32 of the 34 regions, which enables us to retain the vast majority of auto assignees we currently serve. And we're well positioned in the 2016 annual enrollment period that is currently underway. We're offering two plans that have zero dollar deductibles, premiums in many states that are lower than prior-year levels and co-pays \u2013 low co-pays for several frequently-prescribed drugs. I'm also pleased to note that SilverScript recently received for the 2016 plan year a four star rating from CMS for delivering value, clinical outcomes and customer service.","Turning to our Retail Long-Term Care Segment, as Dave mentioned, we're excited to now include Omnicare's long-term care business in the segment. The Omnicare acquisition provides a new pharmacy dispensing channel for us, enhancing our ability to provide continuity of care for patients as they transition through the health care system. The business is performing as we expected. Our integration work is well underway, and we're focused on executing to ensure a seamless transition for clients and patients.","We will integrate the specialty operations into our existing specialty business and include the long-term care pharmacy operations in Rx Crossroads in the newly named Retail\/LTC segment. So overall, we expect to complete the vast majority of the Omnicare integration activities by the end of 2016.","As far as the previously announced Target pharmacy acquisition, we remain excited as this transaction enables us to reach more patients. It adds a new retail channel for our unique offerings and it expands convenient options for consumers. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including necessary regulatory clearance, and we expect the closing of the Target transaction to occur near the end of this year. So, we'll certainly keep you posted.","Moving on to results in the Retail business, pharmacy same-store prescription volumes increased 4.4%, that's on a 30-day equivalent basis, and we continued to gain pharmacy share. Our retail pharmacy market share was 21.7% in Q3, again, on a 30-day equivalent basis and, that's up about 55 basis points versus the same quarter a year ago. Pharmacy same-store sales increased 4.6% and were negatively impacted by about 450 basis points due to recent generic introductions.","During the quarter, we launched ScriptSync. That's a new pharmacy service that aligns eligible maintenance prescriptions to be ready together for pickup at the same time. This makes it easier and more convenient for patients to take their medications as prescribed. And since its launch, more than 400,000 patients have signed up for ScriptSync, greatly surpassing our enrollment projections. We will also be rolling this out to our mail-order customers, and we expect this enterprise program to contribute to significant improvements in medication adherence, while providing strong levels of customer satisfaction.","In the front store, comps were down 5.8%. This would have been approximately 490 basis points higher in adjusting for the tobacco impact. Front store sales reflected softer customer traffic, partially offset by an increase in basket size, and we continued to gain share in our core health and beauty business categories.","Front store margins increased in the quarter, benefiting from the tobacco exit, the growth in the higher-margin health and beauty businesses, along with increased store brand sales. Store brand penetration continued to increase in the quarter, reaching 21.8% of front end sales. That's up about 150 basis points from last year. And while about two-thirds of that improvement results from tobacco no longer being in the denominator, the rest is driven by new product introductions and increased customer loyalty.","Our focus on positioning ourselves as a leading health and beauty destination to drive profitable growth continues to show a great deal of opportunity. Early results from the stores that have been updated have been positive, and we plan to expand our healthy food and elevated beauty programs in 2016, and Helena will provide more detail at Analyst Day.","Turning to our store growth for the quarter, we opened 43 new stores, relocated 11, closed two, resulting in 41 net new stores, and we'll add about 150 net new stores for the full year of 2015, equating to an anticipated increase in retail square footage growth of right around 2%.","As for MinuteClinic, we opened 23 new clinics in the quarter and we ended the quarter with 1,020 clinics across 32 states, plus the District of Columbia. Revenues increased approximately 13% versus the same quarter a year ago.","And then lastly, let me just touch briefly on our Enterprise Digital initiatives. Our vision here is to create a connected health experience that makes it easier for people to save time, save money and stay healthy. And to date, 27 million customers have engaged digitally with CVS Health, and in specialty, we are engaging 36% of all specialty patients, making it the highest penetrated digital program that we have. So we're pleased with the progress that we're making on the digital front.","So with that, let me turn it back over to Dave for the financial review.","David M. Denton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Larry. As you can tell, it's certainly been an eventful quarter with a lot of moving parts in our business. So this morning, I'll try to frame up our results with an eye to making easy comparisons to what we have previously expected.","But first, as I typically do, I'd like to begin by highlighting how our disciplined approach to capital allocation continues to enhance shareholder value. I'll follow that with a detailed review of our solid third-quarter results and an update on our 2015 guidance that now includes Omnicare.","So as it relates to our capital allocation program, let's begin with our dividend payout. We paid $391 million in dividends in the third quarter and $1.2 billion year-to-date. Our dividend payout ratio stands at 28.9% over the trailing four quarters, after excluding the impact of non-recurring items in both years. We remain well on track to achieve our target of 35% by 2018.","During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 9 million shares for $937 million. And year-to-date, we've repurchased approximately 37.8 million shares for about $3.9 billion, or $102.47 per share. For the full year, we continue to expect to complete $5 billion of share repurchases, reflecting an increase of approximately 25% versus 2014 levels.","So between dividends and share repurchases, we returned more than $5 billion to our shareholders in the first nine months of 2015 alone, and we continue to expect to return more than $6 billion for the full year.","And as I noted on our last earnings call, to fund the Omnicare and target acquisitions, we issued a series of senior notes in July totaling $15 billion, which raised our leverage ratio to approximately 3.2 times. We also assumed about $700 million of remaining Omnicare debt, which increased our leverage ratio a bit further. We remain committed to getting back to our 2.7 times target over time. As I stated on the last call, while we have not specified a specific deadline for achieving that, our strong cash generation should enable us to do so in a reasonable amount of time.","As Larry mentioned, we have generated nearly $3.4 billion of free cash in the first nine months of the year. We remain on track with our prior guidance for the full year and continue to expect to produce free cash of between $5.9 billion and $6.2 billion in 2015.","Turning to the income statement, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding acquisition-related activity, came in at $1.29 per share near the high end of our guidance range. That excludes $0.01 of acquisition related dilution from the net effect of the July 15 debt financing, partially offset by the inclusion of Omnicare's operation. We also incurred approximately $0.10 of acquisition-related bridge financing, transaction and integration costs throughout the quarter.","GAAP diluted EPS was $1.10 per share. As most of you know, when we provided guidance on the last quarter's earnings call, we specifically excluded the interest from the senior notes, as well as the results of Omnicare's operations, as the timing of the close was uncertain. Now that the deal has closed, we believe that it makes sense that going forward to include both of these items in our guidance.","So on that basis, adjusted earnings per share in the third quarter was $1.28. This includes the 2.5 months of senior note financing costs, which was partially offset by 1.5 months of Omnicare's operations throughout the quarter. Combined that resulted in net dilution of approximately $0.01.","So with that, let me quickly walk down the P&L, keep in mind that these numbers all reflect the inclusion of Omnicare in our results.","Our a consolidated basis, revenues in the third quarter increased 10.3% to $38.6 billion. In the PBM segment, revenues increased 13.3% to $25.5 billion, while the addition of Omnicare specialty business did contribute to growth versus LY, it was not the primary driver. PBM growth in the quarter nicely exceeded expectations, even after removing the impact of Omnicare specialty business.","This year-over-year increase was driven largely by growth in specialty pharmacy, as well as an increase in pharmacy network claims. The growth in specialty was driven by inflation, as well as increased claims due to new products and new clients.","Partially offsetting this growth was an approximately 130 basis point increase in our generic dispensing rate versus the same quarter of LY to 83.8%. In our Retail Long-Term Care business, revenues increased 6.9% in the quarter to $17.9 billion, with approximately half of the increase due to the addition of the long-term care business.","Excluding Omnicare's long-term care business, revenue growth was solidly within our guidance range. This growth was driven primarily by strong pharmacy same-store sales and growth in scripts. Retail's Long-Term Care Segments generic dispensing rate also increased approximately 140 basis points to 84.8%.","Turning to gross margin, we reported 17.2% for the consolidated company in the quarter, a contraction of approximately 125 basis points compared to Q3 of 2014. Inside each segment's performance, the decline is due in part to a mix shift in our business, as our lower-margin PBM business continues to grow faster than our Retail Long-Term Care business.","Within the PBM segment, gross margin declined approximately 45 basis points from Q3 of 2014 to 5.8%. This was driven by ongoing price compression, as well as business mix, resulting from stronger growth in lower margin areas, such as Medicare and Medicaid.","Those factors were partially offset by the improvement in GDR, as well as favorable purchasing and rebate economics. Despite the decline in gross margin rate, gross profit dollars were up 4.7%. Gross margin in the Retail Long-Term Care Segment was 30%, down approximately 125 basis points from last year.","This was driven by the continued pressure on pharmacy reimbursement rates, the continued mix shift towards pharmacy, and the addition of the long-term care business, which carries a slightly lower overall margin rate than retail.","This pressure was partially offset by a number of positive factors, including the increase in GDR, favorable pharmacy purchasing economics, as well as an increased front-store margin due to changes in the mix of products that we sold.","And while gross margin rate was down, gross profit dollars did increase by 2.6% throughout the quarter. Total operating expenses as a percent of revenue improved by approximately 120 basis points compared to Q3 of 2014 to 10.9%. The PBM segment's SG&A rate improved by 20 basis points to 1.2%, with growth in operating expense dollars in line with expectations. Operating expenses actually declined within the PBM by $10 million, despite the addition of the Omnicare specialty business.","Operating expenses as a percent of sales in the Retail Long-Term Care Segment improved by approximately 140 basis points to 20.8%, due to higher legal costs in last year's third quarter. This excludes approximately $20 million of costs related to the Omnicare integration. Within the Corporate Segment, expenses increased to $309 million, driven by the acquisition-related integration and transaction costs associated with Omnicare, as well as the proposed acquisition of Target pharmacies and clinics. These costs totaled $115 million. Excluding these costs, corporate expenses were better than expected and improved year-over-year.","So adding it all up and excluding integration and transaction costs, operating margin for the total enterprise declined by 5 basis points in the quarter to 6.4%. On the same basis, operating margin in the PBM declined approximately 25 basis points to 4.6%, while operating margin in the Retail Long-Term Care Segment improved by approximately 10 basis points to 9.2%.","So putting aside any acquisition-related items, which is the basis with which we guided, the Retail Long-Term Care Segment posted solid operating profit growth of 4.9% within our 4% to 6% guidance range.","The PBM segment posted operating profit growth of 6.2%, slightly exceeding the high end of our 2% to 6% guidance range. Going forward, these lines become more blurred, so we won't be breaking out our results excluding Omnicare. Now going below the line of the consolidated income statement, net interest expense in the quarter increased approximately $108 million from last year to $261 million.","This was driven by the financing costs associated with the bridge loan facility that we entered into in connection with the Omnicare deal, as well as the senior notes we placed in July in support of the acquisitions. During the third quarter, we recorded amortization of the bridge loan fees for approximately $16 million.","Our effective tax rate was 40.2%. The large increase year-over-year was primarily due to the non-deductible transaction costs associated with the Omnicare acquisition. Excluding any acquisition-related items, the tax rate was slightly lower than expected. Out weighted average share count was 1.1 billion shares, again in line with expectations.","So with that, let me now turn to our 2015 guidance. I'm going to concentrate on the highlights here, but you can find the details of our guidance on the slides that we posted on our website earlier this morning.","To be clear, with the exception of free cash flow and GAAP, all of the figures and growth rates that I'll mention exclude acquisition-related bridge financing, transactions and integration costs in 2015, as well as the loss from the early extinguishment of debt in 2014.","Given that the Target transaction is expected to close near year-end, it could actually occur in 2015 or 2016. You will note on slide 38 that if the Target deal closes this year, we have estimated approximately $0.02 of transaction costs, which we have not included in our adjusted EPS guidance range. Of course, Omnicare's operations and any synergies we achieve are included, as is the interest associated with all of the long-term notes.","For the year, we raised and narrowed our guidance range and now expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share of $5.14 to $5.18, reflecting strong year-over-year growth of approximately 14.25% to 15.25%. This layers in the net impact of the Omnicare's operation and the interest on the debt, which combined is expected to be about $0.01 accretive for the year. This increases the midpoint of our guidance by about $0.015 to $5.16. Our revised guidance reflects our solid performance through the first nine months of this year, as well as the continued confidence in our outlook.","This guidance also continues to assume share repurchases totaling approximately $5 billion for the full year of 2015. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $4.69 to $4.73.","In the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.51 to $1.55, up 24.75% to 28.25% from Q4 2014. This fourth quarter guidance excludes any dilution from integration and transaction costs. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $1.41 to $1.45.","As you'll note, sequentially, Q4 profit growth is expected to be somewhat higher than what we've experienced year-to-date. I'd like to remind you of a few factors influencing the quarterly profit cadence across our business.","First, the benefits from break-open generics in Q4 of 2015; second, Q4 is the first quarter in which we have fully lapped the impact from our decision to exit the tobacco category; and finally, the timing of Med D profits is skewed more towards Q4 this year versus last year.","Now I'll go through the details of our fourth quarter guidance. Within the Retail Long-Term Care Segment, we expect revenues to be up 9% to 10.5% versus the fourth quarter of last year. Adjusted script comps are expected to increase 3.5% to 4.5%, and total same-store sales are expected to increase 0.75% to 2.25%. Obviously, the primary reason for the large gap between comp and total revenue growth is the addition of the long-term care business.","We expect to see a moderate decline year-over-year in Retail Long-Term Care gross margins in the fourth quarter. This is expected to be driven primarily by the continued reimbursement pressures we are experiencing, as well as the impact of adding Omnicare, which carried lower margins, again offset to some degree by the benefit from break-open generics.","We expect the Retail Long-Term Care Segment's operating profit to increase 19.25% to 21.25% in the fourth quarter, reflecting the addition of the long-term care business, as well as an improvement in front store margin dollar growth as we cycle the tobacco exit. It also reflects an improvement in operating expenses as a percent of revenue.","For the PBM segment, we expect revenue to increase 10.5% to 12% for the fourth quarter, and adjusted claims to be between 295 million and 300 million claims. The PBM is benefiting from the addition of Omnicare's specialty business.","We expect to see a moderate improvement in PBM gross margins during the fourth quarter, driven by generic conversions. Combined with the modest improvement in operating expenses as a percent of revenues, due to the growth of the specialty, we expect the PBM segment's operating profit to be up 24% to 27% over last year's fourth quarter. And we expect operating expenses in the Corporate Segment to be between $215 million and $220 million. So as a result, for the total enterprise in the quarter we expect revenues to be up approximately 9.75% to 11.5% from the fourth quarter of LY. This is after intercompany eliminations, which are projected to equal about 10.8% of combined segment revenues.","For the total company, gross profit margins are expected to be modestly down from last year's fourth quarter, driven largely by mix. Operating expenses as a percent of revenues are expected to significantly improve in the fourth quarter.","We expect operating margin for the total company in the quarter to be up 75 basis points to 85 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. We expect net interest expense of between $275 million and $280 million, and a tax rate of approximately 39.3% in the fourth quarter. We anticipate that we'll have approximately 1.11 billion weighted average shares for the quarter, which would imply approximately 1.13 billion for the year. As I said, we continue to expect to generate free cash flow in the range of $5.9 billion to $6.2 billion.","So in summary, this was another strong high-quality quarter with good financial performance across the enterprise, including our new businesses. And importantly, our outlook remains strong, both for the remainder of this year as well as next year. We continue to remain focused on using our robust free cash flow to drive value for all of our stakeholders, both now as well as into the future.","And so with that, I'll turn it back over to Larry.","Larry J. Merlo - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thanks, Dave. And just wrapping up, obviously we're confident, we believe we have the right strategy for long-term growth in this evolving health care marketplace. Our integrated model and unique suite of assets remain unmatched and we remain focused on driving sustainable growth with an enterprise mindset. So again, we're pleased with the quarter we announced today and remain well positioned to continue to grow, gain share, deliver on our targets and return value to our shareholders. Let me just add that we hope you found all of the details that we provided this morning very helpful.","I know we covered a lot of ground and I'm sure you have questions, so let's go ahead and open it up for those questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Good morning, guys. So, getting a lot of questions in the inbox, obviously, with all of the moving parts. Can you just help us understand first, in terms of the fourth quarter on the retail side, and on the pharma services side, what are the key changes on the base business on a sequential basis versus the last time we spoke regarding the second quarter, as we think about the implied fourth quarter from that guide versus where we are today. What are the moving parts, and how is the underlying kind of change, because to us it sort of seems like it's come down from maybe the mid to upper teens to the low to mid-teens, so we are just trying to get some clarity on that. Is that the case, and what's sort of the driving factors?","David M. Denton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Ross. This is Dave. I think if you go back and look at how we guided on Q2 and looked at our Q3 guidance and then therefore our implied Q4 guidance, Q4 has not from a core basis, changed. Essentially what we've done, we've added a couple of pennies into Q4 based on the inclusion of Omnicare's business, but fundamentally Q4 from our expectations has not deteriorated. In fact, it has remained solid and has remained consistent from our projections.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","That's helpful, Dave. So I just wanted to get that out of the way. I guess, big picture wise, there's a lot going on, right? So we obviously saw (42:53) your peers earlier in the week getting together. The results on the pharmacy side at least across the spectrum and across the whole supply chain have been pretty mixed. How do you characterize the current environment, I guess, overall, and the pushes and pulls? And then as you think about longer-term, I guess, vis-\u00e0-vis what was implied in the 2016 guide, it still feels like you've got this winning business model that can kind of endure. And so how should we put sort of the competitive noise, some of the near-term noise in perspective, relative to how you feel about kind of the long-term positioning? I don't want to pre-pull ahead to Analyst Day, but as you can just help us here, I think all of us are just trying to put this into context.","Larry J. Merlo - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Ross, good morning. It's Larry. It's a great question, Ross. And we feel really good about our positioning in the marketplace and our strategy and as you've heard us talk in the past, we've talked about aggregating lives and growing share and recognizing the multitude of ways in which we can manage those lives with access, quality and cost in mind, and our focus around that has been to look at the differentiated ways that we can grow our core business and at the same time broaden our base of services.","So, I think many of the variables that we've talked about in the marketplace, I don't think those variables have changed. Whether it's talking about margin compression or the contribution from generics, obviously there're going to be ebbs and flows in terms of the timing of those variables, but we feel that we're very well positioned recognizing that the health care marketplace is evolving and we see ourselves as an important player.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","That's helpful. I guess, I don't mean to be a question hog, but I will be very direct, so I guess, just to be clear, your confidence in your business model over the long-term and your ability to deliver the long-term targets, no change whatsoever?","David M. Denton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Absolutely.","Larry J. Merlo - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We remain very confident in those long-term targets, Ross.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Well, if you're confident, I'm confident. Thanks, guys.","Larry J. Merlo - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right. Thanks, Ross.","David M. Denton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Ross.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks for the questions. I guess just to put a little more specificity around the 2016 guide, it looks like a lot of moving pieces, and Dave, definitely appreciate all the detail. But even adjusting for Omnicare and Target, it certainly seems like you are below your steady-state range that you've shared before of 7% to 9%. And it does seem like it's actually moderating in both segments. Can you maybe just \u2013 if I'm thinking about that right, first off, and then more importantly, can you maybe just give us a sense of what's changing in your minds for next year, relative to what we have experienced the last few?","David M. Denton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I'm not sure that I see much change in our business from that perspective. As we look at our business and we look at how we're performing, we continue to grow and gain share in both segments of our business. Now we have an additional channel to serve from an Omnicare perspective, and obviously we look forward to the addition of the Target pharmacies in our base business. So I think our outlook remains strong from that perspective and we see solid growth across both segments, excluding the acquisitions.","Larry J. Merlo - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And, Bob, it's Larry. As you know, for some time now, we've messaged our focus around enterprise growth and as we've talked and we've provided some examples, the reality of that is, we could have a segment of our business be sub-optimized for a greater enterprise growth and a good example of that is the high-growth specialty business that as we talked about how Specialty Connect works and the fact that it leverages our retail channel assets, but as a result of fulfillment occurring through the PBM channel, you see that economically flow through the PBM segment.","So, we always appreciate the fact that you'd like to have an apples-to-apples comparison to our primary Retail and PBM competitors, but the reality is that's not how we're running the business, and by the way we think that's a good thing because of what we've been able to do when you look at enterprise growth and I think as we bring more innovation into the marketplace, those lines continue to get more and more blurred and it becomes harder and harder to create that apples-to-apples comparison.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","No, I appreciate that. I guess it's more directionally, I think, the concern in the marketplace, if we just look at \u2013 even take the core retail drug business. It does seem like this year the progression on the gross margin has been negative. If I back out some of the moving pieces, it certainly seems the growth you're calling for, for next year, not that it's not healthy, it is just below what we have become accustomed to. So I guess the real question is just are there things changing in the underlying fundamentals, whether it'd be script trends, reimbursement rate pressure, are there any things that are notably different in your mind, as you look into 2016 relative to 2015 or even 2014?","David M. Denton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, I think what is important is as you think about our business, and to your point, there's a lot of moving parts here, but the thesis of our financial performance has not changed. I think the cadence in some cases changes based on when generics come to market, as an example, or when competition enters into one of our formulary classes, all of which can influence the cadence of when profits occur, not that they're going to occur over time. So I think the fundamental thesis of our financial model and our business model remains intact.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. All right. Thanks, guys.","David M. Denton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You're welcome.","Larry J. Merlo - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah, hi. Good morning, guys. I was hoping that we could maybe unfortunately zero back in on this gross margin issue here, within retail. Because it does seem like within your guidance, you are expecting a more material decline than what you maybe alluded to last quarter, and I don't know if I'm right or wrong about that. You did mention reimbursement rate pressure not accelerating, and maybe there being less offsets than what there's been in the past. So I don't know, maybe you could just pile this together for us, and maybe help us understand if there really is a difference in how you are looking at the gross margin in retail. And then how reimbursement pressure is impacting that, or potentially what offsets are not there, that may have been before.","Larry J. Merlo - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, Ed, it's Larry. And when you \u2013 as we've said \u2013 as we talked about margin compression in the past, we haven't seen that change. As Dave outlined in his remarks, we've got the ongoing pricing pressure, and as you look at the sub-segments within pharmacy, we are seeing higher growth coming out of those segments that carry with it lower margins, so when you look at the Medicare, the Medicaid segments.","And as we've have talked and as you just alluded to, there are a lot of things that we've done to offset margin compression, whether you think about purchasing economics, Red Oak Sourcing, as an example, our focus on formulary management becomes an example of that. You think about what we've been able to do in terms of bringing innovative products into the marketplace that create value for clients and at the same time drive share shift into one of our distribution channels, as well as our ongoing focus on technology and process improvements in an effort to become even more efficient and productive.","So those things have not changed in terms of where our focus lies. And as we talked earlier, we can have some ebb and flow issues in terms of the timing and the syncing up of those. And a good example of that is the timing of generics, whether it's new introductions or the timing of generics entering their break-open period. And again, we'll talk more about that and provide some additional color around that at Analyst Day.","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And just one follow up related to next year. I mean this is kind of asked but it does seem like Retail operating profit growth, maybe excluding Omnicare, is not really going to grow next year, is that right, I guess, first of all?","David M. Denton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's not correct. You will see growth in the core. That's not correct.","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. But you did guide to mid-single-digit retail operating profit growth next year; is that right?","David M. Denton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I did. I did.","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thank you, guys.","David M. Denton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, hi. Good morning. So not to beat on a dead horse, but maybe a little bit differently. So when we back out kind of like the acquisitions, right, EPS growth for \u2013 excluding Omnicare and Target about 7% to 11%. So is this basically when we think about kind of like industry dynamics and kind of like the fact that kind of like Medicare and Medicaid is a bigger part of the customer mix, is this kind of like the growth profile that we should be thinking about longer-term for a core organic business, i.e. excluding capital deployments?","David M. Denton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Ricky, This is Dave. And I'm sure Larry will tag on here. I think \u2013 I don't think that's the correct thesis here. I think what you see is that in some of these businesses, especially I'll use our selling season of next year as a good example, as we won a lot of health plan business. It takes us time to kind of sell in different programs and services that add value to them and add value to us, and that value to us is driving share into one of our dispensing channels. So the reimbursement pressure happens more rapidly and the share gains happen over time, so this is more of a cadence issue or a cadence discussion than it is a long-term financial outlook discussion.","Larry J. Merlo - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And, Ricky, I think you can \u2013 there's a parallel example with the acquisitions and I think as we may have communicated when we announced Omnicare, we'll see the benefit of cost synergy and purchasing synergy sooner than we will revenue synergy. And we see the opportunities, we've talked about the opportunity to grow share, especially in the assisted and independent living space, but it will take some time to sell in those programs.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay and then on the follow-up, obviously you are seeing some softer customer traffic on the Retail side. Obviously the PBM is growing nicely through share gains. I think the utilization environment continues to be a dynamic. You are in best position to see trends in 2016, because you see what your customers are doing on the plan side. When you think about kind of like the co-pay structures for next year, the cost sharing for next year, what is kind of like your view on next year's kind of like utilization trends?","David M. Denton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Ricky, it's Dave. It's probably a little too early to go through that at this point in time. It's certainly something we'll discuss at Analyst Day. I just will step back and remind you that I do think that if you look across the industry, the pharmacy utilization or prescription utilization across the industry is still pretty solid. I think we've experienced a little bit of weakness as we're cycling, quite frankly, the bolus of Medicaid expansion last year and probably a little bit of softness in some seasonality scripts.","But for the most part, utilization has been pretty good and we think that long-term secular trend in utilization should be robust as pharmacy is the most economical way to treat many of these chronic disease states, and you see that chronic disease states increase as age increases and the over 65 population continues to expand as a percent of total. So, I think the outlook for utilization is strong over the long-term.","Larry J. Merlo - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And, Ricky, just to add to Dave's point, you think about the impact of the Affordable Care Act. Dave talked about the bolus that we've seen from the rapid Medicaid expansion. And we're going to continue to see more lives enter into the health care system as the Affordable Care Act further evolves. And I don't want to make a political statement about Medicaid expansion, but we still have approximately 20 states that have not expanded Medicaid and there is a question in terms of is that more a question of when versus if and so there is still opportunity for more lives to enter the health care delivery system.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","David M. Denton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Larry J. Merlo - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much and good morning. Larry, can we take a step back and have a bigger discussion around 2016, as we think about what you've tried to do in putting all these pieces together? I think when you bought Omnicare, we had a discussion around fee-for-value and the way the world is moving in that direction, and your ability to touch a patient beginning of life to end of life. Are you in those discussions? Do you see anything in 2016 that having all the pieces on your enterprise is really coming to fruition, and we'll start to see that impact in 2016, or are those things that are going to come longer-term on this platform?","Larry J. Merlo - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Lisa, it's a great question. I think it kind of goes back to the conversation we were just having. We definitely see the opportunities there as we've begun to have some discussions. But I do think that maybe we see a little bit in the later part of 2016. I really think it's more a 2017 and beyond opportunity. There is a parallel to how Dave was talking about the health plan business that you garner the business and then you have to sell in those programs. And we're in the process of doing the evaluation and the understanding of exactly what is the optimal value proposition that adds value for the long-term care operators and their residents. So more to come on that. As I mentioned earlier, we will see the benefits of purchasing and cost synergy as we go through our integration activities throughout 2016.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then just on the backside of that, as you think about your PBM for 2016, and the guidance that you gave, high single to low double-digit, but again realizing a lot of this is health plan, can you or I don't know if Jon is on the call today, maybe just give us some indication as to what plan design looks like for next year? What about the rest of your book? How about your existing book? Do you have people buying into more programs as we think about 2016?","Larry J. Merlo - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Lisa, I'll go ahead and start and Jon is here. He'll jump in. We are continuing to see adoption of programs like Maintenance Choice, Pharmacy Advisor. We'll put some \u2013 once we \u2013 once \u2013 as Dave mentioned, once we finalize everything for 2016, we'll provide some additional color and details at Analyst Day. So, those programs are continuing to add value. I'll turn it over to Jon.","Jonathan C. Roberts - Executive Vice President & President, CVS\/caremark","Yeah, I mean, Lisa, this is Jon. As we talk to our clients, we just had advisory council meetings on both the employer and the health plan side. Pharmacy is their highest priority when they look at their overall health care costs and they are \u2013 they will be much more aggressive moving forward in plan designs than they have historically been. So, they're looking for us to show them opportunities to more tightly manage their benefits, which will save them money and at the same time, we believe, in many cases drive more share into our channels.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And also drive profitability right? That's the correct way to think about this?","Larry J. Merlo - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's correct.","Jonathan C. Roberts - Executive Vice President & President, CVS\/caremark","Yes.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Larry J. Merlo - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. I'm going to go back to the dead horse here and talk about the Retail side a little bit. I guess can you give us any color or quantify the impact of mix and kind of changing script mix on the margin profile of the business? You've talked \u2013 mentioned a couple times on the call about the growth in Medicaid and Medicare. We continue to see the reimbursement compression in Med D. I guess, can you kind of quantify the mix effect, or talk a little about the mix effect of kind of who's walking in the door in the prescription dispensing and regional business?","David M. Denton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, George, that's a great question. We're not going to \u2013 we can't do that today. We're not going to do that today. I will say one thing about that is that you've heard Larry and I speak and others speak about this in the past. As we've been very focused on as we think about our participation in Medicare Part D in preferred situations in the sense that being a preferred provider in some of those networks, we look at the economics, we model the economics and we make decisions that's in the best interest of our company on how we participate in those. And so we have chosen in many cases not to participate but it doesn't make good economic sense and we participate where we can actually drive value for the plan participants in the plans and the payers that we support in that space. And we're very focused, we're very disciplined on that and we make very I think rational decisions there.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay and then maybe my quick follow-up would be, so Larry has said that reimbursement pressure has not changed. As I think about the store, is kind of reimbursement pressure in the different silos constant and mix is changing, and that's kind of driving the impact? Or is just the rate of decline across the book of business kind of the same, and then maybe just the tackle, a quick comment on what you're seeing in preferred or restricted network strategies in commercial? Thanks.","David M. Denton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, what we have said is that the reimbursement, the intensity of the reimbursement pressure has not changed, but we have seen obviously consistent with what we said at last Analyst Day is that Medicare and Medicaid are really the areas of growth in this business at the moment and they carry a lower margin rate and that's the reality. And as we indicated before, we work kind of three ways to kind of offset that reimbursement pressure in our business. First, we work to improve our purchasing economics. And we've been pretty creative in that fashion. Red Oak's a great example, or exclusive formularies are a great example of how we reduce our cost of goods sold. Secondly, we work hard to improve the efficiency across our operation. We put in technologies and processes to make us fill our scripts more efficiently throughout all of our store base and in our mail centers.","And finally, and most importantly, we work to put programs in place that drive value for our payers but also drive share into one of our dispensing channels. And those efforts, they take time. They take time to implement. And we're working hard at that. You've seen rapid adoption of Maintenance Choice. There's \u2013 and you see, you are beginning to see some adoption of, I'll say, limited networks in some Medicaid areas. But we continue to push in that area to offset those margin pressures.","Larry J. Merlo - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And, George, I do \u2013 it's Larry. The second part of your question, I do think we're seeing and we will see a growing appetite for preferred or premium or restricted networks, whatever verbs or words you want to use. And if you look at the Medicaid space, we've seen that. Okay? We've got \u2013 today we've got more than half the Medicaid business that is now no longer fee-for-service. It's managed Medicaid. And I think as Jon mentioned a minute ago, clients are continuing to look for cost saving ways in which they can reduce their overall pharmacy spend.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Larsen with Leerink Partners. Please proceed with your question.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Hey. Can you talk about pricing a bit and how that impacts your overall book? So, if we see a deceleration in generic inflation, how will that impact your enterprise? I mean isn't that a tailwind to your retail gross margins? And then also, your specialty products, if the rate of inflation starts to decelerate, what sort of impact could there be on your book? Thanks.","David M. Denton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Dave, this is Dave. Just a couple of things. First and foremost, our focus is to lower cost for the payers and clients that we serve. And every day we come to work focused against that. I would say that from a generic standpoint, there has been a lot of chatter around generic inflation in the industry. Keep in mind, generics overall are a deflationary category for us, and they continue to be a deflationary category. We have been effective at managing that, and that has had essentially an immaterial impact on our performance. And we expect that inflation events going forward to have an immaterial effect on our performance as well.","On the branded side of the world, we continue to model specifically what's happening from a branded inflation standpoint. We look at that very specifically molecule-by-molecule. Our expectation is that branded inflation will continue to occur. And again, we use many tools across our business to drive costs down in those categories, particularly within our formulary management aspect. We do think that if there's a deceleration or an acceleration of branded inflation, we don't believe it to have a material effect across our line of business, all of our businesses.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay, that's very helpful, thanks. And then in terms of the PBM wins, if I understand you correctly, these are large wins that will roll into 2016, but it can time to basically drive incremental earnings from those. You've got to sell your managed choice program and as you're successful in that, you can drive more store traffic to the CVS channel. And over time, you will realize incremental earnings from those new client starts?","David M. Denton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's correct. I think the challenge, as I said in my prepared remarks, an employer with one decision maker can make the decision for their entire book of business. So at a stroke of a pen, an employer who has 100,000 member group can offer Maintenance Choice. In health plans, that's not how it works. A health plan might really want to adopt Maintenance Choice, as an example, but then they have to go get their sales teams to go out and call upon all of their clients. And they sell that program in client by client by client. And that just takes time.","Larry J. Merlo - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And, Dave, if you go back to our Analyst Day last December, I think it might have been in Jon's presentation when we looked at the employer segment and the health plan segment. And we showed what percent of pharmacy business went through one of our distribution channels, and in the employer segment, that number was in the high 50%s, in the health plan segment that number was in the high 20%s, recognizing the point that you and Dave were just making, and obviously, it takes a while, but at the same time, there's a lot of white space there and a big opportunity for growth as we go forward","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hey, Larry. A big, big, big picture question, if you look at the pure Retail business, and I know you look at it holistically but that business as it is presently constituted, do you think we are approaching a profit margin ceiling? And if not, what are the one or two kind of big ideas that can change that? Is personalized digital circulars and doing away with print, is that one of those things that can move the needle a lot from where we are today?","Larry J. Merlo - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, John, I'll take the first part, and then ask Helena to comment on our personalization efforts. But John, as you know, we have been one of the leaders in that space and I would turn around and tell you that we have not capped our opportunity in terms of operating margin performance. And if you think about the fact that, again, we continue to be focused on ways in which we can become even more productive and efficient, but it's also about growing the top line and the benefits in growing share, the leverage that that creates for the bottom line as we're able to leverage a lot of those fixed costs across that next sales dollar. So, we certainly see opportunities for more growth there.","Helena B. Foulkes - Executive Vice President & President-CVS\/pharmacy","Right. And just building on that, I agree with Larry, the number one way that we think about it is that idea of script growth and leveraging our fixed assets, but we're also really excited about all the opportunity that exists in the front store, and we'll talk more about this at Analyst Day, but you heard me say last year that we've got five key elements of our growth strategy, and they were around better health made easy, elevating beauty, customer-driven personalization, myCVS Store, and digital innovation. And I think the combination of personalization and digital innovation really strikes us as our biggest opportunity.","And certainly, we have a 17-year history of using ExtraCare. We have 70 million active members. But I have to say in the last year, the work that the team has done to really identify even further opportunities to continue to pull back on our core mass circular efforts and reinvest that margin in higher-performing opportunities with customers who have lots of upside, that's where we're excited. And I'd be happy to share more of that when we see you in December.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","All right. And then just secondly, where are we with the uptake on Maintenance Choice 2.0? Is there yet an acceleration or is it too early? Starting with 2.0 and moving to sort of core Maintenance Choice; is that likely a couple of years down the road or are we seeing any of that yet?","Jonathan C. Roberts - Executive Vice President & President, CVS\/caremark","Well, John, we continue \u2013 this is Jon. We continue to see growth in Maintenance Choice. 2.0 made it attractive to a broader suite of clients. So we have 2,400 clients, we're approaching 23 million lives. We saw the ceiling on it is 34 million lives, so we're continuing to grow. And I think as with pharmacy being such front-and-center as payers look for opportunities to manage those costs, I think Maintenance Choice becomes a great opportunity for them to bring their pharmacy costs down.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Wiltamuth with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning. I wonder if you could give us the specialty growth number in the quarter, excluding Omnicare? And then digging in a little more on specialty big picture, how would you be impacted if the space does come under a little more regulatory scrutiny and we put some price controls on some of the manufacturers there?","Larry J. Merlo - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Mark, it's Larry. Our growth without Omnicare in specialty was 27%. I think in our prepared remarks, we said it was 32% with Omnicare included. Mark, our views on all this noise about price controls, it's not the first time we've heard that rhetoric in the market. As Dave mentioned, we get up every day and focus on how we can reduce costs for our clients and we've got a multitude of ways that we have done that across both the traditional pharmacy business, as well as the specialty business, and there are solutions to further reducing costs. And the umbrella centers around introducing more competition within therapeutic classes that would allow us to do an even more effective job with what we do today.","And I'm sure you are aware there is a backlog of approvals, awaiting decision in the FDA. That's certainly one way to increase competition and at the same time, there is a huge opportunity to reduce costs by focusing on site of care administration and getting the right reimbursements aligned that promotes that method of delivery versus care being delivered in an outpatient center and we've been able to demonstrate the savings that we can create for clients and their members through Coram with infusions in our retail infusion site or at home.","Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC","I think what I was trying to get at is what does that do to your profitability outlook, if things come under controls?","Larry J. Merlo - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well I think it goes back, Mark, a little bit to what Dave was talking about in terms of, as you look across the enterprise, okay, we could see different effects and different segments, but across our enterprise we believe that it would have a muted and immaterial effect.","Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Larry J. Merlo - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Priya Joy Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you for taking the question. Just shifting gears a little bit. Dave, it looks like you still need to undertake the vast majority of your sale leaseback actions for the year. Are you seeing any shifts in market dynamics that might support most of that coming out of the 144A market that you use, or should we think about you guys undertaking a more balanced approach, similar to what you've done across markets in prior years?","David M. Denton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Priya, good question. I think what we have \u2013 I think the market is still robust for us from a sale leaseback perspective. I think we have used multiple mechanisms to support our program; I think that has allowed us to ensure that we competitively price all of our programs. We are \u2013 I think it's a great program. I think we've done a good job of making sure that we have a lot of active participants in the program, and that has allowed us to, I think, drive costs out of the program quite frankly. Again, like the pharmacy business, competition especially helps and we work hard to create competition in the space","Priya Joy Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","David M. Denton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions, and really appreciated all the detail, Dave, in the spreadsheets and the presentation. So what I wanted to get into, and I know people have been talking about it a lot, but I'm just trying to understand, you guys talked about reimbursement pressures, and that there is always offsets, and I think Dave, you outlined three different offsets. So I guess what I'm trying to frame is what's missing in 2016 or maybe is a little less of an offset when compared to 2014 and 2015 of the three buckets that you outlined for us?","David M. Denton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Scott, that's a great question. Listen, I think that's probably a topic mostly for Analyst Day, quite frankly at this point in time. I would say as we look forward, our growth rate is still pretty robust. I think that we continue to work to gain share, we are gaining share and growing our business across both segments. And as we indicated a little bit, the opportunity really is probably to grow dispensing share over time. And that just \u2013 unfortunately that just doesn't happen out of the gate. We have to work hard to do that over time, and I think you are seeing some of that.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then this is kind of just \u2013 two little follow-ups. Do you expect any divestitures needed with Target?","David M. Denton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The data doesn't support that.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.","David M. Denton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","But we'll have to see.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","And then the second thing that kind of caught my attention and you said I believe there is some recent utilization softness, and I was wondering, we have seen indications very recently of some softness out of the consumer. What's your take on that? I think you gave us some explanations, but I don't know what your take on that was.","David M. Denton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I think, I am sorry, maybe I will clarify my comment. The softness that we've seen a little bit is mainly around the acute seasonal business.","Larry J. Merlo - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Seasonal business.","David M. Denton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And I don't know if that is due to dynamics from a weather perspective, over what have you, but that's really been the softness. And then secondly, we are cycling the expansion of Medicaid, the Medicaid programs from last year. So that kind of I'd say, dilutes the year-over-year growth rate, if you will.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, so you don't really see it as a consumer issue, don't see anything in the front-end?","David M. Denton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. There's nothing that indicates there's a consumer issue here. No.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Perfect. Thanks, guys.

Please proceed with your question.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Good morning.","Larry J. Merlo - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Wanted to circle back, I don't know if you agreed with the math discussed earlier of the underlying 7% to 11% growth in 2016 excluding the benefit from the acquisitions, but comment on if you think that's in the right range, and what you think that number looks like in 2017? And I appreciate sort of the 10% to 14% long-term, but just curious if the underlying in 2016 you would think would look different in 2017, or is that the right way to think about the underlying ex-acquisitions going forward?","David M. Denton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Eric, you're getting way ahead of it here, buddy. 2017. I think let's just focus on 2016 at the moment. Listen, again, I think we're pretty confident in our outlook for next year. We continue to make progress, as I say, gaining and growing share across both of our business segments. I would say that as we talked about our financial plan, we always talked about the fact that we include bolt-on acquisitions in our plan, and that is consistent with our expectation.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay, and then if I could just \u2013 and I appreciate that year-by-year thought process.","David M. Denton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","But I will go back. Eric, one thing. As I said earlier, when we made those financial targets, we set those financial targets, we have been, I'd say, trending to the high side of those targets through 2013 through 2016. And those financial targets remain in place. We think they're appropriate for our business and our business model and the environment we compete in. And so we are not \u2013 we stand behind those and none of that has changed.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. I guess the follow up, if you could just provide a little bit of clarity, the 2013, 2014, 2015 at the high end of that without acquisition benefit, there's more acquisition benefit in 2016, and you're still in the same range. So what's different ex the acquisition in 2016 relative to the 2013, 2014, 2015?","David M. Denton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We also did \u2013 we did Coram and other acquisitions as well. So you can't predict the timing of some of these acquisitions. They happen when they happen when the market's available, so...","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. Okay. Very good. Thank you.","David M.

Can you maybe talk about the uptake you have seen, and how that's shaping your view of biosimilars going forward?","Larry J. Merlo - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That particular product is really not a good proxy for us to comment on because it's largely a product that is utilized in a hospital setting.

Last question please?","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning. So a lot of the critical questions have been asked at this point. The one I wanted to still touch on a little bit here was just, without giving any specific numbers around Red Oak, just trying to get a sense for how material your overall volume discounts on generic procurement will be by adding Omnicare and eventually Target?","And really, just the thought pattern is, is it more about improving the COGS just for those two additional books by leveraging your current pricing and procurement levels, or is there still adequate runway to improve your overall COGS by adding this volume?","David M. Denton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","This is Dave. I think obviously in the short run the real opportunity \u2013 the immediate-term opportunity is improving the COGS within those businesses, specifically as they transition into our program. As you know, Red Oak is focused on partnering with generic manufacturers to drive, I'll say, win-win scenarios that drive cost improvements for us and also savings for them from a manufacturing perspective. And I think the team has done just a terrific job getting our program up and running and this is a job that's not done, we're constantly working on this and we're constantly figuring out ways to improve our supply chain, reduce cost of generics that we procure.","Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. All right. By the way, as far as maybe slightly softer 2016 outlook, are we sure it's not because you're taking Philidor out of the network for next year?

Now, I will turn the call over to Larry.","Larry Merlo","Thanks, Valerie. And good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us.","2019 was a transformational year for CVS Health and we have made significant progress in our first full year after acquiring Aetna. We have been executing against our plan which has been delivering substantial value above our initial expectations.","And this value is driven by growth across our businesses as well as contributions from our integration synergies. Eva will provide the details on our 2019 performance along with our improved outlook for 2020, and I will provide a few financial highlights and discuss our operational execution.","For the full-year 2019, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $7.08 with total revenues of nearly $257 billion, up 32% reflecting a full year of Aetna\u2019s operations and positive momentum across our enterprise.","We generated strong cash flows from operations of $12.8 billion, enabling us to repay $4.7 billion of net long-term debt, return $2.6 billion to shareholders in the form of cash dividends, and continue to invest to accelerate future growth of our enterprise.","Moving to 2020, we expect continued progress with adjusted earnings per share in the range of $7.04 to $7.17, representing growth of approximately 3% to 5% over our 2019 baseline of $6.83, which excludes net realized capital gains and prior year\u2019s development. This growth is ahead of what we outlined at our June Investor Day last year.","Now, our strong performance as a combined company along with positive feedback from our key stakeholders gives us even greater confidence in our ability to accelerate growth in 2020 and beyond.","We have set a clear and bold path for CVS Health to be the most consumer-centric health company, transforming the way care is delivered in the U.S. and a significant part of that is delivering an expanded suite of integrated health services across our businesses. And with over a year of successful integration, we have laid a strong foundation for growth.","We remain focused on making healthcare more local across the country, making healthcare simpler to help consumers better navigate their health and make informed decisions, and helping people achieve their best health outcome, particularly when it comes to managing chronic disease.","We have four priorities that guide our transformation as we outlined at our June Investor Day. And they are grow and differentiate our businesses, deliver transformational products and services, create a consumer-centric technology infrastructure, and modernize enterprise functions and capabilities. And we have advanced all four of these priorities in the past year. And I will briefly touch on a few recent highlights to demonstrate areas where we have momentum and are driving innovation.","In Health Care Benefits, we have grown our membership to $22.9 million, up nearly 4% over last year, driven by strong growth in our government services businesses. In particular, our Medicare Advantage business grew by over three times the industry average in 2019 generating outstanding membership growth of over 30% in both our individual and group Medicare products.","Last year in our commercial book, we implemented zero or low co-pay options for members at our MinuteClinics, with three million members enrolled for January 2020. At Caremark, we recently announced a new zero out of pocket program for diabetes care. We expect enrolled members on average to save an estimated $467 per year in out-of-pocket expenses.","In the area of chronic disease management, we have developed a number of innovative pilot programs and service offerings. As an example, transform oncology care is a new program that pulls together our integrated assets and capabilities. It includes the precision medicine program that uses the latest genomic science and technology to help patients receive the most effective cancer treatments.","We are also bringing innovation to the point of care at our retail pharmacies, which are at the forefront of our effort to make quality healthcare more accessible, simple, seamless and affordable.","And our HealthHUBs are the most visible aspect of our integrated offerings and an important component of our comprehensive strategy to fundamentally transform the way we deliver care to millions of Americans locally.","Now as we expand our MinuteClinics and HealthHUBs where our practitioners can treat about 80% of what a primary care physician can treat, we expect to help patients avoid more costly or unnecessary care. We also began rolling out pharmacist panels at our HealthHUBs, which we will expand to other retail locations.","And these panels provide a holistic 360-degree view of the patient, by combining pharmacy and medical data. And having integrated data at their fingertips, our pharmacists can improve medication adherence, optimize medication regimens, close gaps in care and connect patients to their health plan at MinuteClinic or other appropriate resources.","Now our hubs continue to outperform their control group with higher script volume and increased MinuteClinic visits, and our front store sales are in line with expectations and we continue to see increased utilization of health-related services.","Now a key part of our consumer-centric care strategy is meeting people where they are including in the palm of their hand. And we are seeing positive uptake of our digital strategy as consumers increasingly engage with us through our apps, online and via text messaging. And we are seeing higher rates of satisfaction and loyalty from our digitally engaged consumers.","So those are just a few of our accomplishments with several more listed in our slide presentation, and they are the validation points that the Aetna integration activities over the past year have established a solid foundation to accelerate the pace of innovation, bring our unique offerings to more and more people, and drive profitable growth.","As we continue to innovate and execute, we will stay close to the markets we serve and respond to the needs of our clients. What this means for our four key priorities is the following. Within the health plan landscape, our clients, they are looking to us for solutions and innovation. In particular, the expansion of government programs creates a need for our services to manage complex, high acuity and chronic condition consumers.","And with our convenient and local touch points in place and with our advanced data and analytics, we have the ability to creatively and efficiently deliver local personal high-touch care with new products and service offerings coming to market.","Second, the importance of specialty medicine and gene therapy benefit management solutions and services, it continues to grow. This year, we estimate about 60% of pharmacy spend is specialty and that includes that paid under the medical benefit, and it could reach 25% of total healthcare costs over the next several years.","And we are continuously innovating and bringing new programs and solutions to our clients and further innovation in this area is imperative to delivering a better patient experience and lowering costs.","Third is the importance of our open platform approach. We are committed to extending to our many health plan clients, the technology offerings and healthcare services that we developed in-house. We have about 350 health plan relationships and over 100 health system alliances across the enterprise.","And it is vital that we continue to grow these relationships and help these clients solve the issues they are managing. And our integrated model will benefit us as we not only transform our business, but also lead the transformation of the greater healthcare landscape.","And finally as discussed earlier, we are continuing to enhance our local offerings through our HealthHUBs and our MinuteClinics, working to not leave any white space for disruption. For us, the value within the four walls of our retail locations is only growing in the form of higher margin products and services, increased traffic, and medical cost savings.","So with the substantial progress that we have made executing our plan, today\u2019s leadership announcement positions our company to further accelerate growth. These changes will enable us to more rapidly bring our innovations to market by placing our experienced leaders in areas where their immediate past experience and deep relationships in the businesses will enhance execution of both our core growth initiatives and our transformation strategies.","This announcement also reflects our deep and talented bench along with the opportunities our business model creates for personal growth. So let me take a moment to congratulate Alan, Jonathan and Alec on their new roles. And I also want to thank Derica for his leadership and contributions.","And Derica and Alan will work together to ensure smooth transition. So I\u2019m confident that we have the right leadership team in place and we are at the forefront of driving a sea change in how our key stakeholders think about us, and how consumers work with us to take control of their health.","And with that, let me turn it over to Eva.","Eva Boratto","Thanks, Larry, and good morning everyone. As Larry stated, our strong performance across the enterprise continued in the fourth quarter, capping off a successful year across all of our businesses. In the fourth quarter, we delivered adjusted EPS of $1.73 and our consolidated adjusted revenues grew 23.1% year-over-year.","The increase in revenue was primarily driven by the addition of Aetna in the Health Care Benefits segment, followed by higher volume in both the Pharmacy Services and Retail\/Long-Term Care segments. The fourth quarter also benefited from a lower-than-anticipated tax rate.","Looking at our fourth quarter results by segment. Within Pharmacy Services, total revenues increased 6.2% year-over-year, exceeding our expectations. Our growth was driven by increased volume, specialty including the on-boarding of IngenioRx and brand inflation.","Pharmacy Services adjusted operating income increased 1.5% versus last year, in line with expectations, primarily due to increased claims volume, the shift of Aetna\u2019s mail order and specialty operations into our Pharmacy Services segment, and improved purchasing economics, including the benefit from synergies. This was partially offset by continued price compression.","Moving to our Retail\/Long-Term Care segment. Performance was in line with our expectations with total revenues up 2.5% year-over-year. We delivered strong adjusted script growth of 5.6% with comp scripts up 6.9%, primarily driven by the continued adoption of our patient care programs.","Our fourth quarter share of retail scripts was 26.8%, up 80 basis points. Front store sales and operating income continued to be a positive driver in the fourth quarter. Same-store front store sales increased 0.7%, primarily driven by increases in health and beauty, including strength in cough and cold sales.","Adjusted operating income for Retail\/Long-Term Care declined 4.4% as expected, primarily due to continued reimbursement pressure. Throughout the year, Retail\/Long-Term Care adjusted operating income benefited from increased volume and higher generic dispensing rate.","Turning to Health Care Benefits. The segment delivered results that were in line with our expectations. Total revenues continued to benefit from strong membership growth in our government products.","Total health MBR was 85.7% for the quarter and 84.2% for the year, in line with our expectations. Health Care Benefits expenses were higher in the fourth quarter related to our readiness investments for one, one plan starts.","Next, I will briefly touch on our strong cash generation and disciplined capital allocation strategy. In 2019, we generated significant cash from operations of $12.8 billion coming in materially above our expectations.","Cash flow was primarily driven by improvements in working capital, including the timing of certain payables and receivables, which will partially impact our 2020 guidance. We used approximately $4.7 billion of cash to repay net long-term debt in 2019.","And since the close of the Aetna transaction, we have repaid approximately $8 billion of net long-term debt. As Larry mentioned, we also returned $2.6 billion to shareholders through cash dividends during the year.","Transitioning to our 2020 guidance. Full-year adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $7.04 to $7.17, reflecting an increase of 3% to 5% from our 2019 baseline of $6.83. Given our successful integration activity and execution of our strategic priorities, our outlook is more favorable with growth projections improving to low-to-mid single-digit growth versus our previous expectation for low-single-digit growth.","As a reminder, our 2020 financial projections exclude net realized capital gains and prior year\u2019s development, which contributed about $0.25 to the full-year 2019 results. We expect consolidated full-year 2020 adjusted operating income to be in the range of $15.5 billion to $15.8 billion, up 1.25% to 2.75%, with consolidated total revenues in the range of $262.0 billion to $265.5 billion, up 2% to 3.5%.","We expect integration synergies in the range of $800 million to $900 million in 2020, up from our previous expectation of about $800 million. Integration synergies in 2020 will continue to come from the integration of our operations, streamlining of functions, contracting efficiencies and medical cost savings, as we have discussed in the past.","Projected integration costs of approximately $450 million are excluded from our non-GAAP results. We expect to deliver between $10.5 billion and $11.0 billion of cash flow from operations in 2020. As I have previously stated, this includes the timing impact of certain payables and receivables that contributed to our 2019 outperformance.","After the payment of our shareholder dividend, capital retention to support projected growth in our insurance operations and gross capital expenditures of $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion, we plan to use the remaining $4.2 billion to $4.6 billion of cash available to continue to pay down debt.","We remain on track to reach our goal of low three times leverage in 2022. We continue to expect to generate between $10 billion to $12 billion in cash annually to enhance shareholder value in the long term. As previously stated, we will maintain our dividend of $2.00 per share, demonstrating our commitment to return capital to our shareholders.","Keep in mind that because we are not repurchasing shares, the weighted average shares outstanding continues to increase with compensation-related share issuance, including option exercises. Our 2020 adjusted earnings per share guidance reflects approximately $0.08 of dilution from those incremental shares.","Moving to our segments. For the full-year 2020, we expect Pharmacy Services revenues to be in the range of $137.5 billion to $139.5 billion, with adjusted operating income of $5.2 billion to $5.3 billion representing projected growth of 2.25% to 3.75%. This improvement relative to our Investor Day outlook is due to improved business retention and stronger purchasing economics.","Since our Q3 earnings call, net new business improved by $2.8 billion, reflecting our business momentum. Included in our net new business is the retention of a larger portion of the Centene contract as well as additional client wins. We are pleased to report that we have extended our contract with Centene through 2022.","Year-over-year adjusted operating income growth is attributable to specialty performance, continued improvement in purchasing economics and enterprise modernization. Offsetting these positive factors is continued industry wide price compression and the net losses in the selling season. We continue to cycle through our rebate guarantee challenges, resulting from lower brand inflation, which we have discussed on previous calls.","Additionally, looking ahead to the 2021 selling season, we are pleased to report that to date, we have completed approximately 65% of renewals with strong retention, including the extension of the FEP contract through 2021, and the renewal of the WellCare contract through 2023.","Our PBM model continues to be vital in managing drug costs. The importance of scale, expertise and customer relationships will continue to be paramount and we remain focused on delivering the value that our clients expect.","Now, let me turn to Retail\/Long-Term Care. We expect full-year 2020 Retail\/Long-Term Care total revenues to be between $87.5 billion and $88.8 billion, with adjusted operating income of $6.7 billion to $6.8 billion representing projected growth of 0.25% to 1.75%.","Retail is expected to continue to deliver strong adjusted script growth of 4.5% to 6.5%, due to its continued successful execution of our patient care programs, including pharmacy clinical care that improved both medication adherence and patient retention. We expect our pharmacy growth to be partially offset by continued reimbursement pressure.","Front store operations are expected to drive increased bottom line growth with a focus on our health and beauty business, and improved personalization and customer engagement. Finally, we expect Retail\/Long-Term Care to benefit from operating productivity enhancements delivered by our enterprise modernization.","Within the Health Care Benefits segment, we expect total revenues to be in the range of $74.1 billion to $74.8 billion, with adjusted operating income of $5.5 billion to $5.6 billion in 2020 representing projected growth of 5.00% to 6.75%. Growth is off reported 2019 results.","We expect continued strength in our government products driving top line growth. We expect to end 2020 with between 23.1 million and 23.4 million medical members, fueled by Medicare Advantage and Medicaid growth, including the acquisition of IlliniCare from Centene.","There are a few items to consider for Health Care Benefits. First, integration synergies will continue to disproportionately benefit the Health Care Benefits segment. Our full-year MBR is expected to be approximately 83%, plus or minus 50 basis points. Compared to 2019, there is an approximate 160 basis point benefit from the inclusion of the HIF in 2020.","From an adjusted EPS perspective, the effect of the HIF is a drag of approximately $0.13 year-over-year. Our core commercial medical cost trend is expected to be approximately 6%, plus or minus 50 basis points, even with the effective leap day. Adjusted operating income will be impacted by the divestiture of WellCare, and partially offsetting that is the acquisition of IlliniCare.","Starting in 2020, we will no longer provide quarterly earnings per share guidance. We will continue to provide directional color and insights on our expected performance drivers that may impact the quarterly progression of earnings, relative to historical results to provide transparency.","As we transform our business, we are highly focused on the enterprise as a whole and achieving our goals. We are managing our integrated business with the goal of driving long-term shareholder value. And our internal compensation metrics are also based on our annual performance.","With that introduction, let me provide some color about the quarterly progression of earnings we expect in 2020. Q1 is expected to be the lowest earnings quarter for the year due to the seasonality in both the Pharmacy Services and Retail\/Long-Term Care segments.","Similar to 2019, Health Care Benefits\u2019 lowest earnings quarter will be the fourth quarter due to the earnings progression for that segment, including spending to support January readiness. We also expect that benefit from enterprise modernization to ramp over the course of the year, while integration synergies will be more ratable throughout the year.","In summary, we are very pleased with the progress we have made since the close of the Aetna Acquisition and have strong confidence in our outlook for 2020, as well as the long-term trajectory of our enterprise. Over the course of the year, we will provide you with additional updates on our progress related to our transformation efforts and the status of our HealthHUB roll-out.","With that, let\u2019s open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]The first question comes from George Hill of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","George Hill","Hey, good morning, guys. And thanks for taking the question. I think I want to start in the PBM segment, Larry and Eva. I guess if we look at the 2020 guide versus 2019, the revenue numbers are very close, the claims numbers are very close, but profitability seems markedly improved. So I guess could you talk about the dynamic of what is going on in that segment, where kind of a similar claims number and a similar revenue number is driving kind of better than expected profitability?","Eva Boratto","Yes, George, this is Eva. I will start and then if Larry or Derica want to jump in. Overall, we are quite pleased with the expectations for the PBM segment that we laid out today. Clearly, it is a significant improvement from what we gave at our Investor Day.","And as you look at that business, there are two key drivers from the results we provided previously. A, improvement in the selling season that we outlined. And B, what I will call continued purchasing economics.","We have worked hard in improving our underlying cost of goods, thinking about our rebates, working through our rebate challenges, improvements in the network generics. And as we look at all of those factors, it is yielding the results.","Additionally, I don\u2019t want to lose our modernization effort, it is also contributing to the expectations for the PBM.","Derica Rice","George, this is Derica. I would also say -- I also recall that 2019 was an investment year for us in terms of the Anthem on IngenioRx implementation, and we have stated that in 2020 that become very profitable proposition for us.","And as Eva said, we have obviously been working hard to reverse our rebate exposure and we have seen that that exposure has lessened in our outlook for 2020 versus the peak that we realized in 2019. So we are on track, and in fact ahead of where we thought we would be in terms of reducing that exposure and mitigating that over time.","Eva Boratto","And recall, as you think about our claims in year-over-year, in the claims, you will see the benefit of the ramp of the on-boarding the Anthem contract on the network perspective. And that does not flow through to revenue as that account is on a net basis.","George Hill","Okay, that is helpful. And then maybe just a quick follow-up is, you brought up enterprise modernization. It seems like you guys narrowed the range on that a little bit. I guess I would just ask, kind of what drove the narrowing versus the top-end? And I guess, did you feel like there were any opportunities that you saw before that you are not able to capitalize on, or just any comments on there? I think that would be helpful. Thank you.","Eva Boratto","No, George. From an overall financial perspective, we are really confident in that program. As we got closer, we just wanted to tighten the range a bit as we look out in 2020. And Jon can provide some color on some of the initiatives.","Jonathan Roberts","Yes. George, so we are well under way with our modernization efforts and very happy with where we are. And as you recall, we are focused on working smarter to deliver substantial cost benefits, while at the same time delivering an unmatched consumer experience.","So some key focus areas are technology modernization, so rationalizing the number of applications that we use across our enterprise, developing centers of excellence that will deliver higher levels of service at lower cost. Examples data, robotics are centers of excellence for us. We are also moving to a hybrid cloud environment that will not only lower cost, but significantly reduce the time to build and deploy new capabilities.","We are also working on productivity improvements, optimizing our call centers by taking calls out, by leveraging artificial intelligence, natural language processing and robotics along with other technologies. We are rationalizing the vendors and optimizing those, and then there are business initiatives that will focus on the digitization of manual processes across our company.","And finally, we are leveraging and advancing our integrated data and analytics capabilities. And as an example, that will allow us to implement enhanced workforce management tools that allows us to schedule to better serve our customers. So those are some examples.","I think we actually see the opportunity we originally envisioned, and this is a multi-year effort that will deliver substantial savings while at the same time improving service to both our customers and our own employees.","Operator","Your next question comes from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Justin Lake","Wanted to first follow-up on the question and Derica\u2019s comments on rebate guarantees. Just quickly, have we kind of seen the bottom there, I know you were expecting another level of improvement into 2021, that kind of recapture happen faster or should we still see a meaningful change in 2021 on rebate guarantees in terms of improvement?","Eva Boratto","Yes, I think, Justin, on the rebate guarantee, as we said, the impact was greatest in 2019. It is still a headwind in 2020, albeit less of a headwind. And we do see the issue essentially immaterial as you head into 2021.","Larry Merlo","And Justin, keep in mind as you heard us talk throughout 2019, we were able to mitigate a portion of those headwinds working with clients, and clients adopting a more complete formulary, which created a win-win. There was value for them and that helped us offset some of the potential headwind associated with that.","Justin Lake","Thanks. And then my core question was just around the intercompany numbers. Your intercompany number, if I\u2019m backing into it correctly, looks like it is down a few billion dollars year-over-year on revenue, which makes sense, I think given the divestiture of those Aetna PDP lives. But the intercompany actual profitability, which I thought also might have went down instead got worse, instead of getting better. So the drag on intercompany looks like it is actually a bigger negative EBIT year-over-year, which I thought a little bit strange. So I was wondering if you could flush out what happened whatever intercompany, especially the increased drag on intercompany at the corporate -- from an EBIT perspective. Thanks.","Eva Boratto","Yes. I think, Justin, as you look at the intercompany, clearly, with the net new business selling season being down, that that can affect that elimination of those clients had Maintenance Choice and what have you. And as you look at the margin that we record there, right, that reflects the underlying margin of that business, for which that has adopted Maintenance Choice. So there is an aspect of price compression that that flows through there.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Robert Jones","Great. Yes, thanks for the questions. I guess maybe over on the retail guidance. We have the specific guidance now, which seems largely in line with your previous communications for low-single-digit growth. But now we are a quarter closer, I\u2019m wondering if maybe you could just walk through the major building blocks coming off a year clearly that you saw high-single-digit declines in EBIT growth in 2019. So just wondering if you could give us the major blocks again now probably having a little bit more clarity than you did at the time of the last communication that helps get us from the down high-single to the up low-single will be really helpful.","Eva Boratto","Yes. This is Eva. I will take that. So as you look at returning to low-single-digit growth, I think there are four things that I will highlight. Right. It is the result of continued solid script growth, improvement from generics, and a meaningful impact from modernization.","As we have said, the modernization initiative I think disproportionately benefit the retail segment versus our other segments as we look at 2020. I will remind you that we no longer have the headwind of the tax reform investment that we were wrapping through in the first half of 2019.","Jonathan Roberts","And this is Jon Roberts. The only other thing I would say is, we are also working to reposition the front store with a focus on health and beauty. We are pivoting to the HealthHUBs. And then we are growing in the front, growing margin in the front, growing the top line a little bit through our focus on execution around personalization.","Robert Jones","No, that is helpful. And then I guess the follow-up to that would be something as you guys are now closer to transitioning a lot of these stores. Is there any contemplation around what the drag or setback could be on comps? I know when you go through these transitions, obviously there is usually a bit of a one-step backwards before two steps forward. Is that contemplated as you think about the growth in the retail segment overall, in 2020?","Larry Merlo","Yes, Bob, it is Larry. It is. And as you have heard us talk late last year, as we get a bigger critical mass of the hubs operational, we will provide more quantitative guidance and you can expect that we will be in the spring, mid-year time frame.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ricky Goldwasser","Yes. Hi, good morning. So, one follow-up, and then another question. On the follow-up, you highlighted the HIF headwind is $0.13. When we think about what is changed in terms of HIF impact, what would be the impact from mid-year renewals on the commercial side due to the HIF repeal?","Karen Lynch","Hey Ricky, it is Karen. Obviously, we would factor that into our overall pricing as we move forward in our renewals with the commercial business that would be factored in. And it should be overall - we will balance the reduction with our margin expectations.","Eva Boratto","And Ricky, this is. Eva. So as we spoke about the HIF back in June, really that is the only change the repeal for 2021 relative to what we had discussed back in June.","Larry Merlo","And Ricky, just to make sure we are all on the same page. The $0.13 comprehends the question that you are asking.","Ricky Goldwasser","Understood. My question was, was it $0.10 before and now there is an incremental $0.03? Or we just get a sense of how much your head versus your original guide? That was the purpose of the question.","Eva Boratto","Yes. I think, Ricky, the repeal - we haven\u2019t broken that out, but it was a modest change to us adding a couple of pennies.","Ricky Goldwasser","Okay, understood. And then for my primary question, Larry, obviously you are expanding on the HealthHUBs. And one of the key questions that we are getting from investors is whether at some point we are going to see you adding a primary care function to the HealthHUB strategy. Obviously, primary care has become an important part of our vertical strategy for others in the industry. And wanted to get kind of like your view on whether this is something that you are considering in the future. I know that you have the relation with Teladoc, but Teladoc assumes to address kind of like the acute needs of the population versus primary care that could create greater stickiness over time.","Larry Merlo","Yes. Ricky, it is a great question. And as we sit today, we have talked a lot about utilization of Teladoc, okay, our technology capabilities there, as well as the opportunities that we have across the Aetna provider network. And Ricky, you heard in our prepared comments that today our nurse practitioners can treat about 80% of what is treated in a PCP office.","The one element that I want to emphasize that I want to make sure it doesn\u2019t get lost in all of this because we talk about being a complement to the role of the primary care physician. And as we talk to our Aetna members, our consumers, they do talk about the value that they have in the relationship with a PCP. And at the same time, they also talk about the need for - they use words like navigator.","We call it concierge. And the fact that it gets back to one of the imperatives in terms of the ability to be local, and the fact that people are looking - how can you help me access, how can you help me use my benefits, how can you help me navigate through this complex maze called healthcare? Our HealthHUBs are playing that role.","So I don\u2019t want that to get lost in this overall equation.","Operator","Your next question comes from Lisa Gill of JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Lisa Gill","Great, thanks very much. Good morning. I just want to start with the 2021 selling season and kind of compare it to 2020. So Larry, I heard you talk about in your prepared remarks the zero to low co-pay plan options for commercial members. One, is that just really in your Aetna book of business? Are you selling that within that the Caremark component? And then as we think about some of the plan designs that drove 2020 and you talked about the better profitability and aligning formularies, etc., how do we compare what you are selling for 2021 versus 2020?","Larry Merlo","Yes. Lisa, I will ask Derica to start and just start with the selling season broadly, and then we will dig into the questions there.","Derica Rice","Good morning, Lisa. If you think about it, when we came into the selling season, our book of business that was up for renewal was around $50 billion. And today, we have completed about 65% of that with a very high retention rate.","So we are off to a very strong start. And as you heard from Eva\u2019s opening comments, that included the retention of FEP, which we have signed through 2021 as well as we were also able to renew the WellCare book of business as well.","When you think about the economics of this, this is what is helping to drive our outlook for not only 2020, but our outlook for 2021 as well. So we don\u2019t anticipate having the net new business loss to overcome in 2021, that obviously we are overcoming in our guidance for 2020.","So that bodes very well. And then obviously when Larry talked about the formulary management, that really related to our efforts to mitigate our rebate exposure. And again, as I have stated previously, it was expected to peak in 2019 that began to mitigate in 2020 and we expect it to be de minimis by the time we get to 2021.","And then in terms of the zero-dollar co-pay, recall that we just launched a program here recently RxZERO for our diabetes patients, where essentially we removed the out-of-pocket burden. We think that that will not only improve access but adherence, but it will translate into improved health outcomes when we think about the medical claims that we expect to see downstream. And we are selling that to all our clients as well as our zero-dollar co-pay.","Larry Merlo","Yes, and Lisa, to that point, and then I will flip it over to Karen. Because to Derica\u2019s point, that zero co-pay at the diabetes care category is both for Aetna members as well as Caremark members.","And the excitement around that is, today as you know, the rebates get passed back to the plan sponsor and they have that tug and pull in terms of, do I apply those discounts at the pharmacy counter or do I apply those discounts in buying down the monthly premium. And this takes that off the table.","And by clients adopting the value formulary, OK, and the benefits of improved adherence reducing medical costs, they no longer have to make that decision. And that is the beauty of that program. But Karen, maybe I will flip it over to you.","Karen Lynch","And Lisa, just to give you some color on the 2020 enrollment, we have seen strong interest in the integrated pharmacy medical. We actually sold more integrated pharmacy members in January of 2020 than we did all of 2019. So obviously, a significant interest in the integration value and we had about 40% increase in new business was also sold with Pharmacy. So really strong results relative to the integrated story.","Lisa Gill","And how do I think about the profitability of things like the RxZERO diabetes program? Is pharma in some way helping to fund that in the way that you contracted for that? Is it that you are making it up with incremental scripts because people are going to be more adherent to the program? Just how do we think about those kind of programs and the profitability as we think about these going forward?","Derica Rice","Hi Lisa, this is Derica. Pharma is not funding this. In fact, if you think about the way we have constructed is pretty much self-funding. So one, through the client adopting our value formulary, they are able to create offsets in terms of their cost structure and then obviously they get the second offset with the improved medical outcomes downstream by have an improved adherence and compliance with the meds on the part of the diabetes patients.","So again it is a win-win for both, both the out-of-pocket burden for the member as well as the cost control in terms of downstream medical claim costs for the client themselves, or the plan sponsor.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin Caliendo of UBS. Your line is open.","Kevin Caliendo","Hi, thanks for taking my call. I want to go through some of the comments around the stronger purchasing economics. You mentioned both generics and in the PBM. I\u2019m guessing there is also better purchasing on specialty as well. What is the dynamic, like what is changing that is making your purchasing better incrementally? Just want to understand what is sort of changing over the last six months there.","Eva Boratto","I will start. Right. Overall, with our Red Oak venture as well as our internal teams, right, we work to improve our cost structure each and every day. And we look for opportunities. You are right. There is specialty opportunities, there is generics, our rebate negotiations, our network negotiations are all part of a contributor.","Jonathan Roberts","Yes, and this is Jon, Kevin. So, as you look out over the next couple of years, there is going to be significant launches of generics and biosimilars. As a matter of fact, between 2020 and 2023, there is going to be [indiscernible] of these launches.","And as Eva says, we are very happy with Red Oak. And we see an opportunity not only with new launches, but we also see opportunities in how we purchase existing complex generics, single source generics and existing biosimilars.","Derica Rice","And just don\u2019t underestimate also the comments Larry made earlier around having better formulary compliance on the part of our clients as well, which also improves the yield in terms of the utilization.","Kevin Caliendo","Okay. And just one quick follow-up. I was a little confused about the Centene renewal. In the past, it was $3.6 billion headwind, now it is $900 million or so with the WellCare renewal. Can you just help me understand sort of what happened there in terms of the headwind from that contract? Am I thinking about that right? Or, just some more detail around that would be really helpful.","Larry Merlo","Yes, Kevin, in-keep in mind that with Centene transaction just closing, these were two separate events. So the WellCare contract was extended. As you will recall, that contract went through 2020 and has been extended for another three-year period effective 1\/1\/21. And the dynamic around Centene is that contract was renewed again a three-year period starting 1\/1\/24, a larger portion of the Centene business than what was originally planned.","So some of the business rolled off to RxAdvance, largely the exchange business and some Medicaid programs. And we are retaining the balance of that business and we expect in both cases to operate that business for the value of that contract over the three-year contractual periods.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Cherny of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Michael Cherny","Good morning, and thanks so much for taking the question. I guess I just wanted to circle back, Lisa had asked some questions about the selling season. When you think about the selling season, and this is dramatic relative to the overall enterprise, how do you feel about where you need to be from a tipping point perspective when all of the pieces you are putting together within the integrated pharmacy medical offering, are fully resonating in the market? And I guess along those lines, what else start the consultants or plan sponsors are asking you to do that you are not already doing or that you have planned in the hub, but maybe try to accelerate to make sure that they can maximize the value they have of working with you?","Derica Rice","Michael, this is Derica, I will kick it off for the PBM. And Karen, if you have anything you want to add in terms of the Aetna book of business. But as it relates to the PBM, I will say that we have had really good feedback from both the client base when we talk to our health plan and employer clients, as well as the benefit consultants, when we hold our advisory meeting, and we actually just held one here recently at the beginning of January.","They are extremely excited about the opportunities with the HealthHub and our ability to integrate our pharmacy and medical claims, and use that four points of intervention on behalf of the member incite them to take their next best action from their own personal health. That is resonating very well, Michael.","And what we have seen is that, there were some question around how would health plans take on to this new integrated model. We have now had a number of health plans that have come and chosen into pilot with us on some of our care management programs, that we have in development.","So, again consistent with our open platform concept, we are bringing some of those new inventions and insights to them that we are developing along side with our Aetna colleagues. And that is actually playing out very well in the marketplace.","So I do think that that is contributing to our successful start to the 2021 selling season. And I would expect that to continue as we think about the remainder of the selling season, and as we move into 2022 as well. Karen?","Karen Lynch","Yes, Michael, very similar responses from our customers. We have recently met with our customers and our brokers. They are very excited about the opportunities from the HealthHUB, increasingly excited about the connectivity of the data and analytics, and really connecting the members throughout their personal health journey.","So that is where they are really excited about our care management programs, how we are connecting their employees into the communities. So it is been resonating quite well. I think that is why we have seen the increase in the integrated pharmacy medical sales that we had this -- with this open enrollment season.","But as we look to 2021, we will continue to develop new capabilities, we will be advancing our behavior change programs like our Aetna Advice or Aetna\u2019s Next Best Action. We will continue to drive at local sites of care using the HealthHUBs and MinuteClinics as a primary place for those sites of care.","We will continue to drive new benefit designs like our low-cost no co-pay MinuteClinic, but also looking at additional plan designs for first-dollar coverage. And then we will be continuing to round out our new clinical programs like RxZERO program and our transform oncology and our kidney care program, all of which have been resonating with the customers and the brokers.","Derica Rice","So Michael, what is really getting traction is our ability to solve for both the client and the member. It is not either-or, it is an and. And I think that is where the power in this really lies.","Operator","Your next question comes from Lance Wilkes of Bernstein. Your line is open.","Lance Wilkes","Yes, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to take a step back and let you address a little bit the management changes that have been taken place, and some of the new appointments you have got, maybe to put that in context with kind of your overall strategic vision and how you are looking at the company going forward and how you see the organization supporting that, if there are different roles and different sorts of talents you are looking for.","Larry Merlo","Yes, Lance, it is Larry. Look, I think everybody on this call is aware, organization structures evolve over time depending on the needs of the business. And we have always had a very robust management planning and development program across the organization. And we are pretty proud of the results that we have seen with that.","So we have results in a very deep and talented bench. And as you heard in my prepared remarks, these changes really reflect the priorities that we have today, and the excitement around these products and services coming to market, and the opportunity to get them into the hands of more and more people as quick as we possibly can. So we are very pleased with where we are at today and excited about what is in front of us.","Lance Wilkes","Great. I appreciate it. And if you could maybe just on a smaller point, talk a little bit about the fourth quarter commercial medical cost, your experience relative to your projections, and if there is anything else for with from a medical cost standpoint, maybe among the businesses that impacted fourth quarter positively or negatively.","Eva Boratto","Yes. Lance, this is Eva. As we look at our fourth quarter medical cost trend, it was in line with our guidance. I would say it was at the lower end of our guidance range of 6%, plus or minus 50 basis points. As you look at 2019, the year played out largely as we expected and there is really no changes to call out.","Karen Lynch","Lance, the only thing I would add is we heard -- we saw an earlier flu season in December, as you likely know. We have seen it happen in December, coming down in January, but nothing out of the ordinary. It is the influenza B, the incidences are a little bit higher in outpatient. But we aren\u2019t seeing the severity that we have seen in past years relative to the flu season, and we feel like we have adequately covered it in our reserves.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe of Citi. Your line is open.","Ralph Giacobbe","Thanks, good morning. Can you just give us a little bit better idea on the enrollment trends by end market in the Health Benefits segment? And specifically the commercial market, and the split between ASO and commercial as we think about 2020?","Eva Boratto","Relative to the commercial business, as you know we continue to offer choice to our commercial business. We have seen a transition from risk to ASO particularly in the lower end of the small segment. We have been offering a self-insured product at the smaller end of the segment to combat what we have seen relative to those changes.","Relative to ASC business and our national accounts business, as we came into the year, I mean we are kind of flat to down in January. But we are well aware of some national accounts that we will see coming to us in the latter half of the year. So we expect to increase that number in the latter half of the year. And then in small group, we continue to be pressured in that business and we are contracting in that business.","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay. So is it fair to say commercial business down year-over-year in 2020? And then I guess we have talked a lot about sort of the selling season specifically, sort of on the pharmacy side. Just as we think about sort of the medical selling season if you will, as we move through the year with sort of the integrated pitch, is it more selective to sort of match with the HealthHUB roll-out that is going to be more expensive going into 2022? Or is this something that we should see resonating and start to see commercial growth in 2021, given sort of the integration of the Aetna and the CVS pieces? Thanks.","Eva Boratto","Yes. Given the integration of the pieces, we should expect to see better commercial growth in 2021.","Larry Merlo","Yes. And Ralph, keep in mind that it is our plan for the hubs will be between 600 and 650 by year-end. So we do need to build those critical masses. It is not going to surprise you that as we prioritize markets, we have worked to match concentration of Aetna members for these first phases. So, Chris, we have got time for two more questions.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Your next question comes from Charles Rhyee of Cowen. Your line is open.","Charles Rhyee","Yes, hey, thanks for taking the question. Larry, maybe just going back, as you are talking about the HealthHUB there, you know when you look at these new HealthHUBs formats, I think along with adding all the health services aspects of it, there has also been sort of a remodeling of how you are looking at remodeling the front end and how you are kind of shelving the products in maybe a more intuitive way there. Do you see that being extended out just beyond the HealthHUBs? And can that be applied across all your stores? And I ask that because when we think back historically when retailers have gone into a phase of trying to refresh stores, that is kind of come with a uplift in same-store sales. And is that something that you have seen so far in the HealthHUBs against the control group? And is that something we could expect as you kind of go forward, and as we think beyond just the 1,500 HealthHUBs?","Jonathan Roberts","Yes, Charles, this is Jon. So remember, in the HealthHUBs, we are taking probably 20% of the sales floor and converting it to the hub services. And at the same time, we are shrinking the general merchandise and adding a lot of health and wellness items.","And when we look at our 2019 HealthHub stores, we are actually seeing positive growth in the front store sales and margin because health and wellness are actually carrying higher margin. And we are taking components of what we are learning in the HealthHUBs and we are deploying those products and categories across our fleet.","So yes, there is an opportunity to expand that to all stores, and we have different formats depending upon volumes and geographies that stores are in. And also recall over the last several years, we have remodeled just about the majority of our fleet. So we are feeling really good about the shape that these stores are in and our ability to continue to grow.","Charles Rhyee","Thanks. And a follow-up then maybe partly related when we are looking at the synergy guidance, it looks like in 2019, you outperformed that fairly nicely about $100 million or so. When you look at the 2020 guidance, you kind of bumped it up a little bit, taking up the range $800 million, $900 million from, call it roughly $800 million. Anything to think in that, is that more of a pacing and timing of like how quickly you can realize synergies, or is there an opportunity that we can again exceed probably better given where our end target out in 2021 is? Thanks.","Larry Merlo","Yes, Charles, it really reflects on the quality of the integration work in terms of the fact that it was done extremely well and we were able to accomplish many of those activities ahead of schedule. So it is really a great job by the team.","Operator","Your final question comes from Steven Valiquette of Barclays. Your line is open.","Steve Valiquette","Great, thanks. Good morning, everyone. You touched on this topic a little bit, but just a question around the commercial medical cost trend for 2020 in particular. We have seen some other managed care companies talk about lower trends in 2020 due to better pharmacy integration. So with your 6% expected commercial trend for 2020, you mentioned on Page 23 in the slide deck, I\u2019m curious, are there any elevated cost areas maybe either in inpatient or outpatient that might be offsetting some pharmacy savings? Maybe more importantly, is there any bias for the 6% trend to improve over time as you get further along in the overall CVS, Aetna merger integration? Thanks.","Eva Boratto","Relative to our trend - we don\u2019t know what our competitors include in some of their trend expectations, but we obviously factor in a variety of things like the economy, provider consolidation, use of technology, continued emergence of specialty drugs, but there is nothing included in our trend that is out of the ordinary.","We factored in what we typically factored in, accounting for where we think savings will occur as well. And we are quite confident in how we are projecting our trend at 6% plus or minus 50 basis points.","Steve Valiquette","From the merger overall though, shouldn\u2019t this trend come down over time? Should commercial cost trend be a beneficiary of the overall merger?","Eva Boratto","Yes. So Steve, we haven\u2019t provided longer-term trend projections. Right. But as you saw back at Investor Day, right, we are driving toward meaningful medical cost savings through the integration and we will have more to say about that as time progresses.","Larry Merlo","So with that, let me just thank everybody for their time because just summarizing quickly here, I hope you agree with us that today\u2019s results really reflect the importance of our strategy in making healthcare more simple, local and affordable.","And we are really pleased with the progress that we have made in executing our plan, and a lot of the credit for that goes to our nearly 300,000 colleagues for all their hard work and commitment to our purpose. And all of us here are confident in our ability to meet the needs of the diverse markets that we serve, while continuing to accelerate growth. So with that, I\u2019m sure we will talk to many of you soon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating.

And welcome to the CVS Health Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Thursday, February 8, 2018.","And now it's my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mike McGuire, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Mike McGuire","Thank you, Malian. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I'm here this morning with Larry Merlo, President and CEO, and Dave Denton, Executive Vice President and CFO, and Jon Roberts, Chief Operating Officer. Larry and Dave have some prepared remarks to share. After which, we'll open it up for the question-and-answer session.","During the Q&A, please keep in mind that the focus of this call is on our earnings report and guidance and we won't be sharing incremental information related to our pending acquisition of Aetna.","Also, in order to provide more people with a chance to ask their questions, please limit yourself to no more than one question with a quick follow-up. In addition to this call and our press release, we have posted a slide presentation on our website that summarizes the information in our prepared remarks, as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance. Our Form 10-K will be filed later this month, and that, too, will be available on our website once filed.","Please note that today's call is neither an offering of securities nor solicitation of a proxy vote in connection with our announced transaction with Aetna. The information discussed today is qualified in its entirety by the registration statement and joint proxy statement that CVS Health and Aetna has filed with the SEC in connection with our proposed transaction. The shareholders of CVS Health and Aetna are urged to read those filings carefully because they contain important information about the proposed transaction between CVS and Aetna.","Additionally, during this call, we will make certain forward-looking statements that reflect our current views related to our future financial performance, future events, and industry and market conditions and forward-looking statements related to the acquisition, including the expected consumer benefits, financial projections, synergy, financing and the timing for the completion of the transaction.","These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what may be indicated in the forward-looking statements.","We strongly encourage you to review the information in the reports we file with the SEC regarding these specific risks and uncertainties, in particular those that are described in the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and the cautionary statement disclosures and quarterly report on Form 10-Q. You should also review the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in our earnings press release.","During this call, we will use non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company's performance. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find a discussion of these non-GAAP measures and the comparable GAAP measures and the associated reconciliation document we posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website. And as always, today's call is being webcast on our website, and it will be archived there following the call for one year.","Now, I'll turn this over to Larry Merlo.","Larry Merlo","Okay. Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today.","We finished 2017 with strong results and the progress we've made against our 4-point plan provides a solid foundation for healthy growth as we begin 2018. In the fourth quarter, consolidated net revenues grew 5.3%, adjusted operating profit grew 5.7% and adjusted earnings per share grew 12% to $1.92.","For the full year, consolidated net revenues increased 4.1%, with adjusted operating profit declining 5.8% and adjusted earnings per share increasing 1% to $5.90. Now in the quarter, operating profit in the Retail\/Long-Term Care segment was better-than-expected, while operating profit in the PBM segment was in line with the expectations that we laid out on our January call. Additionally, we generated approximately $6.4 billion of free cash during the year.","Now turning to the business update, and I'll start with the PBM and the 2018 selling season. Our gross-to-net client wins are slightly higher than on our third quarter call, and we currently have gross wins of approximately $6.2 billion, and net new business of $2.4 billion with a client retention rate of about 96.5%. Now keep in mind that these new business numbers exclude enrollment results from our SilverScript PDP, and I'll touch on that shortly.","In addition, I'm pleased to say that during this year's welcome season, we continued our record of exceptional implementation. Client satisfaction continues to improve across all areas, with service levels reaching record performance.","Beyond our core service elements, our support capabilities are aligned with the unique approaches of all of our customers across their pharmacy benefit, member and provider strategies. And we believe the investments we've made in quality, automation and client focus, are delivering measurable value to our clients year-after-year.","Looking ahead, we have about $39 billion up for renewal in 2019, which when you exclude Med D, is nearly a third of our business. Now keep in mind that this figure includes the FEP retail and mail contracts, which we have already extended through the end of 2019.","And while it's early in the selling season, we are making progress with our '19 renewals and have already renewed a high percentage of our health plan clients. As for new business prospects, again, it's early to gauge the full extent of our fee activities in the '19 selling season, but we don't see as much health plan opportunity as we've seen in past years.","Our strong service history, our size, our scale and our unique suite of capabilities, provide the tools we need to be successful in retaining business and winning in the marketplace as opportunities arise.","Now top of mind for clients are planned designs that effectively lower unit costs and overall health care costs, and that's pretty consistent with what we've seen in recent years.","The most common designs to lower unit costs include plans with formularies that are focused on the highest value drugs and clinical programs such as our Transform Diabetes Care and Pharmacy Advisor programs are focused on lowering health care costs and are increasingly becoming a central part of our clients' benefit and health management strategies.","In addition, specialty drug management continues to be highly emphasized in planned design elections and is expected to continue to be a focal point for the foreseeable future.","Now growth in specialty pharmacy remained strong and our specialty business continues to expand and gain share. Now while specialty revenues grew 9.2% in the quarter, prescription increased by 14.5%, benefiting from new product introductions and increased access to limited distribution products.","Our Medicare Part D business, SilverScript, wrapped up another a successful annual enrollment period, and we began the 2018 plan year with more than 6. 1 million captive PDP lives, which includes Eclipse [ph] and that's up about 11% from January of last year. Now when you add the non-captive Med D lives that we manage for our health plan clients, the total rises to 13. 3 million Med D lives under management.","Now moving onto Q4 results in our Retail\/Long-Term Care segment. Total same-store sales increased 0.1%, and that's more than 100 basis points better than expectations with pharmacy same-store sales up 0.4%.","Our pharmacy sales comps were negatively impacted by approximately 340 basis points due to recent generic introductions. Our same-store prescription volumes increased 2.5% on a 30-day equivalent basis, roughly 50 basis points ahead of expectations. And as you're well aware, the flu season strengthened beginning in December, and we've continued to experience a strong flu season during the first several weeks of 2018.","In the quarter, the negative impact from the decisions to restrict CVS Pharmacy from participating in the TRICARE and fully insured prime networks had about a 320 basis point negative impact on volumes. Now this is 100 basis points better than the impact on Q3 and a result of having comp the start of the TRICARE restriction at the beginning of December.","Now despite this headwind, CVS Pharmacy gained market share in Q4, increasing our share of 30-day equivalent scripts dispensed by about 15 basis points. Now when you adjust for the network changes, same-store prescription volumes would have been up 5.7% in the fourth quarter, again, on a 30-day equivalent basis.","Now turning to 2018. We'll return to healthy script growth, driven in part by our exciting new collaborations with Optum, Cigna and Express Scripts. Now as a part of growing trend toward consumer-directed care, our collaborations will help our patients get the most from their health plans, while improving their health.","Additionally, we believe that by being preferred in more Med D networks, including SilverScript, Aetna and WellCare, we'll be able to further drive prescription volumes in the growing Med D market.","Now turning to the front store, comps decreased 0.7% and a strong cough and cold season added about 80 basis points for the comp. After adjusting for this tailwind, the Q4 comp sequentially improved from prior quarters and has been the case all year, the decline in front store comps reflects a number of factors, including our decision to optimize our promotional strategies in certain ways such as by reducing our circular page count.","Overall, our reduction in circular promotion in 2017 was a success, supported by the refinement of our industry-leading promotional analytics and processes. And moving into 2018, we expect to leverage these refined capabilities to drive both top and bottom-line growth.","Our Store Brands represented 23.7% of front-store sales in the quarter, that's relatively flat to last year, and it remains an area of focus. There are a significant opportunities to expand our share of Store Brands by launching new products that build upon our core equities in health and beauty, while seeking opportunistic growth in other areas, where we can provide customers a good value. And as a result of our strengthened Store Brands, along with the success of our promotional strategies, front store gross margin, once again, improved in the quarter versus a year ago.","So with that, let me flip it over to Dave for the financial review.","Dave Denton","Thank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll provide a detailed review of our 2017 fourth quarter results and briefly touch on our 2018 guidance with a few updates from our call in January.","First as I typically do, I'll begin with a review of last year's capital allocation program. For the full year of 2017, we generated $6.4 billion in free cash, delivering all of this cash back to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases despite the suspension of share buybacks during Q4.","We paid $510 million in dividends in the fourth quarter and $2 billion during the full year of '17. Our dividend payout ratio currently stands at 30.9% over the trailing fourth quarters, retreating slightly due to the non-cash tax reform benefit we captured in net income during the fourth quarter.","Now going forward, as we previously announced and due to the Aetna transaction, we are keeping dividends flat until we get back to a leverage ratio that is more in line with our credit ratings category.","During the fourth quarter, we did not repurchase any shares. However, for all of 2017, we repurchased approximately 55 million shares for approximately $4.4 billion, averaging $78.68 per share. We ended this year with $13.9 billion left in authorization to repurchase our shares. And as with dividend increases, the share repurchases are suspended until our leverage ratio comes back in line.","As expected, we saw an outflow of $642 million of free cash in the fourth quarter. This is largely driven by the settlement of the CMS payable associated with the 2016 plan year. For the full year of '17, we saw improvement in our cash cycle of more than 4 days. For the full year, our gross capital expenditure was approximately $1.9 billion, about $306 million lower in LY.","This was primarily driven due to higher spending in '16 on the integration of both Omnicare and the Target acquisitions. With $265 million in proceeds from sale leasebacks, our net CapEx for the year was approximately $1.7 billion.","So now turning to the income statement. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.92 per share in the fourth quarter, at the high end of our guidance range. Our effective tax rate was lowered than forecasted as there were several open items at year-end that resolved in our favor. None of them are individually significant and where appropriate, these items are factored into our outlook for 2018.","As a reminder, these EPS results are on a comparable basis and the reconciliation of the GAAP to adjusted EPS can be found in the press release, as well as in the Investor Relations portion of our website.","On an adjusted basis, the PBM segment delivered operating profit in line with our guidance from January, while the Retail\/Long-Term Care segment profit came in slightly above the high end of guidance as we outperformed on script growth.","GAAP diluted EPS was $3.22 per share in the fourth quarter, which is much better than our guidance. The outperformance was due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December, which reduced the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and resulted in a reduction in our net deferred income tax liabilities.","So with that, let me quickly walk down the P&L to provide some additional details. On a consolidated basis, revenues in fourth quarter increased 5.3% to $48. 4 billion. In the PBM segment, revenues increased 9.3% to $34.2 billion. PBM growth in the quarter was 150 basis points, above the high end of our guidance. The year-over-year growth was driven largely by an increase in pharmacy network and specialty pharmacy volumes, brand inflation and Medicare Part D revenues.","Partially offsetting this growth was an approximate 80 basis points increase in our generic dispensing rates versus the same quarter of last year to 86.9%. PBM adjusted claims grew by 7.8% in the quarter, and we finished the year with 1.78 billion adjusted claims.","In our Retail\/Long-Term Care business, revenues increased 0.3% in the quarter to $20.9 billion, again, beating our expectation. This was driven primarily by stronger-than-expected pharmacy same-store sales and script growth, as well as better-than-expected volumes in the front store.","The front store volume outperformance was due to a strong cough and cold season, as Larry mentioned. Offsetting the Retail\/Long-Term Care segment, revenue growth was higher generic dispensing rate, which increased approximately 160 basis points to 86.8%.","Turning to gross margin, operating expenses, operating profit and the tax rate. The numbers I'm citing reflects non-GAAP adjustments in both the current and prior periods where applicable, which has been reconciled on our website. Keep in mind that our guidance for the fourth quarter also reflected these adjustments.","The consolidated company gross margin was 16.3% in the quarter, a contraction of approximately 30 basis points compared to Q4 '16 and consistent with our expectations. The decline is due to a mixed shift in our business as our lower-margin PBM business continue to grow faster than our Retail\/Long-Term Care business.","Gross profit dollars increased 3.5% versus the same quarter of LY. Within the PBM segment, gross margin increased approximately 15 basis points from Q4 '16 to 5.4%. Gross profit dollars were up 11.9%, primarily due to the shift in timing of Medicare Part D profits from the third quarter into the fourth quarter versus '16, increased networking specialty volume and favorable purchasing economics. Partially offsetting these drivers was the impact of continued price compression in the marketplace.","Gross margin in the Retail\/Long-Term Care segment was up - was 30.0%, up approximately 25 basis points from LY. The increase in gross margin rate was primarily driven by favorability in front store margin and increased generic dispensing, partially offset by continued reimbursement pressures. The favorability in front store margin was driven by our continued optimization of our promotional strategies.","Gross profit dollars increased by 1.1% year-over-year mainly due to strong front store margin and script growth, partially offset by the loss of scripts from the network changes that occurred at the end of 2016.","Consolidated operating expenses as a percent of revenues improved approximately 30 basis points to 9.7% compared to Q4 '16. The PBM segment SG&A rate as a percent of sales was relatively flat year-over-year and in line with our expectations, while Retail\/ Long-Term Care segment SG&A as a percent of sales increased slightly due to less leverage from revenue growth.","Within the Corporate segment, expenses were $236 million, consistent with last year. We saw consolidated operating profit increased by 5. 7% for the fourth quarter, in line with our expectations. Operating margin for the total enterprise was flat to last year at 6.6%. Operating margin in the PBM increased approximately 15 basis points to 4.3%, while operating margin in the Retail\/Long-Term Care segment declined approximately 10 basis points to 10.3% on an adjusted basis.","We saw operating profits grow by 13.5% in the PBM segment, while we saw operating profit decline by 0.3% in the Retail\/Long-Term Care segment. Going below the line on the consolidated income statement. Net interest expense in the quarter decreased $1.5 million from LY to $241 million. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 38.3% and 38.1% for the full year, which is a bit better than we expected. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was just over 1 billion shares, again, in line with our expectations.","So with that, turning to our 2018 guidance. Let me first provide a couple reminders. Keep in mind that for guidance purposes only, we are assuming that the proposed Aetna transaction closes after the end of 2018. Also, all bridge financing fees, transaction and integration costs related to the deal are excluded from our adjusted figures.","Now in January, we provide an outlook for the year, and remain comfortable that the estimates on these various elements that we provided. However, at that time, we do not factor any investment of the tax reform benefit into the operating profit guidance.","Today, I'm updating our guidance only to reflect our plans for the investment of these benefits in 2018 and beyond. We currently estimate for the 2018 reduction in tax to yield $1.2 billion in cash benefits. As a result, we have a degree of financial flexibility that is unexpected and allows us to make some incremental high-value investments back into our business. And consistent with comments in January, we anticipate spending at least half the tax benefit on debt reduction in 2018.","This supports our goal to return to a leverage ratio of 3.5 times within 2 years after the closing of the Aetna transaction and ultimately, to the low 3 times level longer term. In addition to debt reduction, there are 3 areas, in particular, which we will invest.","First and foremost, we plan on making investments in our colleagues through increases in wages and benefits. We also plan on expanding our existing capabilities around data analytics and care management solutions. These investments in data analytics will improve our predictive power and further transform our processes with the goal of accelerating our abilities to improve outcomes and lower cost for our patients and the payers that we serve.","And finally, we will make investment in our stores to pilot an enhanced service offerings, again, with the objective of lowering overall health care costs and improving the health of all the members that we serve. A portion of the spending in the stores and on these initiatives will be capitalized in the balance sheet and will not flow through operating expenses by the way.","Given this plan, in 2018, we expect to invest at least $275 million in operating expenses in these new initiatives, predominantly in the Retail\/Long-Term Care segment. When annualized, this is a run rate of at least $425 million of operating expenses.","The lower tax rate is a recurring benefit to the business and investments we are making will also be recurring. So with $275 million of additional operating expenses, we now expect full year 2018 adjusted operating profit growth of down 1.5% to up 1.5%, with consolidated net revenue growth of 0.7% to 2.5%.","For the segments, we expect adjusted operating profit growth in the PBM segment in the low to mid-single digits and in the Retail\/Long-Term Care segment, we expect operating profit to be in the low - to be down in the low single digits.","For the Retail segment, we continue to expect strong pharmacy same-store script growth of 6% to 7% as we benefit from broader relationships established in 2017 and our expanded participation as a preferred pharmacy in more Medicare Part D networks.","We also continue to expect same-store sales growth at 2% to 3.5%, and revenue growth for the segment of 2.5% to 4%. The sale of RxCrossroads, that business creates a headwind of about 50 basis points on the retail segment's operating profit growth due to the absence of this business in 2018.","For the PBM segment, we continue to expect between 1.91 billion and 1.93 billion adjusted claims, and revenues to grow between 1.5% and 3.5% in 2018. Within operating profits, benefits from the company's enterprise streamlining efforts will be offset by Anthem's implementation costs of approximately $150 million as we get ready to administer that contract beginning in 2020. The Anthem spend, which is a mix of both of capital and operating expenses, the Anthem's PBM operating profit growth by about 190 basis points.","Going below the line, our interest expense is still expected to be in the range of $2 billion to $2.3 billion. That expectation includes net interest expense on an existing portfolio of roughly $1 billion, as well as bridge financing fees of $170 million to $205 million, $45 million below our prior estimates as a portion of those fees were booked in Q4 '17. The remainder is interest from new debt. Our effective tax rate is to be approximately 27% for 2018, consistent with what we said in January.","So now, moving on to our Q1 '18 expectations. On the call in January, we see that Q1 was expected to be our lowest level of the year for enterprise operating profit growth, and that we expected operating profit in the Retail\/ Long-Term Care segment to contract.","With one month of the year behind us, we are expecting better result in Q1 due largely to the script utilization at retail. The exceptionally strong flu season across the country has had a major factor in this improved outlook. Given the strong performance, we now expect consolidated revenue growth of 1.5% to 3.25%, with consolidated adjusted operating profit growth of 0.5% to 4.5%.","Within the Retail\/Long-Term Care segment, we expect revenue growth in the range of 4% to 5.5% and operating profit growth in the low to mid-single digits. Total same-store sales at retail are expected to be up 4% to 5.5% and adjusted script comps are expected to increase by 7% to 8.5%.","Within the PBM segment, we expect revenue growth of 2% to 3.75% and operating profit growth to be flattish to up slightly. Finally, while we expect our net interest expense for the quarter to be in line with levels that we've seen recently on our existing portfolio of debt, keep in mind that if we end up leasing the Aetna debt during the first quarter, our interest will be above our guidance expectations. Also, our tax rate for the quarter is expected to be slightly lower than the rate we expect for the full year.","So in closing, we laid the foundation to return to healthy growth in 2017. We executed on our 4-point plan that we laid out back in 2016 and the solid expectations for 2018 reflect the work that has been accomplished. We remain committed to returning to healthy earnings growth long-term and continue to invest in our business to better position us to take full advantage of the opportunities that lie ahead in the health care space.","And so with that, I'll now turn it back over to Larry.","Larry Merlo","Okay. Thanks, Dave. Before we open up for Q&A, just a few additional comments. As you may have seen last week, we received a second request from the DOJ for an additional information related to the Aetna transaction. And the timetable that we laid out in our initial press release back in December, as well as in our S-4 filing reflected this expectation. So things were moving along as planned, and we continue to expect the transaction will close in the second half of the 2018.","In addition, the integration planning has begun, and we have assembled a team with representatives from both companies and are very pleased with how the planning process is progressing.","So just wrapping up. As we move forward in '18, I do want to take a moment to thank our more than 240,000 colleagues who have worked tirelessly to move the enterprise forward and position us for our next era of growth. We've emerged from '17, a stronger company, well positioned to meet the health care challenges of tomorrow and to take advantage of the emerging opportunities in this growing and vibrant market. And we're excited to continue on our path of driving more affordable, accessible and effective care for all health care stakeholders in 2018 and beyond.","So with that, let's go ahead and open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Lisa Gill","Thanks very much. My first question is really around the investments that you're making, Dave or Larry, can you talk about what component of that is wage and benefit when I think about it - that is being permanent versus the data analytics or store pilot, et cetera, where eventually I would expect that we'll see some level of return from investors?","Larry Merlo","Yes, Lisa, it's Larry. Lisa, I just - if we get into that, I just want to emphasize that what we're looking to do is accelerate the work that's important you know, in this CVS-Aetna [ph] combination. If you think about the role of technology and analytics and digital tools and capabilities, and as far as investments in our employees, service and capabilities, especially at retail will continue to grow an importance.","And specifically, these investments will allow us to enhance the role that pharmacy technicians play, which, we believe is key to enhancing the role that pharmacy can play in overall patient care.","As far as the level of investments in terms of what Dave was talking about, I would say that a lion share of that is investments into and with our employees, okay, versus in the other areas. But they're both equally important as we go forward.","Lisa Gill","Okay, great. And then just my follow-up would just be on the 2019 selling season. So you talked about the $39 billion. When we think about FEP and the renewal, Larry, am I thinking about this right that, that's roughly $6 million to $7 billion?","And then can you just give us any indication? You said health plan business, which is usually renewed now, you don't have a lot of renewal. Can you just give us an indication as to how much of that $39 billion has already been renewed?","Larry Merlo","Yes, Lisa, in terms of the FEP, your range is pretty much in the ballpark there. And as we talk about the health plans business, keep in mind that the selling cycle is usually a bit longer than on the employer side. So that in many respects, that's hard - late last or in the fall timeframe last year.","So as you know, as we go through the year, we typically begin to quantify the selling season, as well as the renewals. So recognizing the cycles associated with the health plans, we have a better picture of what that looks like. And as we mentioned, a large percentage of our health plan clients have been renewed, okay, there are still work to be done there.","And we acknowledge that as we look at RSP opportunities, at least on the health care side, health plan side, most of that is behind us at this point, which we're acknowledging that the opportunities there are not as great as we've seen the last couple of years.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of George Hill with RBC. Please go ahead.","George Hill","Good morning, guys. And thanks for taking the question. I'm going to commit a foul here and look at a little bit beyond 2018. But I guess, Larry, Dave, as you guys think about the combination of the businesses going forward, do you expect another large step up in the investment rate. I think a lot of us are trying to figure out what the pro forma 2019\/ '20 numbers look like, and I think whether or not we have the discretionary expense run rate, right, is a big part of the math. I guess, any color that you can provide around that is helpful?","Dave Denton","Hey, George. It's Dave here. I think as we've talk a little bit about the combination, obviously, we're going to make investments in the combination going forward to enhance our care model and data and analytics. Keep in mind that as we discussed, as we build out in our stores new capabilities, we have a fairly robust capital plan for the next several years that's going to touch the majority of our stores.","We'll likely repurpose some of the investments that we had earmarked to that into I'll say changing the scope of design in those stores. So the incremental CapEx required to deliver on those promises is not that large. So we think that we can manage within the performance that we put out there over the next several years.","George Hill","Okay\u2026","Larry Merlo","George, to Dave's point, keep in mind that our historic run rate on gross capital has been in the $2 billion, $2.2 billion range. So to Dave's point and a lot of that was investments on the retail side of the business. So there is a real opportunity to repurpose much of that capital as we build out these new capabilities.","George Hill","Okay. And then maybe a quick follow-up. Interested in the investments in data analytics and care management solutions. Should we think of those investments as specific to pharmacy? Or are they broader with respect to, I would call it, like care management solutions, data analytics for health care? So are these kind of investments in the core or are these investments thinking about 2020 and beyond?","Larry Merlo","No George, you should think about these as being broader. We've made many investments on the pharmacy component to date, which we believe has paid us dividends and really, serve as a gateway in terms of how we're thinking about these broader capabilities as you think about the 2 companies coming together.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee, Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Charles Rhyee","Yes. Thanks for taking the questions. Dave, and Larry, may be following a little bit on that - on George's question. Can you speak more to where you are with MinuteClinics. You had a rollout schedule that you guys talked about a little while back. And I know a couple of years ago, at the Analyst Day, you had talked about sort of where you're tracking in terms of revenues as well.","Now, obviously, in the future, this looks like to be a key part of what a combined entity could be delivering. Can you tell us where you were in terms of MinuteClinic today? How that rollout schedule changes at all with the pending acquisition? And maybe any kind of metrics you can give around that? Thanks.","Larry Merlo","Yes, Charles. It's Larry, I'll start and I think others will jump in. It's a great question, Charles. And certainly, this combination, it enables 2 things. One, a broader expansion of the MinuteClinic footprint. Today, we've got just over 100 clinics across 33 states in the District of Columbia. But equally important is we see an opportunity to expand the breadth and the scope of practice that exists in MinuteClinic.","And so there's a number of things that we're thinking about, whether it's broader management of chronic diseases is one example or even the ability to do lab draws, blood draws in the clinics. So we'll have more to say on that as we get these pilots up and running.","Charles Rhyee","Great. If I can follow-up, you talked about the integration cost related to Anthem. Can you give us a sense as we roll into 2019, will those integration costs continue? And would they be more or less than we are looking at here in '18? Thanks.","Dave Denton","Yes. This is Dave. Obviously, we'll have some integration costs in '18, likely some in '19 to get that business online, just given the share of scope and scale of that. But I expect more in '18 because we want to be up and running in parallel sometime in '19.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Nathan Rich","This is Nathan Rich on for Bob this morning. Dave, just a question on same-store script guidance for 1Q, you know, looks strong relative to the 7% to 8.5% relative to full year range of 6% to 7%. I know you talked about the full impact being a benefit in Q1. Just wondering if you can maybe help us think about the magnitude there?","And then also, can you give us a sense of how the performance in the new preferred Part D networks like SilverScript and Aetna that you're in for this year, how that's compared so far relative to your expectations?","Dave Denton","Yes, Nathan, I guess, it's probably a little too early to answer the performance of those networks at this point in time, just given the - we've just kind of started the year off. Clearly, Q1 as we think about the script, I guess, the growth in script utilization that we cycle into Q1 here being a little bit higher than for the full year.","Clearly, the flu season, the impact of that is fairly significant as we look across the country and more or less all of each of the country at this point in time. So that will affect Q1 into the positive. Clearly, as we get into the Q2, likely we'll get back into, I'll say, in the normal zip code.","As we - maybe the earlier comment I will make, as we thought about Medicare Part D and being a preferred provider in Medicare Part D, the scripts and in some cases, don't just transition right away, we will see script capture build throughout the year as those members chose to move into our network, in those preferred network points.","Nathan Rich","Okay, that's helpful. And then just maybe just a follow-up. Dave, can you help us think about like how you're thinking about gross margin for the Retail segment in '18? I didn't see - I think you, guys, typically give sort of qualitative guidance at least.","I'd just be curious this year, given potential to have some pressure from the lower-margin scripts in some of those preferred Part D networks, how we should think about the gross margin trend for the year?","Dave Denton","Yes, you're right. We have not given specific color around that. I would say that this year, more so than other years is a transition year or step year as we go through planning for the acquisition for next year. Clearly, I think what's important to us is we have a very robust plan to get back to growth in this business, which we delivered upon, clearly meets some now - some investments with the tax benefit back into the business to support our growth longer term.","But I think what's important here is we position the company in preferred networks and in teaming up with other payers and building capabilities and programs to drive long-term growth in the business segment.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Eric Percher from Nephron Resources. Please go ahead.","Eric Percher","Thank you. So a question with Helena moving on, I'm interested in how your view of retail has changed, of course, now, we include long-term care, and it sounds like there will be a lot more that this done in the store over time. How are you conceptualizing what you need in the leadership of retail?","Larry Merlo","Well, Eric, it's Larry. And listen, I think as you're aware, these things happen, and we certainly wish Helena continued success in her new role. And I'll just acknowledge that we're going to - we're an attractive company for people to come and work at, and we'll check the external landscape, but at the same time we've got a deep bench of very talented individuals.","And Kevin Hourican', who has had a number of senior level jobs in the retail business, in the supply chain, in field operations. Most recently, he leads of our Retail Pharmacy Services Group. He will take over the business reporting to Jon, and we're all confident that we're not going to miss a beat.","So, you know, as you've heard us talk in the past, the retail environment is evolving, okay? And we've talked about the front of store being a combination of products and services, the products with a focus on OTC, beauty, personal-care and some elements of convenience. And you've seen what we've been doing with services, whether it's MinuteClinic or the pilots that we've done, and we're beginning a broader rollout of audiology and optical.","And we've talked this morning about some additional opportunities that we're excited to pilot as you think about broader care management, especially with the combination. So I do think that we're making health care a retail option, recognizing that health care is becoming local, okay.","And we're looking to deliver health care to where people are, okay, whether it's in their local community or in many cases perhaps even in their homes. So again, we're excited about the opportunities and again, we've talked about where we're headed in terms of the leadership of the Retail business.","Eric Percher","So my thought on that was that you're acting as a provider, as much as a traditional retailer, maybe to pivot that to a follow-up. With Amazon I think that many of us were looking to see if there was an answer that would come out of Amazon as to the issues that impact health care.","With this new creation, it appears to be a partnership in search of potential answers itself. What would your message be as a player, a provider to what you expect you can do and how you might partner?","Larry Merlo","Well, Eric, it's a great question and we all saw the announcement last week. And you know, listen, we absolutely agree with the goals and objectives that were outlined in that press release. And I think it's important to acknowledge that the press release had few details and the press release acknowledge that there is a plan.","So what that group aspires to is what we're going to deliver as part of the CVS-Aetna combination. And you think about the fact that we have the infrastructure, we have the assets, we certainly have the health care expertise, resident in both companies. And we've demonstrated that we can execute on goals and objectives.","So we're chopping [ph] as a bit to get started. We've talked about the fact that we want this new CVS-Aetna combination to be an open source model that as we build out these capabilities, we can make them broadly available in the market. So we're looking forward to partnering with all groups of individuals, including this new combination of Berkshire, JPMorgan and Amazon.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ricky Goldwasser","Yes. Good morning. So Larry, in line with the opportunity to have kind of like CVS-Aetna combination is an open source program, what is the feedback that you've been getting from your existing customers about the combination? Are they kind of like open to that idea? Are they taking a wait-and-see approach?","Larry Merlo","Yes, Ricky. I'll start and Jon has spent a fair amount of time with our customers as well and he has some thoughts. And Ricky, look, I would say that there is tremendous amount of interest. There's a level of curiosity in terms of what can be created here.","And I think that in those conversations, certainly, with our health plan clients, we've talked about the reality of - the lines between being competitors and being partners are blurring like never before. And by the way, as you know and as we've talked many times, we have examples of that in our own business today when you think about Medicare Part D and the fact that we manage the Part D component for more than 40 health plans.","And we've demonstrated, not just the high level of service as more than 80% of those members are in 4 or 5star performing plans. But those clients have seen that their business as a result of our support is growing faster than the overall PDP marketplace.","So listen, I think, obviously, they want to know more, okay. And the lines of communication will be critically important as we move forward, and keep them updated as to our progress and the opportunities that, that creates for us to partner broadly with them.","Jon Roberts","And Ricky, this is Jon. Just to build on what Larry has said. So we, obviously, have a larger book of employer clients, so clearly, no issue there. And in fact, we share some common clients that could create opportunities.","We do have health plan clients that may compete with Aetna, and I would describe the dialogue as constructive. We serve Aetna today as a PBM, and our goal will be to continue to serve not only Aetna but all of our health plan clients. And we have firewalls in place today that we talk about that allows our competition to occur today as we support health plans on the pharmacy benefit to compete with each other.","And as Larry said, as we build out new products and services, we're going to make them available to all of our health plan, so they're actually pretty excited about that. And we have proven with our SilverScript model that, again, competes with many of our health plans that are in the Medicare market that we can do both. We can compete and support them and with our expertise, they've been able to grow significantly better than the balance of the market.","Ricky Goldwasser","Okay. And then my follow-up is on specialty. Obviously, you highlighted on the press release that you're seeing accelerating contribution. Are there specific products that you can highlight for us? And also, when you think about specialty within your existing members, what percent of your member's dispensed specialty in-house and what's the opportunity there? And how does that compare to the Aetna members?","Larry Merlo","Well, I'll speak, Ricky, maybe broadly about what categories therapeutic classes we're seeing growing in specialty. So autoimmune and oncology continue to grow and outpaced the balance of the specialty market. And we actually are seeing multiple sclerosis kind of flat, and we also saw hep C volume come down pretty substantially in '17. So with the puts and takes that we're still seeing this business grow pretty dramatically.","We're filling about 60% of the specialty business that we manage in our specialty pharmacy. And for Aetna, we actually fill 100% of that volume in our specialty pharmacy. So obviously, the highest and fastest growing part of the pharmacy benefit, and we're pretty excited about our capabilities and the new capabilities that we continue to build out.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Kevin Caliendo of Needham and Company. Please go ahead.","Kevin Caliendo","Thanks for taking my call, guys. Just a couple of quick questions. On the investment spend, you mentioned that the run rate would be about $425 million. In terms of modeling that or thinking about that, should we be exiting the year at up over $100 million in spend, and that's how we should be thinking about it going into 2019?","Larry Merlo","Yes. Because as you can imagine, all of those investments don't happen right away and certainly, some of the payroll happened in Q2 and beyond, so it ramps up.","Kevin Caliendo","Okay, that's a great. Just a follow-up on the Amazon thing. Post the press release that came out, did you approach them in any way, shape or form? Did they approach you? Have there been any even just cursory conversation high, this is who we are and this is what we're doing kind of thing?","Larry Merlo","No, Kevin, we have not had any discussion since the press release came.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Priya Ohri-Gupta","Hey. Thank you so much for the question. Dave, I was wondering if you may be able to shed a little bit of light on some of the potential plans around your debt issuance. I think one of the question that we've been hearing consistently is sort of how are you thinking about where the debt issuance would take place in terms of sort of the HoldCo versus may be one of the subsidiaries.","And then just secondly, how do you think about the treatment of the debt at sort of subsidiary levels versus HoldCo levels and your view on making sure that, that is put through? Thank you.","Dave Denton","Yes, so those are all great questions. I would say a couple of things. I think one thing to keep in mind here, which I think is important. If we talked about the capital structure of the company a few months ago when the deal was announced, actually our cash flow yield for the company substantially improved with the advent of tax reform.","And we've actually now committed that we're going to take a subtle portion of that - now benefit from tax reform to improve our balance sheet over several years, to deliver more rapidly than what we originally anticipated. So we're committed to our capital structure, we're admitted to paying down our debt in a reasonable fashion here. And getting to about 3.5 times levered by the end of 2 years post the acquisition.","So I think that's an important foundation.","Clearly, we're looking at all possibilities of how to issue this debt over the next several months. I would say we're going to issue it that HoldCo company levels. We will evaluate exactly the tenure at which we will issue this debt over next several months and we continue to watch the market pretty actively to make sure that we place this debt in the best way for us from an economic standpoint to make sure that's prudent and then also structure in a way that does allow us to delever in the timeframe that we've committed to.","Priya Ohri-Gupta","Thank you.","Dave Denton","You bet.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","John Heinbockel","So Larry, in terms of investing in people, do you think labor hours in the stores go up as well? And if so, where will that go to? How much does that tie into your thoughts on increased services? And would that be outside of the MinuteClinic?","Larry Merlo","Yes, John. There's - you can think about a portion of that and some of that is over time, okay, and you're spot on in terms of as you think about those hours being signed to additional services or extended capabilities that would be created, whether it's through the pharmacy, through MinuteClinic or things that perhaps don't exist today.","John Heinbockel","And I mean, as a follow-up, it's clearly the right thing to do. When you invest in labor, is that something you can think about on an ROIC basis like you might make a capital investment? Or is it's hard to do, but you know there ought to be a benefit there?","Larry Merlo","You know, what, John, it's a great question. John, there are - think about it this way, okay. There are indicators that we contract in our business that we know if we're doing these things well, sales, profits will follow, okay.","So obviously we have those metrics that as we look forward, as we think about these investments, we will use those metrics to guide us in terms of being on target, okay, to ensure that the investments that we make provide a tangible return.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Glen Santangelo with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Glen Santangelo","Yes, thanks. And good morning. Hey, Larry, I just want to follow up on some of the comments you made with respect to the second request. You've had it for almost a week now, and I'm just kind of curious, I mean, as you've gone through, was there anything sort of out of the ordinary in there or unexpected or any opposition sort of worth calling out at this point? Anything that sort of make sure rethink the timing? Or does seeing the second request, and what's into that actually make you feel more comfortable about the timing?","Larry Merlo","You know, what, Glen, there is nothing that has surfaced. That has come as a surprise, and it's very much as I mentioned in my preferred remarks, things are moving forward as planned. And obviously, we've begun to have discussions with those individuals. And those discussions, there's a very good level of engagement and the discussions have been very constructive and positive. So we feel good in terms of how the process is moving along at this point.","Glen Santangelo","Okay. Maybe I'll just have one follow-up for Dave on the investment. I apologize because I think this has been asked a little bit. But you said the run rate was $425 million. And so are you basically and should we assume that most of those are in the people, those costs are going to be ongoing, we should be modeling an incremental $150 million in annual expenses in fiscal '19 on a go-forward basis. Is that the way to think about it?","Dave Denton","Yes, that is correct. Keep in mind, think about it this way. We're going to increase wages and those wage increases are not going to be affected until 4 1, or 5 1 or 6 1.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Brian Tanquilut","Hi. Dave, just to ask a question on that last comment you made. So as I think about wages, I mean, is this basically an across the board. Wonder is there any waiting as we think about store-level wage increases versus corporate and back office?","Dave Denton","Yes, this is - just look at - if you look at the mix of employees that we have across our enterprise, they're largely store based. So if you think about just waiting, this is largely a store wage increase.","Brian Tanquilut","Okay, got it. And then Larry, as I think about - my follow-up, as I think about the PBM business in the past, obviously, you're benefited from disruptions in the industry with market share gains. So with about third of your contracts summing up for renewal, how should we be thinking about your strategy and messaging for your clients the play defense against your large competitors trying to put clients away in the middle of the Aetna transaction?","Larry Merlo","Well, Brian, I don't - as you think about the things that we have talked about, okay, that there is as you think about Aetna, obviously, there's an important message that is delivered to our clients that, listen, we've got dedicated resources for your business and all of the things that go along with that, and it's our job and it's our commitment, and we are absolutely confident that there'll be no slippage in the level of service that we provide to our existing clients and prospective clients as we go forward.","So we've got the infrastructure to do that and the talent resides in the organization to do that. And I think that's an important message that we are delivering in addition to all the other things that we talked about, whether just as part of the normal ongoing business that are independent from Aetna or any other acquisition.","Jon Roberts","And Brian, this is Jon. Just as Larry said earlier, the majority of our health plans have already been renewed for the selling season. And then as I think about moving forward, payers have 2 priorities. One is optimizing unit cost. That it's a competitive market. That dynamic hasn't changed and will continue into the future.","But the second goal of payers is reducing overall health care cost. And we think that this acquisition will enable capabilities that will allow us to bring even more programs to the marketplace that meet the goal of payers whether they be employers or health plans.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Peter Costa, Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Peter Costa","Good morning, guys. Once again, in the state of union address, President Trump talked about rising drug prices as being an issue. And you've also seen state-level regulation in terms of Kentucky talking about carbon PBM services out of Medicaid contracts, both seemingly being shot at the pharmacy channel. And the drug companies continue to use a redirect towards the PBM.","So what are your lobbying efforts going to be over the course of the next year? And how are you measuring the success of those lobby efforts in terms of what you're seeing in Washington?","Larry Merlo","Yes, Peter, it's Larry. Obviously, this has been a dialogue. And as you pointed out, we expect it will continue to be a dialogue. And Peter, there's no one single answer to that question. But you will see a steady stream of activity from us, and we'll be coming out with our annual drug trend report shortly, okay. IT will talk about the year-over-year increase, okay, which will be well below the rate of inflation, okay, that you would see in the pharma marketplace, okay.","And how that increase ties to our clients spend, but equally important, okay, we will also be spending more time talking about what about the member okay, and what did the member incur, okay, in terms of their out-of-pocket cost associated with drug spend because I think that, that's the component that's getting lost in this PBM dialogue, okay.","That we're spending a lot of time talking about clients spend, we're going to spend more time talking about how their members are benefiting from the roll that PBM are performing in the marketplace. So I think that's one of the things that you will see a little different going forward.","Peter Costa","So as a follow-up with that, what would be the impact to you if all of your clients move to point-of-sale, rebates and discounts being taken?","Larry Merlo","Yes. Peter, we've talked about this in the past that we have a variety of flavors. We have clients today who have point-of-sale rebates or 100% of the rebate value was passed through and there's an administrative fee associated with that. So it would take some time to transition that, okay. But it would have little to no effect on overall PBM economics.","Operator","Your next question is from Mohan Naidu, Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Mohan Naidu","Thanks for taking my questions. Larry, one more on the technology investments. How should we think about this the mix between those investments that you're pulling forward to get ready and to integrate Aetna when it closes versus accelerating investments into solutions that can add new services right away to your store?","Dave Denton","So this is Dave. I think one thing that we've done is we've created a platform that is really engages members around the pharmacy benefit. And when we have done that, we see really enhanced improvement from adherence, as an example, and engagement with the member, this changed behavior. Again, that's been largely focused in the pharmacy benefit.","So now, think with the Aetna combination, potential combination, we're thinking about other things that we can now engage that member on that was just outside of pharmacy but still in health care. So we're making investments to create that platform of engagement such that now, we can focus that member and other areas of health care. So think about our data and analytics investment and infrastructure to support that kind of engagement model.","Mohan Naidu","Thanks. Dave. Maybe one quick modeling question, the Q1 tax rate, is it going to marginally different from full year or is just going to be anything meaningful there?","Dave Denton","Yes, it could be slightly better than the full year. So with that, we'll take one more question.","Operator","And our final question comes from Scott Mushkin, Wolfe Resources. Please go ahead.","Scott Mushkin","Thanks, guys. Thanks for fitting me in. So just kind of housekeeping issue and going back to the health care plans. I just want to see you guys talked about the opportunity not being as big this year. I guess, I didn't quite understand why on that. Is it just something in a market, or is it because the pending acquisitions, so that was kind of a housekeeping issue? And then I had a follow-up.","Larry Merlo","Yes, Scott, it's just a normal cycle of the market. And the plans that were available were for the most part renewed by the existing PBM including ours.","Scott Mushkin","Perfect. And then my last question and talking about the store footprint, I know you guys are thinking about the assets going forward. How should you think about the store footprint?

I do think we'll still need a number of stores that we have. And importantly, if you look at our pipeline going forward, we're still going to continue to grow our store base.

Please note that we posted slide presentation on our website this morning and it summarizes the information on this call as well as key facts and figures around our operating performance and guidance, so I recommend that you take a look at that.","Additionally, note that we plan to file our annual report on Form 10-K later this month and it will be available through our website at that time.","During this call, we\u2019ll discuss some non-GAAP financial measures in talking about our company\u2019s performance, mainly free cash flow, EBITDA and adjusted EPS. \u00a0In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find the definitions of the non-GAAP items I mentioned, as well as the reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, on the Investor Relations portion of our website. And, as always, today's call is being simulcast on our website, and it will be archived there following the call for 1 year.Now, before we begin, our attorneys have asked me to read the Safe Harbor statement. During this presentation, we'll make certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Accordingly, for these forward-looking statements, we claim the protection of the Safe Harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.We strongly recommend that you become familiar with the specific risks and uncertainties that are described in the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and that you review the section entitled Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements in our most recently filed quarterly report on Form 10-Q.And now I'll turn this over to Larry Merlo.Larry MerloWell, thanks Nancy. \u00a0Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us today. \u00a0Obviously we\u2019re very pleased with the strong results we posted in the fourth quarter and full year 2012, with solid performance across the enterprise.If you exclude the one-time cost of $0.17 per share related to the early extinguishment of debt, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter and full year were $1.14 and $3.43 respectively, demonstrating very healthy underlying growth of 28% for the quarter, 23% for the year.Now, you\u2019ll recall that in December we retired some long term debt, replacing it with debt at lower interest rates, and that refinancing and the associated one-time cost was not included in our guidance. \u00a0So our fourth quarter results reflect strong performances at the high end of our expectations in both the retail and PBM segments.In addition, below the line benefits from a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares than expected drove the outperformance, with the quarter exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.03 per share. \u00a0We also generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow in the quarter, bringing the 2012 total to $5.2 billion, which also exceeded our goal for the year. Now, in addition to posting better-than-expected 2012 results, this morning we\u2019re raising our guidance for 2013, taking into account the anticipated accretion from the debt refinancing. \u00a0We now expect to achieve adjusted earnings per share for \u201913 in the range of $3.86 to $4.00, and that\u2019s up $0.02 from our previous range of $3.84 to $3.98. \u00a0And Dave will provide the details of our guidance during his financial review.So with that, let me provide a brief business update, and I\u2019ll start with our PBM. \u00a0Since our analyst day in mid-December, there has been no material change in the 2013 selling season. \u00a0And with nearly 85% of our client renewals completed to date, our retention rate stands at 96%.Now, on analyst day we reported net new business wins for \u201913 of about $400 million, and while we have had some additional wins since the analyst day, we expect the impact of the recent CMS sanction, which I\u2019ll speak about shortly, to basically offset those recent wins. \u00a0So, again, our net new business for \u201913 stands at about $400 million.Now, it\u2019s obviously very early in the 2014 selling season, but efforts are well-underway, and our differentiated offerings continue to gain attention in the marketplace. \u00a0Client interest in our unique Maintenance Choice offerings continues to be robust, and we now have about 15.8 million lives covered by more than 1,100 plans that have implemented or committed to implement our Maintenance Choice offerings. \u00a0And that number is up from 14.5 lives at our last update, and looking forward, we see the potential to increase the number of lives to an even higher level.We are enrolling new lives into both of our Maintenance Choice offerings, with some clients opting for the 1.0 offering and others opting for the new 2.0 design. \u00a0Most of the lives are coming from plans that previously had voluntary mail plan designs, so these clients can now begin to experience the cost savings Maintenance Choice offers.Pharmacy Advisor, our flagship clinical offering, has also made strong advances. \u00a0Five new disease states have been successfully implemented as of January 1, including asthma, COPD, depression, osteoporosis, and breast cancer. \u00a0And as we said on analyst day, we expect to have about 900 clients with about 16 million members enrolled in all, or some of our available programs, and we have seen a very positive response from clients to the newly expanded offerings. \u00a0We also began offering Pharmacy Advisor to our Medicare clients on January 1, and we\u2019re excited about future opportunities to support these clients as they strive to improve their star ratings.And I think these are two great examples of how we\u2019re capitalizing on our integrated assets, and these programs are helping to lower healthcare costs while improving the health of those we serve.Let me talk more about the recent CMS sanction on our Medicare Part D subscription drug plan. \u00a0The sanction means that we cannot enroll new individual SilverScript members or market our Silver Script plan to potential individual members until the sanction is lifted.However, current SilverScript members are not affected by this action, including our EGWPs along with the new individual members that enrolled at the beginning of this plan year. \u00a0Our clients\u2019 EGWP plans and their members are also not affected by the sanction. \u00a0This sanction relates only to our SilverScript plan and does not affect Medicare Part D plans offered by our health plan clients.Now, that said, let me acknowledge my disappointment in these circumstances. \u00a0Our goal is to execute flawlessly across the organization every day, and in consolidating the Medicare Part D enrollment systems for SilverScript, we did not deliver on that goal. \u00a0So we\u2019re working to resolve these issues as expeditiously as possible. \u00a0The sanction should be lifted when CMS is satisfied that the issues are fixed, and not likely to recur. \u00a0Now, let me assure you that we are highly focused on working with CMS to bring these issues to resolution as soon as possible.So with that, I\u2019ll turn to three important PBM growth drivers: the fast-growing specialty pharmacy business, our streamlining initiative, and the Aetna relationship. \u00a0Now, the specialty pharmacy business continued on pace, with revenues increasing more than 31% versus the same quarter of last year. \u00a0And this specialty growth was driven by new PBM clients, new product launches, along with drug price inflation.And given that specialty costs are growing rapidly, our clients are looking for help to better manage this trend. \u00a0And our specialty guideline management program continues to garner a great deal of interest with some significant new clients adopting the program late last year.We\u2019re also seeing a lot of interest in our specialty medical benefit management program, especially among our health plan customers. \u00a0And we have multiple pilots underway. \u00a0We expect to close and implement several other customers during the 2013 year. \u00a0So specialty pharmacy will continue to be a key area of focus for us going forward.As for the streamlining initiative, we are on track with our efforts to reorganize PBM operations to improve productivity, rationalize capacity, and consolidate our adjudication platforms to one destination platform with enhanced capabilities. \u00a0We now have about two-thirds of our business on the destination platform, and we expect to increase that to 85% by the end of this year.As for the other transformation activities, we anticipate being more than 95% complete by the end of April. \u00a0So we\u2019re on track to deliver significant cost savings from the streamlining efforts, and we expect to hit the full \u00a0run rate of annual savings - that being $225-275 million - beginning in \u201914. And then, as for the Aetna relationship, the client systems conversion continues to proceed successfully. \u00a0We have further migrations scheduled throughout this year. \u00a0And once a client\u2019s migration is complete, we can then begin to offer our differentiated products and services. We have had a successful selling season as Aetna has added more than 1 million pharmacy lives to their book, and we have seen interest within the Aetna client base to implement Maintenance Choice and Pharmacy Advisor, and we believe this is further enhanced at this competitive position in the marketplace.So we\u2019re very optimistic as to what lies ahead, as we continue to work with the Aetna team to drive cost savings for their clients.With that, let me turn to our retail business. \u00a0We had a very strong quarter, with same-store sales increasing 4%. \u00a0Pharmacy comps also increased 4% in the quarter, with front-store comps increasing 3.9%. \u00a0New generics had a negative impact of about 1,100 basis points on pharmacy comps, and you may recall that\u2019s up from about 900 basis points in the third quarter. \u00a0Script cost increased 11% on a 30-day supply basis, and 9% when counting 90-day supplies as one script. \u00a0We had a slight benefit in the quarter from flu-related scripts and flu shots increasing during December. In addition, our retention of scripts gained during the Walgreens Express impasse was also a factor. \u00a0As expected, we retained at least 60% of the scripts gained during the impasse, and we estimate the impact added about 340 basis points to our script comp, equating to about 5.5 to 6 million scripts. \u00a0And we remain confident that we will continue to retain at least 60% of the scripts in 2013. Now, as for the front-store business, both customer traffic and the average front-store ticket increased notably in the quarter. \u00a0I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not surprised to hear that we saw particular strength in cough and cold, allergy, and flu-related sales. \u00a0Private label sales represented 18.1% of front-store sales in the quarter. \u00a0That\u2019s up about 20 basis points year over year. \u00a0And we also continued to see solid sales and share growth in the beauty category, driven by skincare and cosmetics.In addition, we estimate that the Walgreens Express impasse positively impacted our front-store comp by about 150 basis points in the quarter. \u00a0And as for the Christmas season, seasonal sales came in close to, but just below, our expectations.When you look at market share, the latest data shows that CVS has gained front-store share versus a year ago. \u00a0Our share growth in the drug channel was 226 basis points, and against multi-outlet competitors, 17 basis points.Now let me touch on our ExtraCare program, because it continues to be a key differentiator for us, with the scale of our program increasing dramatically in 2012, even with competitive activity in the loyalty space. Both front-store and pharmacy transactions with the ExtraCare card increased. \u00a0We issued more personalized offers, and we saw 19% growth in the number of offers redeemed, with many now coming from the ExtraCare coupon centers.In addition, increased engagement of our ExtraCare members is driving meaningful results. \u00a0As an example, we have doubled our email program to more than 15 million active participants. \u00a0They have received over 60 million personalized email offers. \u00a0That\u2019s up 69% versus the prior year. \u00a0Beauty Club participation grew by 21% to 11 million customers, affording targeted promotion and profitable sales growth. And just last week, we launched an enhanced ExtraCare program for pharmacy and health rewards. Now, this is an opt-in program, and individual enrollment versus household participation allows for more personalized communication. \u00a0We can offer members a wider range of rewards for healthy behaviors that can result in improved adherence. \u00a0So this program will be a great tool for driving prescription adherence, script consolidation, and customer retention.And while ExtraCare has been in the marketplace for 15 years, I think these are examples of how we\u2019re not sitting still. \u00a0These enhanced programs are geared to our higher-value customers and it enables us to focus and tailor our rewards along with enhancing the productivity of our investments.With that, let me turn to our real estate program. \u00a0We opened 45 new or relocated stores. \u00a0We closed two, resulting in 35 net new stores in the quarter. \u00a0And for the year, we opened 150 new or relocated stores, closed 19, resulting in 131 net new stores with 2.1% retail square footage growth.Now, before turning to MinuteClinic, I want to touch on a recent transaction. \u00a0Late last week, we closed on the acquisition of Drogaria Onofre, a privately held retail drugstore chain in Sao Paolo, Brazil with 44 stores. \u00a0This transaction is not financially material to our company. \u00a0However, it is our first foray into the international drugstore space, and we wanted to provide a little color this morning.As you know, we have been exploring opportunities for possible international expansion, and we\u2019ve said many times that our approach would be measured, and that we would exercise financial discipline. \u00a0We believe this acquisition is a great example of that strategy in action.Onofre has a strong reputation in the marketplace. \u00a0They do a great job in tailoring their stores to market to different customer segments. \u00a0And we view Brazil as an attractive market, given that healthcare and pharmacy are expected to grow double digits for the next decade. \u00a0And while chains are prevalent, it is still a highly fragmented market. \u00a0So we see nice opportunities to grow the business over time. \u00a0And as we\u2019ve said, we will continue to take a measured approach to our international growth plan. So with that, let me turn to MinuteClinic, which recorded very strong revenue growth in the quarter. \u00a0On a comparable basis, sales were up more than 38%. \u00a0This was the same quarter last year. \u00a0And as we headed into January, with a strong flu season, our patient visits at MinuteClinic reached unprecedented daily levels.In addition to treating [acute visit] patients in the quarter, we continued to work on wellness programs along with programs aimed at treating chronic conditions. \u00a0For example, we\u2019ve developed a provider education program with the American Heart Association to support our hypertension evaluation visits. \u00a0And we\u2019re also piloting enhanced smoking cessation and weight management programs, and the strong growth we\u2019ve experienced in MinuteClinic\u2019s non-acute services is helping us to reduce the seasonality of the business. \u00a0\u00a0We opened 31 net new clinics in the quarter, and we ended 2012 with 640 clinics in 25 states and the District of Columbia. \u00a0And as Andy Sussman noted on Analyst Day, we\u2019re ramping up our expansion plans, and we expect to open another 150 clinics this year, ending \u201913 with just under 800 clinics.MinuteClinic is also expanding its affiliations with many of the nation\u2019s leading health systems. \u00a0And it\u2019s also increasing its collaboration with our PBM clients. \u00a0And through all of these efforts, we will help to transform the delivery of primary care in the U.S. as our healthcare system continues to evolve. \u00a0So with that, let me turn it over to Dave for the financial review.David DentonGood morning. \u00a0Thank you, Larry. \u00a0Today I\u2019ll provide a detailed review of our fourth quarter 2012 results, and review our 2013 guidance. \u00a0But let me begin with a wrap up of last year\u2019s capital allocation program, and how we\u2019re using our strong free cash flow to return value to our shareholders.In the fourth quarter, we finalized the accelerated share repurchase program that we began in September, and we also repurchased approximately 7.1 million shares for approximately $329 million in the open market. \u00a0So for all of 2012, we repurchased approximately 95 million shares for $4.3 billion, averaging $45.58 per share.Additionally, we paid approximately $202 million in dividends in the fourth quarter alone, bringing our total for the year to $829 million. \u00a0We finished the year with a payout ratio of 21.3%, and our strong earnings outlook this year combined with a 38% increase in the dividend we announced at our analyst day puts us on track to achieve our targeted payout ratio of 25% by the end of 2013, two years ahead of our schedule.So between dividends and share repurchases, we\u2019ve returned more than $5.1 billion to our shareholders just in 2012, and our expectation is that between dividends and share repurchase, we will return approximately $5 billion again to our shareholders in 2013.We generated $5.2 billion of free cash in \u201912, and $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter alone, up $419 million from the same period of last year. \u00a0This was driven by our earnings outperformance as well as improved receivables and payables management and the timing of certain payments.Regarding the balance sheet, over the course of 2012 we continued to make great strides in improving our cash cycle, especially within the retail segment. \u00a0Inventory days within retail improved by more than 3.5 days in 2012, and we reduced our retail cash cycle by more than 5 days throughout the year. The retail team was able to reduce inventories by approximately $450 million through process improvements and while just short of our $500 million goal, we remain committed to further inventory reductions as we move forward. In the fourth quarter, gross capital expenditures of $716 million were offset by a $102 million of sale leaseback activity. \u00a0For the year, our net capital expenditures were $1.5 billion, which included $2 billion of gross capex, offset by $529 million in sale leaseback proceeds.As for the income statement, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations came in at $1.14 per share, approximately $0.03 above the high end of our guidance, after you adjust for the impact of the debt refinancing. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.90 per share, and as Larry said, the EPS beat was driven primarily by better than expected below the line performance. \u00a0But both the PBM and retail segments performed at or above the high end of expectations as well.So let me quickly walk down the P&L statement. \u00a0On a consolidated basis, revenues in the fourth quarter increased 10.9% to $31.4 billion. \u00a0Within the segments, net revenues increased 17.4% in the PBM to $18.6 billion. The significant number of new client starts in 2012 drove substantial growth over last year, while Medicare Part D was also a key growth driver. \u00a0Acquisitions such as Universal American and Health Net, as well as organic member growth are responsible for volume increases in Medicare Part D. And we continue to see some drug price inflation, particularly in our specialty business, which helped to grow revenues over last year. \u00a0These positive revenue drivers were partially offset by the growth in the PBM\u2019s generic dispensing rate, which increased 500 basis points versus the same quarter of last year to 80%. \u00a0In our retail business, revenues increased 5.1% in the quarter to $16.3 billion, driven primarily by strong same-store sales growth. Turning to gross margin, we reported 20.1% for the consolidated company in the quarter, an increase of approximately 45 basis points compared to Q4 of \u201911. \u00a0Within the PBM segment, gross margin increased by 75 basis points versus Q4 of \u201911 to 7.2% while gross profit dollars increased 16% year over year.The increase year over year was primarily driven by the big increase in GDR, higher volumes, and better acquisition cost economics. \u00a0These positive margin drivers were partially offset by client price compression. Gross margin in the retail segment was 31.3%, up 155 basis points over last year. \u00a0This improvement was again driven primarily by the 400 basis points increase in retail GDR to 79.9%. \u00a0Additionally, we saw our private label sales as a percentage of front-store volume increase by 20 basis points to 18.1%.Total operating expenses as a percent of revenues were essentially flat to Q4 of \u201911 at 12.7%. \u00a0The PBM segment\u2019s SG&A rate improved approximately 25 basis points to 1.6%. \u00a0This was primarily driven by strong revenue growth as well as improvements derived from the streamlining effort. In the retail segment, SG&A as a percentage of sales increased by approximately 125 basis points to 21.6% while expenses grew by 11.6%. \u00a0As expected, this was mainly due to the deleveraging effect of the growth in generics as well as the fact that we are comparing against disproportionately lower spending in Q4 of last year.Within the corporate segment, expenses were up approximately $30 million to $182 million. \u00a0And given all that, operating margin for the total enterprise improved 40 basis points to 7.3%. \u00a0Operating margin in the PBM improved approximately 100 basis points to 5.6% while operating margin at retail improved by about 35 basis points to 9.7%.For the quarter, we beat our growth estimates for operating profit in both the retail and PBM segments. \u00a0Retail operating profit increased a solid 8.9%, exceeding expectations by approximately 90 basis points. PBM operating profit grew a very healthy 42.9%, some 185 basis points above our guidance range. \u00a0Both segments benefited from the positive impact of generics and the increase in GDRs. \u00a0Additionally, the PBM also benefited from the increasing profitability as we move through the year in the Medicare Part D as well as the increasing benefits derived from the streamlining effort.Now, going below the line on the consolidated income statement, net interest expense in the quarter increased approximately $12 million from last year to $159. \u00a0Additionally, our effective tax rate was 37.1%, lower than expected related to a nonrecurring item. \u00a0Our weighted average share count was 1.25 billion shares, approximately 12 million shares lower than anticipated due to our opportunistic repurchase of additional shares on the open market once the ASR completed. \u00a0","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from the line of Dane Leone \u2013 Macquarie.","Dane Leone \u2013 Macquarie","When we think about the coming year, I know it\u2019s early to really start speaking about the 2014 PBM selling season, I\u2019m just curious with where you\u2019re gotten into the PBM streamlining initiative along with the additional conversions to the destination platform.","Fundamentally, how do you compare going into this year and the capacity for the organization to take on new business versus where you were last year heading into April?","Larry Merlo","We see no barriers and no limitations around that.  Keep in mind that I had mentioned that about two-thirds of our business is already on the destination platform and any new business automatically goes onto that platform, so there\u2019s no conversion activity associated with that.","John Roberts","The other thing I would add is we have a separate team that is working on the conversion process totally separate than the teams that implement new business and we\u2019ve implemented $24 billion of net new business over the last three years, so we think we\u2019re very well positioned to continue to add new business and grow as we move forward.","Dane Leone - Macquarie","Then one additional question on the Silver Script resolution with CMS.  Could you add any additional color on specific steps that need to be taken or specific timeline when that could be resolved?","John Roberts","Yes, well, as Larry talked about, we had to consolidate our enrollment systems from two acquisitions, which was Universal American PDP Healthnet and Silver Script, on the one system, which unfortunately led to issues with Silver Script\u2019s enrollment and claims processing in the January timeframe and an unanticipated increase in call volumes.","So this sanction is focused on Silver Script\u2019s enrollment process.  Our remediation plan was submitted to CMS on January 23rd and work is underway to implement the appropriate corrective action.","We have successfully operated these enrollment systems since the inception of Medicare Part D and continue to expect to do so now that the system consolidation is complete and we\u2019re very focused on working with CMS to correct the issues and to have the sanction lifted as soon as possible and we are confident in our ability to address these issues quickly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Willoughby \u2013 Bank of America.","Robert Willoughby \u2013 Bank of America","Any change in philosophy on retail store openings in the US?  What are your targets there?  And just comment briefly what, if any, synergies you expect to derive from Brazil from a cost standpoint.","Larry Merlo","Yes, Rob, in terms of \u2013 your first question, in terms of our retail gross strategy, we have no change in our strategy there.  We\u2019ve talked the last several years about 2% to 3% square footage growth and our pipeline falls within those boundaries and we continue to see opportunities for retail growth here in the US.","As far as synergies go, it will be very minimal.  As I mentioned in my remarks, this transaction is not financially materially.  We\u2019re talking about 44 stores and I think it\u2019ll be a great learning opportunity for the organization.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette \u2013 UBS.","Steven Valiquette \u2013 UBS","So you mentioned that you obviously retained at least 60% of the RX from Wallgreens in the fourth quarter.  Obviously that\u2019s the guidance for 2013 as well, I guess whatever the actual rate is.","I think you mentioned previously you expected it to stick about the same in early \u201913 as it was exiting \u201912 and that the rollover of the calendar year wouldn\u2019t really change anything or trigger anything to change the run rate.","So I\u2019m just curious now without giving any specific numbers is that indeed the case now that you have probably some read on January?","Larry Merlo","Yes, Steve.  I think as we\u2019ve talked about this over the last several months, we had talked about the fact that we didn\u2019t see this as being a 12 to 18 month event, that we believe that we would reach a steady state run rate.","Towards the end of the year I think we had acknowledged that it could trickle into the first quarter of this year and, quite frankly, our retention is actually performing as we had outlined.  So we don\u2019t see any change to the comments that we made in the past.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research.","Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research","On the retail side of the business, the SG&A growth increased or accelerated a little bit in 4Q versus the prior couple quarters.  I\u2019m interested if you can give a little bit of color on that and then strategically what you\u2019re doing with the drug store with the retail business to sustain good performance and further improve market share in \u201913, if you\u2019re doing anything different for marketing or for merchandising from a promotional perspective.","Dave Denton","Really, the growth in SG&A in retail for Q4 was driven by our comparisons in Q4 of LY, so if you look at Q4 of \u201911, the growth of SG&A was very modest.  We\u2019re bumping up against some tough comparisons, so we knew that was going to be case as we cycled into Q4 of \u201912.","And so it performed as we expected, so nothing really new there.  And with that, maybe I\u2019ll turn it to Mark to talk a bit about the retail business.","Mark Cosby","Well, the biggest headline that we talked about in the analyst day was around personalization and that was really the headline for the quarter and it\u2019s really the headline as we go into \u201913.","So our whole goal is to move away from the mass approach and to customize our approach to each individual customer.  We\u2019re doing that through how we are clustering our stores, which means personalizing the assortment within each store.","That was played out to our urban initiative over the last couple years.  We have a number of initiatives coming up in 2013 to take that to a new level, which we talked about a little bit at the analyst day.","The other big play coming out of personalization is obviously through our extra care program.  As Larry outlined in his comments, that has been a strength for us for many years, 15 years, and we have a very engaged customer set as evidenced by the 68% of our transactions and 85% of our sales going through the program.","We ramped that up in a big way in the fourth quarter and we\u2019re taking that into 2013.  Larry through out a couple of numbers earlier and I think they\u2019re indicative of that improved engagement, first the fact that we increased the number of offers redeemed by 19% over the course of the quarter.","That also led \u2013 was driven by a big increase in the number of offers that came through from our email program.  We\u2019ve more than doubled that program to $15 million and increased the number of offers that went through our email program at 69% to over 600 million offerings.","We also had some advancements on the (BD) club front, which were all about a year ago that that dramatically improved with some new features that we rolled out.  We increased that by 21% to $11 million.","And as Larry mentioned in his comments, significant amount of work going through our differentiated extra care center where we\u2019re able to deliver customized, personalized messages to our customers and that will play out as we go into \u201913 with an initiative that we call conversion which allows our customers to shop broadly across the store.","Just most recently, you probably read a little bit.  We just introduced this pharmacy in healthy rewards program, which we had in place.  Just a little fact, we\u2019ve had a reward in place for our pharmacy customers for the last several years as part of our extra care program where we had $1 for every two prescriptions.","But this most recent program is really different in the fact that it customizes the message to individuals as opposed to households.  We came up with this program over a year ago.  It was tested in five markets and just launched this past week.","The big difference, as I mentioned, it\u2019s tied to individuals, not to households.  We can then trigger the messages directly to customers and customize the message as such.  We have also slightly modified the program.  Ten prescriptions equals five extra (bucks) and we have many different ways for our customers to earn those extra bucks just beyond (awards) themselves.","The big advantages for our customers is more value communicated directly to them.  We also believe it will help their adherence.  It\u2019s also a great way for us to communicate and retain our most important pharmacy heavy user customers.","So extra care, the answer to your question, would be personalization through our conversion program, through our clustering programs as well as through our taking extra care to a new level.","Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research","Then if I could just follow up, the retail comp in 4Q was quite solid.  What you\u2019ve talked about for \u201913 would be a moderation from that.  Could you just square those two facts?","Larry Merlo","Well, keep in mind as you cycle into \u201913 you\u2019ve got a couple things happening.  First and foremost, you have continued generic (NYSE:GER) expansion, number one.  And number two is you\u2019re comping against some share gains, high share gains as we move into 2013 versus what we gained in 2012.  And then finally you have one less day in \u201913 than you have in \u201912 due to leap year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs","First of all, just following up on the changes to extra care as related to the inclusion or the change in the inclusion of prescriptions.  Can you talk about what the break even is or some sense thereof for the share gains you need to generate because presumably some of the extra care bucks that are going to be rewarded are for customers that you\u2019re already doing business with?","So what kind of share gain would you expect you need to generate for this to start to deliver the kind of financial outcome you\u2019re looking for?","Larry Merlo","Yes, Matt, I think if you go back to some of the comments that I had made in my prepared remarks and combine that with what Mark just talked about, through this effort of personalization we\u2019re able to get more granular in terms of where do we make the investments on a customer-by-customer basis.","And so, quite frankly, the break even point is very, very low.  And it\u2019s \u2013 you can think of it as reallocating the investment to where it\u2019s going to matter the most.  So it makes the investment very productive from a profitability point of view.","Matthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs","And then secondly, a modeling question, as we think about the impact of intersegment eliminations on EBIT, that was a number that increased quite sharply over the course of 2012.","How should we think about \u2013 you gave us pretty firm guidance on the revenue impact for 2013.  How should we think directionally about the impact on (technical difficulty) income for 2013?","Dave Denton","Clearly the (InterSoft) company eliminations are being driven by the successful maintenance choice program, so the more adoption of that program drives additional eliminations for the company.","Secondly is the growth in the elimination is also driven strongly by the generic penetration in 2012.  As you know, Lipitor is a very large maintenance drug and that drug was used extensively within the mail order centers, so therefore, it\u2019s a drug that\u2019s used heavily within the maintenance choice product.","And so that disproportionately drove the eliminations in \u201912.  I would not expect to see the same type of growth as you cycle into \u201913.  But I think you take our, what we said from a guidance perspective and walk your way back, you can come up with an estimate of what the intercompany segment elimination might be.","Matthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs","But you would expect EBIT \u2013 because this year you\u2019ve had the EBIT impact more than double.  The revenue (half) was 19%.  You\u2019d expect those two numbers to be closer in sync directionally?  And of course, we\u2019ll go back and do the math this period.","Dave Denton","Yes, that\u2019s right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Hessler \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Greg Hessler \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","As I look at the balance sheet, leverage at year-end was just below 2.5 times, which is below your 2.7 times target.  And then based on 2013 guidance, this number should continue to come down next year as well.","So my question is has anything changed from a financial policy or capital allocation standpoint?","Larry Merlo","No, it has not.  I think we\u2019ve been very clear from a capital allocation standpoint of how we\u2019re going to use our free cash flow.  One, to drive value for our shareholders in really three ways: one, investing in our business with the appropriate return on invested capital targets and hurdles; two, increasing our dividends; and three, doing share repurchases that are value-enhancing.","And we\u2019ve said we\u2019re going to do that in the context of maintaining an adjusted debt to EBITDA capital structure of 2.7 times.  And while that\u2019s our target, we know at times we fluctuate higher or lower to that.  We\u2019ll stay within that range.","And it would be our expectation that we would continue to focus to have our balance sheet and our capital structure within those tolerance levels as we go forward.","Greg Hessler \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just in terms of the rating, are you guys \u2013 are you still committed to the high BBB credit rating as well in conjunction with those goals?","Larry Merlo","Very much so.  We think it\u2019s important for us to maintain our high BBB rating both as we think about financing the company long term but also from a short-term basis.  We access the commercial paper market typically on a daily basis and that\u2019s a very efficient means for us to finance the company\u2019s working capital and I think having a BBB rating is important for that.","And also we think about sell leaseback activities.  I think BBB is also important for that function as well.  So we\u2019re very much committed to that and certainly it\u2019s our target.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill \u2013 JPMorgan.","Lisa Gill \u2013 JPMorgan","Larry, I know you said it\u2019s early talk about the 2014 selling season but can either you or John maybe just, one, size what you have up for renewal and, two, maybe just characterize that the 2014 selling season, would you call it a normal season?","And the discussions that you\u2019re having, obviously reform is coming in 2014.  We have exchanges coming in 2014.  What are your current clients thinking around both reform and exchanges as you start to think about 2014?","Larry Merlo","As it relates to the \u201914 selling season, the amount of business that we have up for renewal is similar to prior years within about $11 billion to $12 billion up for renewal.  And as we\u2019ve all acknowledged, it is early.  I\u2019ll let John touch on what his sense of the market is and what he\u2019s hearing from clients around the exchanges and how they\u2019re thinking about their employee base.","John Roberts","Yes, so Lisa, when I \u2013 and I have to separate my response in two segments.  When I talk to employers and how they\u2019re thinking about the exchanges, I think most of them are in a wait and see attitude, particularly the large employers, which we deal with.  So I don\u2019t \u2013 I think they\u2019re going to wait and see how these public exchanges shake out.  The private exchanges are seeing some activity primarily in the retiree space.","When we talk to our health plan clients, they\u2019re obviously gearing up to participate in the exchanges, so they\u2019re interested in our assistance around formulary.  They like our CVS retail stores and the ability to the market there, their brand to consumers and that all of our differentiated offerings that we have \u2013 maintenance choice, pharmacy advisory, the ability to do preferred or even restricted networks.","So a lot more discussion around health plans as they gear up to compete in the space and that\u2019s where you\u2019re going to see most of the growth is with \u2026 ","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan","Do you think competitively, John, does that help you to win health plan business and do you see any large pieces of health plan business that are up for renewal for others in 2014 that you say that this is something I\u2019m going to target because we think we have something differentiated that we can go to them as they\u2019re building out their exchanges?","John Roberts","We\u2019re seeing a lot of interest from health plans where we\u2019re the (NYSEMKT:PBM) but we\u2019re also seeing interest from health plans where we\u2019re not the (PBM) because of all of our assets.  A little early to talk about what we\u2019re seeing from specific health plans coming to the marketplace and looking for bids.","There may be some activity where health plans have a particular (PBM) but maybe looking for different partners as they evolve their exchange strategy.  So you could see some activity there.","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan","And then I just had an accounting question, Dave.  If I look at the potential impact for Medicare MLR regulation to the PVP in 2014, how will that impact your PVP business?","Dave Denton","Quite frankly, it\u2019s probably a little early to be able to answer that.  Some of the regulations aren\u2019t quite solid yet.  I would say that at the end of the day we\u2019re watching closely and we\u2019ll update as we see that regulation evolve at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Ransom \u2013 Raymond James.","John Ransom \u2013 Raymond James","Dave, as you think about your 2013 PBM margin comparisons to 2012, what\u2019s the impact on say the ramp of the (AETNA) contract versus say the streamlining efforts?  How should we think about that?","Dave Denton","That\u2019s a tough question.  I think in general, listen, we know that both from an (AETNA) perspective and from streamlining perspective we\u2019re very focused on enhancing our performance in both those areas as we think over time.","Certainly from a streamlining effort, we continue to make nice progress on improving the SG&A structure of the organization and aligning from a service perspective the metrics that organizations deliver day in and day out on the service commitment that we have.","Also, I guess, from an (AETNA) perspective, (AETNA) cycles into \u201913.  They are a net share gainer and adding additional (lives), which will drive additional economics for us.","So at the end of the day, as they are successful in a marketplace working with us, that is really the opportunity that we have to broaden our partnership and drive value for them and for us and for the customers that they serve.","John Ransom \u2013 Raymond James","Maybe another way of asking about it, I remember you provided some initial accretion targets when you signed that big contract.  Are those still in the ballpark?  Are they better?  Are they worse?","Dave Denton","Those are stale.  We said quite some time ago that those were stale in that there was a lot of moving parts back then.  So those are not good numbers at this point.  We are very focused and very pleased with our relationship with (AETNA) and how it\u2019s progressing but you can\u2019t look at that.","John Ransom \u2013 Raymond James","Then the other question, just looking at your front end on the retail side, pretty big delta between your large public customers.  What\u2019s the impact, do you think, of getting 24 million scripts from (NYSE:ESI)?  Do you think there\u2019s been some bleed over from those customers and will some of that weigh in this year?  Or do you think it\u2019s disconnected to that?","Larry Merlo","Well, John, we acknowledged that earlier that in the fourth quarter we believe it positively impacted the front end cost by about 150 basis points and that was consistent with what we had seen in prior quarters as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel \u2013 Guggenheim.","John Heinbockel \u2013 Guggenheim","So guys, a couple things on maintenance choice, of the 15.8 million lives, how does that break down between one and two?  And I know two is new, so is two less than 10% of that?","Larry Merlo","Yes, John, we\u2019re not going to break that out going forward.  We\u2019ll continue to report on how we continue to grow the maintenance choice population but we\u2019re not going to delineate between 1.0 and 2.0.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim","Well, do you think 2.0, at least near term, does that generate the bulk of the growth in maintenance choice or no?","Larry Merlo","Well, John, I think as we have outlined, I think at the analyst meeting a year ago, we saw 2.0 as being a key factor in our ability at the time to triple the number of lives that would be appropriate for a maintenance choice type program.","And I think over the past year we have seen our lives grow by about 5 million from \u201911 to \u201912 and now we\u2019re sitting here saying that we still believe we can double the number of lives that we have.  And it\u2019s going to be a combination of the various designs that we have out there.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim","If somebody signs up for 2.0, how quickly do you think they migrate to 1.0?  They don\u2019t have to wait for the next contract.","John Roberts","Yes, they can migrate to 1.0 really at any time and we\u2019ve seen some of that activity and we think that as people get experience with maintenance choice 2.0 they actually have an opportunity to deliver or to generate more savings by moving up to 1.0 as they move more of their maintenance volume into the maintenance choice channel.","So we think 2.0 is a good entr\u00e9e point for where we are, particularly with health plans where we\u2019ve had pretty low penetration of maintenance choice.  They traditionally have liked open access.  We think this really will play well with the health plans.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim","And then lastly, John, given that there are now very distinct models out there in the PBM side and two of your bigger competitors are still sort of involved in integrations, are you more optimistic about \u201914 selling season than you might have been a year ago or, no, that\u2019s reading too much into it?","John Roberts","Yes, listen, it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re focused on obviously ensuring when we\u2019re going to the marketplace we\u2019re talking about our differentiated offerings.  We think they\u2019re resonating in the market.","You look at our success over the last three years, 24 billion in net new business.  But it still remains a very competitive market and we\u2019re seeing pricing is \u2013 continues to be very competitive, no real change over the least few years but still rational.  So we\u2019ll see how it goes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelley \u2013 Credit Suisse.","Edward Kelley \u2013 Credit Suisse","Larry, I just wanted to confirm one thing and then ask you my real question.  But on the express scripts lost customers, has the pace of the customer loss diminished over the last couple of months or has it been steady?  I\u2019m just trying to clarify (technical difficulty).","Larry Merlo","Yes, I think as I had acknowledged earlier, it has \u2013 the migration that we have seen has been pretty much in line with what we\u2019ve expected.  And you see more attrition in markets where we don\u2019t have the concentration of stores, where \u2013 which we were talking about that six months ago that would likely be the case when an agreement was reached.","So we\u2019re seeing those dynamics and, as I mentioned, it\u2019s pretty much on target with how we\u2019ve thought about it and modeled it.","Edward Kelley \u2013 Credit Suisse","And then my question for you is really related to Brazil.  I know it\u2019s small and I certainly appreciate the measured approach to international but it\u2019s a big opportunity, I guess.  So can you walk us through why you chose this country over others for your first initiative overseas, how this market is different than the US?  And if you\u2019re successful here, how do you grow?  Is this an organic opportunity?  Is it further M&A?","Larry Merlo","Yes, as I had acknowledged earlier that it\u2019s a maturing marketplace, it has \u2013 it\u2019s expected to have continued strong growth for the foreseeable future.  As people move up the economic ladder, they\u2019re spending more on healthcare as well as education and with increased access to healthcare and pharmacy both are expected to grow over the next several years.","I think one of the other keys for us is the market is recessive to chain pharmacy.  Chains are pretty prevalent in the Brazil market but at the same time it\u2019s still fragmented.  I think the largest player has about a 9% share.","So we see the opportunity for growth and (inaudible) has an organic growth plan that we will certainly be looking to execute on and there may be other opportunities acquisition-wise as we move down the road.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken \u2013 ISI Group.","Ross Muken \u2013 ISI Group","As you look at where you\u2019ve been with Wallgreen\u2019s retention over the last two months or so, as you look at the places where you\u2019ve done better versus worst, is it geographically disbursed?  Is there a percentage where if someone signs up for an extra card they\u2019re much more likely to stay in the store?  I\u2019m just trying to get a sense for where you feel like you\u2019ve outperformed and areas where you\u2019ve ceded maybe more share and what the key drivers of that have been.","Larry Merlo","Yes, Ross, I don\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m probably a little redundant now with these comments.  But I think you hit on some of the key points that as we talked about a year ago, the acquisition strategy was developed with a retention component.","So we work very hard to et those maintenance users enrolled in extra care and I think if you reflect on some of Mark\u2019s comments earlier, the ability to communicate with them in a very personalized way is a key element around retention.","And then as I just mentioned a minute ago, we certainly recognize the convenience and locale also becomes part of that retention strategy.  So I don\u2019t know that there is anything out of the ordinary that I could add to your question.","Ross Muken \u2013 ISI Group","And maybe just quickly a modeling question on the pharma services business.  As you look at the first quarter guidance implies a bit more deflation versus the rest of the year.  What\u2019s driving the step up of where we\u2019re given the script guidance of where we\u2019re going from a more significant decline to an increase by the end of the year?","Is there a portion of the year where you\u2019re assuming, given mix, something is changing from deflation to inflation?  I\u2019m just trying to get a little more clarity.","John Roberts","You\u2019re cycling through the first couple of months of the introduction of large generics in last year primarily, especially (inaudible).  And so that\u2019s what\u2019s driving that inflation\/deflation cadence, if you will.","Larry Merlo","So Ross, keep in mind that to Dave\u2019s point on Lipitor, we cycle that in June 1st, so the first almost two quarters.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital.","Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital","I want to go back to just questions about maintenance choice 2.0.  It\u2019s probably very early but I\u2019m just wondering what kind of feedback \u2013 because it is something really unique for these patients.  Is there any feedback coming so far about how they\u2019re responding to it or is it really just too early?","John Roberts","Yes, Meredith, so maintenance choice from a member perspective, maintenance choice 2.0, will perform the same way as our original maintenance choice product, maintenance choice 1.0.","So the member has a choice to either go to CVS retail or to go to mail to get a reduced co-pay.  They get a 90-day maintenance script.  The client gets mail pricing.","And so we see about half the members like to go to CVS retail for their maintenance choice prescriptions and the other half like to go to mail.","And if you look at the penetration for these voluntary mail customers that move in the maintenance choice, we see it\u2019s on average around 15%.  And so as we get this new benefit, we think that that penetration will grow beyond 15%, so that will generate more savings for the client and offer a benefit to the members at no charge, actually a savings for the client.","The other thing we\u2019re working on is continuing to improve the member experience with 2.0, so the move between mail and CVS retail can be more seamless.  It\u2019s more of a binary choice now.  We see people go to either retail or mail and stay and we\u2019re going to evolve our ability to allow them to move much more seamlessly.  People are moving around the country much more now than they used to.","So very positive response, members love it and clients love it and it\u2019s a win-win-win for everybody.","Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital","And then I have a question about specialty.  Obviously specialty costs are just going up and up and up and I think there has been more effort by health plans and payers generally to push more costs onto patients.","Are you \u2013 what are you hearing from your customers about that and do you think that will have any kind of impact on the growth of specialty?","John Roberts","Well, if you look at specialty trends, both on the pharmacy side and the medical side, it\u2019s growing at 20%.  If you look at the pipeline, it\u2019s dominated by specialty.  And if you look at eight of the top 10 drugs by 2016, it\u2019s going to be specialty.","So as we move out of this big generic wave, which is deliver tremendous savings, and you combine that with a specialty trend in the double digits that I described, specialty is becoming the highest priority for our patients.","PBMs have traditionally managed specialty on the pharmacy side.  We\u2019ve expanded our capabilities to manage it on the medical side where really half of the specialty spend is.  And we\u2019re really going to focus on really three areas to manage costs for the members, utilization, unit cost and drug mix.","So our clients want us to manage trend.  They want appropriate utilization but I think you\u2019re going to continue to see significant growth in specialties as we move forward and we\u2019re expanding the piece of the pie that we\u2019re managing for our clients as we move into managing the medical side.","Larry Merlo","Meredith, we talked a little bit about some of the initiatives that we have underway there and some of them are in pilot as we speak.  I think that we\u2019re all very excited about the ability for these pilot programs to bring some meaningful solutions to what clients are worried about.  And we\u2019re certainly talk about that as we move forward throughout the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallucci \u2013 Lazard Capital.","Tom Gallucci \u2013 Lazard Capital","My first one is a lot of attention lately on the PDP area within Medicare, drug benefit and some of the plans that have preferred retail design.  I know you\u2019re in some of those I guess mostly yourself and (AETNA), your plan and (AETNA)s and some of the others are in more of the plans out there.","Can you talk about your thoughts around preferred retail networks I guess both within Medicare and within the private sector and some of your strategy there over and above maintenance choice obviously?","Larry Merlo","Yes, Tom, I think it\u2019s probably important just to level set a little bit in terms of start with the difference between preferred and narrow\/restricted networks and I think it\u2019s \u2013 because everybody knows the narrow \u2013 in a narrow\/restricted network, there are pharmacies that are excluded.  In the preferred network, all pharmacies can participate.","But the customer is incentivized to use one pharmacy over another in the form of a reduced co-pay.  And then when you start peeling back the onion, all preferred networks are not equal from a co-pay differential.","If you look in the (Med D) space, it could vary anywhere from $1 to $10.  And within the (Med D) population, there are no restricted networks.  There are only preferred networks.","So as you mentioned, there are plans where we\u2019re identified as a preferred pharmacy and then there are plans where we\u2019re not.  It\u2019s clear that there is going to be some movement between pharmacies.  I think it\u2019s pretty early to measure the specific impact but we\u2019re not seeing anything at this point that we didn\u2019t expect too see.","And I think from a retail point of view, we are well positioned to be a participant more often than not and we\u2019ll go from there.","Tom Gallucci \u2013 Lazard Capital","The other question I had I think is a minor one but I guess news today, the postal service sounds like it\u2019s finally going to stop delivering on Saturdays.  Can you just talk about any impact or how you think about that from a mail order standpoint?","John Roberts","Yes, Tom, I saw that as well.  So we see a small percentage of our mailings deliver on Saturday, so obviously for those deliveries they\u2019re not going to have them.  They\u2019re going to be pushed to Monday.","I will say that anything that does require Saturday delivery for a member, we have other ways of making that delivery happen.  We do that today and will continue to do that.  So net-net I think it\u2019s a small impact overall, maybe an extra day for members but generally mail members aren\u2019t waiting until the last day to get their mail prescriptions and I think the cost impact is negligible.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser \u2013 Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser \u2013 Morgan Stanley","I had a follow-up on the specialty question.  I know you mentioned that you are moving into managing the medical side.  Can you share with us what\u2019s driving this?  Is it your clients that are asking you to expand what you\u2019re doing with them or is it coming from the health plans that are reaching out to you and asking for your help given (inaudible) like your expertise?","John Roberts","So we\u2019re actually hearing from both health plans and employer clients and what they see is particularly on the medical side specialty spend just isn\u2019t being managed.  So there\u2019s an opportunity to leverage our capabilities to help manage what I talked about earlier, which is utilization, unit cost and drug mix.","So significant interest and we\u2019re moving rapidly to expand and help our clients in these areas.","Ricky Goldwasser \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Then one additional question, your distribution contract is up for renewal this year.  Any thoughts on when you expect to make a decision on that?","Larry Merlo","Ricky, I think as we mentioned in the past, as a matter of policy we won\u2019t comment on individual contracts and I think it\u2019s widely known we have relationships with both Cardinal and (Maketsson) and just say that both of those organizations do a terrific job in servicing the CVS Caremark business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig \u2013 Citigroup.","Deborah Weinswig \u2013 Citigroup","So you talked a lot today about extra care and a lot of work you\u2019ve done on the card and can you refresh your capital allocation priorities coming off of such a strong quarter and how should we think about your investments in tech whether in retail or the PBM side, especially in light of the increase within personalization?","Dave Denton","I guess from a capital allocation perspective I can assure you that we have adequate capital to invest in the digital and extra care space as needed to drive value for our company, for our shareholders.","And we\u2019ve laid out I think a fairly clear roadmap over the next several years of how we\u2019re going to enhance all of those performances associated with those products and services and ways in which we engage members and customers more fully.","And we will continue to push in this area.  I think it\u2019s an area that we see opportunities over time to drive a lot of value.","Larry Merlo","And Deb, I\u2019d just add that that technology roadmap is very much aligned to the strategic growth framework that we laid out on analyst day and in terms of the support that those initiatives would require.","Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup","And then how are you capitalizing on the customers who came into visit Minute Clinic and then also the impression in number of daily levels of flu shots that are ministered in terms of new patients and how might you get them to the more regular customers?","Larry Merlo","Yes, I think Deb, it\u2019s consistent with things that we\u2019ve talked about in the past.  I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve looked at this lately but we knew that a large percent of Minute Clinic patient visits had not had a prescription filled out of CVS.  That could be based on need or demand but certainly there is nothing more convenient than being seen by a nurse practitioner and then getting the script filled while you\u2019re there.","And then we have the opportunities to engage that patient at the point of care in terms of getting them enrolled in the programs.  And I think our refill teams do a pretty good job in terms of identifying those new patients and letting them know the advantages that CVS has to offer.","Listen, everyone, thanks for your time this morning and thanks for your continued interest in our company.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.  We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.  Have a great day."],"6185":["CVS Health Corp.

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Tuesday, August 8, 2017.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike McGuire, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael P. McGuire - CVS Health Corp.","Thank you, Leila. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I'm here this morning with Larry Merlo, President and CEO, and Dave Denton, Executive Vice President and CFO. Jon Roberts, Chief Operating Officer, and Helena Foulkes, President of CVS Pharmacy, are also with us today and will participate in the question-and-answer session following our prepared remarks. During the Q&A, please limit yourself to no more than one question with a quick follow-up so that we can provide more people with a chance to ask their questions.","Please note that we posted a slide presentation on our website before this call. It summarizes the information in our prepared remarks as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance. We also filed our Form 10-Q, and that too is also available on our website.","I have one announcement this morning. Our annual Analyst Day has been scheduled for Tuesday, December 12, in New York City. You'll have the opportunity to hear from several members of our senior management team, who will provide a comprehensive update of our strategies for driving long-term growth. We plan to send invitations via email with more specific details at the end of the summer. But please save the date. Again, that's Tuesday, December 12.","Additionally, during this presentation we will make certain forward-looking statements that reflect our current views related to our financial performance, future events, and industry and market conditions. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what may be indicated in the forward-looking statements. We strongly encourage you to review the information in the reports we file with the SEC regarding these specific risks and uncertainties, in particular those that are described in the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10 K and the cautionary statement disclosures in our Form 10-Q. You should also review the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in our earnings press release.","During this call, we will use non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company's performance. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find the reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of our website. And as always, today's call is being webcast on our website, and it will be archived there following the call for one year.","Now I'll turn this over to Larry Merlo.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us to hear more about our second quarter results.","Total company revenues increased 4.5%, comfortably within our guidance range. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.33, which is $0.01 better than last year and at the high end of our guidance. On an adjusted basis, operating profit was down 7%, within expectations. And this reflects performance in the retail business that was in line with expectations along with performance in the PBM that was ahead of our expectations. We generated approximately $1.6 billion of free cash during the quarter and more than $4.6 billion year to date. And while we are pleased to report results within our expectations, we won't be satisfied until the total enterprise returns to healthy levels of earnings growth.","Back in November, we outlined our four-point plan to return to healthy growth, and that plan included: leveraging our enterprise capabilities and CVS Pharmacy's compelling value proposition to partner more broadly with other PBMs and health plans; focusing on driving growth through new PBM product introductions that capitalize on the benefits inherent in our unique integrated model; continuing to be a low-cost provider; and continuing to be very thoughtful with respect to using our strong cash generation capabilities to return value to our shareholders. And as we go through today's call, you'll hear about the progress we've made against this plan.","Given our solid first half performance and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are narrowing our full-year adjusted EPS guidance range and raising the midpoint. We currently expect to achieve adjusted earnings per share for 2017 of $5.83 to $5.93, reflecting a year-over-year change of down 0.25% to up 1.5%. That compares to our previous range of $5.77 to $5.93. and Dave will discuss the details of both our results and guidance in more detail in his remarks.","Turning to the business update, and I'll start with the 2018 PBM selling season. Despite the magnitude of bidding opportunities being flat to down versus the prior year, we've had good success across all segments, and in particular in the government space. We currently have gross wins in the 2018 selling season of approximately $5.4 billion and net new business of about $1.8 billion. These new business numbers include the previously announced loss of the FEP specialty contract but do not include any impact from our individual Med D PDP, which I'll touch on shortly. To date, we have completed about 70% of our client renewals for 2018, and that's roughly in line with where we were at this point last year, and our retention rate currently sits at 97%.","Additionally, I reminded you on our last call that our agreements to provide both retail and mail-order pharmacy services to FEP's more than 5.4 million members runs through 2018. And today, I'm happy to report that we extended those agreements for another year and will continue to provide retail and mail service for FEP members through 2019.","The selling season isn't complete, but our integrated products and services continue to resonate strongly with clients and prospective clients alike, and we continue to maintain our pricing discipline in the marketplace.","Last week we announced our 2018 formulary strategy, building on our formulary management success of the past six years. Effective January 1, we plan to remove 17 products from our standard control formulary across 10 drug classes while adding back 17 products that had been removed in previous years. We remove drugs only when clinically appropriate lower-cost alternatives are available and our targeted approach ensures minimum member disruption. For 2018, we estimate that 99.76% of members will be able to stay on their current therapy. And of course, our proactive member and prescriber communications strategy helps members transition to clinically appropriate medications, which minimizes disruption.","Let me also note that we are in the process of finalizing changes for the autoimmune and hepatitis C categories, which will be communicated in mid-September. The autoimmune class is a trend driver for our commercial clients, due primarily to utilization and price, and new entrants are expected in the hep C class soon. There will be more to say on that next month.","Since introducing our industry-leading formulary management approach six years ago, through 2018 we expect to deliver $13.4 billion in cumulative savings for our PBM clients through the inclusion of lower-cost brands and encouraging the transition to generics. I would note that over that same time period, we seen our generic dispensing rate rise by more than 10 percentage points. You can find an overview of our strategy along with our 2018 formulary details in our latest Insights commentary, which is available through the Investor Relations portion of our website.","In addition to our formulary management strategies, we also introduced our new Transform Value program, which is designed to offer incremental benefit based on specific outcomes in key trend categories. Outcomes-based management aligns reimbursement for a drug to achievement of a predefined outcome. For example, in obesity, the manufacturer would be required to provide additional value if members do not achieve a minimum level of weight reduction within the initial assessment period. This program will launch with Transform Value programs in the oncology, obesity, and respiratory categories. And these join our Transform Diabetes Care program, which was introduced earlier this year. This program targets support for actions that can help influence measures such as A1c levels, improving outcomes, and reducing costs.","Now turning to SilverScript, our Med D PDP, we currently have 4.5 million captive lives in our individual PDP, 1 million captive EGWP [Employer Group Waiver Plan] lives, and we serve another 6.9 million lives through our health plan clients. So in total, Caremark currently serves 12.4 million Med D beneficiaries. Last week we received the preliminary benchmark results from CMS for 2018, and we're pleased to report that SilverScript is below the benchmark in 32 of the 34 regions. These strong benchmark results enable us to retain all of the auto-assignees we currently serve, and importantly qualify us to receive new auto-assignees in all 32 regions, which is an improvement over prior years, as none of the regions are in de minimis status, so we're very pleased with these results.","Before turning to retail, let me touch briefly on Specialty. As you know, the industry continues to see a year-over-year decline in hepatitis C script volume due to lower new patient starts along with fewer days of therapy. And overall, the rate of specialty revenue growth across the industry has slowed. However, CVS Specialty's growth continues to outpace the market, seeing strong growth in the open market while securing significant wins in the standalone specialty market. In the second quarter, Specialty revenues increased a solid 11.5%.","Moving on to Q2 results, in the Retail\/Long-Term Care business, total same-store sales decreased 2.6%, slightly better than expectations, with Pharmacy same-store sales down 2.8%. Pharmacy sales comps were negatively impacted by approximately 410 basis points due to recent generic introductions. Same-store prescription volumes were flat. That's on a 30-day equivalent basis. And as expected, the decision to restrict CVS from participating in the TRICARE network and many fully insured prime networks negatively impacted Pharmacy sales and script comps.","The network changes had about a 460 basis point negative impact on volumes, and that's consistent with the impact that we saw in Q1. And adjusting for those network changes, same-store prescription volumes would have been up 4.6% in the quarter on a 30-day equivalent basis, a sequential improvement from Q1 after accounting for the absence of leap day this year.","Now as we look to return to healthy growth, we continue to be very focused on partnering with all payers to drive volumes and capture share, and these conversations have already yielded excellent results. Our partnership with Optum to provide a 90-day retail solution to their ASO clients and members launched last month. We've already seen some uptake from clients, and the pipeline of additional opportunity in the coming years is promising.","Additionally, in June, we announced a collaboration called Cigna HealthWorks that aligns Cigna-administered health benefits with CVS Pharmacy and MinuteClinic. It leverages the CVS footprint, including the use of the CVS 90-day network, in addition to Health Tag messaging, the ExtraCare Health card, and discounts at MinuteClinic for select preventive and acute care. And we see a strong pipeline of opportunity in this program.","And lastly, we will be the anchor for a retail network option for Express Scripts' Diabetes Care Value program, a performance-based program focused on meeting certain medication adherence thresholds. And we continue to talk with other PBMs and health plans, offering a menu of services to partner more broadly leveraging CVS Pharmacy's compelling value proposition along with our enterprise capabilities, which also include infusion and long-term care.","Now before moving to the front store, let me touch on our Long-Term Care business. As you know, there was a bit of news in the space last week with PharMerica agreeing to be acquired by KKR and Walgreens. And in a lot of ways, their agreement is a confirmation of both the growth potential for long-term care and post-acute services as well as the additional value that our retail pharmacy can bring to this market.","Omnicare remains the leader in the market, and this potential acquisition does nothing to change that. We've invested the time and capital over the past two years to get the right technology and processes in place in order to differentiate our offering to make it more compelling for our clients as well as the residents at these facilities. It's been a slower process than we expected due to technology enhancements that needed to be built along with certain dynamics in the skilled nursing space. However, we remain optimistic in this market and our ability to grow the Omnicare business.","Turning to the front store, comps decreased 2.1%, including a positive impact of 75 basis points related to the shift of Easter into the second quarter. In addition, the decline in front store comps reflects a number of factors, including our decision to rationalize our promotional strategies, scaling back on mass promotions, and reducing our circular page count. Softer customer traffic was partially offset by the continued increase in the average front store customer ticket. And when adjusting for the Easter shift as well the leap day impact in Q1, front store comps improved sequentially from Q1 to Q2.","Our personalization and promotional strategies have been successfully contributing to growth in front store profitability. Front store gross margin once again improved nicely in the quarter versus last year, as did front store gross profit dollars despite the decline in front store comps. We remain focused on growing our Beauty, Health Care and Personal Care businesses, and continue to enhance our digital presence to increase engagement with our Health and Beauty shoppers.","We have integrated digital manufacturer coupons into our app, providing customers a new and easy way to save money in our stores. We also implemented new technology that is making our digital communications even more relevant by automating the selection of products, offers, and messages, leveraging advanced analytics and ExtraCare.","Store brands also remain an area of both strength and opportunity, and our store brands represented 22.6% of front store sales in the quarter. That's up about 80 basis points from a year ago. And we've been growing and gaining penetration in Health Care, Beauty, Personal Care, and Edibles by focusing on providing high-quality value alternatives and through innovation that improves the customers' experience.","Before turning to the financials, let me touch briefly on MinuteClinic, which posted revenue growth in the quarter of 8%. Since its inception, MinuteClinic providers have now conducted 37 million patient visits. Recently, MinuteClinic joined the Alere eScreen Occupational Health Network. And through this new collaboration, employees of businesses that utilize Alere can visit MinuteClinic for a number of services commonly required, such as biometric screenings, vaccinations, Department of Transportation physicals, and drug testing. We look forward to helping improve the accessibility of these workplace testing services.","With that, let me turn it over to Dave for the financial review","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Thank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. Today I'll provide a detailed review of second-quarter results, followed by an update on our guidance. I'll start first with a summary of how we continue to enhance shareholder value through our capital allocation program.","During the second quarter, we paid $512 million in dividends. Our 12-month trailing dividend payout ratio currently stands at 36.6%. Let me remind you again that this ratio is artificially high, as it includes some expenses that are more temporary in nature, as described in our non-GAAP reconciliations on our website. On a comparable basis, we remain well on track to achieve our targeted payout ratio of 35% by the end of 2018.","In addition, we have continued to repurchase shares. As we discussed in the first quarter earnings call, in April we completed the previously announced accelerated share repurchase programs. We received approximately 10 million shares at the close of those programs. We repurchased an additional 4.3 million shares during the quarter, bringing the total repurchased in the second quarter to 14.3 million shares. Year to date we've repurchased 50.4 million shares for approximately $4 billion or $78.67 per share. So between dividends and share repurchases, we've returned approximately $852 million to shareholders during the quarter and nearly $5 billion year to date. We continue to expect to return more than $7 billion to our shareholders in 2017 through both a combination of dividends and share repurchases.","As Larry mentioned, we generated approximately $1.6 billion of free cash in the second quarter, and we have produced more than $4.6 billion year to date. Free cash flow in the quarter benefited from the timing of PBM cash receipts and payable, due in part to the early receipt of a Medicare Part D payment that shifted into Q2 due to the timing of month end. For the full year, we continue to expect to produce free cash flow of between $6 billion and $6.4 billion.","Now turning to the income statement, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.33 per share, at the high end of our guidance range and up 0.8% over LY, or $0.01. These results were on a comparable basis, and the reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted earnings per share can be found in the press release as well as on the Investor Relations portion of our website.","As Larry noted, the Retail\/Long-Term Care segment delivered results within our expectations, while the PBM segment posted profit growth above the higher end of our expectations, primarily driven by timing factors related to purchasing economics.","GAAP diluted EPS was $1.07 per share. This is $0.08 below the low end of our guidance range, primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge associated with our RxCrossroads business that was recorded during the quarter.","You may recall that we bought RxCrossroads a couple of years ago as part of the Omnicare acquisition. It administers programs that provide patients with assistance in obtaining high-cost drugs, working directly with manufacturers to do this. And this has not been a material contributor to our results. Additionally, it also acts as a third-party logistics provider for plasma cold chain management services.","It's a really small piece of our business, and we've continued to work to ensure that the patient assistance programs are completely aligned with our focus on driving down costs for our clients. However, that work has resulted in us walking away from some business that was potentially inconsistent with our enterprise goals.","So we've made the decision to pursue strategic alternatives for the RxCrossroads business. In connection with this decision, in the second quarter we performed an interim goodwill impairment test that resulted in the fair value of RxCrossroads being lower than its net book value. As a result, we recorded $135 million in non-cash goodwill impairment charge within the operating expenses for the Retail\/Long-Term Care segment. You can find further details on this in our Form 10-Q.","So with that, let me provide more detail on our quarterly results as I quickly walk down the P&L. On a consolidated basis, revenues in the second quarter increased 4.5% to $45.7 billion. In the PBM segment, net revenues increased 9.5% to $32.3 billion, within our expectations. This growth is largely due to the increased volume of pharmacy network claims resulting from the successful selling season we had last year as well as brand inflation and solid specialty pharmacy growth. This was partially offset by a 130 basis point increase in our generic dispensing rate to 87.2%. Overall, PBM adjusted claims grew 9.5% in the quarter.","In our Retail\/Long-Term Care business, revenues were approximately $19.6 billion in the quarter, decreasing 2.2% year over year, slightly better than our expectations. This decline was driven by continued reimbursement pressure, which was magnified by flat script comps caused by the network changes we've been discussing. During the quarter, GDR increased by approximately 150 basis points to 87.6%.","We also saw a decline in front store revenues due to softer customer traffic and our promotional decisions, which was partially offset by an increase in basket size. As Larry mentioned, front store same-store sales comps decreased 2.1% and were positively affected by approximately 75 basis points from the shift of the Easter holiday into the second quarter of this year.","Turning to gross margin, operating expenses, operating profit, and the tax rates, the numbers that I'll cite reflect non-GAAP adjustments in both the current and prior periods where applicable, which we have reconciled on our website. Keep in mind that our guidance for the second quarter reflected these items.","The consolidated company's gross margin was 15.2% in the quarter, a contraction of approximately 85 basis points compared to Q2 of 2016. This contraction was mainly driven by a mix shift, as the lower margin PBM business is growing faster than the Retail\/Long-Term Care segment. Gross profit dollars for the company decreased 1.2% versus the same quarter of last year, primarily due to a loss of scripts in the Retail segment.","Within the PBM, gross margin contracted by approximately 10 basis points versus Q2 of 2016 to 4.5%. The decline in gross margin was primarily due to continued price compression and changes in the mix of business, partially offset by favorable generic dispensing. However, gross profit dollars in the PBM increased 7.4% year over year, driven by strong claims growth and favorable purchasing economics as well as improvements in GDR. Of course, partially offsetting these drivers was continued price compression.","In our Retail\/Long-Term Care segment, gross margin declined approximately 20 basis points to 29%. The decline in gross margin rate was primarily driven by lower reimbursement rates that continue to pressure pharmacy margins. Partially offsetting those pressures were an increase in generic dispensing rate as well as increased front store margin that Larry spoke about earlier.","Gross profit dollars decreased 2.8% year over year in the Retail segment, mainly due to the loss of scripts from the network changes as well as continued reimbursement pressures.","Consolidated operating expense as a percent of revenues improved approximately 25 basis points to 10.2% compared to Q2 of 2016. The PBM segment's SG&A rate improved about 10 basis points to 1%, benefiting mainly from additional sales leverage related to volume increases. SG&A as a percent of sales in the Retail\/Long-Term Care segment worsened by about 80 basis points to 21.1%, as we delevered due to the loss of prescriptions related to the restricted networks.","Additionally, a portion of the increase in operating expense dollars year over year relates to investments we are making in process improvements and technology enhancements as part of our enterprise streamlining initiative. During the quarter, we continued to work on new tools and processes designed to improve labor productivity across our enterprise pharmacy operations, among many other projects. Recall that we expect cost to outweigh savings this year but that savings should ramp up as we move throughout the year.","Within the corporate segment, expenses were up approximately $20 million to $240 million due to an increase in benefit costs and the investments in strategic initiatives. Consistent with our expectations, operating margin for the total enterprise decreased approximately 60 basis points in the quarter to 5%. Operating margin in the PBM remained relatively flat at 3.5%, while operating margin at retail declined approximately 95 basis points to 8% on an adjusted basis.","For the quarter, operating profit growth in the segments and at the enterprise level was in line with or better than expectations. The PBM exceeded our expectations, with operating profit growth of 9.1%. Operating profit in the Retail\/Long-Term Care segment declined to 12.7%, in line with our expectations. And the consolidated operating profit declined 7%, also in line with expectations.","Going below the line on the consolidated income statement, net interest expense in the quarter decreased approximately $33 million from LY to $247 million, due primarily to pay down debt in the fourth quarter of 2016 and a lower average interest rate on the debt that remains outstanding.","Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 38.4%, which was higher than expected. This was driven by a delta between our estimates of the discrete tax benefit we've seen from adopting the new share-based accounting standard and what we've actually experienced during the quarter. As previously discussed at Analyst Day and in prior earnings calls, the amended accounting guidance seems likely to result in increased tax rate volatility because of changes in both share price and behavior of employees that can exercise best adoptions. This required change in accounting treatment will continue to impact the tax rate going forward, which will fluctuate based on these factors.","Our weighted average share count was just over 1 billion shares, reflecting the receipt of shares from the ASR that was completed in April and some additional repurchases made throughout the quarter.","So with that, now let me update you on our guidance. I'll focus on the highlights here, but you can find additional details of our guidance in the slide presentation that we posted on our website earlier this morning.","As Larry said, we are narrowing and raising the midpoint of our 2017 adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $5.83 to $5.93, from a range of $5.77 to $5.93, reflecting the year-over-year change of down 0.25% to up 1.5%. This raises the midpoint by $0.03, reflecting our performance to date as well as our expectations for the second half.","With respect to GAAP diluted EPS, in addition to narrowing the range, we're revising our full-year guidance to also reflect a few additional items. One obviously is the goodwill impairment charge of $135 million pre-tax related to RxCrossroads, which I discussed earlier. The others total $25 million pre-tax, and mainly relate to additional costs associated with the loss on the defined benefit pension plan settlement expected in the third quarter.","So with that, we now expect the GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.92 to $5.02 per share. You can find a reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted EPS in our press release and on the Investor Relations portion of our website.","With half the year now behind us, we are updating our revenue and operating profit guidance. In the PBM segment, we are narrowing revenue guidance to a range of 8% to 9%, leaving the midpoint unchanged. We are also increasing our estimate of adjusted claims to a range of 1.78 billion to 1.8 billion claims. This takes into account the solid performance the PBM has delivered thus far and reflects our confidence in our adjusted claims volume for the remainder of the year.","In the Retail\/Long-Term Care segment, we are narrowing and revising guidance for revenue. This mainly reflects continued reimbursement pressure and expected softness in script volume. We now expect Retail\/Long-Term Care revenue to decline 2.75% to 3.5%, and total comps to decline 3.5% to 4.25%, and script comps of down 0.75% to up 0.25%. As a result of all these changes, we narrowed our consolidated net revenue growth to 3% to 4%.","Now turning to operating profit, we are narrowing the PBM operating profit get range by lowering the top end 150 basis points to account for slightly slower growth in Specialty than planned, mainly due to the slowdown in hep C. This results in a new operating profit growth range of 5.75% to 7.25%.","We are narrowing and lowering the guidance range for the Retail\/Long-Term Care segment to reflect slightly lower volumes. So we now expect Retail\/Long-Term Care operating profit to decline 8.75% to 10%. We narrowed the consolidated operating profit range by 75 basis points to reflect the changes in PBM and the retail segments as well as increased investments related to our streamlining effort that will help us achieve our long-term goals.","We now expect operating profit to increase 4.25% to 5.75%. This reduction in the high end of the operating profit guidance range is mostly offset by an improved outlook in our effective tax rate and a lower weighted average share count for the full year of 2017, thus enabling us to maintain the top end of our previous adjusted earnings per share guidance.","Now let me touch upon the earnings pattern for the third and the fourth quarters. Starting back at Analyst Day, we highlighted several timing factors that would impact our cadence of earnings for this year. One of those drivers was the timing of profitability in our Medicare Part D business. As we've seen in years past, the timing of Medicare Part D profits in the third quarter remains difficult to forecast, since this is the time period where the risk-sharing corridor is usually least effective at providing risk-sharing protection. Thus, changes in any current estimates, such as utilization, significantly impacts the timing of profits between the third and fourth quarters. This forecasting challenge is compounded by the growth in this part of our business. We've made our best estimates and included those estimates in our guidance.","This year, we expect the timing of Med D profitability to shift to the fourth quarter. This is in contrast to 2016, when we experienced members moving through the risk corridor more quickly, which led to higher profitability in the third quarter. This year-over-year swing in timing of profitability is not impacting the outlook for the year. It is simply a shift of earnings from the third to the fourth quarter. We used our best estimates to provide Q3 guidance, but the cadence between Q3 and Q4 does have the potential to change because it's based on how members move through their benefits.","In addition to the timing of Med D profitability, we continue to expect the benefit from our enterprise streamlining initiatives to be greater in the back half of the year than they have been year to date.","Turning specifically to the third quarter, which includes certain non-GAAP items described in the slides, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.47 to $1.50 per share, reflecting a decrease of 8% to 10.5% versus Q3 of 2016. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.20 to $1.23 in the third quarter, which includes an estimated $220 million loss on the settlement of the defined benefit pension plan discussed previously at our 2016 Analyst Day.","Within the Retail\/Long-Term Care segment, we expect revenues to decrease 3.25% to 5% versus the third quarter of last year, driven in large part by the network changes discussed previously. Adjusted script comps are expected to be down 0.75% to up 0.25%, and total same-store sales are expected to decrease 4% to 5.75%. In the PBM business, we expect third quarter revenue growth of 8.5% to 9.75%, driven by continued strong growth in volumes in specialty pharmacy.","Consolidated net revenues are expected to grow 2.75% to 4.25%. We expect consolidated operating profit to decline 11% to 13.5% in the third quarter. Retail\/Long-Term Care operating profit is expected to decrease 11% to 13.5%. Additionally, we expect PBM operating profit to decrease 5.5% to 7.5%, but you do need to be mindful of the shift in Medicare Part D profits, as I just outlined. If the Medicare Part D PDP were excluded from all periods, PBM year-over-year growth in Q3 and Q4 would be more in line with the growth that we saw in Q2 of this year.","In closing, we remain very confident in our full-year forecast and our ability to return to sustainable healthy earnings growth over the longer term, and we continue to demonstrate our ability to generate substantial free cash flow. We remain committed to using the cash to drive returns for our shareholders through value-enhancing investments, dividends, and share repurchases.","And so with that, let me turn it back over to Larry Merlo.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Thanks, Dave.","Before moving into the Q&A, I did want to share our approach and actions in dealing with the rhetoric around the drug pricing debate. We have been and continue to be a very active voice in Washington with regard to healthcare issues. In fact, at the beginning of this Congress, we outlined a series of proactive proposals to lower drug costs. And these proposals focus on increasing competition in the drug market, strengthening the ability to use our drug management tools, and easing out-of-pocket costs for consumers, and we have seen action on a number of fronts.","Foremost, the new FDA Commissioner has embraced proposals to prioritize the review of generic drug applications, launching a Drug Competition Action Plan. And as part of this plan, the agency has published a list of more than 260 off-patent branded drugs without approved generics in order to encourage the development of ANDAs in markets without competition.","Additionally, the FDA now will expedite the review of generic drug applications until there are three approved generics for a given product, recognizing that patients do see significant price reductions when there are multiple generics available. And we're already seeing results, as May and June of this year have seen the most generic drug approvals since the FDA began tallying its monthly approvals.","We're also engaged with the administration at all levels, and our discussions have increased the understanding of the value of the PBM, are highlighting the significant savings being generated in Medicare Part D, and are providing solutions for consumers to better afford the drugs they purchase at our pharmacy counters.","And there's still more that can be done. We're piloting the use of technology to provide drug pricing information to both the patient and the prescriber at the point of prescription. This dramatically changes the conversation with policymakers, several of whom have expressed great interest in these capabilities. And ultimately, we believe continuing to demonstrate the role that CVS Health plays in making healthcare more affordable, more accessible, and more effective will be the winning strategy.","So with that, let's go ahead and open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, guys. I appreciate it. I had one shorter-term question regarding the guidance and then one longer-term question. So the guidance is, to summarize, it looks like the operating profit for the enterprise is coming down a little bit. That's specialty and maybe some more investments in retail.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","That's correct.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","And then bridge me to the better performance. Is it just tax rate and the share buybacks? That's how you get to the move up in the range?","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","That's correct. There's a little bit of softness due to volume in retail and a little bit of softness due to specialty at the operating profit line and some investments that we're making to drive the long term. But all of that's being mainly offset through both tax rate and our performance from the share repurchase program.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, perfect. And then this is a broader question. I'm sure it's going to come up in the call, so I might as well ask it because I cover Amazon. Amazon has been rumored to be entering, or may enter. I know it came up on the Express Scripts call. How do you guys view that, especially on the retail side of the business? And what would prevent them from taking share if they decided to enter?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Scott, listen. It's Larry. I think as you've heard many talk about, there are many barriers to entry when you're looking at pharmacy. And I think most people are thinking about pharmacy as another distribution point. But pharmacy is also about the clinical outcomes that are provided. And in an environment where there's a migration to more value-based care, those clinical capabilities are going to continue to grow in importance. It's highly regulated, so the barriers to entry are high.","And you know the role that \u2013 today you've got more than 90% of prescriptions that are covered by some type of third-party insurance, so there's an awful lot of work that exists between pharmacists working with payers and physicians to provide that care. And we know the role that pharmacists play in the community. We've seen mail-order pharmacy decline to some degree over the last couple years, and patients put a lot of value in the trust and the relationship that they have with their community with their retail pharmacist. So I don't think there's anything that is in the near-term world that changes those dynamics.","I think as you flip over and think about the front store, listen, there are many more online retailers today than what we had five years ago. And the CVS Pharmacy model is built on convenience, when you think about 9,700 points of access and the fact that you've got almost 80% of the U.S. population that lives within a few miles of a CVS. And over the last couple years we've been working hard to define what omni-channel means for us and means for those customers, and have been investing in our digital tools and capabilities to provide more of an omni-channel experience.","So listen, there's no question that Amazon is a competitor in the marketplace. They've done a great job, and you don't take anything that they're doing for granted. But at the same time, I think that we have a lot of capabilities and a value proposition that can compete effectively in the market.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","All right, perfect. I'll yield. Thanks, guys.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","All right. Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thanks very much and good morning. Larry, you talked about the relationships with Cigna, Optum, and Express Scripts. Can you maybe just give us any updated thoughts around the number of prescriptions you think this could drive over time?","And then secondly, any updates on Medicare Part D network relationships, any thoughts around participating in preferred networks as we think about 2018?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Lisa, the relationships, the things that we talked about in the prepared remarks, I think those products are out being sold in the marketplace as we speak. We don't expect it to have any material impact in 2017, and we hope to see it begin to ramp up in 2018 and beyond because we think that there is a robust pipeline. At the same time, I think we've learned from our experience between Caremark and our health plan clients the challenges that exist in terms of selling those products in the marketplace, so it will take some time.","In terms of Med D. I think you've seen some announcements that this is work in progress. We'll have more to say on this at the end of the year, but CVS Pharmacy will be preferred in Aetna's Medicare Part D network beginning in 2018. So I think that there's progress being made as we continue to evaluate those opportunities.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then my follow-up just would be on the generic comments that you made, obviously, more generics coming to the market, generally viewed as a positive as we think about the PBM and drug retail. Is there a certain point where the pricing is so low that you can't capture the same amount of margin opportunity, or is lower pricing and competition around generic procurement always a positive for your book of business?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Lisa, I would say at this point and for the foreseeable future, we view it as a positive for our business. And it would be interesting if we can ever find a point where that hypothesis that you mentioned would \u2013 we've got a long way to go before we get to that point. Maybe that's the right way to say it.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Thanks, Lisa.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Larry, on the Transform Value program. I know it's early, but what learnings have you had from the diabetes portion of this as you look at rolling out the next three \u2013 maybe enhance those three? And then when you think about using this to get closer to your health plan and other PBM partners, have you been able to \u2013 is there a way to dimensionalize that possible impact, or you know it's positive but it's very difficult this early to figure out what that might mean for share?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","John, I'll start and then I think Jon will want to jump in here. John, the learnings that we've got from the Transform Diabetes Care, I would say it's largely come from the pilot program. And I think what we found is that \u2013 keep in mind that there are two parts to this program. There's the client part in terms of which we're telling them that we can control their costs in a differentiated way, recognizing that diabetes has been a contributor to trends over the last couple years. And for the patient, we're working with them in terms of providing more effective care and a better health outcome by monitoring their blood glucose in real time and avoiding unnecessary visits to the physician or to the emergency room.","So the pilot program demonstrated for us that we can improve the patient outcome and reduce costs for the client. That's what we're out there selling right now, and there has been a high level of interest. But again, those programs are being sold in the marketplace, so we'll have more to say on that later this year or early next year in terms of the traction that it's getting.","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","And, John, this is Jon. We've been talking for many years about the value of adherence and lowering overall healthcare costs. And I think this diabetes program, which is our clients' top priority when they look at their population and what's driving their overall healthcare costs. So it really is positioning us as a partner to not only provide pharmacy services but also to help manage the overall healthcare costs for those clients.","And so the response has been very positive. People are interested in solutions. There have been solutions in the marketplace, but they are point solutions, so they can now come to us and get a comprehensive program and we can talk about not only their pharmacy costs but their medical costs. And we expect to roll Transform Care programs out for four additional disease states over the next 24 months, and that will be asthma, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and depression. And we tell our clients that these members have to be in one of our channels to get the value of these programs. So I do think there is share shift. There will be share shift that comes as clients adopt these programs and we demonstrate our ability to lower overall healthcare costs.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","And then maybe as a follow-up for Larry, if you think about the reimbursement pressure you and everybody else is seeing and what that has to be doing to those with subscale business models, what happens to share over time? And do you think \u2013 by definition does there have to be some moderation in reimbursement pressure, either as a means to not prevent some of these other channels from leading the market or maybe we get there because share consolidates too much? What's the prognosis there?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","John, I think the question that we've talked about probably every year for the last several is that I wouldn't describe reimbursement pressure as increasing from its historic levels. I think the dynamic that we see, at least this year, is the offsets associated with that reimbursement pressure are more challenging than what may have existed in prior years. And you would expect there are going to be ebbs and flows to that, whether it's the contribution that new generics can make to the market or other dynamics underway.","You've heard us talk, John, about the migration to \u2013 and we're talking about value-based networks. And I do think that dynamic will change the construct of networks because now pharmacy networks will not be simply defined by location and price, they'll be defined by clinical capabilities and outcomes. And I think that will create a different dynamic than what exists today in terms of who can participate and who can't when you look at clinical capabilities.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay, thank you.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Thanks, John.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning. Larry, in your prepared remarks about the selling season, you talked about some wins in the government segment. So can you just help us think about how the mix of the new business with the profitability associated with it, and how should we think about that compared to last year?","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Ricky, this is Dave. As typical in the PBM space, profitability within a new client is pretty thin in the first years. And I would say that as we look forward to profitability in these contracts next year versus this year, I'd say more or less on a comparable basis consistent with year over year.","I do think one of our challenges and that we work hard on is once we onboard a client is making sure that we work to improve their performance, drive value for them and drive value for us, whether that's shifting to new generics, whether that's improving clinical outcomes, whether it's moving into some value arrangements. And that's the program that we constantly run, and that is something that our organization and our teams are consistently focused on.","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","Ricky, this is Jon. The only other thing I would add is about half our wins are in the government space, and they probably perform more like health plans because they're limited in the programs they can adopt. So I would probably think of it along those lines.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, that's very helpful. And the other half, is it commercial?","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","The other half, Ricky, think of it as being split between health plan and employer.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, and then just a question around capital deployment. When you provided us the long-term guidance growth of 10%, it included capital deployment, so two questions there. One, how do you think about capital deployment? I know that Pfizer last week said that they are holding back on M&A until they have more clarity around tax reform. Is that something that you're thinking about as well? And my second question is when we think \u2013 this might be a little bit early for that. But when we think about \u2013 how should we think about 2018 within the context of that long-term 10%?","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Ricky, it's probably a little too early to talk specifically about 2018. As you know, we're targeting 10% adjusted earnings per share growth over time. We said that some years will be better than that. Some years will be light to that. We're obviously working hard to get ourselves back to a growth platform here.","From a tax reform perspective, we are encouraged by the progress and the discussions that are occurring around tax reform. We are not waiting on tax reform to make investments in our business. I think at a nearly 40% tax rate all-in from both federal and state, we're more likely than not to be a beneficiary of tax reform. So therefore, it will enhance our performance over time. So we're not going to wait for that to come through legislatively. We're going to work towards making investments in our business that make the most sense long term.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And any thoughts about areas of M&A and the scale that you would be considering?","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Ricky, we've probably not much comment there. We obviously continue to look at the healthcare space pretty holistically. I think our platform from a pharmacy care management perspective is pretty robust. I do think there are still areas that we can continue to invest on that platform and continue to add value to both our shareholders and to the clients and members that we serve, but I can't probably give you any more specifics at this point.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny with UBS. Please go ahead.","Michael Cherny - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning, guys. Thinking about the updated guidance and particularly on the retail side and the script growth, can you maybe give a sense, especially since you talked about the lighter script growth being some of the driver for the reduced EBIT guidance? Are the numbers you had expected at the beginning of the year or late last year when you first gave guidance relative to the initial 40 million or so scripts tracking in line with what you had expected?","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","I think materially, they're fairly consistent with what we expected, so no big changes there. I think as you've seen, our script delivery for the first half of the year within the Retail\/Long-Term Care segment has been pretty consistent with expectations. We are seeing a little softness from a market perspective, so our go-forward guidance reflects that. I would also say that just from a Long-Term Care perspective, we're seeing bed census lower, so that obviously had some effect on script delivery in that portion of our business.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","And mostly, Mike, within the skilled nursing space.","Michael Cherny - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks, that's helpful, and then just one quick follow-up on Part D. As you think about the evolution of the competitive dynamics in the market, and SilverScript obviously has been a leader for a while, have you seen any changes in parallel to what's happening with regards to the repeal-and-replace debate that are impacting Part D and your view of Part D and the competitive dynamics around Part D to the positive or negative?","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Mike, I don't think we've seen much change from that perspective. This continues to be an area where we've excelled in Part D. Our set of services and products are priced very competitively. We've been able to drive a lot of value, and we continue to grow share and membership in this space over the last several years. And I think it's important to note that we're not only growing share within our PDP business. At the same time, the capabilities that we deliver from a PBM perspective are allowing our health plan partners and clients to grow share within their base, so we're participating in both aspects of that business.","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","Mike, if anything, I think the dialogue is probably the reverse; that are there things that exist within the Medicare space that should be applied to Medicaid. And you think about the fact that there is still a large percentage of Medicaid fee-for-service that there are opportunities to reduce costs across the country and in many state Medicaid programs by migrating some of the tools that exist in other spaces.","Michael Cherny - UBS Securities LLC","Excellent, thanks.","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great, thanks for the questions. Dave, you covered a lot of the changes to the outlook, but I wanted to just go back and ask specifically on the retail pharmacy gross margin. It went down in the quarter after showing some improvement last quarter, and you guys obviously maintained modest improvement for the year. So just curious if you could talk a little bit about what changed in 2Q versus 1Q. And then how are you thinking about the improvement or the implied improvement in the retail gross margin in the back half?","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","I think this is largely tied to the timing of break-open generics as we think about the back half of this year. So you would think a little bit about that driving that performance. Also, when you get to the fourth quarter, you start overlapping the restricted network changes as it relates to TRICARE. So that overlap helps, at least from a growth perspective \u2013 maybe not the rate, but it certainly helps from a growth perspective.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay, great. I guess just one quick follow-up on the selling season. Obviously, good news on the FEP retail and mail extension. I'm curious about the thought process behind the one-year extension. If I think back, I believe these contracts were typically longer in duration when they were renewed or reassigned, so just wondering if there was any more background on the extension around FEP.","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","Bob, this is Jon. They had two one-year options to extend the contract. They had exercised one, and this is the exercising of that second one-year option.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","And, Bob, FEP continues to be extremely satisfied with the levels of service that we're providing for their members.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay, got it. That's helpful. Thanks, guys.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Thanks, Bob.","Michael P. McGuire - CVS Health Corp.","Thank you. Next question?","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.","Ann Kathleen Hynes - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Hi, good morning. Can we talk about Omnicare a little bit more? Because if I'm hearing you correctly, I think maybe the softness in guidance for retail is more related to Omnicare than anything else. Is that correct, and maybe just a little bit more detail on what's happening and how you can fix it? Thanks.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Ann, this is Dave. I think the softness from a volume perspective is a little bit of both, both Long-Term Care and we're just seeing some softness in retail more broadly. And by the way, that's just a tweak, that's not a major trend break, so we're just tweaking that guidance expectation around the edges here.","I do think what you see in the skilled nursing facility space, you're seeing length of stay and just that census come down a little bit in the marketplace. And as that has occurred, that affects Omnicare disproportionally greater because it has a fairly sizable share in that space. I will say as we think about new beds and as we think about marketing and offering new services to new clients and new operators, I think our products are resonating in the marketplace. I feel like we're nicely positioned here. We have a little industry headwinds as we cycle in the back half of this year in that business as it relates to volumes.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Ann, the only other thing I would add is that we had talked about some of the technology investments and enhancements that we needed to make in that business, and those have largely been complete. So now it's a question of executing those new capabilities. And in addition to what Dave mentioned, there are opportunities to improve the productivity and efficiency in that business as well.","Ann Kathleen Hynes - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay, great. And then just to focus on the ramp to Q3 to Q4, I think there is some concern historically because it's much bigger, but I'm assuming you're pretty confident on the Medicaid Part D side that it's more a timing issue than anything. And I think you also mentioned there's a second reason why, just maybe some more cost savings. Can you tell us how much of the ramp has to do with cost savings versus the Medicare Part D risk corridors? Thanks.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","This is largely a Medicare Part D PDP topic. There's a little bit of investments we're making in the corridor from a cost perspective, driving initiatives, but this is largely Medicare Part D. And I'll just reiterate a little bit of what I said before. If you took Medicare Part D, our PDP, and you excluded it from all periods this year and last year, our PBM year-over-year growth in Q3 and Q4 would be very much in line with the growth that we saw in Q2.","Ann Kathleen Hynes - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","And, Ann, the other point in terms of getting comfortable with that, keep in mind that Part D has been growing at a pretty significant rate and represents a bigger portion of the PBM business than it would have last year or the year prior.","Ann Kathleen Hynes - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Yes, and one last topic there. Just also, as I said earlier to Bob's comment I believe or question, is when we get to the fourth quarter, we begin to wrap the impact of the TRICARE decision to restrict the network. And that took effect December of last year, but we started feeling the effects of that a little earlier than December.","Ann Kathleen Hynes - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay, very helpful. Thank you.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Thank you.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Thanks, Ann.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thanks. Good morning, Larry and Dave. I'm just curious with Walgreens and Rite Aid now proposing a scaled-down asset purchase instead of a full merger, I'm just curious whether or not that's changed the tone of any narrow network contracts you're going to be negotiating right now. I guess specifically, does their lack of a full-scale merger maybe put CVS in a better light now on a relative basis when negotiating these narrow network deals when you're trying to be the anchor chain? Thanks.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","No. Steve, it's Larry. I don't think that anything has changed with that as a variable. I think that as we talked a fair amount about in our prepared remarks, I think the dialogue around network configuration is about capabilities, and I don't think there's anything associated with Walgreens-Rite Aid that changes that dynamic.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. By the way, thanks for the confirmation on the Aetna Medicare Part D network that we talked about several months ago as well. We look forward to more color on that in the future as well. Thanks.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Great, thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of David Larsen with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Can you provide a little bit more color around your narrow network deals with Cigna, Express, and Optum, like roughly any sense for how many lives are included in each of those deals? And when will those volumes start to impact retail, or have they already? Thanks a lot.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","They certainly have not impacted at this point in time our retail performance. Keep in mind, what we have done, and this is just one I'll say product offering or service offering that we provide to PBMs in the marketplace, the option to sell in services related to CVS Pharmacy. And as they sell them in, we begin to get share. And part of that could be a narrow network. Part of it could be a clinical offering. Part of it could be communications with their members. And so we expect that over time, the success of how they sell those lives into their book of business and then over time we will gain share.","Our experience with health plans is that it takes time for share to come through. We're optimistic about what we see in the marketplace, but we will have to watch carefully and help those members transition into our channel over time. So I'm not prepared at this point in time to give you a definitive number. I do think \u2013 as we look forward for the next several periods, we do think there's an opportunity to grow share into our channel.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. And then just quickly, with the exclusions lists that were recently published, it seems like you had 12 that were added, 12 that were taken off, so net zero incremental exclusions. It's very different from last year, where I think you had a lot more exclusions. Can you talk about that, any reason for what appears to be a less, I guess, aggressive approach to your exclusions list for 2018?","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","This is Jon. We're not any less aggressive than we've ever been. And quite candidly, we've been able to demonstrate that we can move share away from product. So these pharma companies are coming back to the table trying to get back into our formulary and bringing value. That then makes sense for us to add those drugs back in those therapeutic classes. And we've been very conservative about adding drugs back, but we felt like this was a year and there was enough value for our clients to make moves that you saw with our new formulary announcement.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. And then just real quick, any thoughts on your Aetna relationship, how it's progressing? Thanks very much.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","I'm sorry, what about Aetna?","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Just your relationship there?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Listen, our relationship continues to be very good. We talked about where we're going with Med D on the CVS Pharmacy side. Next year we'll be taking on a portion of Aetna's rebating. And as we alluded to earlier, we continue to partner very closely with their sales organization in selling in our unique integrated products, whether it's Maintenance Choice or some of the other products you heard us talk about earlier today. So I think our two organizations are working extremely well together in a cohesive and complementary fashion.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks very much.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Okay. Thanks, Dave. We'll take two more questions.","Operator","Very good, our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about RxCrossroads. You took the impairment charge. But is it fair to think you plan to retain the business itself? And I guess the specific question is within RxCrossroads, their HUB services offering, how important is that to have it still connected to the Specialty Pharmacy business?","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Dave, we're obviously exploring all options with that business. I don't think the HUB connectivity to our Specialty businesses is important to us, so that could be disconnected easily, so we're not focused on that at this point in time.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And then when you talked about the timing on Medicare Part D moving more to the fourth quarter, does that imply anything in terms of the growth rate in the Med Part D business this year versus last year? So if you move through the donut hole earlier, was there faster growth last year in the first half versus this year, or is that just timing when you saw the growth?","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","It has nothing to do with growth. It really has to do with how the members utilize the benefit and when they hit those risk corridors at what stage. So it's not really affecting the year, and our performance in the business is really simply a shift between Q3 to Q4 from a profitability delivery perspective.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, great. And then one last clarification around \u2013 I'm sorry, go ahead.","Michael P. McGuire - CVS Health Corp.","It's all right. Go ahead.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","I just had one more clarification on the FEP contract. You extended it for a year. Are there any more additional extension periods embedded within the contract, or does it go to RFP at some point then in 2019 or 2020? Thanks.","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","This is Jon. The contract runs through 2019, and we expect it to go out to RFP at that point. There are no more extensions left.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Thank you.","Michael P. McGuire - CVS Health Corp.","Last question.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Thanks, guys. So maybe just thinking about, Larry, the comment you made in the press release that you won't be satisfied until the organization is back to healthy earnings growth, help us tick and tie how the year has played out so far, particularly on the operating income line, with some of the tweaks there relative to the long-term plan you talked about at the Analyst Day. It seems like a few pieces out of your control like volumes are maybe a bit lighter. But then on the positive side, you've got some of these network changes rolling off, and you've also got the streamlined piece kicking in, and it seems like you've got some new interesting relationships with a number of managed cares.","So help think us through conceptually in your mind how the business has progressed and your confidence level in getting back to those healthy growth rates that obviously the business was used to more historically.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Ross, this is Dave. I'll start a little bit maybe with some color around this year. I think if you look at our performance year to date, we've largely delivered on the expectations that we set forth at the beginning of this year. I think that the organization continues to focus on driving as much growth as possible. We know this is a rebuilding year, but we've largely been able to through the first half of the year deliver on our top line and our bottom line. I think as we look forward, we made some slight tweaks as we've seen the industry soften a little bit from a volume perspective, but literally tweaks around that.","I think the good thing too is despite the fact that because of those tweaks, we've had a little softness in the operating profit delivery in the back half of the year, our strong cash flow has allowed us to continue to deliver from an adjusted earnings per share a range that hasn't really moved. In fact, it actually increased $0.03 midpoint to midpoint. So I think we feel very good about what we've done. We have a lot of work ahead of us. We're focused on that. So with that, maybe I'll turn it to Larry.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Ross, I think, as Dave outlined the focus in terms of delivering 2017, we're also working in terms of how do we plan and prepare for the future. And I think we feel very good about the quality of the work that's been done in terms of the new relationships on the CVS Pharmacy and related business side, and equally important, the innovation that is coming to market through the PBM. The Transform Care programs and some of the things that we talked about that Jon alluded to in his comments as well, and the work that is being done in terms of allowing us to be an even more efficient and productive provider on the streamlining, that work is on target and is moving in the right trajectory. So we feel very good about the work that's being done that prepares us for the future.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","And I guess just as a quick follow-up, how would you grade, Larry, your responses to some of the challenges last year in terms of how you've addressed them so far and your confidence level in, again, getting this business back on to the trajectory that's normal? Do you think you've, in most of the pivots you've made, done enough essentially to feel like you've got the business back now to where you've actually got some positive momentum, it seems like for share this year withstanding some of the market noise?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Ross, listen. There's no question that there is a high sense of urgency in the organization in terms of delivering on the things that both Dave and I alluded to. So I feel very good in terms of how the organization has responded and has rallied to the charge to work with speed and in focus. So I'm very proud of the work of our CVS Health colleagues, and I don't think we can ask any more of them in terms of the effort and the work they're doing.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Thanks, guys.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Thanks, Ross.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Thank you, Ross.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","So listen, we know this was a long call. We had a lot of information to talk about, and we certainly appreciate everyone's interest and attention. And if there's any follow-up, don't hesitate to call Mike McGuire.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

During the presentation, all participants will be in the listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, May 2, 2018.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike McGuire, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael P. McGuire - CVS Health Corp.","Thank you, Savanna. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I'm here this morning with Larry Merlo, President and CEO; Dave Denton, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jon Roberts, our Chief Operating Officer. Larry and Dave have some prepared remarks to share, after which we'll open it up for the question-and-answer session. During the Q&A, in order to provide more people with a chance to ask their questions, please limit yourself to no more than one question with a quick follow-up","In addition to this call and our press release, we have posted a slide presentation on our website that summarizes the information in our prepared remarks as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance. Our Form 10-Q will be filed later today, and that too will be available in our website once filed.","Additionally, during this call we will make certain forward-looking statements that reflect our current views related to our future financial performance, future events, and industry and market conditions, and forward-looking statements related to the Aetna acquisition, including the expected consumer benefits, financial projections, synergies and the timing for the completion of the transaction. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what maybe indicated in the forward-looking statements.","We strongly encourage you to review the information in the reports we file with the SEC regarding these specific risks and uncertainties, in particular, those that are described in the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and the cautionary statement disclosures in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q. You should also review the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in our earnings press release.","During this call, we will use non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company's performance. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find a discussion of these non-GAAP measures and the comparable GAAP measures in the associated reconciliation document we posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website.","And as always, today's call is being webcast on our website, and it will be archived there following the call for one year.","Now, I'll turn this over to Larry Merlo.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Well, thanks Mike; and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We delivered solid performance in the first quarter in line with our expectations. And while my remarks today will focus more on our past forward, our Q1 results confirm my confidence in the strength of our core model and the foundation it will provide in the CVS-Aetna combination.","So let me begin by providing an update on our proposed Aetna acquisition. There have been three very important work streams that began shortly after the December announcement: the regulatory pathway, integration planning and shareholder approval. And we've already seen success on the last work stream, as we reached a key milestone on March 13, when CVS and Aetna shareholders each voted to approve the transaction with over 95% shareholder approval.","On the regulatory front, we have a highly experienced legal and regulatory team that has made significant progress since the signing. Currently, we're in the process of responding to a second request for information from the Department of Justice, which we received on February 1. The scope of the request was not unexpected and we are working to provide all the information requested by the regulators.","Now, we're also working through the approval process at the state level to secure all the appropriate operating licenses. All of the required Form A filings were submitted to 28 state departments of insurance in January. The states that require hearings are starting to schedule and hold those hearings. In fact, the hearing for the Department of Managed Health Care in California, is taking place later today.","So we're making good progress with the states and have already begun to receive approvals. In fact, I'm pleased to share that the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation, a large and important state for both companies, provided its approval on April 13. So as we previously stated, we expect the transaction to close in the second half of this year and we'll continue to provide updates as we move forward.","Now, turning to integration planning, CVS Health and Aetna have established a formal, tightly organized Integration Management Office reporting to Mark Bertolini and myself, with its efforts led by senior executives from both companies. A steering committee comprised of executive leadership from both companies has been developed to provide guidance and strategic direction to the integration team.","And our goal is twofold. First, to ensure a smooth transition along with laying out the path to the $750 million in expected year two synergies; and second, to create the long-term roadmap for success in growth to be used after the close of the transaction. 22 integration work streams have been organized with representation from both CVS and Aetna to ensure effective knowledge transfer.","And the integration teams are focused on a wide range of objectives from how we'll work together most efficiently, to operational processes, to mapping out how we will capture the opportunities for growth and innovation that are the driving force behind the vision for the combination. And we've made valuable progress on those work streams aligned with the $750 million synergy goal. The synergy components include: procurement, SG&A, process alignment along with medical cost savings using existing assets such as MinuteClinic or home infusion through Coram.","Now, the really exciting part of this transaction is our opportunity to rethink and reinvent health care in our country. And currently, there is a growing recognition of the impact that social determinants have on people's overall health and wellbeing. And after the transaction closes, we will be in a position to address these forces in ways that have never been done through our extensive community presence, along with the broader use of the information and analytics.","And here too we're off to a strong start; and while it is still very early in the process, we begun to identify some populations and intervention tools that will become part of the first programs we will undertake. And while this list will certainly evolve, at the outset, we'll focus on three primary patient populations recognizing that there will be some overlap among these groups.","First, those patients with one of five common chronic diseases: diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, asthma and depression; second, those patients undergoing transitions in care; and the third being a broader focus on managing high-risk patients. We know there are billions of unnecessary and avoidable health care dollars being spent in these areas and we know that we can and must do better.","Now, the initial tools to be developed to address the needs of these groups fall into four major categories: interventions in our stores, activities in the patients' homes, new digital tools and capabilities, with all of this supported by the role of data and advanced analytics.","Importantly, we will also utilize our investments in technology to ensure that all of these activities are fully integrated with local providers. The promise of this combination is to utilize the combined company's unique position as an integral part of the local health care community, to enable consumers to achieve their ideal health potential.","The combination will create an innovative, new health care platform that will be easier to use, less expensive for consumers, and one that integrates broadly within the marketplace to deliver superior, coordinated care.","Additionally, keep in mind that another important asset that results from the CVS and Aetna combination is the cumulative value of our management teams. And the teams are working well together and there is a genuine excitement in fulfilling the vision of the two companies and our commitment to better health. So we'll continue to update you on the progress of our integration activities as we work towards the closing.","And with that, let me turn it over to Dave, to review the quarter.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone. This morning I'll share some financial and business highlights and provide a brief update on our guidance. Unlike past quarters, I won't go through all the details in my prepared remarks, but you could find additional information in the slide presentation that we posted on our website earlier today and also in our SEC filings.","And with that in mind, let me start by touching on our capital allocation program. As a result of the Aetna transaction, we have suspended the share repurchase program and we'll be keeping our dividend flat until we turn to a leverage ratio that is more in line with our credit ratings. In March, we issued multiple tranches of senior notes totaling $40 billion. The tranches are well-lathered with maturities ranging from 2 years to 30 years. We issued the notes ahead of the closing the deal to take advantage of the current interest rate environment, allowing us to secure the debt at a favorable weighted average blended rate of approximately 4.19%.","With the new debt, our pro forma trailing 12-month adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio is expected to be approximately 4.6 times post-closing of the transaction. We are committed to improving this ratio to 3.5 times within two years post-closing of the deal, utilizing our strong cash generation capabilities and the savings from tax reform. Ultimately, our goal is to maintain the company's leverage ratio in the low 3 times level.","Additionally, beginning in the first quarter, we are excluding net interest expense associated with the Aetna-related debt from our non-GAAP metrics. As the transaction with Aetna is still pending approvals, we obviously are not benefiting from Aetna's cash flow and its earnings, but we are already incurring interest cost of the new acquisition-related debt. By adjusting this expense out, we believe we are providing a clearer picture of our underlying performance until the deal closes. Keep in mind that this represents a change to our prior stated approach.","In the first quarter we generated $1.9 billion of free cash, keeping us on track with our free cash expectations for the year. During the quarter, we paid approximately $508 million in dividends and we expect to return more than $2 billion to shareholders through this year through dividends alone.","Now turning to the income statement, adjusted earnings per share was $1.48 per share, an increase of 26.5% over LY. These results are on a comparable basis and the reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted EPS can be found in the press release as well as on the Investor Relations portion of our website. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.98 per share. A lower effective income tax rate and higher prescription volume within the Retail\/Long-Term Care segment drove the increase year-over-year.","In addition, interest in taxes came in slightly better-than-expected for the quarter, contributing about $0.02 to adjusted EPS. Operating profit results for both business segments were within our expectations. On a consolidated basis, revenues in the first quarter increased 2.6% to approximately $45.7 billion, consistent again with our expectations.","Gross profit, operating expenses, operating profit, net interest expense and the tax rate we are providing today reflect non-GAAP adjustments in both current and prior periods where applicable, and have been reconciled again on our website. Our guidance for the first quarter also reflected these adjustments.","Gross margin for the consolidated company was 15%, representing a small improvement over Q1 of 2017 due to segment mix. Total enterprise gross profit dollars increased 4.4%. Total operating expenses dollars grew $219 million in the first quarter, again in line with our expectations. We are continuing to make significant progress in our enterprise streamlining efforts and we are already benefiting from enhancements that we've made.","As an example, CVS Pharmacy and Caremark implemented an improved process to share members' eligibility in real time. Historically, we've seen eligibility-related rejections impact about 6% of Caremark scripts at the pharmacy counter, so the potential customer service improvement and cost savings from this effort is quite large. This project benefits customers at the pharmacy counter, while reducing costs for both CVS Pharmacy and Caremark by reducing member service costs.","To date, we've seen a nearly 70% reduction in Caremark's rejects and have eliminated more than 8 million rejections in the first quarter alone. We're also pursuing this solution with other payers. Across all work streams, we expect to generate approximately $475 million in gross benefits this year, well on our way to generating $700 million or more annually once this work is complete. Operating profit for the total enterprise grew 3.4% in the quarter, while operating margins remained relatively flat year-over-year at 4.5%.","Now going below the line on the consolidated income statement, net interest expense in the quarter decreased approximately $10 million from LY to $242 million, but is consistent with the fourth quarter of 2017. Our effective income tax rate in the quarter was 26.1% and our weighted average share count was just over 1 billion shares.","On the January guidance call, I mentioned that during 2018 we'd be moving to a common financial platform across the enterprise to further our effort to drive more efficient shared services. We made this transition in Q1; and as a result, we have better information to allocate our shared services costs to our operating segments. This change slightly impacts profitability for each segment; however, consolidated operating profit does not change.","To enable you to review segment performance on a comparable basis, we are revising both our 2016 and our 2017 financial statements for this change. The reconciliation of the changes have been posted to the Investor Relations portion of our website, and the figures and growth rates that I'm referring to today are based on a new cost allocation method.","So with that, turning to the PBM segment; net revenues increased 3.2% to $32.2 billion. This growth was driven by net new business, including the additional lives in Medicare Part D as well as continued growth within our specialty pharmacy business. Partially offsetting the sales growth was continued pricing pressures and an increase in our generic dispensing rate. PBM adjusted claims increased 6.4% in the quarter to 468.8 million adjusted claims.","Now looking at the 2019 selling season, our retention rate is currently in line with rates that we've seen in prior years, and we are more than halfway through our 2019 renewals. We expect RFP opportunities in the 2019 season to be less than the opportunities we see in the past few years. However, we do believe that our strong service history and unique suite of capabilities will foster success, with both retaining business and winning new opportunities as they arise.","Gross margin remained relatively flat at 3.5%, while gross profit dollars increased a healthy 5.1%. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily due to increased volume in specialty pharmacy and the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice, partially offset by expenses incurred to support the Anthem implementation as we get ready to administer that contract beginning in 2020. While relatively small in Q1, we expect the spend associated with Anthem to ramp up as the year progresses.","Operating expense dollars increased by approximately $52 million in the first quarter, primarily driven by the reinstatement of the ACA's health insurance tax and the Wellpartner acquisition. As a percent of sales, operating expenses were 1.2%. Operating profit in the PBM was relatively flat year-over-year, while operating margin was consistent at approximately 2.4%, again in line with our expectations.","Now turning to the Retail\/Long-Term Care business, revenues increased 5.6% in the quarter to $20.4 billion. The strong growth was primarily driven by increased script volumes due to the continued adoption of our Patient Care Programs, partnerships with PBMs and health plans across the industry, and our preferred position in a number of Medicare Part D networks this year. Additionally, the Retail business benefited from a strong cough, cold and flu season in Q1.","Revenues were slightly above our expectation. And as demonstrated in our results, our initiatives to expand our partnerships including those with other PBMs and health plans, have progressed well and we continue to see opportunities for 2020 and beyond. We have seen an uptick by a number of both Optum and Cigna clients of many CVS Pharmacy and MinuteClinic programs. Our initiatives are driving growth of adjusted scripts to spend; and as a result, our market shares increased by nearly 140 basis points in the quarter to 24.6%.","Same store sales were slightly above expectations at 5.8%, with adjusted same-store script growth of 8.5% at the high end of our guidance range. The flu season was quite strong during the first quarter; and as a result, we saw seasonal adjusted scripts grow by approximately 4 million year-over-year. Front store same store sales grew 1.6%, possibly affected by the calendar shift of Easter to April 1 this year, which impacted comps by approximately 90 basis points, again, as well as the strong cough and cold season.","Gross margin in the Retail\/Long-Term Care Segment was 29%, down approximately 40 basis points. This contraction was driven by continuing pressure on reimbursement rate. The decline was partially offset by an increase in GDR as well as improvements in the front store margin rate. Gross profit dollars increased 4.1% in the quarter, mainly due to increased scripts and front store volume, as well as improvements in purchasing through Red Oak Sourcing. Operating profit within Retail\/Long-Term Care Segment increased 4.1%, while operating margin declined slightly to 8.4%, again on an adjusted basis.","Within the Corporate Segment, expenses were relatively flat at $224 million. So overall, we're very pleased with our performance to date. The first quarter results underscored the early success we are achieving in our four-point plan to return to healthy growth. Our partnerships are driving script growth, while our streamlining effort is improving enterprise-wide efficiencies. And Larry will have more to highlight on the innovations we're bringing to market.","But with that, let me first provide an update on our outlook for 2018. I'll focus on the highlights here, but you can find additional details in the slide presentation that we posted on our website earlier today. Let me start with a couple of reminders. First, keep in mind that for guidance purposes only we're assuming that the proposed Aetna transaction closes at the end of 2018. By doing so, we are setting no expectations for the results of Aetna's operations in this year. Secondly, all financing fees, interest, transaction and integration costs related to the deal are excluded from our adjusted figures.","Prior today we have not provided an EPS guidance range, given that the uncertainty around the timing of the Aetna debt placement. As the placement occurred in March, we are now able to provide an adjusted EPS estimated range for 2018 of $6.87 to $7.08 per share, representing growth of 16.25% to 20%.","We expect GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations in the range of $5.11 to $5.32 per share. The significant growth in EPS is largely related to the benefit received from tax reform. You can find a reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted EPS in our press release, and again on the Investor Relations portion of our website.","We've increased our top line growth expectations, given stronger prescription growth in the Retail\/Long-Term Care Segment. Consolidated revenue growth is now expected to be 1.25% to 3%, an increase of 50 basis points from our prior guidance range. For the Retail\/Long-Term Care Segment, we now expect both revenue and same store sales growth of 4% to 5.5%, an improvement of 150 basis points and 200 basis points, respectively, versus our previous guidance.","Pharmacy same store scripts are now expected to grow 7.25% to 8.25%, an improvement of 125 basis points. We are seeing a greater benefit from the broader relationships we established last year with payers as well as from our expanded participation as a preferred pharmacy in various Medicare Part D networks. Our expectations for revenue growth in the PBM Segment of 1.5% to 3.5% has not changed, with adjusted claims of approximately 1.9 billion.","Moving to operating profit, we continue to expect full-year 2018 adjusted consolidated operating profit to be down 1.5% to up 1.5%. For the segments, we continue to expect adjusted operating profit growth for the PBM Segment to be in the low- to mid-single digits and operating profit in the Retail\/Long-Term Care Segment to be down low-single digits. Both segments are benefiting from the company's enterprise streamlining efforts.","In the PBM, these benefits are being offset by Anthem implementation costs. In the Retail\/Long-Term Care Segment, the benefits are being offset by lower expectations for our Long-Term Care business, which are primarily due to lower-than-anticipated benefits from our cost improvement effort and our assisted living initiative, as well as headwinds from the financial challenges faced by many LTC facilities.","Recall that Retail operating profit also includes the investment of $275 million of tax savings back into that business. Going below the line, net interest expense on our existing portfolio of debt is expected to be approximately $1 billion, slightly below our previous estimate. We continue to expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 27% for 2018.","Before I move to Q2 guidance, I want to provide some color on the cadence of operating profit growth for the year. Enterprise operating profit growth is now expected to be weighted more to the front half of this year, which differs from what we had indicated previously. There are a few factors that are driving this. First, our investment of $275 million of tax savings back into the business will be invested predominantly in the back half of this year.","Second, the Retail\/Long-Term Care Segment is making better progress on certain pharmacy initiatives during the front half of this year than previously expected. At the same time, Retail has been positively affected by the strong flu season in Q1. Third, as I stated, the Long-Term Care business is experiencing some challenges and its growth rate is lower than previously expected. And finally, the Anthem expenses we expect to incur this year are back half weighted.","Now, let me highlight our Q2 expectations. We expect adjusted EPS in the second quarter to be in the range of $1.59 per share to $1.64 per share in the quarter, reflecting an increase of 19.25% to 23% versus Q2 of 2017. Tax reform will continue to be a major contributor to this increase. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.21 to $1.26 per share. Non-GAAP guidance for the second quarter excludes certain items described in our slides. Consolidated revenue in the second quarter are expected to grow 1.25% to 2%, while consolidated operating profit is expected to be flat to up 3.25%.","Within the Retail\/Long-Term Care Segment, we expect revenue growth in the range of 4.5% to 6% and operating profit growth in the mid- to high-single digits. Total same store sales at Retail are expected to be up 4.75% to 6.25% and adjusted script comps are expected to increase by 7.75% to 9.25%. In the PBM Segment, we expect second quarter revenues to be down 1.25% to up 1.5% and operating profit to be down mid- to high-single digits. The timing of PBM profit delivery is somewhat unique this year for Q2 and is being driven by a few factors.","The year-over-year results are being affected by the investments we are making to support Anthem's implementation as well as the timing of certain client contractual commitments. But despite a weak outlook for profit growth in Q2 in the PBM business, we remain confident in our full-year outlook for that segment. We strongly believe that the investments we are making now set the company up well for the exciting opportunities that lie ahead.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to Larry.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Okay. Thanks, Dave. And before we open it up for Q&A, I do want to spend just a couple minutes talking about our focus on driving growth and highlight some recent innovations and product introductions that are capitalizing on the benefits that are inherent in our unique integrated model.","And with health care costs continuing to rise at a remarkable pace, it's no surprise to anyone that people are looking at the market and asking themselves, what can be done better? It's a question that we challenge ourselves to answer on a daily basis as we think about our model and explore ways in which we can provide greater value to the health care stakeholders that we support across our enterprise.","So with this in mind, we are continuing to innovate to improve the quality and lower the cost of health care for our patients and clients. And if you look over the last couple months, just last month we announced that we're marshaling our enterprise assets to help address an area of significant, unmet clinical need; that being chronic kidney disease. And our approach here is centered on two tenets.","First, that we can use the wealth of data available to our enterprise to predict and support diagnosis earlier in the patients' disease course; and second, absent renal transplantation, home dialysis is potentially the best alternative for many patients. Earlier identification of patients allows for better symptom management, potentially delaying the need for dialysis; and dialysis in the convenience of the patients' home has the potential to provide a better patient experience, better health outcomes, and reduce total medical costs.","Just as background, about 90% of patients in the U.S. are treated with hemodialysis, three days a week for three to four hours at dedicated centers. However, most nephrologists would choose home dialysis for themselves, because it's logistically the only way to deliver more frequent and longer dialysis. And this is the intervention; longer, more frequent therapy that has been reported to improve outcomes in appropriate dialysis patients. And this program is an example of CVS Health pushing the boundaries of innovation in our sector.","And to bring this vision to market, we will need to execute a clinical trial to generate the safety and efficacy data to obtain FDA clearance to market a new home hemodialysis device. So we're currently planning to begin this trial late this summer. We anticipate an 18 to 24-month timeframe for the completion of the trial, submission of the data and FDA review before we can come to market.","Also last month, we released our latest Drug Trend Report. And for 2017, our PBM strategies reduced drug trend for commercial clients to its lowest level in five years at 1.9%, with drug price growth at 0.2% despite manufacturer price increases of nearly 10%. In fact, 42% of our payer clients spent less on their pharmacy benefit plan in 2017 than they had in the prior year. And just as important as saving clients' money, we also help members save money and lower out-of-pocket costs. This past year nearly 9 out of 10 members spent less than $300 out-of-pocket and monthly cost per member declined to $11.89.","Now, keeping drugs affordable also help to improve adherence. We increased the number of optimally-adherent members in key categories like diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidemia by as much as 1.8 percentage points. And although we're proud of these results, we know that for some patients prescription drugs are still unaffordable. And to help solve this problem, we launched the Saving Patients Money program; the industry's most comprehensive approach to helping make needed medications more affordable. And this approach provides what we're referring to as actionable transparency across all points of care, from the point of prescribing with the physician to the pharmacy and directly to members.","At the doctor's office, we're providing real-time patient benefit information that enables prescribers to see the member-specific out-of-pocket costs of a prescribed medication as well as the costs of clinically appropriate therapeutic alternatives based on that patient specific plan design. This capability is built into the prescribers' EHR system and that allows the prescribers to offer members medication options that may be more affordable.","At the pharmacy counter, the new CVS Pharmacy Rx Savings Finder enables our retail pharmacists, for the first time, to quickly and seamlessly evaluate individual prescription savings opportunities to determine the best way for patients to save money on out-of-pocket costs, with the primary goal of helping the patient find the lowest cost alternative under their pharmacy benefits plan. And through the PBM, we're continuing to make solutions available to help further drive down drug trend for our PBM clients and their members. For instance, our Point of Sale rebate offering allows the value of negotiated rebates on branded drugs to be passed on directly to patients when they fill their prescriptions.","So I think you can see, we're pretty excited about these solutions that are helping to address some of the cost and quality challenges facing our health care system. We know that more challenges lie ahead and we firmly believe that the addition of Aetna will enhance our positioning in the market and allow us to play a larger role in the health of our country.","So with that, let's go ahead and open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Michael Cherny with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Cherny - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, guys, and thanks for all the color so far. Just thinking about the selling season for the PBM. As you think about going to market with the messaging, especially with the pending Aetna transaction, what's been the feedback you've gotten over the course of the selling season, both with your own customers, are they working on for retention as well as new customers where you're pitching new business for an RFP, in terms of how you think about the value proposition and how they should think about the value proposition CVS can provide that evolves, as you work on onboarding Aetna and building out other capabilities from the store? I mean how is that message changing for you and how is that resonating in the market?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah, Mike, it's Larry. I'll start and I know Jon wants to jump in as well. But Mike, if you go back to December after the announcement, we had a pretty comprehensive outreach to our clients, especially our health plan clients. And we just had our Client Forum this past month. It was extremely well attended. I would say that the reaction from our clients has ranged from interest in learning more about how we can create value for them and their members. And I would tell you that there is a lot of engagement around the opportunities that can be created, recognizing that \u2013 we've talked about the fact that we want to make many of these solutions broadly available in the marketplace for our clients. So, Jon?","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah. And I think the one thing we heard really from all clients, both employers and health plans is, as they're trying to manage their overall health care costs down, they're having to work with a lot of different vendors to provide services. And so, they very clearly told us that they're looking to us for innovation that they are looking to reduce the number of vendors. And the fact that we have this Aetna acquisition and the fact that that will allow us to innovate much more broadly to have a positive impact on our overall health care costs, they're very excited about. So that was a message that we heard loud and clear from clients just a few weeks ago.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","And Mike, I think the only other point I'd add and Dave alluded to it in his prepared remarks that in terms of the 2019 selling season, we are seeing RFP activity down. And I do think that, tied to your question, there is a better of a wait-and-see approach as to how does the landscape shake out, okay, as people better understand the various offerings that will be out in the marketplace as they are thinking about making a three-year decision which, as you know, are the typical length for these contracts.","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","And then, Michael, the only other thing I would say is, regards to the selling season, I mean payers really have three priorities. One is service the members and themselves as the client, and we clearly are doing a great job there with everything that we do from sales and account management to all of our support to their members in care, in mail and specialty.","Secondly, they are looking to optimize unit cost, so our size and scale allows us to do that along with programs and plan designs like Maintenance Choice and preferred or narrow networks. And Larry talked about the results that we delivered to our clients with our trend at 1.9%, and then they're very interested in reducing overall health care costs. And that's what I talked about earlier, and I think that is becoming more of a priority and that's why they're so excited about the new company that we will become.","Michael Cherny - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Excellent. Thank you.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Glen Santangelo with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Glen Santangelo - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks and good morning. Larry, thanks for all the details on the Aetna situation. I think investors very much understand and appreciate the long-term bull case of the combination. But we hear a lot of concerns about the potential for integration issues, incremental investments that may be required to get to where you want to be.","And so my two quick questions are: one, when do you think you'll be in a position to give us more detailed information about the integration plan, the services you may look to provide at MinuteClinic, how much you'll need to invest, et cetera? And then secondly, assuming you successfully close the deal in the second half of this year, as you look to 2019, what do you see as the biggest integration challenges? And then I'll stop there. Thanks.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Okay. Glen, as I alluded in our prepared remarks, the integration work is going very well. Keep in mind that as you think about integration risks, the fact that Caremark and Aetna have had an eight-year relationship, you always worry about systems and that work is behind us. So, we can take that one off the table because of \u2013 we did that about eight years ago or started that process eight years ago. And as we've talked about the tools or the areas of investment, we'll have a lot more to say on that as we get further into the work.","But keep in mind that we typically at CVS spend around $2.2 billion in CapEx each year. And we believe that there are elements of that CapEx that can be repurposed that would support some of the investments that we understand will be important to bring things to life. So keep in mind, we've been at this now for probably 8 to 10 weeks. As I mentioned, the work's gone very well and we have not seen anything surface to date that we would say is unexpected, especially as you think, back to your question, large cost ticket items.","Glen Santangelo - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Hill with RBC. Please proceed with your question.","George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, good morning, guys, and thanks for all the question. I guess, Larry, I'm going to ask one of these big picture macro questions. As you guys laid it out in the presentation, I think it's interesting that you guys are looking about reducing the cost of care delivery on a disease state by disease state setting versus like a care delivery treatment area setting, given the collection of assets that you guys are going to have. And I guess, can you talk about whether or not like why is that more important and why does that seem to be the focus as opposed to the assets that you guys have in place in driving higher utilization?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah. George, first of all, I would say, think of it a little bit as both. And I'll start with, we know today that chronic disease accounts for a disproportionate share of those health care costs. And keep in mind that \u2013 I think we've given some examples. We've learned some things from the CVS-Caremark combination over the years that whether you're looking at a patient with diabetes and that patient they visit their doc on a quarterly basis, it's all about the execution of that care plan. That ultimately manages the patient to achieve their best health at the lowest possible cost.","And we've seen some things with our Transform Care program, where \u2013 that has been rolling out that \u2013 there's about $2,800 per patient that can be reduced by just making sure that their A1C levels are in the appropriate range, that ultimately avoid some unintended medical event. So, we think there is a huge unlock in terms of the management of those patients with chronic disease. At the same time, we've also talked a lot about site of care in terms of whether it's transitions in care, whether it's how do we ensure that care is being delivered in the right setting with cost as a variable.","And again, we think that there is a huge opportunity there when you look at the bricks-and-mortar asset as well as what can be provided for in the home. And George, you recall, I think it was three years ago at Analyst Day that we've started talking about this retailization of health care that picks up some of these themes and that health care was becoming more local. And certainly, the growth of consumer-directed health plans have driven that even in a bigger way as accountability and decision making is shifting to the patient. So, we think there is a surround sound capability that we're looking to build out with that in mind.","George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Maybe a quick follow up would be, if you look at a couple of years, does health care become deflationary? And how do you think about kind of the impact to that like as you think about the enterprise income statement?","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","George, it's probably too early to understand whether it can be, in fact, deflationary. I do think that with certain members, as we think about again taking a big step back and thinking about the retailization of health care and the assets that we have in place and we'll put in place, is all about wrapping ourselves around a member and helping that member better navigate the health care system and be more efficient as they use the health care system.","And as we do that, we do believe that we can lower the cost year-over-year for those members, and actually at the same time improve the outcomes as that patient matures. So in those categories, yes, I do think there's some opportunity to really bend the cost curve.","George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. I'll hop back in the queue. Thanks.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Thanks, George.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Hi, good morning. Two questions here. First one is around the discussions we're hearing out of Washington on potential changes to Part D. If you can provide us just some context of what you are hearing out of D.C., and what could mean to the business?","And then the second question is around the MinuteClinic. You've shown very nice growth around 15%. So, should we think about it as a new kind of like run rate for the business? And are you seeing more clients adapting MinuteClinic as part of their offering? Or is it that the consumers just feel more comfortable with the concept?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah. Ricky, let me start with the second one. Ricky, obviously in the first quarter, MinuteClinic is experiencing the intensity of the flu season that we saw largely in the months of January, February began to tail off in March. So, I wouldn't use the first quarter trajectory as a new run rate.","At the same time, as part of what we're talking about, one of the work streams is, what is the trajectory from a scope \u2013 I'll say, the scope of practice and services at MinuteClinic? And those are things that we're working on and we'll have more to say on that in the coming months. And I would say, Ricky, that the consumer awareness of MinuteClinic has grown substantially. And obviously, I think that that is helping to drive utilization as well.","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","And then, Ricky, we're going to be launching what we're calling, virtual care, later this year that will either be an online visit or a video visit. So, the video visit will be able to treat things like minor illnesses or injuries, skin conditions and wellness services. And then the online visits will be on-demand diagnosis for limited scope areas like birth control, allergies, hair loss and acne. And we're doing that under our brand that we think will help this virtual care model that has been in the market for quite some time, but had limited traction.","In addition, when we look at our clients, employers, we see a lot answers from employers in creating an incentive for their employees to go to MinuteClinic; MinuteClinic's open at nights and weekends. So it keeps them at work, but still gives them the care that they need. And then with health plans, very interested in MinuteClinic so that their members can go to a MinuteClinic versus the emergency room and it really is just a cost save for the health plans. So we're just saying, continued interest. And as Larry said, we're continuing to evolve this model.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","And then, Ricky, back to your first question in terms of Part D, what are we hearing in D.C.? Obviously, there's been a lot of dialogue about Point of Sale rebates in Part D. And keep in mind, Ricky, as you've heard us and quite frankly others talk about the dynamic here that 100% of that rebate value in Part D is passed through the plan design in the form of a lower premium. So as it relates to the PBM, that would have no impact on profitability if that ended up moving forward.","I think the concern that exists there is, as you model that out, what is the dynamic as it relates to beneficiary premiums going up? What is the consequence associated with that? And ultimately, what's the government costs associated with that? So, I think that work has been done and you've seen some published studies associated with that.","I think the other things that we are hearing is, moving certain Part B drugs into Part D. And then there'll be ongoing dialogue about the dynamics associated with the six protected classes, where formulary management typically does not come into play and the opportunities to further reduce the cost of the program for beneficiaries and the government.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much and good morning. Jon or Larry, I just wanted to start going back to the 2019 selling season. So, I understand your comments around being halfway through, not as much opportunity in 2019. But can you talk about what you're seeing in the marketplace? Some of the things we're hearing right now is the shift in contracting towards total care.","Even if you don't own the health plan today that some of the contracts are coming out that way, number one. You did talk about point of service (sic) [Point of Sale] rebates, but are you seeing that in the commercial market today where an uptake on that side, if maybe you could just talk about what your expectations are as far as plan design goes, as we think about 2019.","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah. Lisa, this is Jon. So, I do think that there is interest in integrating the medical and pharmacy benefit. And you'll see that more in the mid-level sized employers, where they generally have one health plan and their workforce is more localized, because they're a little more challenging with the large national plans that have multiple health plans.","But we spend a lot of time talking about things we can do in pharmacy to lower their overall health care costs, and Transform Diabetes Care is a good example. Larry talked about that earlier. We have over 100 clients and 2 million lives in this program, very targeted to their members with diabetes. So, I just think there will continue to be a growing interest in how pharmacy can help bend the overall cost curve with health care costs.","With respect to Point of Sale rebates, I think as we see continued growth and high deductible health plans, I think there will be even more interest in Point of Sale rebates. We have 10 million members in a Point of Sale rebate program today. We can administer that. We can actually encourage those plans with either percent copays or in high deductible plans to adopt those, and we're able to show them how it actually helps members stay adherent and lowers their overall health care costs. So, we think it's a good thing to do. And it's just been a challenge because people like the flexibility of having that rebate check in either applying it to lower premiums or use it for other programs that they're interested in. But I think you'll continue to see us progressing in that direction.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. And then just a point of clarification. Larry, I think you talked about virtual care being under a CVS brand. But can talk to us about your teleservices relationship with Teladoc?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah. Lisa, it pretty much is what you just alluded to, we will use Teladoc as the engine that provides telehealth services through the CVS app through and direct it back into MinuteClinic and other providers. So, essentially think of them as private labeling our telehealth program.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mohan Naidu with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.","Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks for taking my questions. Dave, first on the Point of Sale rebate offerings. Should we think about this as something that could impact your margins? And I just have a quick follow up on the Aetna combination as well.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","I don't know if it will affect our margin substantially. I do think it's obviously a product and service that we'll offer in the marketplace pretty comprehensively today. I think it's an opportunity for us to reduce the cost at the pharmacy counter for those members in the deductible phase. I think the adoption of that has been pretty slow at this point in time.","I will also let you know that we've been talking about the fact that, while we collect rebates, the vast majority of those rebates go back to our plan sponsors in form of lower cost to them. We have said in the past that about 90% of those rebates have gone back to the payers. Today, probably a lot closer than 95% of all those rebates go back to the payer in the form of lower cost into the pharmacy program.","Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","That's very helpful, Dave. Larry, just one more quick follow up on the Aetna combination and you talked about this in the last couple of questions, I guess. As we think about post approval and post Aetna combination, what can you do immediately within the, I guess, first couple of years in terms of offering new services at the store versus what you can do or years (00:55:04) with more investments in the store? Can you do the chronic disease management stuff that you talked about right now as soon as the deal is closed? Thank you.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah. Mohan, it's a great question and I do believe that we'll have elements of that that we'll be able to do early on, recognizing the assets and capabilities that are already resident in each of the companies. And that's one of the things that the teams are currently working on, whether it's site of care, we talked about MinuteClinic, we talked about infusion in the home as well as the role that \u2013 the additional role that we can play around improving medication adherence. So these are just a handful of examples of things that we will be able to do out of the gate.","Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Larry.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company","Yeah. Hey, thanks for taking the question. Most of mine have been asked here. I guess, just maybe first on \u2013 Dave, can you just go into what's going on in Long-Term Care specifically? Obviously, you acquired Omnicare a few years back and there seem to be a lot of opportunities there to bring maybe some of the more CVS kind of brand services into that channel, particularly assisted living. Curious whether \u2013 just want to get an update here, what might has been going on here and when do you think some of these challenges could subside?","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah. Well, first and foremost, within the Long-Term Care space, there's \u2013 many of the players in that space are facing financial distress and that has created pressure from a growth perspective just as we service those homes across the country. Secondly, reimbursement pressure continues to evolve in that space and probably a little bit higher than what we originally planned. At the same time, census has been a bit lower across the industry. We experienced that, just given our market share.","And then finally, as you indicated, we believe that there is a big opportunity for growth within the out market. However, the growth in that market has not been as fast, from a case perspective, as we originally planned. We have several pilots underway and the success of those pilots have been pretty strong, but we haven't created a platform yet that we can scale nationally across our business line. And so, that's an area of work that we have underway. We think we're optimistic about that in the long term; but in the short term, we're not exactly where we need to be.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company","I see. And just a follow up on telemedicine, in particular, I guess is \u2013 because you talked about hemodialysis and if I recall correctly, I think as part of the \u2013 some of the pilots that are going underway, there's another one with home hemodialysis using telemedicine for, I guess, two out of every three patient visits. Is that something that you expect to also deploy? Or is that part of the opportunity when you're thinking about your home hemodialysis opportunity here?","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","Well, this is Jon. Home hemodialysis, we're taking it to trial and it will take probably 12 months to 18 months to get through the clinical trials. And then that solution is targeted for the home, so there's about 10% of dialysis that takes place at the home today with about 1% of it hemo and the balance peritoneal. So we'll be going after that narrow segment of the market.","I think what's interesting is, when you look at other countries, you see home dialysis up to 30%, 40%, even 50%. So, we think there is an opportunity to expand that market as well. So, nothing really related to telemedicine with the hemodialysis that's planned at this point.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Charles, it's Larry. You think back to some of the dialogue that we've had in terms of specialty and the role that Accordant has played in supporting our specialty pharmacy business, and our Accordant team, our Accordant nurses are working with a specialty patient in an effort to manage the patient holistically. And we think that that is the approach that we would apply to home hemodialysis. They'll play a key role in that regard, as...","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company","But not necessarily taking over \u2013 I guess, not also ruling up the role of the provider to these patients as well through CVS more directly, but still more as a support to the specialty pharmacy. Is that the better way to understand it then?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah. That's along those lines, Charles. Yes.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company","Okay. Thanks for the clarification. Thank you.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Steven Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So, I guess I'm just curious if you can speak about copay accumulator programs and whether there was greater adoption of this type of program by commercial employer clients in 2018 versus 2017 within your PBM book of business? And also do you see maybe even greater adoption in 2019, if you maybe more aggressively marketing this in the upcoming PBM selling season? Thanks.","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","Steven, this is Jon. So, it really is a capability that we have and it has to be something that our client opts into. I would say, there has been some interest, but not \u2013 I don't think it's not a priority for clients as we speak to them, because they know that these patients are challenged financially and they actually appreciate the help. But it's a client-by-client decision whether they opt into the program and we support as they do so.","Steven Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. So adoption rates are pretty low right now? And just, by the way, could a customer adopt this mid contract if they wanted to? Or would this typically only change with the renewal of a contract? Just curious how that works.","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","They can implement this at any time. It's a pretty straightforward implementation.","Steven Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Got it. Okay. Thanks.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Great. We're going to take two more questions. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Really looking out beyond the Aetna closure, I just want to get your thoughts on a couple of things. First is \u2013 and I know we touched on it a little bit, but the risk to the health care plan book of business in Caremark. The second one is really just around drug coverage, and if we look at how many generics are out there. Do we need to look at drug coverage in a different way as we look out maybe beyond 2020? And then the third thing was as you pay down the debt, the appetite to do a deal like you did with Target? Thanks.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Well, I'll take the Target question as it relates to an incremental transaction there. Obviously, just given our leverage, as you said, we're not positioned to do something of scale at this point in time. I would say, secondly, as we look at the overlap of national players around the country, there's probably not a national player that would fit with our geographic needs at this point in time. There could be an opportunity for a small regional fill in as we think about access points around the nation, but those are going to be one-off and pretty small in nature if they were to come about.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","And Scott, I'll take that drug coverage question. Jon will take the health plan question. But Scott, if your question is really going down the generic path and listen, we have been pleased with what we're seeing from the leadership in the FDA in terms of streamlining the pathway, beginning to eliminate the backlog of potential generic approvals that have existed for quite a few years now, that has the prospects of moving more generics into the marketplace.","And we think that there is an opportunity for greater adoption of things like value formularies that are largely, I'll say, staffed, if you will, with generics and the fact that we have now reached a point, especially as you look at chronic disease where there are multiple generic options within all of those different therapeutic classes. So, we think there is an opportunity for growth there. And we continue to explore different procurement models in terms of how can we work differently with pharma, with more of a focus on outcomes. Now, obviously I'm moving from generics into brands and we'll continue to explore those opportunities. And by the way, I think this \u2013 the CVS combination will open up the door to do even more of that.","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","And Scott, this is Jon. I'll take the health plan question and their reaction. They understand that the lines are blurring between who's a competitor and who's a partner. And they just want to make sure that they're not disadvantaged in the market. And we've been very clear with them that, as we build products \u2013 new products, we're going to make them not only available to Aetna, but all of our health plan partners in this open platform. And we use the example of SilverScript, where we have a Part D plan and it's the largest Part D plan in the country, where we compete with the 40 health plans that we support.","And as I talk to these plans, I say, with your brand and your market if I can make you more competitive, you're going to be very successful in the marketplace. And that in fact is what has happened with our health plan partners that are in the Medicare space. They have grown faster than the market because of the product services and expertise that we bring them. And so, the fact that we proved and demonstrated that in SilverScript is giving them confidence that, with this Aetna acquisition that we'll do the same thing for them as we build out these products and services.","So I would say, people are from enthusiastic to wait-and-see, but we haven't really had anybody react in a very negative way because of this acquisition. So we're very happy with how this has been received.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","Thanks.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of David Larsen with Leerink Partners. Please proceed with your question.","David Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Congratulations on a good quarter. Dave, did you increase the revenue growth expectations for Retail? And then, I don't think I saw an increase in the operating profit growth expectations. Any color there would be great.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah. We actually did, in fact, increase our revenue guidance for the Retail business. Keep in mind that two things have happened. One is, we are making the incremental investments from tax savings largely into the Retail business at the back half of this year. But probably more importantly, why we're not raising guidance is, as we indicated our Long-Term Care Omnicare business is not performing as we expected, so we had a little headwind in the back half of the year compared to our expectations in that. So, think about the Retail business strong from a top line, both from a script and a front store perspective, being offset slightly from softness in Long-Term Care.","David Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And then, can you maybe talk a little bit about biosimilars and maybe your drug trend that you delivered in diabetes. The drug trend of I think 1% was fantastic. What was it for diabetes? And then the use of Basaglar over Lantus, I think, probably had a significant impact there. So it seems to me like CVS's use of biosimilars is actually very effective today. What other products should we be looking at in the near term to sort of see similar results? Thanks.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah. We're very happy with the biosimilar performance in diabetes. I don't have the trends specific for diabetes. I think when we talked about the 1.8% that was we saw adherence improving in that class. So as we look at the biosimilars that are coming to the market, most of them are in the medical benefit in the near term. And I think we're several years off from seeing biosimilars under the performance benefit. But when they come, we're very optimistic that we'll be able to leverage competition as we have been doing with our formulary strategies to dramatically reduce costs for our clients and their members.","David Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","All right. Well, listen, we appreciate everybody's time this morning. We know it is a rather long call and we communicated a lot of information. And Mike McGuire is certainly available for any follow ups. So, thanks everyone.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find the definitions of the non-GAAP items I mentioned as well as the reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of our website.","Please note that we also posted slides and supplemental financial schedules on our website this morning that summarize the information on this call, as well as key facts and figures around our operating performance and guidance, so you may want to check those out.","As always, today's call is being simulcast on our website, and it will be archived there following the call for one year.","Finally, please note that we expect to file our Form 10-K by the close of business on February 21, and it will be available through our website at that time. Now before we begin, our attorneys have asked me to read the Safe Harbor statement.","During this presentation, we will make certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Accordingly, for these forward-looking statements, we claim the protection of the Safe Harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We strongly recommend that you become familiar with the specific risks and uncertainties that are described in the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and that you review the section entitled Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements in our most recently filed quarterly report on Form 10-Q.","And now, I'll turn this over to Larry Merlo.","Larry J. Merlo","Well, thanks, Nancy, and good morning, everyone. Hopefully, you've had a chance to read through our press release this morning. And we're obviously very pleased with the strong financial results we posted, along with the great progress we made across the enterprise last year. Our accomplishments in 2011 set a solid foundation for future growth, and as we outlined for you in our Analyst Day in December, we look forward to an even better year in 2012.","We reported adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.89 for the fourth quarter, $2.80 for the full year, with Retail results in line with our guidance and PBM results exceeding our guidance. Overall, we generated about $700 million in free cash flow in the quarter, bringing the 2011 total to $4.6 billion, which beats our goal. And Dave will provide the details of our results, as well as guidance during his financial review.","So with that, let me address what I know is the #1 question on everyone's mind: What benefit has  CVS\/pharmacy seen from Walgreen no longer participating in the Express Scripts Retail network? Well, as we have said previously, the benefit was not material to our results in the fourth quarter, although it did start to ramp up late in the year. Now since the start of this year, we are seeing a significant number of transfers from Walgreens into CVS. In fact, the amount is a bit more than we anticipated. We have spent the last several weeks focused on ensuring that Express Scripts members have uninterrupted, convenient access to pharmacy care and excellent customer service, and the feedback to-date from our new customers has been excellent. Our pharmacy teams have been doing a terrific job in making sure that the transfer process is as easy as possible, and we will continue to do as much as we can to provide superior service to these new customers.","And with that in mind, we have made investments in store labor and marketing that we believe will enhance our success in capitalizing on this significant opportunity. Now based on the early results, we believe we are gaining more than our fair share of this business. And in light of this, we are now projecting that earnings per share will benefit by approximately $0.03 per share in the first quarter should the situation remain unresolved for the duration of the quarter. And as you're aware, that's $0.01 higher than the estimate provided at Analyst Day.","As a result, we are increasing our guidance for the first quarter and full year to reflect this first quarter benefit, and we now expect to achieve adjusted EPS for 2012 in the range of $3.18 to $3.28. As I said, Dave will review the specific details. But that said, please note that we are not increasing our guidance for the remaining quarters of the year as the situation is fluid and is not within our control. And as everyone is aware, Walgreens and Express Scripts could come to an agreement at any point in time. So we are taking this one quarter at a time. We would encourage you to only include the benefit in your models for the first quarter. We will report the estimated impact from this impasse to you on a quarter-by-quarter basis throughout the year if it remains unresolved.","So with that, let me turn to a brief business update, and I'll begin with PBM. The 2012 selling season continues on a positive trajectory, and with 90% of the contracts scheduled for renewal in 2012 completed, our retention rate stands at 98%. As for new business, our net new business wins now total $7.2 billion. That's up from the $6.8 billion provided on Analyst Day. And we won some new accounts, and our estimate for the number of new Medicare Part D lives for 2012 has increased to 200,000 lives. And that's predominantly driven by the auto-assigned beneficiaries, and that brings our PDP lives up to approximately 3.6 million to date.","Now in addition to net new business wins, recall that we expect another $5.5 billion in revenues associated with CVS Caremark becoming the PBM or the PDP acquired from Universal American in 2011 and with Universal American's Medicare Advantage plan. Another PBM was serving these plans; that relationship terminated at the end of '11. So after adding this to our net the new business to date, our 2012 impact revenues are currently $12.7 billion, and that is up from the $12.3 billion projected on Analyst Day.  So obviously, there's a lot to be pleased with these results of our 2012 selling season, and again, we believe that driving top line growth will be an important component of successfully growing our operating profit over time. And I guess everyone's aware that 2013 selling season is underway. It's very early in the game, so we'll report on that in future quarters.","Now we talked at length on Analyst Day about our integrated offerings that capitalize on what we're calling our integration sweet spots, and these are the products and services that are extremely difficult for standalone PBMs or standalone pharmacy retailers to replicate. And as illustrated by the results of our 2012 selling season, our flagship programs, Maintenance Choice and Pharmacy Advisor, are resonating in the marketplace, and they continue to deliver great results for clients and their members.","We currently have approximately 10.2 million lives covered under 835 plans that have implemented or committed to implement Maintenance Choice through March of this year, and that's up from 9.9 million lives at our last update. I think it's interesting to note here that 59% of the clients using Maintenance Choice in 2012 had voluntary mail plans prior to adoption. And if you compare that back to 2009, when the product was first introduced, that number was only 20% back then. The former voluntary mail clients adapting Maintenance Choice back in 2009 saw their 90-day utilization increase from about 37% to 65% and, as a result, recognizing significant savings. So armed with this compelling data, we continue to demonstrate that Maintenance Choice has been successful in broadening access while reducing costs and improving prescription drug adherence. ","Now with our anticipated launch of Maintenance Choice 2.0, we expect the number of clients taking advantage of this offering to increase dramatically over the next few years. And recall that this next-generation product will enhance the member experience for all legacy and new Maintenance Choice clients. Moreover, Maintenance Choice 2.0 does not require clients to adopt restrictive benefit designs, so we expect that more clients will try 2.0 to recognize at least some of the savings associated with Maintenance Choice. And we believe these enhancements will provide a transformative member experience that further differentiates CVS Caremark in the marketplace. This program will be rolled out on a limited basis this year, and we expect to make it broadly available beginning in January of '13. And as you may have seen in their press release, one of our new clients with a July 12 implementation, the Pennsylvania Employees Benefits Trust, actually cited Maintenance Choice 2.0 as one of the primary reasons for selecting CVS Caremark as their PBM.","As for Pharmacy Advisor, we have also experienced additional uptake. Our data has demonstrated that we are identifying important opportunities for cost savings while improving adherence and closing gaps in care. We have 15.9 million lives covered by almost 900 clients committed to implement Pharmacy Advisor for diabetes thus far, and that is up from over 12 million lives at year end. Again, as we announced on Analyst Day, we're expanding Pharmacy Advisor to one new disease state this year and to several other targeted disease states in 2013, and we're doing this through a comprehensive initiative that we're calling Pharmacy Advisor 3.0. We're excited to report that we have already signed up 344 clients covering 8.8 million lives for Pharmacy Advisor for cardiovascular disease, and that will be available in the spring of this year.","Additionally, we have made very significant opportunities to expand the program by offering Pharmacy Advisor to other major client segments, and a case in point here is Aetna. And we have the opportunity to offer the program to Aetna's 8 million commercial lives as they begin the migration to our systems this year. And we plan to offer Pharmacy Advisor to our Medicare clients for 2013 implementations as well.","Now among other cost savings programs, we continue to encourage adoption of plan designs to improve generic dispensing rates. Today, 355 clients representing about 8.4 million lives have adopted generic step therapy plans, and that's a 23% increase in lives from our last update. And then moving on to some of the highest growth areas for the PBM, we saw significant growth in our Specialty Pharmacy business, with revenues increasing a very strong 31% this quarter. That was driven by healthy underlying growth, as well as the addition of the Aetna specialty business.","As you know, we're also very committed to growing our Medicare Part D business, and this is in light of prescription utilization trends of seniors, as well as the potential displacement of lives due to a larger number of employers who may decide to shift their retirees to an EGWP program or simply into the open PDP marketplace as we approach the elimination of the RDS tax subsidy in 2013. And with that in mind, we recently agreed to acquire Health Net's PDP. We expect the deal to close in the second quarter, and that will shift from our PBM to our PDP about 400,000 lives, bringing our total PDP lives to approximately 4 million. Now we've had a long-standing relationship with Health Net, having served as their PBM for the past 12 years, and we expect to transition various services from the closing, again, in the second quarter through 2013.","Now before turning to Retail, let me touch briefly on the PBM streamlining initiative, which is proceeding on track. We expect the benefit from the initiative will outweigh the costs this year, and we continue to expect to hit the run rate of annual savings of between $225 million and $275 million in 2014. And as we've said previously, through this initiative, we're streamlining PBM operations to improve productivity, rationalizing capacity and consolidating our adjudication platforms to one destination platform with enhanced capabilities.","On January 1, we migrated our larger health plan clients to the destination platform, and as we sit here today, all of our Medicare Part D business is now on that platform as well. And we expect to migrate additional clients throughout the year. So I think it's pretty clear that our PBM is performing well, making continued great progress and is fully expected to return to healthy operating profit growth this year.","Let me turn to our Retail business, which is certainly in the midst of an exciting industry-driven opportunity. And as I noted earlier, in the first several weeks of this year, we are posting strong pharmacy comps at levels that we have not seen in quite a while.","In the fourth quarter, our same-store sales increased 2.5%. That was at the high end of our guidance range. Late in the year, we did begin to see some incremental growth from the stalemate between Walgreens and Express. Our pharmacy comps increased 3.6% in the fourth quarter, with script comps up 4.4% on a 30-day supply basis.","Our script unit comps continue to outpace all of our primary competitors, and our pharmacy share grew by approximately 75 basis points nationally, 85 basis points in the markets in which we operate versus a year ago. Our pharmacy comps were negatively impacted by approximately 235 basis points from new generics in the quarter. In addition, pharmacy comps benefited from the continued growth of Maintenance Choice, which added approximately 160 basis points on a net basis. And furthermore, despite a very weak flu season, flu shots administered by CVS pharmacists nearly doubled versus the prior year, which also helped to drive our pharmacy comps.","Now turning to the front store, our market share increased 39 basis points in our class of trade, 11 basis points in the food, drug and mass channel versus last year. Traffic turned positive in the fourth quarter with front store comps increasing slightly in the quarter. Christmas sales were a bit lower than we had planned, and flu-related front store sales were impacted by the weak flu season. Store brand and proprietary products made up 17.9% of front store sales in the quarter. That was up 10 basis points from a year ago as consumers remain value-conscious.","We continue to make progress on our clustering initiatives. 420 Urban Cluster stores were completed by year end. We expect to add approximately 50 more this year. And also this year, we're expanding our efforts to develop and test additional clustering concepts that came out of our trip segmentation work, and we believe these efforts around localization are a key component to optimizing the return on capital of our remodel program.","As for our real estate program, we opened 29 new or relocated CVS stores and closed one, resulting in 23 net new stores for the quarter. And for the full year, we opened 247 new or relocated stores, closing 16, resulting in 145 net new stores, and that equates to Retail square footage growth of 2.6%.","Let me touch briefly on MinuteClinic, which continues to grow and achieve its targets. We ended the year with 657 clinics in 25 states and the District of Columbia, and we have cared for more than 11 million patients since the company's inception. We added about 100 clinics in 2011, and we believe our plans to double our clinic count over the next several years will position us well to play an important role in providing care to the newly insured beginning in 2014.","Now despite the very weak flu season, MinuteClinic revenues increased nearly 40% in the fourth quarter versus last year. We continue to add new services and raise awareness. It's just this one example with the new Texas law requiring college students to be vaccinated against meningitis prior to the January school start. We actually launched a marketing campaign in our 3 Texas markets that resulted in a 50% increase in vaccinations.","MinuteClinic continues to enhance its role as a collaborator with integrated health networks, and during the fourth quarter, we entered into several additional affiliations with prominent healthcare systems, including Emory Healthcare, the Carolinas HealthCare System and UMass Memorial Health Care. And MinuteClinic now has affiliations with 14 of the nation's leading health systems, which will help position us well for future growth and clinical collaboration.","So with that, let me turn it over to Dave for his financial review.","David M. Denton","Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll provide a detailed review of our fourth quarter financial results. I'll also update our 2012 guidance for the first quarter, as well as the full year.","Now first, let me start with the wrap-up of our 2011 capital allocation program. We paid approximately $670 million in dividends last year, which was an increase of 41% over 2010 levels. And at our Analyst Day, we announced that our quarterly dividend would increase this year by another 30%, our ninth consecutive year with an increase. And given our earnings expectations for this year, we anticipate a payout ratio of 21% to 22%, placing us comfortably on track to achieve our targeted payout ratio of 25% to 30% by 2015.","In regard to share repurchase, during the fourth quarter, we completed the buyback associated with the 2010 authorization, for which we had approximately $450 million left at the end of the third quarter. With this, we repurchased a total of 12.6 million shares. We also settled the final balance of our August accelerated share repurchase transaction, adding another 1.6 million shares to our treasury stock. In total, we repurchased 83.7 million shares at an average cost of $35.85 per share, and we spent approximately $3 billion in 2011. So between dividends and share repurchases, we returned more than $3.5 billion to our shareholders last year. It is my expectation that at a minimum, the remaining $3 billion on the 2011 repurchase authorization will be used in 2012, and that will allocate roughly $3.8 billion to enhancing shareholder value through both repurchases, as well as a dividends. Our capital allocation program will remain a vital component of providing shareholder value, taking advantage of the powerful cash flow generation capabilities of CVS Caremark both now and in the long run.","As Larry said, we generated $4.6 billion of free cash last year, with our inventory initiative helping us to surpass the high end of our guidance range by more than $300 million. In the fourth quarter, we generated approximately $700 million of free cash, a decrease of more than $830 million over the same period of last year. This decrease was primarily driven by the timing of CMS funds received in September associated with premiums and subsidies for Medicare Part D, which were earned in October. On our last call, I mentioned this as the main driver behind the third quarter's free cash flow increase. So this is merely the equal and opposite impact from the reversal in the fourth quarter. ","Partially offsetting this was be inventory improvement that resulted from our 2000 initiative that targeted a $1 billion reduction in Retail inventories. And I'm happy to report that during the fourth quarter, we reduced our related Retail inventories by another $690 million, bringing the full year total to approximately $1.5 billion, surpassing our $1 billion inventory reduction goal.","And as with prior quarters, you can see the improvements we made in accounts payables and inventory on the balance sheet, as well as in our strong cash flow. Inventory days within the Retail segment is nearly 6 days better than it was at the end of last year, and DPO has improved by nearly 2 days. We've reduced our Retail cash cycle by more than 8 days, and we've identified some additional opportunities for improvement. The team has set an inventory reduction target of $500 million in 2012 as we continue to make process improvements. That reduction target is above and beyond the net impact of inflation and generic convergence on our inventory levels. So working capital improvements are expected to continue to enhance our cash generation capabilities well into the future.","Net capital spending in the fourth quarter was $123 million, an improvement from $243 million last year due to the increased amount of sale-leaseback proceeds during the quarter. We completed approximately $580 million in sale-leasebacks in the fourth quarter versus approximately $380 million in the prior year. For the full year, our net capital spending was approximately $1.3 billion or about $200 million less than the prior year.","Turning to the income statement, adjusted earnings per share was $0.89 for the quarter, while GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations came in at $0.84 per share. On a consolidated basis, revenues in the fourth quarter increased by more than 15% to $28.3 billion. Drilling down by segments, net -- down by our segments, net revenues grew by 32% in the PBM to $15.9 billion. The majority of the increase from last year was driven by the addition of the Universal America -- American and Aetna businesses to our book. However, we did see higher revenues than expected due to stronger volumes from new managed Medicaid client starts during Q4, as well as some higher-than-usual stocking up by members at the end of last year.","PBM pharmacy network revenues in the quarter increased 41% from 2010 levels to $10.9 billion, while pharmacy network claims grew by 46%. Total mail choice revenues increased by 18% to $4.9 billion, while mail choice claims expanded by 8%. Our overall mail choice penetration rate was 20.8%, down approximately 530 basis points versus LY. This decrease was driven entirely by the addition of Aetna and the Universal American Med D businesses, both of which have lower mail penetration rates than the average book of our business.","In our Retail segment, we saw revenues increase 4% in the quarter to $15.5 billion. This increase was primarily driven by our same-store sales increase of 2.5%, as well as net revenues from new stores, relocations and MinuteClinic, which accounted for approximately 150 basis points of the increase. And Larry talked about our pharmacy and front store comps in some detail, so I won't repeat it here. ","Turning to gross margin, the consolidated company reported 19.6% in the quarter, while gross margin contracted approximately 260 basis points compared to Q4 '10 and improved approximately 115 basis points since Q1 of '11.","Within the PBM segment, we saw a sequential gross margin improvement of approximately 20 basis points, but gross margin was down approximately 75 basis points versus last year's fourth quarter. This was better than expected as our cost of goods sold benefited from better purchasing. The decline versus last year mainly reflects the price compression associated with contract renewals, as well as the impact of the addition of the Aetna business.  Partially offsetting these were the positive margin impact from the 220 basis point increase in the PBM's generic dispensing rate, which grew from 72.8% to 75%, as well as better purchasing.","Gross margin in the Retail segment was 29.7%, up approximately 45 basis points sequentially mainly due to the higher mix of front store purchases associated with the holiday season. Gross margin at the Retail -- at Retail decreased approximately 140 basis points versus last year.","As we expected, we saw gross margin pressure from pharmacy reimbursement rates, the growth of Maintenance Choice and planned holiday promotions. However, the weaker-than-expected holiday sales caused margin decline a bit more than we had forecasted. These unfavorable factors were partially offset by the benefit from various front store initiatives, increased store brand penetration and increased generic dispensing rates, with Retail GDR increasing by 210 basis points to 75.9%.","Total operating expenses as a percent of revenues improved by approximately 230 basis points versus the fourth quarter of '10. The PBM segment's SG&A rate improved by 30 basis points to 1.8%. This was primarily due to expense leverage gained by the addition of the large Aetna contract, which was partially offset by the impact of our acquisition of the Universal American Med D business. In the Retail segment, SG&A as a percent of sales improved by approximately 160 basis points to 20.4%. This improvement in expense leverage was driven by solid sales growth and continued discipline around expense control. ","Within the Corporate segment, expenses were down approximately $15 million to $152 million or less than 1% of consolidated revenues, improving by approximately 15 basis points versus the same period of last year. With the change in gross margin more than offsetting the improvement in SG&A as a percent of sales, operating margin for the total enterprise declined by approximately 25 basis points to 6.9%, as we expected. Operating margin in PBM was 4.6%, down about 40 basis points, while operating margin at Retail was 9.4%, up about 15 basis points. Retail operating profit, which makes up more than 2\/3 of the consolidated operating profit, achieved continued healthy growth. It increased 5.9% above the midpoint of our guidance range. PBM profit increased 21.2%, which was well above our guidance range.","Going below the line on the consolidated income statement, we saw net interest expense in the quarter increase by approximately $11 million to $147 million versus last year. Additionally, our effective income tax rate was 39.3%, and our weighted average share count was 1.31 billion shares.","Now let me update you on our guidance for the first quarter and full year 2012. With the exception of some tweaks or -- to reflect the impact from the Walgreens-Express Scripts impasse, as well as the improved working capital expectations, our guidance remains essentially unchanged from Analyst Day. You can find the details of our guidance in the slide presentation we posted on our website, but today, I'll focus on the highlights.","We currently expect to deliver adjusted EPS in '12 of between $3.18 and $3.28 per share and GAAP diluted EPS from continued operations of between $2.96 and $3.06 per share, reflecting very healthy year-over-year growth of 13.5% to 17%. This includes the $0.03 benefit we expect to see during the first quarter only resulting from the Walgreens-Express Scripts impasse. As Larry said, we are assessing the impact on a quarter-by-quarter basis, and we'll update our guidance as needed as we move throughout the year.","Taking into account the impact from the prescription transfers, we currently expect consolidated net revenue growth of between 12% and 13.5%. This is a reflection of strong revenue growth across the enterprise, but especially in the PBM, following another great selling season. Recall that our estimates includes one extra day in 2012 versus '11 for leap year.","Within the Retail segment, we now expect revenues to increase year-over-year by 3% to 4%, reflecting an impact from the impasse of about 100 basis points. Gross margin in this segment is expected to be moderately up over 2011 levels, while operating expenses as a percent of revenue should modestly de-lever.  As a result, operating profit in the Retail segment is expected to grow between 8.5% and 10.5%. Guidance within the PBM segment remains unchanged from Analyst Day, and we still expect PBM operating profit to increase between 11% and 15%.","For the first quarter, adding the $0.03 benefit from the impasse, we now expect adjusted EPS of between $0.61 and $0.63, reflecting growth of 7.5% to 11% over the same period of last year. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $0.55 to $0.57 in the first quarter. Consolidated revenues are expected to increase 17% to 18.5%. In the Retail segment, revenues are expected to increase 8% to 9% versus the first quarter of '11. Same-store sales growth is expected to be in the range of 6.5% to 7.5%, and same-store script the growth is expected to be in the range of 5.5% to 6.5%.","While the majority of the top line increase is due to the benefit from the script transfers from Walgreens, we also have added some growth reflecting increase in drug inflation, which is helping to offset some of the deflation from new generic introductions. We assume that we will see this through the first quarter, but we are not including any expectations that this will last beyond Q1.","Operating profit in the Retail segment is now expected to grow between 14% and 16% during the fourth quarter, an increase from the 8% to 10% we guided on Analyst Day. Guidance for the PBM segment remains unchanged for the quarter. In addition, we are increasing our free cash flow guidance to the range of $4.6 million to $4.9 billion, up about $300 million from our previous guidance. A part of the increase is due to the flow-through of the additional $0.03 associated with the script transfers, but the bulk of the increase reflects greater optimism around our ability to improve working capital management, especially in accounts payable. This is above and beyond the improvement we are targeting in Retail inventory.  I am very pleased with our significant and growing cash flow generation capabilities, which, as I said, will play an important role in driving shareholder value both now and well into the future.","And with that, I will turn it back to Larry Merlo.","Larry J. Merlo","Well, thanks, Dave. Let me just summarize here. I think we closed 2011 with a very good quarter, earnings solidly in line and free cash flow ahead of target. Once again, we delivered on our promises.","I think, as you heard, 2012 is off to a great start, and today, we've increased our earnings and cash flow guidance to reflect the industry opportunity we're capitalizing on, as well as greater confidence around our working capital management.","We absolutely remain focused on driving shareholder value, and our productive long-term growth, significant cash generation and disciplined capital allocation will continue to be important drivers of returning value to our shareholders. So with that, let's open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig with Citigroup.","Michael Palahicky","This is Shane on the line for Deb today. Just wanted to talk about the front end a little bit. Obviously, it seemed a little bit weaker than expected, and you mentioned that. I'm just kind of looking of trends in January, and how has that kind of changed, or has there been any differences that you've seen?","Larry J. Merlo","Yes, Shane, I think as we outlined in our remarks, we saw some weakness in the flu season, which impacted our front store growth, as well as disappointing holiday sales around the Christmas products. That element of it is behind us, and I think as we outlined our comp guidance for the first quarter, we are expecting to see stronger front store trends than we saw in Q4.","Michael Palahicky","And is that something that you're seeing currently, or is that what you're...","Larry J. Merlo","No, we are seeing that currently. Yes.","Michael Palahicky","And then just kind of looking ahead to like the PBM selling season, obviously, you guys seem to have a pretty strong negotiating position. And how are you guys trying to position yourselves with kind of Walgreens and Express and all the other things that are going on in the industry?","Per G. H. Lofberg","It's still very early in the season, as you guys know, and there are a number of RFP processes that are underway and a number -- many more that we expect to begin in a couple months. I don't think the Express-Walgreens issue per se is a particularly significant factor. I think there will be a lot of opportunities for us to feature our set of solutions and our integrated capabilities and so forth. I do think that there will be an interest in comparing the cost savings and the benefits from restricted networks going forward, and that is probably, to some extent, prompted by the Express-Walgreens impasse, but that will be just one factor that people will be interested in.","Larry J. Merlo","And Shane, at the same time, we are expecting to see more RFPs out in the marketplace this year. The benefit consultants are driving that with the Express-Medco deal on the horizon. So we do see more activity coming, but as Per mentioned, it's very early, especially on the employer side of the selling season.","Michael Palahicky","And if I could just do one quick follow-up, on that restricted network, what types of savings are you guys hearing, like that clients are -- or people would like to -- if you can -- are looking to get from a more restricted network? If you're allowed to talk about that or are able to...","Per G. H. Lofberg","I think you probably have to show savings of at least a couple of percent for it to be a meaningful benefit to a customer and to justify the disruption that is inevitable when you change the network. Obviously, the more restrictive the network is, the deeper the savings are that you can propose. So it is sort of a sliding scale.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a follow-up on that line of questioning, Per, Larry. Are you seeing more interest in narrow networks because of this dispute, number one? And then number two, Larry, I know you mentioned that you thought there would be more business out to bid. Can you maybe just help us to frame the amount of business that you have out to bid for 2013?","Larry J. Merlo","Yes, Lisa. I'll take the second question, and I'll ask Per to comment. We have about $16 billion up for renewal in this selling season, and that would exclude the Med D business, which, as you know, is kind of up for renewal every year.","Per G. H. Lofberg","And Lisa, just to elaborate a little bit on the restricted networks, I think our expectation is that we will frequently be asked to quote on different network configurations, and that we'll be asked to provide different levels of savings for different sizes of networks, and all of our discussions with the benefit consultants sort of indicate that, that will probably be one of the variables that will be in play this year.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Per, have you been surprised that there hasn't been more noise around the exclusion of Walgreens and Express Scripts network? As you know, we talk to a lot of consultants and plan sponsors, and it doesn't appear to us that there's been a lot of disruption because of this. Obviously, maybe it's because CVS has done such a great job of taking over the scripts, but can you talk about your experience? Are you hearing from any of these clients that say, \u201cI want to switch because I don't -- I do want Walgreens in my network?\u201d","Per G. H. Lofberg","Nothing of that, Lisa. I mean, I have to actually tip my hat here to our competitor, Express. I think they have done an excellent job really making this change very smooth for their customers, and many of their clients that I've spoken to that actually have gone through this have been \u2013 they\u2019ve been very clear that this has not really been a big deal for them.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess and then just one follow-up to you, Larry, would just be that if they did come to some kind of resolution, generally speaking, how sticky are the scripts that have moved? So those people that have moved in January, how much of that business would you anticipate that you could retain if they ever came to a resolution?","Larry J. Merlo","Lisa, that's a great question, and we really don't have a benchmark against this. As I've said in the past, we know that that pharmacy customer is the hardest person to lose, but once you lose them, it's the hardest person to get back. And I believe the longer this goes on, the more sticky the customer will be, especially as they have the opportunity to refill their prescription a few times and get to know the pharmacist and the staff in the store. And obviously, our Retail teams are doing a great job in terms of doing everything that they can to engage those new customers.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple of things. So Larry, the improvement on the front end, are you seeing anything that you can tie to the Walgreen benefit or really not very much?","Larry J. Merlo","Yes, John, there's a little bit there, but as we were just talking with Lisa's question, the focus right now is making sure that, that transfer process and the administrative tasks associated with that, that is front and center in terms of what our store teams are focused on executing. And we're just beginning the process of getting these new customers enrolled in ExtraCare, as an example. So I think it's going to take several weeks to really shake out what the front store impact of this will be. And Mark can talk a little bit about some of the investments that we're making with that in mind.","Mark S. Cosby","Well, clearly, when the whole impasse began, we set up a plan to address what the opportunity could be. And we had several initiatives underway. We had several on the marketing front, both in terms of our circular and our TV. And we did a lot in terms of staffing and in terms of the resources by store and in terms of inventory that we deployed by store to be ready for it. But the biggest push was around service, making sure that every new customer that came into our store had a great experience, and that continues to be our biggest push. As we go forward, it's now about retention, so putting programs in place to make sure that the folks that do come into our store have a great experience and they stay with us.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","And now the $0.03 benefit is net of whatever investment you're making in staffing and marketing, right?","David M. Denton","That's correct, John.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","So do you still think -- because that's front loaded, do you still think that if this thing goes on for the rest of the year, there's a bigger benefit in the back half after those investments moderate or no?","David M. Denton","Well, I think we'll have -- well, I want to play it quarter by quarter, John. But we're very focused on executing at the store level today, making sure that the transfers -- that we give the best service possible, and we'll assess it after we get a few more weeks under our belt.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","And as you look at that windfall, and I asked you at the analyst meeting, is there anything you can find where you can invest some of these onetime windfall in the business, either PBM or Retail, to strengthen the franchise and take advantage of this windfall, or not really?","David M. Denton","Well, John, at the end of the day, we look at all the cash generation capabilities of the company and look to invest that money with the highest return possible for our shareholders. So we won't assess this any other way than that. So we'll keep looking for projects to either invest in our core business that has high return on investment for it, or we'll look to dividends and share repurchases to enhance value as well.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Well, I meant more can you add labor in the stores or put it into pricing on the PBM, or not capital so much but on operating expense, so the benefit to the P&L would be less but maybe more lasting and maybe more of an annuity?","David M. Denton","Yes. But I think we look at those as the same way, John.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right. And then one final thing. How did the whole Medco-Express kind of in limbo here impact the timing of selling season decisions? Maybe it's too early. Maybe it has to go on another month or 2, but is that impacting anything you see in terms of how people are making decisions or the timeline?","Per G. H. Lofberg","I don't think it's affecting the timing very much, John. The timing of RFP processes is basically very much driven by the contract term and the time it takes to transition accounts. Health plan accounts take longer to transition than employer accounts, and therefore, they tend to start a little earlier. I don't think that the Express-Medco merger per se is affecting the timing. I do think that the uncertainty around that certainly has given fuel to benefit consultants to really sort of recommend that clients go out to bid, and we'll certainly see market activity as a result of that.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Dane Leone with Macquarie group.","Dane Leone - Macquarie Research","This one is for Per. As we think about the 2013 selling season, I think we had a case example recently where a large plan reversed course from a prior decision in terms of favoring the financial bid over the technical bid. Are we seeing some change in how plans view the bidding process given kind of maybe a longer economic recovery than some people had previously thought back in 2011?","Per G. H. Lofberg","I'm not sure I know exactly what you're talking about, but I really don't think there is a significant change in the emphasis. People go out to bid, first and foremost, because they want to get the best possible economics they can get for their drug programs. And that, I think, has not really changed at all. Clearly, though, the integrated programs that we have, have made a difference here this past year, and we kind of expect to see that continue as there is broad adoption of this programs and longer track records in terms of the customer experience with them. So Maintenance Choice and Maintenance Choice 2.0, the Pharmacy Advisor program and so on that Larry referenced in his speech, those are really good features that allow us to kind of really highlight how we can add value to our enterprise.","Dane Leone - Macquarie Research","Great. And then on the MinuteClinic side, could you give us an idea of how profitability is expected to ramp up through the course of 2012?","Larry J. Merlo","Yes, Dane, I think as we've communicated in the past, in the fourth quarter, MinuteClinic actually hit a breakeven status for the first time at what we define as the enterprise level. And we will expect that to continue even as we expand the MinuteClinics going forward, so we're very pleased with what we're seeing there. And the role that MinuteClinic plays, as Per was talking about our integrated programs, there's an important MinuteClinic component to many of those.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Jefferies & Company.","Scott Andrew Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Really, two. First, to Per, how important is the Retail pharmacy network when a client is looking at a proposal? I assume it's one of the top 10, but where does it rank in your estimation as people look at proposals?","Per G. H. Lofberg","Well, it's very important, and the primary thing people look at is basically access. So they look at where their employees and dependents, where they live and what geographies have to be covered and the access that they can get to the network configuration that you're proposing. So it definitely is important, and at the end of the day, as you know, you can meet access standards very successfully with much less than 65,000 pharmacies around the country. So there is the trade-off to evaluate in terms of how many pharmacies you have in the network and the kind of economics you can offer up. So that trade-off is very real. But it certainly is a very, very important component of the PBM offering.","Scott Andrew Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And just, I assume though that it's among several things that people look at, or is it top 1 or 2 in your estimation?","Per G. H. Lofberg","No, it's 1 of, let's say, 5 major variables; the mail order program and, in our case, the Maintenance Choice program. It's a very important component that adds additional savings opportunities. The formulary and the rebates that are generated, generic programs that maximize the use of generics, that also offer additional savings. I mean, those are probably the 4 or 5 major items that go into the calculation.","Scott Andrew Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Perfect. And then I wanted to switch gears to Retail and also kind of bring in the free cash flow. As I look at what's going on with your business, there's clearly going to be starting a bubble of, looks like over the next 18 months, of just an enormous amount of traffic into those retail stores. And so that just smacks to me of opportunity. We haven't seen a real big kind of change in the format of the retail stores or a big re-merchandising effort. And I was wondering, as you look at the opportunity here, maybe this is more for Larry, how do you see it? I mean, to me, it seems like there's just a massive opportunity to grow maybe earnings a little bit faster in that Retail segment as you harvest this and also show nice improvements on return on invested capital, as a lot of capital is tied up in the Retail segments. So maybe you could comment on that?","Larry J. Merlo","Yes, Scott. Let me make a few comments, and then I'll ask Mark to comment on some of the initiatives that he has underway that I think addresses that question. But I think as we heard earlier, we're focused on making sure that these customers have just a terrific experience and that they continue and we continue to ensure that there's no interruption in their pharmacy care. As we've talked many times in the past, we'll continue to use ExtraCare as a differentiator in terms of how we can add value for those patients, as well as, quite frankly, how we communicate with those customers. And I'll ask Mark to talk about some of the work that he has underway around clustering and what future store may have in store, if you will.","Mark S. Cosby","That's a twofold answer, really. There's a number of things, short term, that we're doing between improving effectiveness of our promotion, looking at our productivity of our spaces in our store, particularly the high-traffic areas in our store, and then we have a number of things where we're empowering our store teams to take more accountability for sales. Those are some of the short-term things. The longer-term things that Larry alluded to, the biggest thing we probably have in the works is this clustering initiative. We had success this past year and the year before with the urban initiative, and we have a number of different clustering options that we are looking at right now, which we think will have some play in the second half of this year in a test mode and then rollout mode as we go into 2013. The broader one that Larry alluded to is around what we are calling the store of the future. So we do have a project underway, where we are relooking at everything that we do within our store, from the pharmacy to the front of the house, in terms of how do we really capitalize on the opportunity that's in front of us. And we do plan to have some test stores in place in the front part of next year, which I think we'll learn a lot both in terms of -- for new stores as we go forward, but also for remodel opportunities down the road.","Larry J. Merlo","Scott, I think the issue around this is that these are not new ideas. We've talked about this -- many people talked about this in years past. I think what's different today is that we have the information and we have the technology to execute it. And that was always the kind of the barrier to entry, if you will. So I think this is going to take some time, but I think that the prize here in terms of doing it well is pretty big.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallucci with Lazard Capital Markets.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","A couple of quick follow-ups. Just first, back on the restricted network idea, 2 questions there. One, how deep do you have to sort of restrict to get toward that 2% type of a savings that you mentioned earlier that might be important for customers to consider it? And is there any, I guess, strategy around maybe preferred-type networks as opposed to just simply restricting them or narrowing them down, where you can go to any network, but one is more expensive than another one, pharmacy is more expensive than another one?","Per G. H. Lofberg","Yes, so to your first question, Tom, I think you have to get to -- to get to like a 2%, 3% saving, you have to make a pretty significant change in the network, maybe bring it down by 20%, 30% or something like that to be able to approach those benefits. It's obviously driven by the value that accrues to people who remain in the network and the increased volume that they can project and the improved pricing that you can derive from that. So that's sort of a ballpark. With respect to the preferred networks, that's primarily been an opportunity recently in the Med D segment. You may have seen that last year, Humana came out with a program where Walmart was a preferred retailer. It was a pretty successful program. They got good traction with that. This year, there were a number of other participants that have similar types of programs, including Aetna together with CVS\/pharmacy. So there, you have the ability to meet all of the access standards that CMS require and, at the same time, offer significant copay advantages if members use the preferred retailers.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Do you think the preferred type of a strategy is something that could leak into the private sector, or there it would be more just narrowing it?","Per G. H. Lofberg","It's a good question. I haven't seen much activity around that on the commercial front, but there is no real fundamental reason why that couldn't happen there as well.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just the other follow-up was I think you mentioned some better generic purchasing. I was wondering if you could expand there. Did that sort of more relate to certain new drugs that were launched, or is it older drugs? Or any other color you could offer would be great.","Larry J. Merlo","Yes, I think what we -- I would just say that the team from a purchasing standpoint has just done a fabulous job throughout 2011, and we continue to push improvements to improve our cost of goods sold outlook, and that's just kind of us continuing to work pretty diligently in that space. So it's kind of across the generics but also on the branded side as well.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I got kicked off the call quickly, so if somebody asked this question, just tell me, and we'll move on. But your gross margin on the Retail business is something that I want to just ask about. The 140-basis-point decline, it's a little bit of a surprise, I think, to us, even though you guided it down and you had said it was a little disappointing. Can you help us parse out the individual items there? How much for reimbursements, how much for promotions, and then how much of that continues going forward into next year?","Larry J. Merlo","Yes, Ed, when we provided guidance for the fourth quarter, we expected margin to be down. We talked about continued pressures on pharmacy reimbursement. What we saw that was incremental to that was largely in the front store as it related to, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, a disappointing Christmas selling season. And as you know, those products are in a higher margin, and we also incurred some incremental markdowns. That's a onetime event in nature, and it's behind us, so we don't need to worry about that as we migrate into Q1. The other issue really ties to a weaker flu season, which, in the front end, in the OTC categories, that is heavily penetrated by store brands, which, again, higher margin. So that pressured margin, and again, that is seasonal in nature, so we don't see that occurring going forward as well.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And just on the reimbursement side, how much should we be concerned about that?","Larry J. Merlo","Well, Ed, as we talked, the reimbursement issues are what we've been managing through for several years now. We don't see that abating, and at the same time, we're comfortable in terms of our abilities to manage that going forward.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And if Express closes on Medco, how does that impact your thought on reimbursements? Is there a risk there? And I guess what I'm getting to is, what have you factored into guidance related to that?","Larry J. Merlo","Well, Ed, again, as we said back at Analyst Day, we have worked very hard on the Retail side to position ourselves as a good partner, a good long-term partner, okay, as well as being a low-cost provider. And we have worked with all the major PBMs with those guiding principles, and we see no reason to change that as we go forward.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And just last question for you. SG&A, down about 3.5% in Retail. It's a pretty big number. Can you just help us understand where it all came from?","David M. Denton","Yes, this is Dave. We have been very focused from a cost-containment perspective throughout the Retail division, so there's no one initiative that drove that. I would say that again, we've just continued to put in technologies and processes primarily in the pharmacy that have driven productivity gains across the enterprise, and that's really what continues to drive it.","Larry J. Merlo","And Ed, going forward, we will continue with that level of focus. But again, as we've discussed previously, because of the impact of generics, that SG&A leverage that we've seen in the past will be muted to some degree as a result of that.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Larry Marsh with Barclays Capital.","Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just 2 quick ones. One, in January, you announced that you\u2019d settle a 2-year investigation by the FTC and a 24-state task force for nearly $5 million after a lot of complaints by independent pharmacies and consumer groups, after the merger of CVS and Caremark. Based on the feedback you got was a message from the FTC that in their analysis, the PBM-Retail combination clearly didn't drive up costs or that there was clearly no evidence of conflict of interest in a limited network, or was there some other message that you got from that?","Larry J. Merlo","Well, Larry, thanks for asking that question because we are very pleased to have reached an agreement with the FTC that ends a very comprehensive and very extensive review of all of our business practices, along with the innovative and differentiated products and services that we're bringing to market. And we're very pleased that there were no allegations of anti-trust violations, no allegations of anticompetitive behavior related to any of our business practices, products or service offerings. So we are full speed ahead in terms of the focus that we have in terms of bringing differentiation that improves health and lower costs. And so that's my sermon, okay? And the other thing that I would acknowledge is that the $5.5 million settlement that related to legacy RxAmerica practices was prior to the acquisition of Longs Drugs, so we were, again, very pleased with the outcome of that, and we believe it's a validation of our business model.","Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And to the validation, is your message that scale in this case can actually drive down costs and create product innovation, or is it just, no, let's just not be too broad, this is really just about CVS and Caremark?","Larry J. Merlo","No, I think this is about CVS and Caremark, and I think it, quite frankly, it speaks to Per's comments earlier in terms of the fact that you have to be priced competitively in the marketplace. But our products and services are allowing a form of differentiation for CVS Caremark that is allowing us to win disproportionately in the marketplace.","Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Very good. A quick follow-up just on Medicaid, I know you called out some fourth quarter startup costs. There's been a lot of discussion about states moving more to managed care plans both for duals and those covered under CHIP, and I know, Per, you've called out the opportunity. Are you able to elaborate a little bit on the opportunity, potential benefit of Texas moving to MCOs, March of this year? And in that market, how able are you to run restricted retail networks?","Per G. H. Lofberg","Yes. I mean, we expect to participate in the Texas conversion because we have a number of existing clients down there that will benefit from the move of lives into managed Medicaid. And I certainly would expect what Texas is doing and what Ohio and New York have done, and so on, that, that will be replicated by many other states in the years to come. And there are pretty significant cost savings associated with those conversions. And as you've kind of alluded to, restricted networks are possible in the managed Medicaid arena. And so we participate in a number of states with a number of customers where we have restricted networks in place.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Two quick questions for you. First of all, as you look at the Retail top line and at the front end, in particular, and you think about the magnitude of your inventory declines, which were quite impressive, do you feel like the inventory position or the in-stock could, at this point, given the very sharp declines, be having some impact on your Retail sales?","Larry J. Merlo","No, Matt. We don't believe that's the case, and we've monitored that very closely. And there were a few isolated geographic issues that were process-related that were very short in duration, and those were remedied. So we're very focused and very careful that it's not at the expense of service levels to our customers.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then my second question, if you think about the Express-Walgreens dispute and the possibility that, at some point, perhaps, this is resolved, what kind of efforts are you implementing to try to ensure that the business that you win through this dispute is sustainable business for you and that these customers can become long-term customers for you, not just temporary customers, if you will?","Mark S. Cosby","Well, thanks. This is Mark again. As I said upfront, big push that we had from the get-go was to make sure that we\u2019re providing a great experience to each new customer that walked in the door. And we believe that's the #1 thing that we can do to retain them over time. We do have a number of other things that we can do both in the front store and the pharmacy, including ExtraCare, to try and really pushing that program to encourage more loyalty over time. But probably a big a priority as we have right now is how do we make the experience as good as it can be and retain those customers over time.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I have a couple of follow-up questions. First, on the market share gains from Walgreens, can you quantify for us what percent of the business that you gained you would categorize as maintenance scripts? And do you think that maintenance scripts could be more sticky than overall scripts?","Larry J. Merlo","Well, Ricky, recognizing that this situation is -- we're 4, 5 weeks into this now, we don't have that level of detail at this point in time. As I mentioned earlier, our focus is getting those customers enrolled in our systems and making that transfer process as seamless as we can. I think it's intuitive that the maintenance customer has the potential to be a stickier customer because they're using the pharmacy on a regular basis versus the individual that has an acute episode that may use the pharmacy once or, perhaps, twice a year. And I think a lot of the things that Mark alluded to will be focused on those maintenance customers.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then one other follow-up on the Specialty business, what was the Specialty growth once you exclude kind of the benefit from Aetna?","Per G. H. Lofberg","I don't think we have provided that breakout. We did have very strong growth in Specialty, as was reported earlier, and a significant component of that was Aetna, for sure, but the category itself is growing because of just the increased utilization, and we've had some additional PBM growth that added to it.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just trying to get a little bit better feel for the marketing battle behind the scenes for the Walgreens business that's up for grabs. So I guess my 2 questions are, is there any sense of a tug-of-war between CVS pushing these customers to Retail versus maybe Express trying to push them to mail order? And do you have any sense of whether the mail order industry overall is picking up any share, or do you think that retail scripts are basically just staying in the retail channel?","Larry J. Merlo","Yes, Steve, I mean, our retail organization has worked very well and very closely with Express in terms of how we can make this as seamless an experience as possible. And quite frankly, as Per mentioned earlier in terms of giving Express a compliment in terms of how they've handled this, I, too, believe they've done a terrific job with both their clients as well as working with -- and I'm sure it's not just CVS, it's other retailers as well, in terms of working closely to make it as seamless as possible for their members.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of John Ransom with Raymond James.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just looking at your PBM business, do you anticipate at some point that the revenue growth and the operating income growth will sync up, or do you think this is a business that you'll see better revenue growth than operating income growth for the intermediate term?","Per G. H. Lofberg","I think you know what our long-term guidance has been on that subject, and we've kind of talked about it at Analyst Day. And so certainly, for the foreseeable future, over the next several years, we expect revenues to grow at a higher rate than the operating income.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, and just one more question. Just one other thing, any comments on Lipitor? Are you indifferent as to who has market share on the manufacturing side given your dual PBM retail structure?","Larry J. Merlo","Yes, John, what we're seeing over the last 2 months is Lipitor is behaving as we had forecasted. In our Retail business, our substitution rate is in the mid-70s at this point in time. And we expect that, that will continue to increase and probably have an acceleration once the exclusivity period expires in late May, early June.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","Two questions. First of all on Walgreens, the $0.03, can you split at all the benefit even roughly that you think you're seeing in the pharmacy relative to the front end?","Larry J. Merlo","Eric, we covered that or we touched on that a little earlier, it's very early in the game. We are -- we believe some of the front store lift that we've seen in January is attributable to that, but we will -- I think over the next several weeks, we'll be able to do a better job of quantifying that as we're able to get these customers enrolled in ExtraCare and so on.","Mark S. Cosby","Eric, I think, in the short-term here, at least for the first quarter, you think about dominant in pharmacy versus front end.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","And then secondly, I think you touched on this a little bit, but in terms of PBM profits growing faster than you thought in 4Q, and I know you didn't do anything different with the '12 PBM profit expectation, what was in 4Q that helped, and is there a potential that, that continues in '12?","Mark S. Cosby","Well, I think we had, through 4Q, we did see some accelerated utilization in the quarter, and I think we're very focused on delivering our expectations in 2012. And the guidance that we provided at Analyst Day, we feel very comfortable on where we stand. So I don't know if there's anything that's going to wrap, if you will, into 2012 specifically related on trends in the fourth quarter, but we're very confident where we stand today.","Larry J. Merlo","Okay. Well, listen, we want to thank everyone for your interest and your time this morning, and I'm sure we'll talk to many of you soon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We achieved strong performance in the fourth quarter, and in full-year 2018. And importantly with the completion of our merger with Aetna, we have positioned CVS Health to excel in a market that is undergoing profound and rapid transformation.","In recent years, it has become increasingly evidence that the path to long-term growth and value creation lies in the establishment of new integrated health care models that provide consumers better care convenience at a lower cost. And since closing the Aetna merger, we are increasingly confident in the synergistic potential of this powerful combination to build and deliver shareholder value.","A CVS Health is in a superior position to lead the change needed in the fragmented U.S. Health Care System with our compelling fully integrated health care offerings, our unmatched local community assets, proven pharmacy care leadership and a commitment to collaborating with health care providers to achieve the very best outcomes for the patients and clients we serve.","In 2018, we've delivered on our financial expectations as set Aetna laying a strong foundation for a successful combination. We generated significant cash flows with nearly $7 billion of free cash for full-year '18, consistent with our expectations, and we returned $2 billion back to shareholders through dividends and later deployed the cash we raised in early '18 to fund the Aetna merger. So in short, 2018 was a milestone year both tactically and strategically as we successfully completed our transformational merger with Aetna.","Now, we also delivered our key foundational steps for growth in health care services. This includes making more than 80% of primary care services available to consumers at MinuteClinic, while also increasing home visits by Coram for infusion services by more than 15%. Importantly, we began effective implementation of our integration strategy and took important steps toward building the integrated health care model that will bring substantial value to our various stakeholders.","Now we expect 2019 to be a year of transition as we integrate Aetna, and focus on key pillars of our growth strategy, creating a more consumer-centric health care experience. As an example, our first three concept stores were unveiled earlier this month. And you probably saw press coverage last week. And there's a lot of excitement around the consumer engagement and response. Now it's still early as we're in the learning phase and working to define a hub-and-spoke approach, but it's an example of the work underway. And I'll share additional progress on achieving our vision in just a few minutes.","Now, that's said, we're also fully aware of the need to address the impact of certain headwinds that are having a disproportionate impact in '19 when compared to prior years. Many of these issues we've talked about previously and most significant is the ongoing pharmacy reimbursement pressures in our businesses and the reduction in offsets to those pressures. What we're experiencing in '19 is the declining benefit from new generics, lower brand inflation and the ongoing questions around rebates, along with some structural and CVS-specific challenges in the long-term care space. And while these factors will negatively affect the business in the short-term, I want to outline the comprehensive actions we have taken in response.","In our Retail business, we are continuing to develop product and service initiatives that will accelerate top line revenue and profitability. We are winning from a growth perspective and we expect to continue on those positive trends. In the front store, this includes introducing new product lines in the health and beauty areas along with the expansion of higher margin service offerings.","In the Pharmacy, we will continue to deliver market leading top line growth through our network relationships and clinical care programs. Additionally, we are developing a new retail contracting strategy that better aligns reimbursement to the value our clinical products provide enabling adherence improvements and star enhancements, while saving patients' money, to name just a few.","Second, in the PBM, we've created a new contracting model that provides for more transparency, simplicity for and alignment with our clients. The guaranteed net cost pricing model is an innovative way to approach the market by allowing us to maximize all cost control tools that are disposal. In this model, clients will receive 100% of rebates, while we leverage our core strengths of contracting expertise and utilization management to drive lower net costs for clients and members without compromising on the quality of care.","Now this is a win-win. Clients will benefit from the simplicity of one guaranteed price per claim that's focused on lower net costs and not discounts and rebates. Now we've introduced this approach to clients and benefit consultants, and we will have a small number of clients adopting the model this year. We expect a more rapid adoption in '20 and beyond.","Third, back in August, we outlined a 4-point plan to get the long-term care business back on track. And while progress is being made in the identified areas, the benefits are being offset by the external factors impacting the skilled nursing business. And work is underway to accelerate the action plan timeline to achieve the benefits more quickly. And we've already begun to see some progress realizing nearly $80 million in process improvement savings with more to come.","Forth, in early January, we began planning a new cost reduction effort across the enterprise going beyond the previously announced productivity initiatives of the legacy companies and targeting opportunities that neither company would be able to accomplish as a standalone. This separate is in addition to the near-term synergy work tied to the $750 million target, which we are on track to exceed.","If we look across the new combined enterprise, there are significant streamlining opportunities and member enrollment, claims processing and customer service, as well as through the use of robotics and advanced analytics. Additionally, we are focused on aggressively managing working capital, especially through the reduction of inventory and improvement of terms within our payables. And we'll have more details for you on our May earnings call.","And finally, we continue to evaluate our assets and the roles they play in enabling the core strategies of our new company. So we'll provide updates to the actions we have underway as we execute our vision in a strategic and innovative yet practical, realistic, and carefully prioritize way. We understand acutely the importance of balancing near-term execution with longer-term vision, and we are confident that these actions will position us well in 2020 and beyond.","Now, several key pillars that we are executing on today will drive above market growth going forward in this rapidly changing health care environment. And a few key initiatives that underlie the ongoing execution of our strategy are as follows. First, we are growing membership. We are working to expand the reach of our government business with Medicare position to lead the way. Medicare advantage top line growth is being driven by the addition of new membership and existing markets, and continued geographic expansion. Driving excellence in STAR ratings continues to be a primary focus for our business. And by enhancing our clinical model products and capabilities, we are expanding our offering to take care of higher acuity and complex members, including dual eligibles that critically important set of beneficiaries, when bending the cost curve.","Our success and building the largest Medicare Part D plan SilverScript, while simultaneously becoming the partner of choice for more than 40 Health Plan Part D clients, gives us the confidence that we can further expand upon the success of both organizations.","Looking ahead, we see a strong and growing pipeline of new business opportunities within Group Medicare for 2020, and we see opportunity as well within Medicaid building upon the success we've had with recent wins in Kansas and Florida. And of course, we are actively working to strengthen our commercial offerings.","Now, success in all of these areas requires the use of our full breath of capabilities, comprehensive data, predictive analytics and our unparalleled intervention points with consumers to drive behavior change and improve health outcomes. And both Aetna and CVS Caremark have very successful employer businesses, and we're working on opportunities to create new products and services to meet the needs of these payers.","Backend we are creating differentiated products and services at the community level, driving meaningful value for both consumers and payers, while improving the bottom line. Now this reflects our broad base of consumer facing assets that is highlighted by our nearly 10,000 CVS pharmacies. And I touched on the first concept stores earlier, but importantly, our assets extend well beyond our pharmacies, when you think about the role and the value that MinuteClinic, Coram, Accordant, and other ancillary businesses can play. And while our community assets have the power to improve outcomes and reduce costs, they also contribute to enterprise revenue and earnings growth. Third is the role of partnerships in accelerating innovation. And our recent announcement with Apple on the development and springtime rollout of Attain by Aetna is just one example. Applying new technologies will be a component of our consumer centric approach to improving health.","And finally, we are establishing the optimal structure and go-to-market strategy for our health services offerings. We've been very clear about our vision of creating an open platform model that will serve the needs of all payers. And to support this goal, we are integrating existing capabilities with new products and services that will benefit all Aetna and Caremark clients and their members. And we are on track to have this in market for the 2021 selling season.","So we're more excited than ever about our progress and the opportunities that lie ahead. We also have a good understanding of the factors that impact our business in the near term and are actively working to address them. We view 2019 as a bridge for the future. And we expect our businesses to strengthen meaningfully from the integration of CVS and Aetna's core capabilities.","Now, I'm also pleased to introduce the leaders of our businesses. John Roberts, Chief Operating Officer; Kevin Hourican, President of CVS Pharmacy; Karen Lynch, President of Aetna; and Derica Rice, President of CVS Caremark. They'll be joining us for the Q&A after our prepared remarks. And our senior leadership team is energized by the prospects of our new company and together with all of our colleagues across the enterprise we are laser-focused and fully committed to delivering on the vast potential of this combination.","So let me turn the call over to Eva to walk through key items from '18 and the details of our '19 financial outlook.","Eva Boratto","Thanks, Larry, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into the details of our results and guidance, please note there is a significant amount of information in the presentation we posted to our website this morning to help you understand the changes to our financials for both 2018 and 2019.","Regarding 2018, while the face of the P&L is different, definitions of the non-GAAP are consistent with legacy CVS. However, interest income is shifting from net interest expense to revenues to conform to insurance company presentation. With that, I'll provide some key highlights for 2018.","As Larry stated, CVS Health generated significant free cash of nearly $7 billion for the full-year '18. And we used it in addition to the cash on hand to repay $5.5 billion in debt, of which $3.5 billion were scheduled maturities and $2 billion was a voluntary early repayment of a 5-year term loan. We also delivered $2 billion to shareholders through our dividend.","We delivered adjusted EPS of $7.08 at the high end of our guidance range, reflecting the addition of Aetna, with all of our businesses performing at our expectations. On a standalone basis, CVS Health's adjusted revenue grew 2.3% in 2018, at the top end of our full-year guidance range. With the addition of 34 days of Aetna's operations, which are now embedded in our new Health Care Benefits segment, adjusted revenues grew 5% to $194 billion, with HCB contributing an additional $5.1 billion after considering elimination.","In 2018, the Retail\/Long Term Care segment delivered adjusted script growth of 8.8%, driven by our pharmacy clinical programs comprised of increased adoption of 90-day program, as well as the successful partnering with PBMs and health plans via network relationships, including additional preferred positions in a number of Med D networks.","Adjusted operating income declined by 1.2%, driven by our decision to invest a portion of the benefits we've realized from tax reform into wages and benefits. Additionally, we continue to experience underperformance in the long-term care pharmacy business. Excluding those two items, standalone retail pharmacy adjusted operating income grew solidly by about 5% over full-year 2017. Notably, our market leading script growth increased our pharmacy market share to a record 26% in December.","In the PBM, adjusted claims increased 6.1% over full-year 2017, driven by net new business wins and continued adoption of maintenance choice. PBM operating income was up nearly 1%, as expected. The formulary and cost management strategies, Caremark has developed effectively mitigated drug costs increases in 2018. Prices for non-specialty medications decreased 4.2% for commercial clients, while we also held price growth on specialty products to just 1.7%, despite even higher list price increases. We also worked to improve health outcomes and reduce member costs successfully driving the average cost per script for plan members down for a third year in a row.","And finally, the Health Care Benefits medical membership was 22.1 million. Government programs represented approximately half of HCB's insured membership at year end '18 positioning the segment to drive future growth. Overall, HCB operations performed as we expected. Medicare advantage membership growth materially outpaced the market fuelled in part by our strong STAR's performance. Our clinical care and service programs expanded their reach in 2018, resonating in the marketplace and strengthening the value proposition of our commercial offerings.","Adjusted gross margin for legacy CVS Health was 15.6%, up 20 basis points compared to full-year 2017. This was due to mix given that the higher margin retail business grew faster than the PBM. Total adjusted operating expense dollars increased 12%, largely driven by the addition of Aetna's business as well as investments from a portion of the tax reform benefits into the retail business and cost to support pharmacy growth. As noted in our press release this morning, due to continued industry-wide and operational challenges, in Q4, we've recorded a $2.2 billion goodwill impairment charge on the long-term care business.","Transitioning to our 2019 guidance, there are a few key changes to note. Beginning in '19, we are realigning or segments for changes to our operating model that I'll detail shortly. And our adjusted operating income guidance reflects the adoption of Aetna's legacy definition, which excludes intangible amortization.","We maintain the same definition for adjusted EPS, which excludes intangible amortization and transaction and integration costs, which were consistent across both companies. A summary of the changes is included in the slides we posted to our website along with the full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation. 2018 has been adjusted for comparability as appropriate.","As stated in our press release, consolidated full-year adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $6.68 to $6.88, down from the $7.08 we reported in 2018. We expect consolidated full-year 2019 adjusted operating income between $14.8 billion to $15.2 billion with consolidated revenue in the range of $249.9 billion to $254.3 billion. For the segments, we expect operating income in the Retail\/Long Term Care segment to be in the range of $6.6 billion to $6.7 billion and Pharmacy Services segment in the range of $4.8 billion to$ 4.9 billion.","We expect that HCB segment operating income to be in the range of $5.1 billion to $5.2 billion. Significant synergies will be generated by the combined business this year stemming from elimination of duplicative corporate and operational functions, purchasing efficiencies, and some medical cost savings including formulary alignment. These synergies are expected to be between $300 million and $350 million in 2019, and we are on track to exceed our goal of $750 million in 2020.","Additionally, there will be investments and initiatives designed to set the foundation for future new product offerings. Investments are being made to further our analytics and digital capabilities develop new programs such as chronic kidney care, and enhance Aetna's clinical platform. We expect our incremental investment spending to be between $325 million and $350 million in 2019.","Integration costs of approximately $550 million are excluded from our non-GAAP guidance. We expect to deliver between $9.8 billion to $10.3 billion of cash flow from operations. We remain committed to our capital allocation priorities. After the payment of our shareholder dividend, capital retention to support our insurance operation and growth capital expenditures of $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion, we will use the remaining cash available to continue to pay down debt.","As we stated, when we announced the Aetna acquisition, while we intend to maintain our shareholder dividend, we will not restart share repurchases or engage in large M&A transactions until we achieve our leverage targets. We expect to pay down our maturities this year as they come to and have other sources of pre-payable debt available to us. We expect leverage to modestly improve, and we will pay down debt in line with previous expectations.","Moving on to the segments, for the year, we expect Retail\/Long Term of revenue to be between $85.3 billion and $86.8 billion with adjusted operating income down about 10%. Retail is expected to continue to deliver strong adjusted script growth in the range of 4.5% and 6.8% due to continued successful execution of our pharmacy clinical care program that drive improved adherence and patient retention. Additionally, we will experience growth in the Medicare partnerships we formed in 2018, as well as a few new regional preferred relationships in 2019. The contraction and adjusted operating income reflects the annualization of tax reform investments and expected performance of long term care. These factors are expected to contribute nearly half of the contraction.","Continued reimbursement pressure without the full benefits of traditional offsets is also causing contraction. Historically, reimbursement pressure has been primarily offset by growth in generics as well as inflation on branded pharmaceuticals. We will experience a larger year-over-year headwind from a lower contribution from break-open generics and diminished return on generic dispensing increases.","The front of store is expected to drive margin with a focus on winning in our health and beauty businesses through improved customer personalization and consumer engagement. Front store margin rate and dollars are expected to expand year-over-year.","As we look to the future, we believe CVS Retail is best position in the market to deal with the challenges we see. Our best-in-class clinical programs will allow us to continue to gain market share. We have strong partnerships with payers, including incentives to drive dispensing into our CVS channel. And finally, we will continue to drive efficiencies in our pharmacies through the use of technology and productivity improvements.","Now, let me turn to the PBM. This segment's 2019 reported figures will be affected by two important reporting changes. First, our Individual SilverScript PDP will move from the PBM segment to the Health Care Benefits segment enabling us to rapidly create the best products for seniors in advance of the 2020 bid season, in this important part of our business. We have restated 2018 results for comparability. And this information is also available on our website.","Second, we will consolidate the pharmacy operations of Aetna into the PBM to enable us to rapidly drive efficiencies. For the PBM segment, in 2019, we expect revenue to be in the range of $136.5 billion to $139 billion with adjusted operating income down low-single-digits. There are a few key elements driving 2019 PBM performance to note. As we have stated previously, price compression continues to be a factor in the marketplace, exacerbating the impact is the cumulative effect on rebate guarantees due to lower branded inflation.","Second, the net benefits from the 2019 selling season are expected to be modest. And we expect Anthem to remain a stronger headwind given the investments required to onboard the business on its accelerated timeline. The on-boarding is expected to begin in the second quarter of this year. As a reminder, the revenue for this contract will be recorded on a net basis.","Our retention rate stands at a strong 98% for 2019. In addition, Centene has notified us of their intent to move their business to their PBM partner RxAdvance. It is expected to begin in 2019, although the exact timing is not clear at this point. The retention rate I mentioned, excludes any impact from this transition.","Additionally, the PBM will benefit from the segment's shift. On a like-for-like basis, operating income will be down mid-single digits versus 2018. It is clear that the PBM industry is in the middle of an environmental change given the dialogue around rebate. However, it is also clear that the PBM brings tremendous savings and value to the clients we serve. The importance of size, scale and customer relationships will continue to be paramount, and we remain focused on delivering the value our clients expect.","Finally, in the Health Care Benefits segment, we expect revenue between $67.7 billion and $68.7 billion in 2019. We expect continued strength in our government programs with top line increases, driven by industry-leading Medicare growth as well as the key Medicaid wins in Kansas and Florida. We expect to end the year between 22.7 million and 23 million medical members as we expect strong commercial ASC membership teams to complement our government program growth.","A handful of other dynamics will impact HCB results, including: year one deal synergies will disproportionately benefit the HCB segment; second, incremental investments will be deployed in 2019 to accelerate growth, enhance infrastructure and drive market differentiation; third, the suspension of the Health Insurer Fee in 2019 will impact certain operating ratios, while the after-tax impact of this suspension versus 2018 is immaterial.","And finally, certain onetime benefits realized by Aetna in 2018 are not expected to repeat in 2019, and the HCB segment will be negatively affected by the segment movements discussed earlier. Excluding the segment news, the incremental investments we're making in 2019 to accelerate growth and the impact of the HIF suspension, HCB operating income is expected to grow modestly.","Turning to operating efficiencies, both CVS and Aetna have had a strong history of successful cost productivity initiatives. And as we begin integrating the two companies, we are seeing the opportunity to accelerate our cost savings across the enterprise even further than originally expected. As Larry stated, we are embarking upon an aggressive cost reduction initiative. The savings this will generate will help offset the competitive dynamics we have experienced, drive the creation of more affordable products for our customers and provide capacity that will help us achieve our financial targets as we continue to invest in our strategic and transformational initiatives. We are confident that these initiatives will help drive longer-term growth in the combined business beyond 2019.","Before I wrap up, I want to touch on expectations for the first quarter and the remainder of the year. In Q1, we expect to deliver adjusted EPS of $1.49 to $1.53, and GAAP EPS of $1.4 to $1.8.","As you look at the spreads for the remainder of the year, you can assume that the seasonality of our expected results this year will closely resemble that of our reported results in 2018. Year-over-year growth of consolidated adjusted operating income will be highest through the first three quarters as we wrap the addition of Aetna. In the legacy CVS business, Retail, Long Term Care and PBM, we expect to see our greatest level of year-over-year deterioration in Q1 with operating income growth in those segments improving as we move throughout the year. Adjusted operating income within HCB is expected to be greatest in Q1 and lowest in Q4.","At our Investor Day in June, we will provide you a more detailed roadmap to long-term growth. We will provide you with our long-term targets, including more specifics around the innovative products and services we plan to bring to market. We'll also layout our capital structure and allocation plan to provide you with more visibility into the timeline for returning more capital to shareholders, while also continuing to invest in the business.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Larry.","Larry Merlo","All right. Thanks, Eva. Well, CVS is much better position to provide value to our customers and the broader community through our new enterprise model. And our diversified company is providing our stakeholders with a highly effective ability to make health care more local, more simple, and less costly, while reducing our dependencies on dispensing revenue and maximizing the benefits from value added services.","We have a number of unique offerings being piloted or launched in the coming months. And those capabilities utilize enterprise assets in a differentiated way with the goal of increasing consumer engagement, while improving health outcomes and lowering costs. As an example, expanding MinuteClinic services and incorporating CVS community assets in conjunction with Aetna analytics around the member's next best action will allow us to help individuals achieve a better health outcome. And we see tremendous opportunities ahead, whether it's improving adherence, close the gaps in care, engaging high risk members through care managers or providing new approaches to complex disease management. Just take the mitigation of hospital readmissions. We understand the contributing factors to readmission and we can now bring solutions to those factors. Aetna had about 470,000 hospital discharges in 2017, and about 47,000 of those were readmitted at an average cost of $14,000. If we're successful cutting that number in half, we remove more than $300 million of costs, while creating a better patient experience.","Again, the list of opportunities goes well beyond the few examples mentioned. Importantly, many of these unique service offerings will ultimately be available to our health plan clients creating value across the health care system. And it's this combination of assets and capabilities that will ultimately drive enterprise growth and create significant shareholder value. ","So with that, let's go ahead and open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Cherny from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Michael Cherny","Larry, Eva, if we think about all the headwinds, in particular, that you outlined going back to the -- your conference presentation last month, I guess, relative to then, what was bigger than you expected? And I guess, most importantly, as you think about all of the big ones, whether it's, Omnicare, Anthem, Centene transition, et cetera, what do you view as the most transitory, in particular, what you have the most confidence in their transitory that'll be able to reverse itself or at least improve in '20 and beyond?","Larry Merlo","Yes, Mike, it's Larry. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Mike, as you look at the transitory nature of the headwinds, you think about the impact of the investments in tax reform. That rolls off midyear of this year. You look at the inflation impact on our rebate guarantees. That peaks in 2019 and rolls off at the end of 2020. We certainly expected Omnicare performance to stabilize and improve. And as you think about the contribution of generics, as we've talked many times, they're going to be peaks and valleys that can occur in any given year. As we sit here today and look at what that looks like for 2020, we expect that to improve, so many of these headwinds are transitory in nature. And also keep in mind that there are parts of the business that have momentum, growth in Medicare, growth in the commercial business. We've got momentum at retail much just in front store growth and pharmacy growth as well. And we're really pleased with the speed with which we're executing the integration activities.","Eva Boratto","And, Larry -- again seeing that that I would add there, as Larry outlined, we also see additional opportunities to continue to manage our call space and reduce our core to help mitigate these headwinds as we go forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lisa Gill from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.","Lisa Gill","Let me just -- first, just go back to the guidance, again. And just looking at the different segments versus our numbers in the street, it looks like the biggest headwind year-over-year is clearly on the Retail side. Larry, when you talked about things that were transitory, not, obviously, --Omnicare, being one of them. Is that the biggest driver, one within Retail, you talked about a new type of model around reimbursement? It says something that you believe will take hold in 2020 and reimbursement will start looking better. I just really want to understand how we think about how retail really turns around would be the first part of my question. And then secondly, how do we think about that $3 billion cost cutting initiative that you talked about a couple of years ago? Where do we see that in the numbers? And how is that coming along?","Eva Boratto","Hi, Lisa, this is Eva. I'll start, okay. As you think about the performance in Retail, contracting about 10%, the impact of Omnicare as well as the tax reform investment that it represents about half of the contraction. And clearly, the next most significant driver is what Larry described around lower benefit from generics in 2019. In terms of the streamlining efforts, that is on track, and we're delivering in line with our expectation. It's reflected in both the PBM and the Retail segments.","Kevin Hourican","Good morning, Lisa, this is Kevin. I can also talk about the longer-term component. Our plan to improve profit outlook in Retail is focused on three very important things. First is to grow the top line. Increasing the script volumes enables us to leverage the highly fixed-cost nature of retail pharmacy fulfillment. That's the first. The second is to lower our fixed and variable costs. As Eva just spoke through, there is significant productivity improvement, namely automation within the pharmacy fulfillment process as well as continued reduction in cost of goods sold through Red Oak. The third, and Larry mentioned this in his prepared remarks, is the migration to a new and improved third-party peer contracting model. We will align incentives with payers to lower overall health care costs and begin to reduce the pressure over time on the actual core pharmacy reimbursement rates.","Lisa Gill","And then, just as a follow-up to that, is Omnicare strategic to the company going forward? I mean, if I listen to you, Omnicare has been a headwind last year. Even you just talked about it being half of the headwind for 2019. Is this a strategic asset for CVS going forward?","Larry Merlo","Lisa, it's Larry. The growth opportunity with Omnicare was always focused on the independent and assisted living spaces. And those opportunities still exist. And they're consistent with our strategy of putting the customer at the new place of transforming care. The challenges that we have in that business are really around the skilled nursing facilities, which happen worse than we originally expected.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Please go ahead.","Ralph Giacobbe","Just going back, I was hoping to -- and I can certainly understand the directional commentary. But are you guys willing actually sort of quantify the drags in each of the buckets, as you sort of laid out the headwinds just gives more clarity on kind of the numbers and the size of each of the drags?","Eva Boratto","Yes, Ralph, this is this Eva. In terms of -- I tried to quantify the pieces of it. As you look at Retail, which has the most significant impact. The impact of Omnicare, as well as the annualized impact of the tax reform investment, is driving nearly half of the contraction on the Retail business. And think about the remainder, clearly the lack of generics as the biggest driver there. Certainly on the PBM side, the impact of the cumulative nature of the rebate guarantees affected by the lower inflation is a pretty significant driver on the PBM business. Additionally, we said it'll keep in '19. We had some impact in '18. It's what new is that the key element moving us to the lower end of our guidance rage. And we do expect that to move through 2020.","Ralph Giacobbe","And then just maybe a quick follow-up, you had a little more time to digest the HHS rebate proposal. Any updated thoughts there, and particularly, if it gets implemented for 1120? And then more broadly, you mentioned the new PBM sort of net pricing model. You expect, I think, you expect to see a small number initially and more rapid adoption beyond 2022. I guess, how do you drive that change, particularly if employees like the legacy model? And do you see yourselves perhaps moving to just that net pricing model and just moving away from rebates altogether? Thanks.","Larry Merlo","Yes, Ralph, it's Larry. Maybe I'll take the first part and flip it over to Derek and talk about the new pricing model. But as you look at the rebate role, we fully support the administration's objectives where were drug prices and out-of-pocket costs for consumers. And CVS has pioneered a number of innovative solutions that hit delivered against that goal. Unfortunately, we see the rebate role taking us backwards, not forwards. And we've been very public about the fact that 100% of rebates are turned over in the Medicare business, and have been utilized by down premiums. You look at that dynamic, premiums will increase in some actuarial report have it, growing as much as 52%. We actually took a step back and looked at today's Part B program. We went back to 2009, we looked at monthly premiums, 10 years ago, we were $29, 10 years later, $32. At the same time you look at generics, they represent about 90% of all Part D scripts that are dispensed. So those are two important data points that absolutely point to premiums increasing for everyone. And the reality that, yes, a small percentage of seniors may not have favorably, but again, the actuaries are estimating as many as 70% of beneficiaries are going to be worse off. So one of the concerns that we have is that we'll -- fewer beneficiaries' sign up for Part D, and then you look at the estimated cost that $200 billion over 10 years. And it put taxpayers on the hook and branded pharma ends up with a profit windfall. There are certainly readily available solutions in the commercial space that can be applied to Medicare. And you look at what those potentially could be. We work with commercial clients today to reduce out-of-pocket costs with Point of Sale rebates and the utilization of a preventive drug list. We think programs like that are far better solutions than the proposed role. And we also have -- we've talked about the real-time benefits tool in Caremark. Kevin's got a similar program in our retail pharmacies. And both of those tools have reduced out-of-pocket costs for consumers. So we're certainly laying in during the comment period, with our concerns with the rebate role, but more importantly, what we believe the appropriate solutions are to address the root cost of what we're trying to solve for. Derica?","Derica Rice","Good morning, Ralph, this is Derica. In regards to our new pricing model, what we're calling the guarantee net cost model, we've had two clients who adopted for 2019. In addition to that, we've already provided to all of the benefit consultants draft contract language. So they've been able to walk through and see all of the elements in terms of the fine print and the details. The feedback thus far has been very positive. So we will look to continue to drive a more rapid adoption through the remainder of '19 and more specifically for the 2020 period. In terms of rebates, whether we have rebates or discounts, what we really want is still the opportunity and this is kind of piggybacking on HHS rule question. Our ability to execute formulary management, which is the methodology we've been able -- as a tool, we've been able to use historically to be able to free rebate or discounts from manufacturers to create value for our clients and our members. So as long as we have access to that where we have to be able to do that with the manufacturers, we will be able to execute the GNC model. And really what this means is getting to the lowest net costs. It is not a focus on aggregate rebate value.","Eva Boratto","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Justin Lake","First, I wanted to discuss rebate guarantees and the break-over generics. I'm just trying to understand and make the 2020. So it sounded like, Larry, you said, break-over generics get better in 2020 versus 2019. You give us any order of magnitude there and then same thing on rebate generic views. It sounds like it peak in '19. Does it get better in 2020 in your mind? And maybe you could tell us about some of the remediation that you've assumed in these -- in your guidance about rebate guarantees?","Jonathan Roberts","Yes, Justin, this is John. I'll take the generic question for. So, the overall dollar amount of generic launches in '19 is similar to what we saw in '18, but there are some key differences. So you heard us talk about less value from break-open generics in '19 compared to '18. And that's primarily due to the timing of the launches leading to slower progress in '19 to the break-open status. But there are also more generics launching in '19 compared to '18 that are single source generics, where we're unable to optimize our profitability during that exclusivity period. And as a result, these generics for the most part are headwinds in '19. And finally, in '19, we're seeing generics that launch with limited competition stay with limited competition even after the exclusivity period expires. And this is driven by many factors, including manufacturing, complexity and regulatory approval timelines. But as we look forward into 2020, based on what we know today, we see 2020 improving from where we were in '19.","Derek Gorney","And Justin, this is Derek. In regards to the rebate guarantees exposure, just recall from both Eva and Larry's remarks that we anticipate that the rebate exposure peeks in 2019. And we anticipate that it will anticipate over the '20-2021 period. And we've also been able to go back and adjust our underwriting models to now we're assuming a mid-single digit inflation rate.","Justin Lake","So if I could just sneak in a follow-up, the last number you gave us on rebates retention was $300 million, I believe. And that's net of payouts for rebate guarantees. Given the rebate guarantees have gone up, can you give us an updated number there?","Eva Boratto","Justin, this is Eva. That was a standalone legacy CVS, PBM. And I would say it's in the same zip code if you will, in terms of that overall two to three percentage points.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ana Gupte from SVB Leerink. Please go ahead.","Ana Gupte","My question was about on the health benefits side. The medical loss ratio you had said that the experience rated book would create a reset. It's a bit more than we had anticipated. Wanted to know if this is kind of a one-time thing? And can you talk about, on the commercial side, what the implications were there for membership on either retention and\/or new growth? And also if you are -- when you're planning to go-to-market with Aetna and Caremark books together? Is that going to be mid-year this year and one month training, maybe later?","Eva Boratto","Ana, this is Eva. I'll start. As you look at our guidance for the MBR, it's about 84%, there are couple of things that I would call out. First, obviously, the mechanics of the HIF, as well as if you look at the mix of our business, we have very material growth in the government services business, which, obviously, also increases that MBR. And it's early in the year, and we feel it's important to be proven as we look at these estimates.","Karen Lynch","And Ana, just to answer your question on when we'll go-to-market with Caremark, look, obviously, we're in the process of evaluating where we have opportunities. We are rapidly looking at where we have medical and pharmacy and vice versa, working very closely with Derica. We're building products and service capabilities so that we can go to market. And you should expect us to see go to market later this year early in '20.","Ana Gupte","If I could just sneak in a follow-up on that, so also on the tax reform, Aetna had seen some pressure on MLR rebates. I mean, will this combination help you on that might that's start in 2020. And I think you also had talked about enterprise value in your last communications both closed. And is that going to impact how you price your Aetna book because you do have value that's created now from the PBM and Retail that wasn't there earlier?","Karen Lynch","Yes, relative to pricing we will factor all that and consider that in our pricing. But, Ana, what I would tell you is, we'll continue to maintain pricing discipline on our commercial book, but we'll take the value of a combined organization or the value that we expect to capture some additional services in consideration when we do price our book.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Steven Valiquette","So for the HCB segment, the slides include their comment that excluding segment shift impacts, incremental investments and the impact of the HIF, the operating income is expected to grow modestly over 2018. I think some investors might have been expecting that profit growth to be a little bit stronger in '19, just given the robust Medicare Advantage membership growth for Aetna, actually both last year and this year. I know there's a general notion that new MA lives aren't that profitable in year one. Maybe you can just give a little more color high level around the Medicare Advantage membership growth in 2019. Maybe just frame it in terms of top line growth versus profit growth within HCB? Thanks.","Eva Boratto","Yes, Steve, this is Eva. I think a key aspect is we noted in our prepared remarks that we're making significant investments in terms of transformation. There's some of that affecting the HCB segment. So the modest growth is obviously taking into account that that impact.","Karen Lynch","Let me just comment on general Medicare growth in '19 and '20 -- both years. We are above industry growth. You have to consider when you look at our Medicare business to split the mix between individual and group. Obviously, there are different margin profiles on those books. If you think about 2020, we are exceptionally pleased with the growth that we have for one-one. As you've seen, we're above industry growth. It is really, truly reflecting the number of years that we've been investing in Medicare, it's reflecting our starts performance, it's reflecting our expansion into different geographic counties, and really tight management of our benefit products. What I would also say to you is the way to think about our growth for 1\/1 -- think about it half group and half individual.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ricky Goldwasser","Larry, going back to the HHS rebate rule, I understand the questions that you raised, but assuming that the rule is finalized effective 1\/1\/20, it seems that there's going to be a change to the business model as we know it today. So, one, can you fully offset with premium increase an impact on the PDP business; two, what would be the implications for your commercial, that is based on past experience, how long does it take before we see the spillover effect to commercial changes; and three, you're in the hole on the commercial book on rebate guarantees. Is the new role a material enough change that will allow you to go back to your commercial customers and trigger a change in current contractual terms that can help offset that?","Larry Merlo","Ricky, it's Larry. In terms of your first question around the offsets, yes, we would underwrite that with a different set of assumptions, Ricky, and some of that goes back to my earlier comments. The concern would be will people deselect from a Part D program because of the increase in monthly premiums? We know from all the research we've done over the years that beneficiaries -- that's the first thing they look at, and SilverScript has been successful growing with holding down that monthly premium level for the reasons that I touched on earlier.","Your second point, Ricky, around commercial -- our sense is -- what is it that our clients want and value? I would sit here today and say broadly, our commercial clients value the same elements that the Medicare Part D program works. They want to use the rebates and discounts to buy down the monthly premium. So, I'm not sure that I see a rapid adoption in the commercial space for that reason, and Ricky, the other thing that I would point out is I think many people are aware that Caremark introduced a new plan this year -- it was called Allure -- where it priced...it took the rebates and applied point-of-sale. We had a very small number of seniors enroll in that program -- it was around 20,000 -- and we think one of the barriers to that was the increase that we saw in the monthly premium.","Ricky Goldwasser","Okay. So, a follow-up question here. If you can refer to -- if the change happens, can you go back and change some contractual terms? And then second follow-up is obviously, 2019 is a transition year, and you're going to give long-term guidance on your Analyst Day, but it's been over a year since you gave us a year two accretion goal. Can you give us any update there, or what type of growth should we expect next year?","Larry Merlo","Ricky, in terms of the other question on can we go back to clients -- should there be a material change in how the programs are written, the answer to that question is yes. And, in terms, Ricky, for 2020 outlook, we're not going to provide that today. We're working diligently, recognizing that we have made great progress on the integration work that was tied to the synergy goals that we talked about, and as you think about the regulatory pathway, quite frankly, it was very late in that process that we were able to begin the transformation work in earnest. So, we're pretty pleased that we've got concept stores up and running, we've got a number of pilots in market, and a whole other series ready to go to market to learn and understand, and that is our primary objective -- to complete more of that work so that when we get to June, we will be able to provide more of a long-term outlook.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ann Hynes from Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.","Ann Hynes","I actually just want to follow up on Ricky's question because I do think 2020 is important because when you closed the deal, you did give some directional guidance of mid-single digits, and if you adjust for tax reform, it would suggest a mid-$8.00 range. And, the reason I bring it up is because that's where your consensus estimate is now, so I know you don't want to comment on it, but what do you think that we should consider in our models as the biggest change to your business model since you gave that guidance in December of 2017, I believe? So, that's one.","Secondly, on the Retail operating profit decline, if you ex the Omnicare and, I think you said, the tax reform investment is down 5% -- I know you say it's because break-open generic is less of an offset, but I still think that's very low. Can you give us some more detail on what's happening there so we put it in our models going forward? Because it just seems a bigger decline that I would think. Thanks.","Kevin Hourican","This is Kevin. I'll take the Retail question, and then Eva will talk about 2020. The primary headwind in the Retail profitability excluding Long-Term Care and the tax investment is in pharmacy reimbursement. It's impacting small operators and big operators. It's a secular headwind impacting everyone. What we talked about is a tailwind that typically is utilized to help us blunt that reduction is the generic wave, and John covered well that that value year over year is down. Eva also mentioned in her prepared remarks that there's benefit from branded inflation that helps that blunting as well, and that number is down year over year. So, we're seeing a consistent headwind. It's the two tailwinds themselves that reduced in value year over year, and as I mentioned a few moments ago, our plan to address that for 2020 and beyond is to accelerate our top-line growth. The good news in our retail business is we are winning in the top line. We're taking market share in both the front and pharmacy business, we're resonating with consumers, growing share of vault with consumers, and taking market share. What we need to do more of for 2020 and beyond is increase the year-over-year value of productivity improvement. We have some compelling innovations coming in technology improvement that can help automate things that are currently done manually within the pharmacies, and I'll just repeat: The most important thing we need to do is make a pivot in our third-party payer contracting. We are going to lead the change there to migrate to a new method of doing pharmacy contracting. We're going to start with ourselves.","So, by owning a large insurer and owning the largest PBM, we can lead that change by structuring a contracting relationship that if we can lower overall healthcare costs, we can take some of the burden off of the annual reimbursement reform, and where that will come from -- this is the last thing I'll say -- is we can prove through technology and clinical care programs that we can improve medication adherence, we can maximize the formulary compliance that Derica spoke to in his remarks, we can do things that are net new -- like reduce hospitalization -- through our clinical outreach program, saving Aetna money, and then we can share in the benefit of that from our Retail segment. We intend to bring that model to the other payers, and two of the other payers also own an insurance company.","Larry Merlo","And, I just want to emphasize the last point that Kevin just mentioned because I've come to appreciate -- when you look at the Aetna business today, more than 50% of their claims have some type of outcomes-based reimbursement tied to that, and it's all on the medical side, with providers. Pharmacy has not penetrated that, and this new model is going to demonstrate the role that Pharmacy can play in terms of affecting and improving outcomes, and I think it's one of the big unlocks as you think about an open-platform concepts that we could make elements of broadly available in the market.","Eva Boratto","Ann, this is Eva. I'll go back to your 2020 question. As Larry said, it's still really early to give 2020 guidance or expectations, but let me try to provide you some color. In terms of the accretion numbers that were provided back when the deal was announced, it's really difficult at this point in time to speak to those. Given the timing of the deal close, you'd have to mix and match periods as well as changes related to tax reform. But, what is 100% clear is that Aetna is performing at or better than our expectations. We absolutely stand behind the estimates of the value being created by the deal, and as we've said, we're tracking ahead of our year two synergy number of 2020. The factors affecting what I'll say the legacy CVS business is -- as you think about 2020, all of those factors will either improve or phase out, the tax reform investment, obviously, is complete, the impact of the rebate guarantee peaks in '19 and is reduced in 2020, and we expect those Omnicare and generics to improve in 2020.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Robert Jones","Just to follow up there on the synergies, it clearly sounds like you're still on track. Maybe one of the other sides of it that was a little bit larger than I think we would have expected was the incremental spending in order to achieve those synergies. So, just on the numbers that you provided for this year, could you talk a little bit about what that spend is, exactly? Eva, I know you said that HCB would disproportionately benefit from the synergies this year. Is that safe to assume where the incremental spend would also come?","Eva Boratto","So as we think about the additional investment spending, it's in the $325-350 million range. I would put that spending into two large buckets. Supporting transformation -- it includes investment in our clinical platform to more effectively engage members, our chronic care initiatives, and other initiatives aimed at improving outcomes and lowering costs. The other area that we're continuing to invest in and expand our investment is digital, and improving the digital and mobile experience for members and customers across all of our businesses, and we're making investments in our Health Cloud software platform. So, a large amount of these investments do affect the businesses. There was zero in 2019, if you will, in the denominator for which we're comparing.","Robert Jones","Okay. And it's safe to assume, Eva, that as we roll beyond 2019, these costs should reduce? That would just be the quick follow-up. And then, the other question I had was just more housekeeping. As we look at the guide for HCB housekeeping, is prior-period development included or excluded from that guidance? Thanks.","Eva Boratto","Bob, I'll take your last question first. There is no -- consistent with Aetna's legacy practices, there is no prior-period development included in our guidance. In terms of investments in the business, yeah, I do think as -- the investments will step down over time, but we will continue to invest in our business as we're evolving to our new model, with the consumer at the center.","Larry Merlo","Bob, also just keep in mind -- to that point -- as you've heard us talk on the Retail side -- more on the CapEx side -- we have the opportunity to repurpose capital that we would have spent in areas that can be dedicated to our activities here, so that's one of the reasons why you don't hear us talking about it in that regard.","Eva Boratto","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Charles Rhyee","I just want to go back to Omnicare real quickly here. You've kind of written off maybe upwards of half of the value of what you put into it initially when you consider the debt you took on as well. It's also just two pieces you're talking about -- it's the piece that you're interested in, which was the independent assisted living market versus the SNF market. When you talk about the turnaround here, is it that you expect initiatives to grow the business in assisted living -- that's going to take off, or is that you think the declines in the SNF business are going to slow? You've been talking about this for a little bit -- what gives you the confidence here that you would expect that to turn as you get into '20?","Larry Merlo","Charles, it's Larry. Just one quick comment on that, and then I want to flip it over to John. As you look at the Omnicare business, don't lose sight of -- there was a specialty component of that business, which has been fully integrated and quite successful for the business. So, I don't want to lose that element of the acquisition.","Jonathan Roberts","Charles, this is John. So, what gives us the confidence that we can stabilize the long-term care -- that's the SNF. We have to think about stabilizing that. We've invested in account management personnel so that they're providing higher levels of service to the facilities. We've seen significant improvements in our service levels, and our retention rates are improving pretty significantly, and we're putting technology in that assists these facilities in communicating with the pharmacy. So, we think service ties directly to retention, and we've made significant improvements there. And then, we still are very bullish on our ability grow in assisted living. We've implemented a new service model -- we call them \"community care centers\" so that there's a single point of contact with that community staff for senior living. That was not the case prior to this past year. And then, we introduced some tools that we think are going to be very attractive to these facilities, like multi-dose packaging that is better than what's available generally in the market with barcode scanning. And then, we're also leveraging our CVS retail pharmacies for staff deliveries to these facilities, so these pharmacies are closer than the Omnicare pharmacies; they can respond more rapidly and actually develop a local relationship with these facilities along with the Omnicare pharmacy. So, we think we'll be able to not only grow our penetration rate in these assisted living facilities, but we're seeing existing clients where we didn't have all of the existed living facilities actually give us more of their facilities because of the services and changes and enhancements that we've made.","Charles Rhyee","Just to follow up with that, my understanding is that assisted living -- part of the problem with that market was that the facilities themselves didn't think of themselves as healthcare providers, more as residential communities. Is that behavior starting to change? It seems like a lot of the issues that you're discussing here are actually issues, probably, that Omnicare dealt with years ago as well, and so, placing more of a structural issue, particularly in the SNF market. Any structural changes you're seeing that you think of as being positive as you move forward here? Thanks.","Jonathan Roberts","I think the structural changes we're seeing -- with senior living or independent living, they're trying to be able to provide continuity of care as people progress through the different phases of aging and they move from independent living to assisted living, and so, we think our value proposition will resonate even more based on these changing dynamics and what we've seen historically.","Michael McGuire","We'll take one more question, please.","Operator","Our final question comes from Kevin Caliendo from UBS. Please go ahead.","Kevin Caliendo","One question I had on the Aetna business -- the Health Benefits business -- if you could just tell us on an apples-to-apples basis -- any of the shifts between the segments and the like -- what Aetna would have looked like excluding any cost shifts that you may have done into that segment and the like. What would we be looking at? That's the first question. The second question -- can you talk about the magnitude of the Centene loss? Should we expect to see that revenue loss and how it would roll -- impact the PBM margins positively or negatively going forward?","Eva Boratto","Kevin, this is Eva. I'll take the first question regarding Aetna's performance without the shifts. What we're seeing -- the most clarity I can give you here is without the shifts and some of the things we've called out, we expect to see modest growth. The business has tailwinds behind it with the growth on membership in both commercial and government space, benefiting nicely from the synergies, but we're also making investments. So the best on a same-same basis, modest growth on the bottom line, obviously, normalizing for the health insurance fee impact.","Kevin Caliendo","Right, OK. And then, on Centene?","Derica Rice","Hi, Kevin. This is Derica. In regard to Centene, keep in mind that it will be a multiyear migration. We anticipate that it will start in 2019, likely hit the peak in 2020, and there will probably be a residual in 2021. And, as Centene is migrating, they're looking to move to their own PBM platform, RxAdvance.","Eva Boratto","And, Kevin, just to add one thing to Derica's point, while the exact timing with these large changes -- you don't know exactly how the rollout will go -- in our guidance range, we have made estimates within the range around our expected migration.","Kevin Caliendo","Got it. And, just one more -- on the well care, the PDP business that you sold the WellCare -- how is that incorporated into the numbers now, and what's the magnitude?","Eva Boratto","So, WellCare -- it's a transition year. The economics still continue to benefit \u2026","Karen Lynch","Yes, they benefit Aetna. They're still in the Aetna results as we're transitioning it out.","Kevin Caliendo","Okay, great. I just wanted to make sure they were still included in there. Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Larry Merlo","So, we know this was a long call, we know there was a lot of information, a lot of questions, and as is always the case, Mike and his team will be available for any follow-ups, and I'm sure we'll see many of you soon. Thanks.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect."],"6189":["CVS Health Corp. (NYSE:CVS) Q2 2018 Earnings Call August  8, 2018  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Michael P.

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, August 8, 2018.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike McGuire, Senior Vice President-Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael P. McGuire - CVS Health Corp.","Thank you, Jose. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. As usual, I'm here this morning with Larry Merlo, President and CEO; and Dave Denton, CFO. Larry and Dave have a number of prepared remarks to share after which Jon Roberts, Chief Operating Officer, will join us to participate in the question and answer session.","During the Q&A in order to provide more people with a chance to ask their questions, please limit yourself to no more than one question with a quick follow-up. In addition to this call and our press release, we have posted a slide presentation on our website that summarizes the information in our prepared remarks as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance. Our Form 10-Q was filed this morning before the call and that too is available on our website.","Additionally, during this call we will make certain forward-looking statements that reflect our current views related to our future financial performance, future events, and industry and market conditions, and forward-looking statements related to the Aetna acquisition, including the expected consumer benefits, financial projections, synergies and the timing for the completion of the transaction. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what maybe indicated in the forward-looking statements.","We strongly encourage you to review the information in the reports we file with the SEC regarding these specific risks and uncertainties, in particular, those that are described in the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-Q (sic) [Form 10-K] (00:02:00) and the cautionary statement disclosures in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q. You should also review the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in our earnings press release.","During this call, we will use non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company's performance. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find a discussion of these non-GAAP measures and the comparable GAAP measures in the associated reconciliation document we posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website.","And as always, today's call is being webcast on our website, and it will be archived there following the call for one year.","Now, I'll turn this over to Larry Merlo.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Okay. Thanks Mike, and good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. We're pleased with the solid performance of our business in the second quarter and our results year to date continue to validate our confidence in the strength of our model and the strong foundation in place as we bring CVS Health and Aetna together to transform the health care experience.","Strong revenue, adjusted earnings per share, gross and operating margins along with cash flow demonstrate our success and driving value. Additionally, our enterprise streamlining efforts are continuing to deliver value through process improvements and technology enhancements and Dave will review our performance in detail.","Now that said, we're clearly disappointed with our performance in the Omnicare business. And despite this disappointment, we continue to believe in the business's long-term prospects. And Dave will provide an Omnicare update focusing on the factors contributing to its current performance along with our plan to improve results and deliver on our expectations. We continue to believe in our ability to drive growth in this sector by improving our presence in the assisted and independent living areas.","Now let me provide an update on how we are moving forward on the regulatory pathway and integration planning for our proposed Aetna acquisition. On the regulatory front, we continue to make excellent progress. Our highly experienced legal and government affairs teams are working hard, ensuring that we provide all the additional information requested by state regulators and the Department of Justice. To-date, a substantial number of states have approved and more are expected to approve this summer. In fact, several additional states have already held or scheduled hearings.","You should also keep in mind that as a matter of practice some states prefer to wait for the DOJ decision before finalizing their approval. And as a result, we expect that a number of approvals will occur shortly after receipt of receipt of DOJ approval.","And while I won't provide details on our interactions, I can tell you that we are having productive discussions with regulators. Now some of you may have seen a recent report concerning potential divestitures. And while I won't comment on the specifics of that report, you should keep in mind that when we announced the transaction last December, we contemplated a range of possibilities in the limited Med D PDP area in which both CVS and Aetna offer plans, and we determined the impact of any divestitures would not be material to the deal model. And with all of that said, we currently expect the transaction to close late Q3 or the early part of Q4.","Now turning to integration planning, the work streams we have in place are making important progress against their objectives, which include ensuring a smooth transition and achieving the $750 million synergy goal for the second full-year of operation.","At a high level, we are pressure testing our day one readiness, gaining a deeper understanding of each and every value opportunity across all of our customers, and ensuring organizational clarity while retaining high potential talent in critical roles.","Key work streams are diligently gathering information to map out the future patient journeys within our combined company, assessing various interventions for efficacy and the most effective approaches to reducing medical costs.","Our sales and account management teams are evaluating a broad range of possible offerings and developing plans to introduce those effectively in future selling seasons. And we are beginning to link the strengths of both analytics organizations as we develop a holistic view of the patient.","Since our last earnings call we completed a milestone step in our journey to combine our companies when we announced the executive management team, that following the close of the acquisition, will lead the combined company. The talent of both organizations is reflected in the main management team. And I look forward to working alongside this outstanding group of individuals to transform how health care is delivered in our country.","I would also like to thank those individuals who will not be continuing with us. They too have been instrumental to the success of both organizations. And we are extremely grateful for their contributions.","And I especially want to thank Dave Denton for his outstanding leadership and contributions during the two decades he has spent at CVS. He's been a driving force behind the growth we've experienced. And the finance organization that he has assembled is first class. And I know that Dave's next chapter will be met with continued success.","So we'll continue to update you on the progress of our integration activities as we work towards the closing. And there continues to be a genuine excitement among the teams from both companies in fulfilling the vision we share and our commitment to better health.","Now last quarter, I highlighted our approach to chronic kidney disease and our Saving Patients Money program as examples of CVS Health innovating to improve the quality and lower the cost of care for our patients. Those are but two of the many innovations that we either have or will bring to market.","And I want to quickly highlight another, because today we announced that MinuteClinic is offering video visits to its patients through the CVS Pharmacy app.","This new telehealth service that leverages Teladoc's technology platform provides patients with access to care 24 hours a day, a referral to a nearby MinuteClinic or other provider is available, if needed, as is the ability for the provider to submit a prescription to the patient's preferred pharmacy, if warranted. The MinuteClinic team spent a great deal of time customizing the experience and patients will receive the same high quality evidence based care that they receive at our in-store clinic locations. So we're excited about the solutions we are bringing to market.","And with that, let me turn it over to Dave to review the quarter.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Thank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. This morning I'll share some financial and business highlights and provide a brief update on our financial guidance for 2018. I won't go through all the details in my prepared remarks, but you can find the additional information in the slide presentation that we posted on our website and in our SEC filings.","Overall, the company posted extremely strong financial performance in our core business as we met or exceeded all elements of our guidance in Q2.","But before I go into that discussion, I want to begin by addressing the goodwill impairment charge that we took for the Omnicare business. We continue to see growth opportunities in the assisted living market, particularly as the most efficient operator in the space.","That said, industry-wide financial challenges have created unexpected financial pressures on our facility clients, which has resulted in lower growth than we anticipated when we acquired the Omnicare business three years ago.","The impairment was caused by several factors: higher levels of bad debt and longer collection times on receivables; a faster decline in facility reimbursement rates than we originally forecasted; and lower client retention rates. Additionally, bed census at skilled nursing facilities continued to track lower, resulting in fewer prescriptions across our platform. And despite a growing opportunity in the assisted living market, our programs to serve these clients have grown more slowly than we originally anticipated.","In 2017, we disclosed that our annual goodwill impairment test of our long-term care reporting unit resulted in its fair value exceeding its carrying value only by a narrow margin. As a result, we've been closely monitoring the performance of the business for potential indicators of impairment. As we began our planning for our 2019 budget in the second quarter, we updated our 2018 forecast as well as our long-term outlook for the business to reflect our expectations of continued deterioration in our financial results.","Given this, we believe that there were indicators of potential impairment. And as a result, it was necessary to perform an interim test of the long-term care business goodwill.","The results showed that the fair value was now below its carrying value. Accordingly, we record a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $3.9 billion in the quarter, which reduced the goodwill associated with this business to $2.7 billion. This charge is excluded from any non-GAAP earnings measures going forward.","The fair value of the business was determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method. Apparently \u2013 approximately one-third of the impairment charge is due to rising interest rates and challenged market multiples of our peer group. The remaining two-thirds of the charge resulted from lower than expected financial performance within the Omnicare business.","As I said, we continue to believe in the strategic benefit of being a long-term care pharmacy operator and that we are best positioned to thrive longer term as the most efficient operator in the space. Let me outline the steps we are taking to put the business performance back on track.","First, we have recently installed a new leadership team to manage Omnicare's day-to-day operation. The team is made up of individuals with expertise in the long-term care market, supplemented with operational talent from CVS Pharmacy.","Second, the team is undertaking a broad initiative to enhance service levels with the objective of improving client retention levels. The team has already identified a series of near-term actions that should substantially enhance client retention rates with a target of 95% or better.","Third, with the industry continuing to face financial challenges, being a low cost provider will be even more important. We are embarking upon a systemwide cost improvement effort, utilizing assets within both Omnicare and CVS Pharmacy to dramatically lower the cost-to-fill within the skilled nursing channel.","The team is targeting $100 million to $150 million in cost takeout opportunities over the next several years to enhance process design, the implementation of automated technologies, and better leveraging our local presence at CVS Pharmacy to serve our skilled nursing facility clients.","And finally, the assisted and independent living market remains an attractive long-term care \u2013 a long-term opportunity. Our enterprise product development team is rapidly innovating improved solutions to effectively serve this market and to substantially grow our penetration rate from approximately 50% to 70%. Our initial solutions have produced success in some markets. And we're looking to scale those up across our assisted living book of business.","In addition to scaling these solutions, we expect to meet the evolving needs of facility operators, local residents and caregivers enabling us to grow our penetration and win new business. With our expansive network of local assets, we are best positioned to capture share in this market longer term. Again, we remain optimistic about Omnicare's long-term growth potential and its relevance to our value creation strategy.","There is no doubt that as the population ages, there will be an increased need for long-term care services and support. We must execute on our initiatives, deliver high levels of patient and client service and drive additional efficiencies so that when the market does turn around, we are well-positioned to take advantage and grow.","So, with that, now let me turn to a review of the other aspects of our performance for the quarter and I'll start, as I often do, with our capital allocation program. With approximately $4.4 billion in free cash generated through the second quarter, we are well on track to achieve our strong cash flow generation expectations of approximately $7 billion for the year.","Due to the proposed Aetna acquisition and the associated debt we issued, we have suspended the share repurchase program and will be keeping our dividend flat until we achieve a leverage ratio of approximately 3 times adjusted debt to EBITDA. Recall that the combined company's pro forma trailing 12 months leverage ratio is expected to be approximately 4.6 times, post closing of the transaction. We are committed to improving this ratio to 3.5 times within two years after closing, utilizing our strong cash generation capabilities and savings from tax reform.","Turning to the income statement, we generated adjusted earnings per share of $1.69 per share, an increase of 26.8% over last year and $0.05 above the high-end of our guidance range. These results were on a comparable basis and the reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted EPS can be found in the press release as well as on the Investor Relations portion of our website.","GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was a loss of $2.52 per share, which is a direct result of the goodwill impairment. A lower effective income tax rate combined with pharmacy share gains within the Retail\/Long-Term Care segment drove the increase in adjusted EPS year-over-year. Now versus our expectations, the timing of PBM operating profits, interest and taxes each performed better, driving a $0.05 beat on adjusted earnings per share.","On a consolidated basis, revenues grew 2.2% in the second quarter and were about 25 basis points above the high-end of our expectations. Gross profit, operating expenses, operating profit, net interest expense and the tax rate reflect non-GAAP adjustments in both current and prior periods where applicable and have been reconciled, again, on our website. Our guidance for the second quarter also reflected these adjustments.","Gross margin for the consolidated company improved approximately 25 basis points over Q2 of 2017 due to segment mix, while total enterprise gross profit dollars increased 3.9%, in line with our expectations. Total operating expense dollars increased 3.5% also in line with our expectations.","As Larry mentioned, our significant progress in our enterprise streamlining efforts through process improvements and technology enhancements continues. As an example, CVS Pharmacy completed the deployment of its enhanced automated prescription process and these enhancements have saved approximately 40% of the time spent, performing data entry and edits on e-prescriptions. As a result of our ongoing efforts, we still expect to generate approximately $475 million in gross benefits this year from streamlining.","Operating profit for the enterprise was $2.4 billion increasing 4.6% versus LY and nearly 140 basis points above the high-end of expectations for the quarter. Additionally, operating margin was slightly higher versus a year ago and better than expectations.","Going below-the-line on the consolidated income statement, net interest expense in the quarter improved year-over-year and was better than expected and our effective income tax rate significantly improved year-over-year due to tax reform. Our weighted average share count was in line with our expectations for the quarter.","Now turning to the PBM segment, revenues grew 2.8% to $33.2 billion exceeding the high-end of our guidance by approximately 135 basis points. This outperformance was driven by a higher mix of specialty claims, which drove a higher average script price across the book. Growth in claims volumes and brand inflation drove the year-over-year increase, partially offset by continuing pricing pressures and an increase in our generic dispensing rate.","Additionally, keep in mind that we are administering rebates this year for Aetna's Medicare Part D business as part of our existing PBM contract and that is dampening revenue growth. PBM adjusted claims grew by 6.5% largely driven by our strong net new business performance and the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice.","Our PBM gross margin remained relatively flat compared to Q2 of 2017 while gross profit dollars grew by 2.6%, exceeding our expectations despite implementation costs related to Anthem. The outperformance is due to timing of our client contractual requirements as well as favorable specialty volume.","PBM operating expense dollars increased year-over-year, while operating expenses, as a percent of sales, deteriorated slightly. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by growth in the business, including acquisitions as well as the reinstatement of the Affordable Care Act health insurance fee this year.","Given the outperformance on gross profit and to a lesser extent lower operating expenses, PBM operating profit contracted 2% and operating margin declined by approximately 15 basis points, both significantly better than we expected. Recall that last quarter we guided to a decline in PBM profitability arising from the timing of certain client commitments. The timing of those commitments changed, benefiting the second quarter and that \u2013 and impacting the business later this year.","Looking at the 2019 selling season, we see fewer RFP opportunities in the market than what we have seen over the past few years. With this in mind, our current gross wins stand at approximately $1.8 billion with net new business of approximately $200 million.","To-date we have completed more than 70% of our client renewals roughly in line with where we were at this time last year. And our current retention rate is slightly higher than the levels that we've seen in recent years. Additionally, recall that earlier this year we extended the FEP retail and mail contracts to the end of 2019.","And today I'm happy to report that recently we were able to extend these contracts through the end of 2020, one year beyond what we had announced earlier this year. Last week we previewed our 2019 formulary strategy continuing to build on the success that we've had since 2012 when we introduced our new approach.","Effective January 1, we plan to remove 23 products from our standard control formulary while adding back four products that have been removed in prior years. We anticipate that the vast majority of our members, in fact, over 98% will be able to stay on their current therapy. Since 2012 our formulary strategies have helped keep costs in check for our clients despite year-over-year price increases and at the same time they've helped to improve adherence.","Turning to SilverScript, our Medicare Part D PDP, we currently serve 4.8 million captive lives in our individual PDP, 1.3 million captive EGWP lives and another 7.3 million lives through our health plan clients. So in total, Caremark serves 13.4 million Medicare Part D beneficiaries.","Last week, we received the preliminary benchmark results from CMS for 2019, which showed that SilverScript qualified in 32 of 34 regions, remaining under the benchmark in 28 regions and de minimis in four regions. These strong benchmark results enable us to retain all of the auto-assignees that we currently serve and qualify us to receive new auto-assignees in those 28 regions in which we are under the benchmark.","All-in-all the 2019 marketplace looks to be very competitive, but we are very pleased with these results. We'll know more about the competitive positioning and auto-assignee expectations once CMS releases the landscape file in late September.","Within our Retail\/Long-Term Care business, revenues increased 5.7% to $20.7 billion in line with expectations. This is primarily driven by very strong script volume growth of 9.3% for the quarter. This growth was due to the continued adoption of our Patient Care Programs, success from partnering with PBMs and health plans across the industry, and our preferred position in a number of Medicare Part D networks this year.","As demonstrated in our results, our efforts to expand our relationships with other PBMs and health plans has progressed well and we continue to see opportunities moving forward. In total, our initiatives are driving growth of adjusted scripts dispense and as a result our retail market share has increased by about 180 basis points in the quarter to 25.2%.","Same store sales grew 5.9% in line with expectations while adjusted same store prescription growth of 9.5% came in 25 basis points above the high end of our guidance. Front store same store sales declined 1%, but were negatively impacted by about 90 basis points from the calendar shift of the Easter holiday from Q2 of last year to Q1 of this year. After adjusting for this, front store same store sales were essentially flat to LY.","Gross margin in the Retail\/Long-Term Care segment was down approximately 50 basis points to 28.6%. This contraction was driven by continued pressure on reimbursement rates. The decline was partially offset by an increase in GDR as well as improvements in the front store margin rate driven by strong health and beauty sales.","Gross profit dollars grew in line with expectations, mainly due to increased script volume and generic introductions, as well as improvements in purchasing through Red Oak Sourcing. Retail's operating expenses were in line with expectations for the quarter. The growth in expenses year-over-year were primarily due to investments in the business to drive revenue growth as well as increases in expenses related to script volume. Operating profit dollars grew 7.3% to $1.7 billion within Retail\/Long-Term Care, while operating margin increased 10 basis points to 8.2%, both in line with our expectations.","Within the Corporate segment, expenses declined year-over-year and were lower than expected primarily due to the shift in timing of cost related to the enterprise streamlining effort.","So we're continuing to drive success against the four-point plan that we introduced last year to return to healthy growth. We are generating script growth from our expanded relationships with PBM and health plans and we continue to innovate and we are reaping the benefits of our streamlining effort. However, we are obviously disappointed with the performance of long-term care, but we believe we have a solid management structure and a plan for improving that business.","So with that, let me provide an update on our outlook for 2018 before turning it back over to Larry. I'll focus on the highlights here, but you can find additional details in the slide presentation that we posted on the website earlier today. As we have stated previously, for guidance purposes only, we are assuming that the proposed Aetna transaction closes at the end of 2018. By doing so, we are not including any expectations of results of Aetna's operations in our 2018 estimates.","Also keep in mind that all financing fees, interest, transaction and integration costs related to the deal are excluded from our adjusted figures.","For the full-year 2018, we are narrowing and raising the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance range to $6.98 to $7.08 per share, representing growth of 18.25% to 20%. The significant growth in adjusted EPS is largely related to the benefit received from tax reform. We are also narrowing the range for GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations and adjusting it to reflect a long-term care goodwill impairment charge.","So we now expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.50 per share. And you can find a reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted EPS in our press release and on the Investor Relations portion of our website.","With half the year behind us we are updating our revenue and consolidated operating profit guidance. Consolidated revenue growth is now expected to be 1.5% to 2. 5%. Within the PBM segment, we are narrowing the range to 2.25% to 3.25% given an increase in our expectation of specialty revenues and maintaining our adjusted claims expectation of approximately 1.9 billion claims.","For the Retail\/Long-Term Care segment, we now expect revenue growth of 4.75% to 5.5% and same-store sales growth of 5% to 5.75%, due to continued strong performance through the second quarter. Pharmacy same-store scripts are now expected to grow 8.25% to 9.25%, an improvement of 100 basis points over prior expectations. We continue to see a large benefit from the broader relationships we've established last year with payors as well as our expanded participation as a preferred provider in various Part D networks.","Moving to operating profit, we have tightened the full-year 2018 adjusted consolidated operating profit to down 0.75%, to up 0.75%. For the segments, we continue to expect PBM adjusted operating profit in the low-to-mid-single digits and Retail\/Long-Term Care operating profit to be down low-single digits.","Going below the line, net interest expense of our existing portfolio debt is expected to be approximately $1 billion, slightly better than our previous estimate. We continue to expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 27% for 2018.","Now let me touch on the earning cadence we expect for the third and fourth quarters. As I discussed on the last earnings call, enterprise operating profit growth is expected to be weighted more to the front half of this year. There are few factors driving this. First, the $275 million investment of tax savings will be spent predominantly in the back half of the year and the vast majority of that is in the Retail\/Long-Term Care segment.","Second, the Retail segment has made better progress than expected on its pharmacy initiatives during the first half, while also having a very strong flu season. Third, the challenges in the Long-Term Care business weigh more heavily on our second half Retail\/Long-Term Care growth expectations. And finally, we have the timing shift of the PBM client contractual commitments moving into the back half of this year.","Turning to Q3, we expect adjusted EPS in the third quarter to be in the range of $1.68 to $1.73 per share, reflecting an increase of 12.5% to 15.5% versus Q3 of 2017. Tax reform will continue to be a major contributor to the increase.","GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.29 to $1.34. Non-GAAP guidance for the third quarter excludes certain items described in the non-GAAP reconciliation posted on our website.","Consolidated revenues in Q3 are expected to grow 1% to 2.75%, while consolidated operating profit is expected to decline 2.5% to 5%. Within the Retail segment, we expect revenue growth in the range of 4.5% to 6% and the change in operating profit to be down mid-single digits. Total same store sales at Retail are expected to be 4.75% to 6.25% and adjusted script comps are expected to be 8.75% to 9.75%.","Despite strong year-over-year growth in volumes for the retail pharmacy, continued reimbursement pressures, the timing of generic launches, the investment of tax reform savings and the long-term care challenges are driving the decline in profits during the third quarter.","In the PBM segment, we expect third quarter revenue growth to be up 1.5% to 3.25% and operating profit growth to be flat to up low-single digits.","Similar to last quarter, the year-over-year increase \u2013 the year-over-year results are being affected by investments we are making to support the Anthem implementation as well as the timing of certain client contractual commitments. We expect that the efforts we are making today to address our challenges and to invest in the advancement of new programs will place our company at the forefront of the evolving health care landscape.","And with that, let me now turn it back over to Larry.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Well, thanks, Dave. Before we open up for Q&A, I want to talk briefly about a couple of topics, because in recent discussions with shareholders, there are two broad industry themes that seem to be top of mind. One is government action on drug pricing and rebates and a second, the competitive landscape given the possibility of new entrants.","So let me touch on both. And I'll begin with the conversation around drug pricing.","We see the impact rising drug costs have on plan members and patients every day. And we use every innovative tool possible to bring down the cost of drugs. We do that through highly effective clinical programs, innovative purchasing and formulary design and enhanced data analytics that allow us to provide the right drug to the right patient at the right time at the lowest possible cost.","Now the current debate regarding drug pricing and the role of PBMs centers on rebates and the impact of out of pocket costs on consumers at the pharmacy counter. Drug manufacturers want you to believe that increasing drug prices are a result of them having to pay rebates and that PBMs are retaining these rebates. And this is simply not true.","If list prices were the result of a manufacturer's need to address rebates, then you would expect rebates and list prices to be highly correlated.","And to the contrary, our data show that list price is increasing faster for drugs with small rebates than it is for medications with substantial rebates. And this makes intuitive sense as the products with small rebates are more likely to be in uncompetitive drug classes, where there is less incentive for manufacturers to compete on price. Rebates are maximized only when there are therapeutically equivalent competitor products in a drug class. And it's that dynamic that allows for formulary placement that drives lower costs.","So let me be clear. The idea that rebate retention is correlated with higher drug prices is entirely false.","And while some have speculated that our retained rebates represent as much as $2 billion, the simple fact is that over the last number of years, we have positioned the Caremark model and its broader value proposition to the point where in 2018, we expect retained rebates to be about $300 million, or about 3% of our annual adjusted earnings per share.","Competition among PBMs means more and more rebates are going and will continue to go back to clients. And this is a good thing. It demonstrates that the market techniques used by PBMs do in fact work. And no matter what may happen to the ability to rebate, PBMs will still be needed to drive discounts and cost savings for their clients and members. And the PBM model will continue to evolve as a result.","Today, we underwrite our contracts to an overall level of profitability. And there are many levers available to us depending on the preferences of the client. Nevertheless, the amount of rebates we retain is a relatively small cost for the value we provide through our formulary negotiation. Tens of billions of dollars of rebates generated, the overwhelming majority of which are passed back to clients and their members.","Let's also be clear about what happens with the rebates that are passed to clients. Our clients, employers and insurers use rebates to lower the costs of providing insurance for their employees and members. And typically this means investing in insurance premiums to keep growth for all members to a minimum.","As an alternative, we do offer rebates at the point of sale as an option for all clients. And in addition to helping members reduce their out-of-pocket costs, this program underscores the true cause of rising drug prices at the pharmacy counter, and that is prices set by manufacturers.","For members in high deductible health plans, the availability of point of sale rebates before their deductible is met can be a key solution to help members stay adherent on their essential medications by making them more affordable. And today, we provide this service for approximately 10 million of our commercial members.","This is what's getting lost in this debate, the fact that we have been able to improve adherence and keep drug cost inflation under control using key PBM techniques. Last year drug price growth for our clients was only 0.2% on a per capita basis, despite AWP inflation of nearly 10%.","And improvements in member adherence actually reduced overall health care costs by some $600 million. And these statistics underscore that we are controlling costs, while promoting better health through greater adherence to medications.","Now as everyone knows, the administration released American Patients First, the President's blueprint to lower drug prices. And we support the administration's goal to lower prices and reduce out-of-pocket costs for consumers.","Several weeks ago, we submitted our response to the blueprint, and I encourage you to use the link in our slides to review our perspective. Because in it we highlight what we, as a company, do to help bring down drug costs and steps the government could consider. And I will tell you there are many elements in the blueprint that are extremely complementary to current PBM capabilities and in fact would enable us to do more, not less.","And yesterday afternoon's announcement by CMS to allow Medicare Advantage plans to use PBM tools for Part B drugs shows that the administration recognizes that PBMs have a key role to play in lowering drug costs.","And CVS Health is very well situated to help MA and MA-PD plans develop these solutions through our extensive enterprise assets, including our NovoLogix business, which currently helps our clients manage drugs under the medical benefit. So we have great confidence in the substantial role we will continue to play in driving efficiencies on behalf of our clients.","Our PBM techniques for reducing costs are working as demonstrated by drug costs for our clients essentially remaining flat. We've realized that the most important thing we can do for our clients is ensure people take their medications, because doing so, improves health and it lowers costs. And we're certainly not standing still. We continue to develop and implement new initiatives to ensure that patients can get the medications they need and ultimately this is the value proposition that the administration needs to consider.","And for a more in-depth discussion regarding our approaches to making drugs more affordable, I encourage you to read our white paper on this topic, which we are releasing this morning on our Payor Solutions website. And you can also find the link on the Earnings section of the IR website.","Now I'd also like to take a moment to share our thoughts on the competitive landscape. We all know health care delivery is changing before our eyes. We're excited to be in the vanguard of that change and not just in light of our transaction with Aetna. Our distinctive position is the result of several longstanding core competencies that set us apart from others in fundamental and critical ways.","First, we deliver quality health care to patients in more ways and in more settings than anyone else. Online and mail order pharmacy has existed for many years and CVS Health dispenses millions of scripts this way for patients each and every week. But our delivery model goes well beyond that foundation in ways that are very hard to build or replicate. Whether it's providing in person infusion services at a patient's home, placing a prescription refill through our mobile app to be picked up at any of our 9,800 locations or having your physician send a script electronically to be delivered directly to your doorstep, we offer the diversity of delivery options that patients need.","You see we have the right footprint, we have the specialized supply chain and we have the right group of professionals to deliver care in a range of settings that patients and the health care system require.","Second, with a physical presence in almost every community across the country, we have the unique ability to meet patients where they are and provide the care and services they need either face to face or with the unique set of virtual and physical delivery service capabilities that extends our physical presence in real time to meet their needs.","You see, it's not simply about selling products it's about delivering quality care and driving superior outcomes, both of which require expertise that our clients and members have come to trust. For example, we promote medication adherence. We close gaps in care through our Pharmacy Advisor program, where we engage face to face with patients who are diagnosed with chronic conditions.","We've integrated our rare disease management with our specialty pharmacy, so we now have nurses who are acting as care managers working closely with our pharmacists, providing real synergy in terms of making sure that people are taking their medications and adopting behaviors that avoid unintended medical events and related costs.","Our MinuteClinics not only help diagnose and treat minor health conditions but also provide chronic care management to keep patients healthier and help reduce wasteful spending. Our PBM business has deep, longstanding relationships in the industry, it helps thousands of payors and plan sponsors design more effective plans to help keep drug trend low.","So only a company with these capabilities can take the next step in care delivery, which is integrating our capabilities and services to further lower costs and improve outcomes.","And to effectively compete in the future health care system, and to complement existing physician services, new capabilities will be required. New ways of identifying and engaging patients to drive beneficial behavior changes will be critical to lowering medical costs for patients and payors and Aetna helps us accomplish this. Lower cost models of care delivery will be crucial given the margin compression we see and the inevitable shift to value-based care and Aetna also helps us accomplish this.","So we welcome competition. We expect more of it in the years to come and we are confident that we ourselves are key disruptors and pivotal players in helping to define that new landscape. And together, CVS Health and Aetna will help address the challenges our health care system is facing and we'll be able to offer better care and convenience at a lower cost. And that's why we are excited about CVS Health and why we believe the pending transaction will accelerate our progress towards this goal.","So with that let's now go ahead and open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. And Larry, thank you for all your comments here towards the end of the call. I just want to better understand where you stand on your conversations with the administration. Clearly, President Trump has met with CEOs from both Pfizer and Merck. I'm wondering if you've had any conversations, number one.","And number two, how do we reconcile everything you said and the way the administration seems to be talking about this? And then in July your response to the RFI and the blueprint said that you return 95% of rebates to commercial clients and members. Today you're saying 97%. And I think historically you talked about returning more than 10%. Is it just that the commercial market is changing that quickly as far as contracting goes? I just want to understand how to reconcile those numbers.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah, Lisa, I'll start and I know others will jump in here. Thanks for the question. But, Lisa, it is true that as we stated in our prepared remarks that more of the value of negotiated rebates are being passed back to clients. And keep in mind, we've been saying for a while now that we have different flavors of contracting where we've had clients for a while now that prefer to have 100% of that rebate value passed back.","So that is a trend that has continued. And again, as we said, we underwrite our PBM contracts to an overall level of profitability. So, Lisa, if you triangulate all of the numbers that we threw out there for 2018 that rebate pass-through is closer to 98%, okay, than some of the others that we had historically talked about.","Lisa, your second question around interaction with the administration, we have had productive engagement and discussions with the administration, on the Hill, at the secretary's office. And I do believe for reasons that we talked about and reasons that you see outlined in the President's blueprint, there is an acknowledgment as to the role that PBMs play.","And again I think yesterday afternoon's CMS announcement is just another example of that. So I'm sure those conversations will continue. And, Lisa, I think that as we talked again in the prepared remarks, this \u00fcber focus on rebates, what we believe, Lisa, wherever we end up because the administration hasn't finished the story in terms of what their desire is on rebates, but what will not go away is the ability for PBMs to use size, scale, competition, private sector innovation to garner discounts that lower the cost of medications for clients and their members.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And so as we think about that you brought a value-based care a number of times. And then as we've talked to people in D.C., it sounds like the administration wants to move away from this word of rebates. And this relationship, as you talked about, of the gross to net and this whole idea that the system is paid on rebates, how would you envision a value based program in government? And are you or Jon seeing this in the commercial market that what I've heard from some people is that the commercial market is actually ahead of where Medicare is. And you can take some current commercial market programs and bring it to the government and bypass this whole idea around rebates, but yet to your point, still be able to have a reasonable amount of profitability for the PBM while saving the government money. So just any thoughts you have around that would be great. And then just lastly, I want to say Dave, it's been great working with you and if the transaction closes, I really wish you all the best.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Thank you, Lisa.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Well, Lisa, listen, I think there are a number of different pilots or programs around value-based care today. And I think that folks are still testing and learning. I don't \u2013 I would sit here and say as we sit here today, I don't know that there is one that has gotten any type of substantial traction in the marketplace. And we're going to continue to be part of that solution and pilot and see what we can do to push the ball up the court because we do believe that that's where the marketplace ultimately has to go.","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","And, Lisa, this is Jon. So we have a lot of value-based contracts. I would say they're pretty comparable to the traditional contracts we have in the marketplace and there really hasn't been as much uptake as we would like to see. I do think that the market will move there. And the thing I like about it is it aligns incentives for the payors, for us and for the pharmaceutical manufacturers. And I think as Aetna comes onboard and we now own the entire life (00:51:12) combined with our data capabilities, we're going to have the ability to really advance this value-based contracting notion in the commercial space and we'll bring that to CMS and hopefully they'll learn from our results and adopt it over time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ann Hynes of Mizuho Securities. Please proceed.","Ann Hynes - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Good morning, Ann.","Ann Hynes - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","So, I want to thank you for disclosing rebates-only account for 3% of earnings, in fact that it's that low is probably an understatement on what the Street views the impact was. But I'm going to ask some non-rebate questions. Could we \u2013 on the federal employees' contract, congratulations on extending that, because I know it's a big contract for you and the government seems to continue to extend that with you rather than put it out for RFP. Do you have any color on why that continues to happen?","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","Ann, this is Jon. It's just a one year extension and through 2020, we would expect them to go out to RFP at that point. So I think it's pretty typical of what we've seen with them over the years and we've got a great relationship with FEP and we hope to continue to serve them in the years to come.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","And Ann, listen, I also think it underscores the high level of service and value that FEP has come to count on us for and we expect that that will continue as we go forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee of Cowen. Please proceed.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey. Thanks for taking the question guys. Hey, Larry, you mentioned that the retention rate here is ahead of where you were in recent years. Obviously, that's \u2013 it's good news here despite some concern \u2013 I think there's been some concerns that with the Aetna transaction in process, you're going to have some disruption in the business. Is this a good indicator from your current customers that they're looking at the transaction in a positive light?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Charles, as I say, it's a great question. And I think it's really a function of two factors. I think one is the point that you just made that I think there's a lot of interest in terms of what we can bring to market with CVS Health and Aetna and how that can benefit some of our existing clients, especially in the health plan space.","And I think the second one is what we've talked about previously, what Dave outlined in his remarks that RFP activity has been lower this year. And I think with all of the activity in the marketplace, I do think that there are clients that want to see where everything shakes out as they think about longer term commitments that are typically associated with contracting.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Hill of RBC. Please proceed with your question.","George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. And Dave, best wishes in new endeavors. It's been a lot of fun. I guess, Larry, I would start off with the proposed rule last night, or the step edit rules that it looks like we're going to get from Med B to Med D (00:54:38). I guess can you talk about how you think about the opportunity there? And how is that opportunity enhanced through the Aetna acquisition?","And then, I guess I would just ask if you could comment on given that tumultuous regulatory environment, have you seen anything either in proposed rules or in announced rules that either I guess kind of makes you \u2013 do you see new opportunities or new challenges as it relates to the transaction? Would just love comments around that. Thanks.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah, George, on your first question, we see the proposed rule from CMS last night as being a real opportunity for us and probably an even bigger opportunity as CVS and Aetna come together because it picks up a component of the business that largely has been isolated to the medical side of the house, if you will. And the point that I had made earlier that the NovoLogix capabilities that we have resident today that have proven to be able to bring, I'll call it, the management of that portion of pharmacy flowing through the medical spend to treat that with the same diligence that we do with the traditional pharmacy spend, we think that that is a significant opportunity, obviously first in the Medicare space. And I think it will be interesting to see if that moves into the commercial sector in terms of the pace with which that would happen.","George, your second comment, I guess when you asked that question I think of some of Dr. Gottlieb's comments coming out of the FDA in terms of his focus in terms of removing what has been a significant backlog for potential drug approvals, especially generics, as well as his focus on getting more biosimilars into the marketplace. And today, we've got four in the marketplace. We currently have two of those biosimilars in our formulary and are working to add to that list. And you compare that to Europe where you have over 50 biosimilars in the market.","So both of those, again, it falls under the heading of giving PBMs more bandwidth with the tools that they have to further reduce drug costs.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny of Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Cherny - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. So I want to dive in a little bit more as you think about the changes going on in Washington. You talked about the conversations you're having with various members of HHS.","As you think about some of the other pieces of the blueprint and what gets you most excited for the business model, what are your clients telling you that they essentially hope comes through? Is there any feedback interaction with them on the blueprint on the drug pricing side, where they're saying, we hope there is a encouragement of this. I know value-based contracting was asked earlier, but anything else where you think that aside from the Part B conversation that there's value that you think can be unlocked as this blueprint gets put into place?","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","Mike, this is Jon. Our clients are actually very happy with the benefit that we've been managing for them. So they saw their costs grow on average 1.9% last year. They know they're getting the majority of rebates. They understand that pharma is responsible for raising prices and we're working on their behalf to manage that down.","So I think if anything, they're interested in more transparency as we move forward. And we embrace that and we think that's a great idea. And I think today is the first step as we talk about how much we're retaining in rebates is another step forward in that transparency journey.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","And, Mike, it's Larry. I think that clients rely on us to separate, to pore through the detail of all that. Obviously, they want to continue to see more opportunities. To Jon's point, they see what we're doing today. And are there opportunities beyond what we're doing today? Again, some of that goes back to how we bring them solutions.","And listen, as one example, we're encouraging our clients that have high deductible plans to take a portion of those rebate dollars and pass them back to their members at the pharmacy counter, while they're in that deductible phase.","Once they hit the deductible phase, then they fall into the plan design, where their out of pocket costs dramatically go down. So I think in many respects, the responsibility falls to us as we help educate them in terms of ways that we can help them reduce costs but at the same time improve satisfaction among their members.","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","And, Mike, the only thing I would add to that is as clients talk about their highest priority, it's really around what they're seeing with specialty cost growth. So they would like to see more biosimilars get to the market much faster than what is currently occurring. That's pretty uniform as we're out in the marketplace.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Hi. Good morning and congrats on good results. So I have two questions here. First of all, Larry, to your point, consumer cost at point of sales is really at the core of the brand price debate.","So how long do you think after closing the transaction, do you expect to be able to offer plan design that will lower consumer cost at the front end? And will really kind of like look at the benefit design from the entire life of the member that Jon referred to earlier? So is this something that we are going to start to see materializing in the 2019 selling season? So that's question one.","Second question is around your script growth. I mean you've done a great job translating the preferred networks that you signed late last year with increased volume and market share. When we think ahead, SilverScript Plus remained an open network. Are you planning to move to a preferred network following the lead of what you've done with SilverScript Choice? And what other preferred network opportunities you're seeing for next year?","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Hey, Ricky, this is Dave. Maybe I'll take the script growth perspective and Larry will come back to the first piece.","Keep in mind that our script growth is really coming in three buckets, and each of those buckets is really supporting our growth in the market. One of them is our \u2013 how we're partnering with payors and health plans across the industry, so that's contributing nicely. And our relationships with Part D providers are a part of that.","Secondly, organically, we're just taking share in the marketplace as our service and metrics and performance out in the marketplace have done really well. And we continue to garner share from all the participants.","And then finally, we have a very robust clinical program. Our patient care initiatives are improving adherence for our members, and that's driving script utilization and share gains in the marketplace.","So all three of those components are really important. So we've talked about \u2013 your question is really around one, and we'll continue to focus on that. But that's not the only contributor to our growth.","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","And, Ricky, this is Jon. SilverScript has two plans and both plans have a preferred pharmacy network as part of their designs. So that happened in 2018 for the large SilverScript Part D plan.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","And then, Ricky, back to your first question, in terms of new products, plan designs, I think it's probably more realistic that those innovations would find their way into the market for the 2020 selling season.","But give Aetna a lot of credit, because you may recall, I think, it was a few months ago they announced in \u2013 specific to your question on point of sale rebates, they had announced that in their fully insured book of business that they were going to be applying point of sale rebates to that segment of their business.","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Steven J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Good morning, Larry and Dave. I will also echo that the disclosure around the rebates is definitely helpful to clear the air. And the takeaway just seems to be that you're probably not losing much sleep on the notion of rebate elimination, potentially morphing beyond Medicare and into the commercial segment. That seems to be what some investors are focused on.","So I guess just my quick question around that is the rebate footnote suggests that the $300 million excludes SilverScript. Maybe just to quickly clarify, is the $300 million, is it more heavily weighted to commercial related rebates? I think you said there's some MA-PD in there, but curious on the weighting of that.","And also, is SilverScript being excluded because it's primarily just an intercompany number? Just curious on the thought pattern on not having SilverScript, thanks.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah. So just to be clear, the $300 million retention is for commercial, all of our commercial rebates. All of our Medicare, think about them as 100% pass-through because they support the bid and the premium, so there's no retention on that at all. So $300 million would be the impact of both Medicare and commercial because there's no retention on Medicare.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","And, Steve, to Dave's last point, we talked about our results of the benchmarking process. But, yeah, I think what's interesting to note, obviously you have to preface this by saying it's competition in the private sector.","But you look at what's happening to beneficiary costs and even government costs, okay? And the bid levels have an 11% reduction over the prior year and \u2013 both for beneficiary as well as the government. So you may point to competition, but you also have to point to the value of rebates in contributing to those numbers as well.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Erin Wright of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Erin Wright - Credit Suisse North America","Great. Thanks. Two questions here and a broader question on the PBM. I guess, at this point how would you rank, I guess, outside of rebates \u2013 and that was great color that you gave. But what those core profit drivers are for your PBM business at this point and how that kind of evolves under the new regulatory environment and what you think actually could play out?","And then on Omnicare, you mentioned new leadership and other initiatives. I guess what needs to be done there, or how quickly can you address some of the challenges there? And what is that longer term growth and profit prospects for the Long-Term Care business and how those expectations changed? Thanks","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","So maybe \u2013 this is Dave. I'll talk a little bit about PBM. Obviously the growth in the PBM has been, over the last several years, we continue to see this over the next future periods, especially continues to be a nice driver into this business. Obviously the movement as has always been moving from branded drug to generic drug is a big driver of growth in our business model in the PBM, but importantly our business in totality. So we still think there's opportunities as new generics come to the market to improve our performance from a generic perspective.","And then finally, we do believe that the innovative solutions and products that we have in the market that can support essentially a mail order platform with the convenience of a retail outlet i.e. CVS Pharmacy, is a big opportunity for us to continue to enhance and grow earnings over time. So with that, I'll turn it over to Jon.","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah. Erin, this is Jon. I'll talk about Omnicare. So Dave talked about our four-point plan and he talked about the new management team that's in place. So I'll focus on where we see a lot of the growth opportunity, which is assisted living and not only growing new beds, we're growing penetration.","So as we have been working to grow this business what we found is that the Omnicare service model was not optimal for assisted living. It was really built to service long-term care. And long-term care is facility focused. As an example, all members for the facility are serviced on a same day except when there is a stat order.","In assisted living model, think about it as being more member-centric. So these residents order their prescriptions very similar to what we see in Retail. So, not all members receive their orders on the same day in that facility, they call them in as they need them. So we needed to change the front-end of our pharmacies to service these members. And so we're building assisted living centers of excellence and we have three of these in operation and we'll complete the rollout by year-end.","And I talked at our last earnings calls, how we had invested in account management resources to work directly with facility managers and their residence to improve our service and penetration of the facilities. So early results where we have this model fully in place are positive and we're confident that this service model will enable us to achieve our goals in assisted living.","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe of Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Talked a lot this morning about sort of the evolution of the PBM and you talked about value-based care, but then you also mentioned sort of not much uptake. So with that as the case, one, what would drive that uptake? And then the second piece of that, what's your interest in sort of taking more risk on the PBM side? Could you give us a sense of what percentage of the business you do that on currently? And do you ultimately think that's the biggest change from the current model sort of meeting more trend guarantees and the like? Thanks.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah. Ralph, its Larry. I think it's a great question. And as you look at where we have risk today, obviously the SilverScript is a risk-based product, okay? And we've begun to take \u2013 I'll describe it as elements of risk with our Transform Care program which started with diabetes and I think we've now expanded it to three other chronic diseases. So I do think that we have a growing appetite, okay, to move in that direction. And I believe that the combination of CVS and Aetna can serve as an enabler to doing more of that as we go forward.","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from the line of John Ransom of Raymond James. Please proceed.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi. Sorry for the airport noise. But beyond the rebates, could you talk about the process of re-contracting if gross prices on branded drugs change? And I'm thinking about downstream with PBM and upstream with your retail drug stores, how long that would take? On a 1 to 10, how disruptive that might be? Thanks.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Well, John, this is Dave. We've obviously \u2013 when the industry has changed in the past, I can go back to when AWP rules changed, we went back and recontracted our entire network to conform to new standards of the industry. I would anticipate that if the market were to change in a dramatic fashion, we would have the same opportunity to do that. And I think our contractual structures at this point allow us that flexibility.","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","Hey, John, this is Jon. So if something were to change and Medicare, as an example, those are annual bids so \u2013 and we actually recontract every year with pharmas and the retail networks. So we think we could do that within a year. I think when you think about the commercial market if things were to change, I think it would happen over a much longer period of time and I think we would have plenty of time to pivot to how the market evolves as a result of those changes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Percher of Nephron Research. Please proceed with your question.","Eric Percher - Nephron Research LLC","Thank you. Thinking about the comments you made on the blueprint and squaring that with $300 million of rebates and I wonder if there was any thought to being more aggressive in your proposals and suggesting that we move towards a system where 100% of rebates must be passed back to the payor, whether it's government or commercial were fairly close. And I would think that would put the onus on pharma to address price increases and on payors to address, how much of the rebate goes toward may be plan cost versus consumer cost share or rebates. What are your thoughts on how that might be detrimental or beneficial?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Well, Eric, listen, I think we have always worked to be as flexible as we can in terms of meeting the diverse needs that exists with our clients. And as we acknowledged earlier, today we've got many contracts with 100% value of the rebates being passed back directly to them. As you know, Medicare Part D works that way today, okay?","And I do believe that one of the challenges that we need to solve for is as you think about the plan designs, okay, especially \u2013 we acknowledged earlier those with high deductible plans, okay, that how do we take care of those members, those patients customers who were in the deductible phase, okay, and are incurring costs? Because oftentimes, it's the pharmacy spend within their plan that \u2013 that's where the dollars are spent to go and meet their deductible.","And that's why we advocate for at a minimum that let's apply some of those rebates at the point of sale, while people are in their deductible phase. And once they've satisfied that then the balance of those rebates can be applied by plan sponsors to buy down premiums et cetera, et cetera. So that's where our focus has been along with expanding the definition of HSAs, okay, the use and utilization of preventive drug lists that again can reduce consumer out of pocket costs. So in response to the blueprint, we've spent a tremendous amount of time on those elements as quite frankly opportunities could be brought to market sooner than later.","All right, Jose, we'll take two more questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for the questions. I guess just two quick clarification questions. I know we spent a lot of time on rebates and the trend there, Larry, but I guess just making it a little bit more simple to think about, outside of Part D, if a client choosed a full pass-through rebate contract with you versus one that was maybe more traditional when you were keeping some of that rebate, what is the difference in operating profitability in those two types of arrangements, or are they really kind of a wash?","And then just one other clarification on the retention rate. If I back out the FEP extension, it actually does look like \u2013 if my math is right here, it actually looks like the retention might have been a bit lower actually than what you've seen in recent years. So just was \u2013 want to make sure I was looking at the math right there. And if that is the case, any commonalities for why maybe some clients had choose to leave?","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah. Hey, Bob, this is Dave. Retention rate is actually higher this year, year-to-date than it has been in past with and without FEP. So I think that's \u2013 there must be something wrong with the math there. Our client retention has been extremely strong. We're very pleased with our progress at this point in time.","And I can't really comment on the profit margin on those clients. Each client obviously is underwritten by \u2013 with a target margin rate and we're very focused on maintaining that rate. And we have been successful with clients who have full pass-through and clients who may have an incentive for us to do better in a rebate than a shared savings. So we've been very successful in both models.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","So guys two questions. Just do you guys have a sense given the strategic change, right, we're seeing in a lot of these models, how long that will dampen RFP activity?","And beyond that, switching, people may put out an RFP but may decide to stick with their existing PBM for a longer time to sort of feel out some of these changes. What's your sense on that time? And then secondly, specialty grew how much in the quarter? Maybe it was in there, but I didn't see it.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah John, its Larry. I'll take the first one. And John, listen, I don't know that we can sit here and answer that question, today. I think some of it is going to be based on bringing closure to the variety of activities and questions that exists in the marketplace. And I think that that's probably the key driver to people taking more of a long-term view in terms of understanding how the future marketplace lines up. And then in terms of specialty, our growth in the quarter was...","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Just the low- to mid-single digits, in that ZIP code.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","And John, keep in mind that that would include the loss of the FEP specialty business.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","That's right. Yeah.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Okay and in terms of that number being somewhat depressed from prior years.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","So with that, listen, I know it's been a long call this morning. We appreciate everybody's patience. But obviously there was a lot to talk about and a lot of information to disseminate and as always, Mike McGuire is available for follow-up.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that concludes the conference call for today.

Is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Nancy Christal, senior VP, investor relations. Please go ahead, Ms. Christal.","Nancy Christal","Thank you, operator. Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us. I\u2019m here this morning with Larry Merlo, president and CEO, who will provide a business update, and Dave Denton, executive vice president and CFO, who will review our third quarter results and guidance. John Roberts, president of PBM is also with us today and will participate in the question and answer session following our prepared remarks. Mark Cosby, president of the retail business, was planning to join us, but is under the weather and not able to be here today. ","During the Q&A, please limit yourself to no more than one question with a quick follow up so we can provide more callers with the chance to ask their questions. ","I have one important reminder today, on Wednesday, December 18, we\u2019ll host our 2013 analyst day in New York City. At that time, we\u2019ll provide 2014 guidance and some longer term financial targets as well as a comprehensive update on our strategies for achieving those growth targets. ","You\u2019ll have the opportunity to hear from several members of our senior management team about our PBM, specialty, retail, and MinuteClinic businesses, along with numerous enterprise wide initiatives that will capitalize on the evolving healthcare landscape and drive future growth. If you didn\u2019t reply to your invitation, please let us know if you plan to be there, as space is filing up quickly. The meeting will be webcast for those unable to attend in person, but we do hope to see many of you there on December 18.","Turning to this morning\u2019s news, we posted a slide presentation on our website just before this call which summarizes the information you will hear today, as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance. I encourage you to review the slides. Additionally, we plan to file our quarterly report on Form 10-Q by the close of business today, and it will be available through our website at that time.","During this call, we\u2019ll use some non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company\u2019s performance, mainly free cash flow and adjusted EPS. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find the definitions of these non-GAAP items as well as reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of our website. And, as always, today\u2019s call is being simulcast on our website and it will be archived there following the call for one year.","Now before we continue, our attorneys have asked me to read the Safe Harbor statement. During this presentation, we\u2019ll make certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Accordingly, for these forward-looking statements, we claim the protection of the Safe Harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. ","We strongly recommend that you become familiar with the specific risks and uncertainties that are described in the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our upcoming quarterly report on Form 10-Q.","And now I\u2019ll turn this over to Larry Merlo.","Larry Merlo","Thanks, Nancy. Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Now, given that our analyst day is next month, our business update this morning will be brief. However, I do want to take some time to cover some of the topics that I know are top of mind in the marketplace, such as the impact of the Affordable Care Act.","But before we get to that, let\u2019s kick things off with today\u2019s earnings, because we\u2019re pleased to report that we posted solid third quarter results across the enterprise. Overall operating profit increased more than 15%, with the PBM and retail businesses growing approximately 28% and 8% respectively.","And it\u2019s important to note that excludes the benefit from a legal settlement that was finalized during the third quarter. That settlement related to a prescription drug antitrust lawsuit with a drug manufacturer. We recorded a $72 million gain within operating expenses, which equates to a $0.04 per share benefit in Q3.","Now, that said, adjusted earnings per share excluding the legal settlement came in at $1.05 for the quarter, and that\u2019s $0.02 above the high end of our guidance. We also generated a substantial amount of free cash and year to date the total now stands at $3.1 billion and consistent with our goal at the beginning of the year, we remain committed to returning about $5 billion to our shareholders this year through both dividends and share repurchases.","Considering our strong operating results to date, along with our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are raising and narrowing our earnings guidance for full year \u201913 to a range of $3.94 to $3.97, and that\u2019s a change from our previous range of $3.90 to $3.96. And again, that\u2019s excluding the $0.04 benefit from the legal settlement. Dave will discuss our results and guidance in more detail during his financial review. ","With that, let me address some of the topics of interest that I alluded to earlier. I think as everyone knows, the healthcare environment is changing rapidly, and there are certainly a number of moving parts, from the Affordable Care Act to the private exchanges, and collectively we expect changes within this environment to be a net positive for our business in 2014.","So let me walk you through the multiple ways that we\u2019ll continue to grow our business in this evolving landscape. First, we\u2019ll participate in coverage expansion and the public exchanges, as well as Medicaid. Second, we\u2019ll participate in the private exchange market for both active employees and retirees. And I think it\u2019s important to remember that our opportunities to participate are not limited to just our PBM, but span across our entire enterprise to include both our retail pharmacies, along with our MinuteClinic businesses. ","So let\u2019s drill down a little further through our PBM, because we\u2019ll participate in the public exchanges through our health plan clients on a carve-in basis, where the health plan offers integrated medical and pharmacy benefits and we provide the PBM services. In fact, our health plan client footprint spans 25 states covering nearly 70% of the eligible exchange population.","In addition, as the number one PBM player in the managed Medicaid space, we\u2019re also very well positioned to gain share through Medicaid expansion, and we certainly understand what these clients require. ","Moving to the private exchanges, we\u2019ll participate through both a carve-in basis - again through our health plan clients - as well as on a carve-out basis as a standalone PBM where we have direct prescription benefit offerings on the exchange products. And we are well-positioned to win lives on the exchanges given our unique products and services as well as our trusted brand and name recognition. ","Within the private exchanges, we\u2019ll also play an important role in providing coverage to retirees through our Silver Script prescription drug plan, as well as our health plan clients\u2019 PDP and MAPD businesses. ","Now, there\u2019s certainly been a lot of speculation about what various employers are going to do with their populations, recognizing and acknowledging that large employers cannot participate on the public exchanges until 2017. ","Well, the fact is that less than 1% of covered lives are expected to move to private exchange products in 2014. And based on conversations we have had with our PBM clients and private exchange partners, we believe that most large employers are taking a wait and see approach to private exchanges, particularly with their active employees. ","Now, we recently had a meeting with our client advisory group, and they told us that they feel they can manage costs effectively in their own environment while still maintaining both control and flexibility. ","That said, large employers may consider moving their retirees to the exchanges over time, and we may see more movement to private exchanges by smaller employers over the next few years, because the exchanges do offer a way to reduce administrative burdens. However, I want to emphasize the point that we are very well positioned to gain lives and market share in the exchange products. ","Recently, you have also been asking about the impact all of this will have on PBM margins. And as we\u2019ve stated previously, we do expect to see some churn in PBM lives as some members may move from the employer bucket to the health plan bucket, and although this may result in margin compression in some instances, we expect this will be mitigated by cost management tools such as narrow networks, our proprietary Maintenance Choice offering, narrow formularies, step therapies, and the list goes on. And as a result, we do not expect a material impact on PBM margins in the foreseeable future. ","In addition to tighter pharmacy management tools, we also expect share gains from both market expansion and market churn as an additional lever to help offset PBM margin compression. And as I mentioned again, we\u2019re well-positioned to win lives on the exchanges given our unique products and services, along with our trusted brand and name recognition.","Now, I also mentioned it\u2019s important to remember that the opportunities from healthcare reform go well beyond our PBM, because our consumer expertise in the new business to consumer world of healthcare is being welcomed by health plans across the country, and leveraging our retail footprint, we can support healthcare marketing initiatives ranging from limited pilot marketing programs to full-scale educational programs.","In fact, over the next six months, we expect health plans to host more than 6,000 marketing events in more than 1,000 of our stores across 20 states. Some of these health plan partnerships also include participation in preferred or restricted retail pharmacy networks and many are taking advantage of the convenient and affordable MinuteClinic services as well as cost-saving PBM services and programs to better manage the specialty pharmacy segment. ","And on top of these opportunities, our retail business will obviously benefit from the expansion of coverage along with our ability to drive incremental scripts through our fixed retail cost structure.","So while there are a lot of moving parts, all things considered, we\u2019re very well positioned and we\u2019ll certainly provide more specific context around our assumptions for the newly covered lives and pharmacy utilization that we expect from reform when we provide our guidance next month at analyst day. ","So with that, let me quickly review some highlights on the PBM business. We\u2019ve had a strong 2014 selling season, despite the fact that the number of RFPs were down year over year. To date, we\u2019ve completed 75% of renewals, and we have a retention rate of 96%. Our gross sales wins currently total $5.1 billion, with net new business of about $1.8 billion. And remember that this net new business excludes any impact from attrition in our Medicare Part D PDP business.","Now with regard to the sanction imposed by CMS earlier this year, as we\u2019ve talked about previously, it has prevented us from marketing our Silver Script PDP or enrolling new members. And recall that the sanction primarily affects our individual Silver Script prescription drug product.","Today we have about 3.3 million Silver Script lives and we expect to have roughly 3 million lives in our individual Silver Script PDP by the end of January \u201914. On our last call, we said that we expected our remediation efforts to be complete sometime near the end of the year, and we expect to meet that target. And once complete, the next step will be for CMS to conduct its review to determine whether the issues have been fixed, are not likely to recur, and ultimately CMS will determine when the sanction will be lifted.","While we\u2019re obviously disappointed that we have not been able to participate in the open enrollment period, it is important to remember that we still see significant opportunity to grow our Med D business over the long term. And we believe that the changes that we have made to strengthen the Med D management team, along with the remediation steps that we\u2019ve taken will allow us to do just that.","Now, on the heels of a successful 2014 selling season in our commercial PBM business, work has already begun on the 2015 selling season, and as all of you know, we have a long term strategic agreement with Aetna to provide their PBM services. And I\u2019m happy to report that we have successfully completed the 2015 market check with Aetna, and we look forward to continuing our strong and mutually beneficial relationship.","I\u2019m also very pleased that we have successfully completed the migration of Aetna\u2019s commercial business to the CVS Caremark platform. That\u2019s pretty significant, since it means that more clients will have access to CVS Caremark\u2019s differentiated offerings. ","Our joint efforts with the Aetna sales team have been successful to date, with numerous clients adopting our unique offerings, like Maintenance Choice, like Pharmacy Advisor, and we\u2019re also working closely with Aetna to implement and administer their exchange offerings and other government programs resulting from the Affordable Care Act.","Now turning to our specialty business, growth was strong. Revenue\u2019s up approximately 22% year over year. This growth was driven by drug price inflation, utilization, new product launches, and new PBM clients. ","At our recent client forum, many of our clients expressed concerns about the rapid growth in specialty pharmacy costs, and they are increasingly open to new ideas and solutions that address the escalating growth in specialty, and we certainly view this as a significant opportunity. And you\u2019ll hear more about our strategies to help clients manage the specialty trend next month at analyst day. ","Moving on to the retail business, we had another solid quarter. Total same-store sales increased 3.6% while pharmacy same-store sales increased a very healthy 5.7%. Pharmacy same-store sales were negatively impacted by about 320 basis points due to recent generic introductions, and that\u2019s about half of the 670 basis point impact that we saw in Q2.","Pharmacy same-store scripts increased 1.4% when counting 90-day scripts as one. It increased 4.5% on a 30-day equivalent basis. And we have seen a greater than historical rate of conversion to 90-day from 30-day scripts. And that\u2019s being driven by the continued strong growth in our Maintenance Choice programs.","I\u2019m also pleased to report that the retention of scripts gained during last year\u2019s impasse between Walgreens and Express Scripts continues to exceed our expectations. As you know, our goal was to retain at least 60% of those scripts this year and we are ahead of that goal.","As for the front store business, comps decreased 1%, reflecting a decline in traffic. At the same time, we saw continued increase in basket size, as well as modestly higher front store margins. Our ExtraCare loyalty card continues to enable us to personalize our offers, creating more value for customers and gaining a bigger share of their wallet. ","In fact, this quarter we launched the My Weekly ad, a first of its kind personalized digital circular experience that taps into ExtraCare insights. And the My Weekly ad provides a unique weekly circular for every customer that\u2019s geared to their shopping preferences, saving them both time and money. We hope you\u2019ll log on and give it a try and we\u2019ll speak more about this on analyst day. ","As for new stores, we opened 71 new or relocated stores, closed one during the quarter, resulting 48 net new stores in Q3, and this keeps us on track to achieve our 2-3% square footage growth target for the year.","Let me turn briefly to MinuteClinic, which posted a revenue growth of 18% versus last year\u2019s third quarter. We opened 42 net new clinics in the quarter, including clinics in two new states, Hawaii and Louisiana, ending Q3 with 726 clinics in 27 states and the District of Columbia. And our long term goal is to create a platform that supports primary care by providing integrated, high-quality care that is convenient, accessible, and affordable. And we\u2019ll talk more about that next month as well.","With that, let me turn it over to Dave for the financial review.","David Denton","Thank you, Larry. Good morning everyone. Before turning to our results and our guidance, I want to highlight how our disciplined capital allocation program continues to enhance shareholder value. And during the third quarter, we paid approximately $276 million in dividends, bringing our year to date payout to $829 million.","Additionally, we repurchased approximately 25.8 million shares for $1.5 billion in the quarter, at an average price of $58.98 per share. Year to date, we\u2019ve repurchased 39.6 million shares for approximately $2.3 billion, again at an average price of $57.33.","As you can see, the pace of buybacks accelerated throughout the third quarter, and we remain on track to complete approximately $4 billion of share repurchase in \u201913, which is also included in our guidance. ","So between dividends and share repurchases, we have returned more than $3.1 billion to our shareholders through the first three quarters of this year alone and we continue to expect to return approximately $5 billion for the full year.","We\u2019ve also generated approximately $3.1 billion of free cash flow through September of this year. Improving our cash generation capabilities through improved working capital management remains an area of focus for us. ","And over the past several years, we\u2019ve made excellent progress in reducing our cash cycle. As previously noted, we have some timing issues with respect to CMS payables and receivables that may affect our working capital and delivery of free cash flow for the year. Even so, we are maintaining our guidance of free cash flow of between $4.8 billion and $5.1 billion this year, while we work to offset this headwind to our target.","As for the income statement, third quarter adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.05 per share was approximately $0.02 above the high end of our guidance, after removing the pre-tax gain of $72 million from the legal settlement. ","GAAP diluted EPS was $1.03 per share, including the $0.04 from the legal settlement. Earnings were higher than expected, primarily due to the outperformance in the PBM, a favorable tax rate, and a weighted average share count that was slightly lower than planned. ","Now let me quickly walk you through our results. On a consolidated basis, revenues in the third quarter increased 5.8% or approximately $1.7 billion to $32 billion. This exceeded the top of our guidance range, again driven by the PBM.","PBM net revenues increased 7.8%, or approximately $1.4 billion, to $19.5 billion. This growth was more than 225 basis points above the high end of our guidance, and was driven by higher than anticipated claims volume, primarily from Maintenance Choice, as well as higher inflation within our specialty business.","Script utilization trends were consistent with prior periods, and we saw increased utilization of the retail network and in Maintenance Choice claims, offset by declining trends in core mail order. Claims growth year over year was driven by net new client wins and increased membership within our existing book of business. Specialty pharmacy was also a key driver. ","Slightly offsetting these positive revenue drivers was a strong GDR, which is obviously good for the bottom line. The PBM\u2019s generic dispensing rate increased 170 basis points versus the same quarter of last year to 81%. ","Note that starting with Q1 of this year, the sequential year over year rate of increase continues to slow from the high point of approximately 500 basis points in Q4 of last year to 170 basis points this quarter. This trend is expected to continue throughout Q4 of this year, given that fewer generic conversions are expected for the remainder of this year versus last year. ","Revenues in the retail business increased 5% in the quarter, or approximately $780 million, to $16.3 billion. As with the PBM, Maintenance Choice adoption was better than expected and helped drive overall performance to near the higher end of expectations. Like the PBM, new generic introductions negatively impacted retail sales, with our retail GDR increasing approximately 160 basis points versus the third quarter of \u201912, to 81.5%.","Now turning to gross margins, we reported 18.9% for the consolidated company in the quarter, an increase of approximately 20 basis points compared to Q3 of \u201912. Within the PBM segment, gross margins increased by approximately 65 basis points versus the second quarter of last year to 6.6% while gross profit dollars increased approximately 20% year over year.","The increase in margin rate year over year was primarily driven by better acquisition cost, rebate economics, timing of our Medicare Part D PDP margins, as well as the increase in GDR. The increase in margin dollars was driven by higher volumes from new clients and new members and higher specialty volumes versus the third quarter of last year as well as the shift of Medicare Part D profitability from Q4 into Q3 of this year.","These positive drivers were partially offset by price compression as well as remediation and operating costs within our Medicare Part D business. Gross margin for the retail segment was 30%, down about 15 basis points from last year, while gross profit dollars increased 4.5% year over year.","Given that pharmacy growth was stronger than front store growth in the quarter, pharmacy revenues as a percentage of total retail revenues increased by about 135 basis points. This shift in the business mix was the main driver of the climb in the overall retail margin rate since gross margins in the pharmacy business are lower than that in the front. Partially offsetting this was the increase in GDR as the continued increase in front store margins. ","Excluding the positive impact of the legal settlement, total consolidated operating expenses as a percentage of revenues improved versus the third quarter of \u201912 by approximately 35 basis points to 12.3% while total SG&A dollars grew by 2.9%. ","The PBM segment SG&A rate improved by about 15 basis points to 1.5%, excluding the benefit of the $11 million settlement. PBM expenses declined approximately $4 million from the third quarter of last year, and this reflects reduced spending on the streamlining initiative as the project nears completion.","In the retail segment, solid expense control resulted in an improvement in SG&A as a percentage of sales of 40 basis points to 21.3%, excluding the $61 million from the legal settlement. Overall retail SG&A expenses grew by about 3.1%. Within the corporate segment, expenses increased by approximately $10 million to $179 million. As a percentage of consolidated revenues, operating expenses were flat. ","Adding it all up and excluding the impact of the legal settlement, operating margins for the total enterprise improved approximately 55 basis points to 6.5%. Operating margins in the PBM improved 80 basis points to 5.1% while operating margin at retail improved by 25 basis points to 8.7%.","For the quarter, we were comfortably within the high end of our guidance for operating profit growth in the retail segment, while we exceeded our expectations in the PBM. Excluding the benefit from the legal segment, retail operating profit increased a very healthy 8.2% while PBM operating profits increased a very strong 27.7%.","Going below the line on the consolidated income statement, net interest expense in the quarter declined approximately $12 million from last quarter, to $122 million. The debt refinancing we did in the fourth quarter of last year continues to be the primary driver of the year over year decrease each quarter. Additionally, our effective tax rate was 38.2%, which was slightly better than we expected, and our weighted average share count was slightly lower than anticipated, at about $1.23 billion shares for the quarter.","So now let me turn to our 2013 guidance, which we both raised and narrowed this morning. Excluding the impact of the legal settlement in the third quarter, we currently expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share of $3.94 to $3.97 for 2013, reflecting strong year over year growth of 14.75% to 15.75%, after removing the impact in 2012 of the early extinguishment of debt to make the numbers more comparable.","GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $3.73 to $3.76 per share. Our revised guidance reflects our solid performance for the first nine months of this year as well as our confidence in our outlook. ","Embedded in this guidance are share repurchases totaling approximately $4 billion for the year, including shares from a $1.7 billion accelerated share repurchase program that we began on October 1. The details of the program will be available in our 10-Q, which will be filed later today.","Now let me walk you through our fourth quarter guidance. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.09 per share to $1.12 per share, down 1.5% to 4.25% from Q4 of \u201912 after removing the impact from last year\u2019s fourth quarter resulting from the early extinguishment of debt.","GAAP EPS from continuing operations is expected to in the range of $1.03 per share to $1.06 per share. As I said on our last quarterly call, we expect the fourth quarter to be somewhat atypical this year, driven mostly by the timing of break open generics and by Med D profits in the PBM. ","With respect to Medicare Part D, as I noted on our last earnings call, we are seeing a shift of profitability within the business from Q4, which has historically been our most profitable Med D quarter into Q3. A number of factors are affecting this, predominantly changes in earned rebates and the mix of the business across our Silver Script Choice versus our Silver Script Basic plan, as well as the impact of the sanction. As such, we expect the PBM segment\u2019s operating profit to decline by 15% to 18% in the fourth quarter.","We expect the retail segment\u2019s operating profit to increase 2.75% to 4.5% in the quarter, driven by gains in both the front store as well as the pharmacy. For the PBM segment, we expect revenues to increase 3.5% to 5% for the fourth quarter and adjusted claims to be between $262 million and $265 million.","For the retail segment, we expect revenue to increase 3.5% to 5%, with same-store sales to increase 2.25% to 3.75%. Same-store scripts are expected to increase 0.5% to 1.5% while adjusted script comps are forecasted to be between 3% and 4%.","And now as a result, for the total enterprise in the quarter we expect revenues to be up approximately 2.75% to 4.25% from the fourth quarter of \u201912. This is after intercompany eliminations, which are projected to equal about 10.6% of combined segment revenues.","For the total company, gross profit margins are expected to be down significantly from last year\u2019s fourth quarter, as both the retail and PBM segments will experience contraction. Expectations are that gross margin in the retail segment will be notably down due to fewer new generics available to offset continued reimbursement pressure. ","Gross margins in the PBM segment will be significantly down, due in large part to the timing of Medicare Part D profitability, but also due to fewer break open new generics to offset pricing pressures. ","These trends are occurring as expected, as we lap a large amount of break open generics in 2012. For the total company, operating expenses as a percentage of revenues are expected to moderately improve in the fourth quarter. PBM operating expenses should show modest improvement, driven in part by a reduction of streamlining costs year over year.","Retail expense leverage should notably improve, and upturn from recent trends largely due to the fact that there are fewer new generics and therefore less deleveraging of expenses. And we expect operating expenses from the corporate segment to be between $190 million and $195 million.","We expect operating margin for the total company in the quarter to be down 60 to 70 basis points from last year\u2019s fourth quarter. We expect net interest expense of between $130 million and $135 million, and a tax rate of approximately 39% in the fourth quarter.","We anticipate that we will have approximately 1.2 billion weighted average shares for the quarter, which would imply approximately 1.23 billion for the year. And as I said, we continue to expect to generate free cash flow in the range of $4.8 billion to $5.1 billion, and we remain focused on using our strong free cash flow to drive shareholder value now as well as into the future.","And with that, I will turn it back over to Larry Merlo.","Larry Merlo ","Thanks, Dave. And just to sum things up, obviously we\u2019re pleased with our strong third quarter results, and optimistic about the outlook for this year and next. We see the evolving healthcare environment as an opportunity for growth, and we believe we\u2019re very well positioned to gain market share across the enterprise.","So with that, let\u2019s go ahead and open it up for your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] Our first question comes from the line of Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. ","Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs","A lot of good detail on the PBM side, so I thought maybe I\u2019d start off on the front end. Same-store sales down again this quarter, and I know you\u2019re citing softer traffic. I was wondering if you could just maybe share some color on whether you think this has been more macro-driven, or is there some competitive changes going on that are driving a little softness on the front end?","Larry Merlo ","We have discussed in the past that we continue to see a cautious consumer. We did see some pullback in consumer spending that began in the spring timeframe. It\u2019s manifesting itself in fewer trips. At the same time, we have seen the promotional environment intensify in both the drug and mass channels. At the same time, we have not made dramatic changes in our promotional strategy. ","As a matter of fact, if you look at our year over year promotional circular page count, in the third quarter it was actually down 12%. And we continue to use ExtraCare as our point of differentiation along with delivering a way to create value for consumers. And we have been able to drive the basket size of our customers. And as Dave mentioned in his remarks, it\u2019s also important to point out that through these efforts we\u2019ve been able to achieve margin expansion.","So I think on the front store sales issue, it\u2019s always a bit of art and science, trial and error. Mark and his retail team are certainly focused on it. We would like our front store comps to be better, but we\u2019ll be very disciplined about not chasing empty sales. ","Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs ","That makes a lot of sense. And Larry, I know you talked about a lot of the major topics in the sector, specifically the exchanges. And obviously look forward to getting more detail on that at the analyst day, but one of the other major topics as of late has been agreements across the supply chain as far as consolidating generic purchasing. I\u2019m just wondering if you could weigh in given some of the activity as of late, as far as your view of your current positioning in generic sourcing and whether or not you think in light of some of these moves that you would be interested in trying to garner more scale.","Larry Merlo ","Our position has really not changed since we discussed this on our last call. A generic sourcing alliance could present an interesting opportunity. We\u2019re certainly always open to learning and evaluating opportunities in the marketplace, and if we were to determine that an alliance could drive higher returns for us, we\u2019d certainly consider that. And we believe that we could do that without expending significant capital. So we\u2019ll continue to watch it, and there may be some incremental opportunities domestically, but we still see the global sourcing environment less clear, but again we\u2019ll be open to opportunities.","Operator","Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Bob Willoughby from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","Robert Willoughby - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","In light of how fast the CVS share of the Caremark accounts has grown over the past few years, does it make sense to offer any type of quarterly update where you think your share stands and to offer any targets where that could go over the next couple of years?","David Denton ","Good question. As you know, we have seen substantial growth in share within CVS, within the Caremark book. I think over the past few years we\u2019ve moved from roughly 18% to in excess of 31% at this point in time. My guess is those are longer term movement trends. So probably quarter by quarter it might not make the most sense. Probably year over year is probably a more comparable perspective. So you\u2019ll probably see a little bit of that as we cycle into analyst day coming up here.","Larry Merlo ","It\u2019s a great question. I think it does make sense to look at it on an annual basis. And to Dave\u2019s point, keep in mind that that retail percent of the Caremark book of business, while it\u2019s grown, the pie has also grown at the same time. There have been north of $25 billion worth of new business wins during that period of time.","Robert Willoughby - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","Any three year target per chance?","David Denton ","Not at this point.","Operator","Continuing on, next question is from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research ","Can you give us any color on the share in the retail business now that is transitioning from 30- to 90-day? Where you think that might go, and how you are running the business or managing capacity in the stores differently as that has taken place?","Larry Merlo ","We have seen it grow for some time now. Acknowledging growth off of a smaller base, but it has been growing north of 20%. And I think that there are a lot of variables in play that are driving that growth. I\u2019ll start with Maintenance Choice, but there are also more plan designs out there that have 90-day options at retail, and there\u2019s been a lot of information out there that 90-day prescriptions also improve medication adherence. ","So I think that that we\u2019ll continue to see a disproportionate growth and an acceleration from 30 to 90. Obviously, on the retail side, we have always done an effective job of managing SG&A at the store level. And the labor models that we have built, along with our workflow in the pharmacy, enable us to flex our labor according to those volumes. And there are some labor efficiencies to be picked up there.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research ","And then secondly, you talked about restricted or preferred networks. Just curious what you\u2019re seeing take place, and what you\u2019re facilitating through Caremark, and what you\u2019re seeing take place in the market in terms of the appetite and adoption and utilization of preferred or narrowed networks on the retail front as we move into 2014.","Jonathan Roberts","We\u2019ve clearly seen the growth of preferred networks in Medicare. Got off to a slow start when Medicare was first implemented, but you\u2019ve seen a lot of movement, particularly over the last couple of years. In Medicaid, we\u2019re seeing restricted networks in the managed Medicaid space. We think that continues to be something that this segment will be interested in. ","And in the employer space, you\u2019ve seen - and Dave talked about our growth of Maintenance Choice, which is a form of a narrow network - interest from employers. I would say this year probably less interest, because employers were more focused on healthcare reform changes they needed to make within their own book of business. ","But it\u2019s interesting that health plans that historically have not been interested in narrow networks, we\u2019re seeing a lot of interest, particularly around their exchange offerings. So we\u2019ve had several health plans adopt narrow networks for their public exchange offerings. ","So we think it continues to be an opportunity for plans and clients to save money through either preferred or restricted networks. So we continue to see good growth opportunities in this area. ","Operator","Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your question. ","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities ","First, on Maintenance Choice, any comment on the relative growth rates of 2.0 and 1.0? And how much time do you think it takes for 2.0 to start then customers migrating from 2.0 to 1.0? Will that be one full contract cycle? Or shorter? Longer? What are your thoughts on that?","Larry Merlo ","We\u2019ll touch on this more at analyst day, but we have seen some adoption on 2.0. I think certainly, as we\u2019ve talked, we see an opportunity to, when you look at 1.0 and 2.0, the opportunity to cover more than 30 million lives over time, I think we see an adoption track where a client gets into 2.0 and then ultimately migrates in to 1.0 to maximize the savings. But we\u2019ll hit more of the metrics in December.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities ","And then secondly, thinking about the front end and My Weekly ad, if you could segment traffic by loyalty of customer - I don\u2019t know if you would do a decile or a quartile or whatever - is traffic down among the most loyal customers? Or is it down more among the least loyal, so maybe some of that is by your design? And then over time, as My Weekly ad gets greater adoption, what does that do to traffic and is that a significant incremental positive to margin, as you\u2019re maybe wasting less promotional dollars?","Larry Merlo ","Those are two great questions. If you look at our traffic through segmentation, we would see more of the declines among our least loyal customers. We continue to see growth in our most loyal customers. I think directionally, you\u2019re spot on in terms of the reality of as we migrate over time, and reduce our dependency on the weekly circular, there is certainly an opportunity to deliver value to our ExtraCare members and create a high level of satisfaction and a bigger share of wallet, and to be able to do that so there\u2019s a flowthrough to the P&L.  ","","And by the way, the My Weekly circular just becomes one more tool. That\u2019s not going to be the single conduit that drives that behavior. It will be that in addition to many of the other attributes that ExtraCare offers the consumer.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities ","Well, when you did ExtraCare, that helped growth, right? Will My Weekly ad help to the same degree, or not as much?","Larry Merlo ","It\u2019s early. We\u2019re experimenting with it now. And that\u2019s something that we\u2019ll be able to talk about over time.","Operator","Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler from Barclays. Please proceed. ","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital","I\u2019d like to just go back a little bit to the discussion about the private exchanges, and you talk about some being carve-in of pharmacy benefit and some being carve-out. Do you have any sense of kind of what percentage is going to be carve-in and what is going to be carve-out? And then also, related to that, is there a difference in profitability when it\u2019s carve-out versus carve-in?","Larry Merlo ","I\u2019ll take the first part of that. Acknowledging that A) it\u2019s early, B) it\u2019s a small sample size. But you know, what we have seen is a trend that really looks at the historical preference of the clients. And by that I mean if the employer had pharmacy as a carve-out option, then they\u2019re going onto a private exchange product that continues to carve out pharmacy, and vice versa. If they have pharmacy carved in with their health plan, then they\u2019re migrating to a carve-in product. And again, it\u2019s a limited sample, but that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen to date.","Jonathan Roberts","And then on the profitability, it\u2019s really a function of what programs they adopt that really drives profitability. So it lowers their cost, but drives our profitability. Programs like mail formulary, network programs, and others. And we think with the consumer making that choice, they\u2019re going to be more likely to make those selections for themselves.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital ","Right. And then switching gears, a question back to the discussion of the front end, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re ever going to eliminate the circular, the one that isn\u2019t tied to the loyalty card or the individual, but can you conceive of it being much less promotional and more kind of like an EDLP circular? I mean, there are other retailers who highlight their good deals every day, but not necessarily being focused on promotional items.","Larry Merlo ","I think that you are right. I don\u2019t think any of us see the circular going completely away. And I think that it will evolve over the next few years. I can see it being smaller. I can see it being more focused. Exactly what shape and form that takes, I think, is probably still an open question. I mean, we know that just because of the viewership or the readership of the newspaper, circular distribution is down from what it was five years ago. And so I think directionally you\u2019re correct with your hypothesis.","Operator","Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. ","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan ","Larry, thank you very much for all the comments on the public and private exchanges, but I\u2019m actually going to ask a question around Medicare Part D. When you look at your now guidance of roughly 3 million members versus 3.3 million before, is that roughly in line with the 350,000 that you talked about last time? And secondly, anything you\u2019re seeing in the open enrollment period that would change any of your thoughts around that going into next year?","Larry Merlo ","In response to your first question, it is consistent with what we talked about on our last call in terms of the attrition of about 350,000 lives. And it\u2019s early in open enrollment, but we have not seen anything that is contradictory to what we\u2019ve talked about.","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan ","And then secondly, can you maybe just give us an update on where you are on RDS and conversion from RDS? Clearly the tax benefit goes away in 2014. And based on the sanctions that you have, can you just remind us if there\u2019s any impact at all of moving people potentially to an EGWP or any other programs as they shift away from RDS? ","Jonathan Roberts ","We saw most employers focused on healthcare reform this year, so most of the movement to EGWPs happened the year before. We think there will be a pickup in activity this year. Our plan would be out of sanction, so we believe that we\u2019ll be able to implement anyone that wants to move into an EGWP product moving forward.","Larry Merlo ","The other thing I would mention is that we have been operating under a waiver from CMS to continue to enroll EGWP members that we had commitments to prior to the sanction. So that has been ongoing. That waiver has been extended through January of \u201914.","Operator","Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. ","Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research","I had a quick housekeeping item, and then I wanted to get to my questions. Flu shots, is that in your script number or not? I can\u2019t remember.","Larry Merlo ","Flu shots we do treat as a prescription. And I\u2019ll call it season to date\u2026 The season kicks off in the August timeframe, and what I\u2019m going to share with you probably goes through near the end of October. But we\u2019ve administered just over 3 million flu shots across our retail business and MinuteClinic. And that\u2019s up from last year.","Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research ","The second question I have really goes to the outlook for the PBM. You guys talked about market share and that you feel like you can kind of, with the new environment, gain market share. It seems to me, as we look at Medicaid, I think you\u2019re 31% of that bus. It\u2019s grown quite a bit, so I want to understand can that go higher? Also, you commented that you\u2019re in 25 states with the exchanges. Can you get to more states? Can 70% become 90%? ","And then the final question about next year as we have some big contracts out, like Tricare, what\u2019s your confidence that you\u2019ll continue to gain share on the PBM side of the business in those three different buckets? ","Larry Merlo ","In terms of Medicaid, and I think specifically you\u2019re talking about the managed Medicaid environment. And you\u2019re right, we have about 30% share of the managed Medicaid market. We certainly see more room for growth there. We\u2019re estimating that the managed Medicaid market is going to grow by about 40% between now and 2016. So we see that, again, as a driver for growth. ","Jonathan Roberts ","As far as we\u2019re in 25 states with 70%, as we continue to win in the marketplace and win health plans, which we had some wins this year, we\u2019ll continue to expand our footprint. And just as far as winning across all segments, as Larry mentioned earlier, for the 2014 selling season we got over $5 billion in gross wins with 96% retention. ","If you look back over the last several years, we\u2019ve continued to be very successful selling. Our integrated model continues to resonate in the marketplace with Maintenance Choice, Pharmacy Advisor, our integrated specialty capabilities we\u2019re launching, what we\u2019re able to do for our clients with MinuteClinic. So we\u2019re very bullish on our growth opportunities moving forward.","Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research ","And then one final follow up is if you continue to gain share like you have been, which is driving a tremendous amount of traffic into your assets, particularly your retail assets, and I know you\u2019re doing the promotional stuff, but Larry we\u2019ve talked about how do you get the incremental sales in a profitable way? It seems like there\u2019s a tremendous untapped opportunity to take that traffic and convert it to some front end sales. Any other color on how we get that done?","Larry Merlo ","First of all, I agree with you, and as I mentioned earlier, I think it was the first question, that our retail team is working hard to improve our comp sales performance. And I think some of what you\u2019re describing lies in innovation and trial and error, and we\u2019ve got a talented team focused on it, and we\u2019ll continue to work and ultimately crack the code on that. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Wiltamuth from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. ","Mark Wiltamuth - Jefferies","Wanted to ask a little bit about the specialty pharma environment. And I know you have a pilot going there to kind of join the CVS brick and mortar stores with the mail operations on specialty. If you could give us an update on what\u2019s going on there and how you think that will evolve as the specialty trends continue to grow. ","Jonathan Roberts ","If you think of specialty today, and you think about it from an access to a member perspective, it\u2019s primarily a mail channel today. What we\u2019ve been able to do is take all of our specialty capabilities and connect them to our retail stores. So now members that want to get access to specialty medications can go in any one of our 7,400 stores as we roll this program out next year. ","We\u2019ll leverage all of the back-end clinical capabilities, the billing capabilities, the fulfillment capabilities, and then we\u2019ll be able to deliver that prescription either to the member\u2019s home, like happens today with specialty pharmacy, or deliver it to their local CVS Pharmacy. And it\u2019s interesting, very similar to Maintenance Choice, half the people want to pick up their specialty prescription in their CVS local store, the other half want it mailed to their home. ","When you think about it from a pharma perspective, historically adherence levels for specialty medications have been lower in the retail channel than in the specialty channel. In our pilots, we\u2019ve been able to achieve the same levels of adherence through the integrated specialty offering that we have in mail. So we think pharma\u2019s going to be pretty bullish on this capability. ","So we\u2019re improving access, we\u2019re achieving very high adherence levels, and we\u2019re delivering all the clinical capabilities that these patients need, with the convenience that we\u2019re able to offer through an integrated offering.","Mark Wiltamuth - Jefferies ","And is the bigger win capturing more prescriptions at the local pharmacy, or is it just the convenience of delivery for the consumer?","Jonathan Roberts ","Well, I think about it in probably two parts. One is we think because we\u2019ll have a differentiated offering, again it adds to our value proposition as we\u2019re out trying to win new clients. Secondly, there is a segment of the population that is open. Medicare is an example, where the patient has choice where they get their specialty prescription filled. So we think we have a better value proposition for those patients, so we think we will capture more share of that open business.","Larry Merlo ","And I think the only other point that I would make is that we can make it a seamless experience across all of the stakeholders that are involved here, to include the physician. ","Operator","Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with ISI Group. Please proceed with your question.","Ross Muken - ISI Group ","Maybe first just going back to all the stuff you laid out re reform. Do you feel like the more you continue to dig into this, and obviously there\u2019s a lot of things changing and a lot of unknowns, but do you feel like the integrated model, you continue to figure out sort of new services, new offerings, new potential profit drivers as things change, and you really sort of have a structural advantage there, having the full suite of capabilities versus maybe some of your peers?","Larry Merlo ","I think you said it very well. I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s a whole lot I would add to that, other than agreeing with you. And I think it gets back to what we\u2019ve talked about many, many times, that if you think about, from the PBM perspective, that it\u2019s largely been a B2B bus, and if you think about the new world order adding B2C segment, we\u2019ve got expertise in both. ","And I think that that\u2019s how we\u2019re uniquely positioned to gain share, acknowledging that we are going to go through a period of churn in terms of who\u2019s sponsoring the coverage. But we feel that we\u2019re well-positioned and that whether you\u2019re talking about our PBM assets, our retail assets, our MinuteClinic assets, that we can do things and bring differentiation into the market that would be difficult for standalone peers to replicate.  ","Ross Muken - ISI Group ","I guess you guys have done a good job of educating us. Maybe just quickly on the selling season, if you look at some of the net losses, could you maybe just sort of tick through how much of that was sort of acquisition and if not, in terms of the update from Q2, what were the key reasons where you saw maybe the business move away from you?","Larry Merlo ","The numbers that we gave, to include the retention, does reflect the net impact of acquisition activity. And recognizing that we pick up some from acquisitions and we lose some. But acquisition activity posed a headwind for us in terms of the impact of that. And I\u2019ll let Jon talk about it from a client perspective.","Jonathan Roberts ","It\u2019s a very sticky business. We\u2019ve got retention at 96%, you add on top of that the $5 billion in new wins. You\u2019re always going to see some movement as people go out and evaluate the market, but we\u2019ve been very happy with our ability to retain customers. And with that 96% retention, including some of the acquisitions that are moving away from us, like Amerigroup. ","Larry Merlo ","We\u2019ll take two more questions please.","Operator","Certainly, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Zach [Sacheck] - Morgan Stanley","Hey, good morning. This is Zach [Sacheck] for Ricky. Just had a question on your Medicare Part D preferred network. We\u2019ve seen a proliferation in the number of Part D networks. I was wondering if you could talk about your offering for 2014 and how it compares to some of your competitors in the preferred network area.","Jonathan Roberts ","We have a preferred network. It\u2019s very similar to what we had this year. It\u2019s about 25,000 pharmacies where they\u2019ll get advantages. The member will have a lower copay if they go to a preferred pharmacy. And then we wrap the balance of the network around that so that we have the full suite of 65,000 pharmacies participating in it. ","But it\u2019s been very successful, and we\u2019ve created enough copay differential to drive pretty good share into those preferred pharmacies, so we\u2019re very happy with the performance of that preferred network. And it\u2019s allowed us to offer a very competitive product in the marketplace that will help us continue to grow as we move forward. ","Larry Merlo ","Also keep in mind, if we use Aetna as the example, that we have an Aetna preferred Med D product out in the marketplace that we\u2019re supporting them on as well.","Zach [Sacheck] - Morgan Stanley","And then just a quick question on Minute Clinic. Of the 18% revenue growth you talked about, I was wondering if you would be willing to break down how much of that was organic versus new store growth? And then if you could talk at all about how the payer mix might have evolved over the course of the year?","David Denton ","I don\u2019t know them off the top of my head, but we\u2019ve been comping, if you look at it from a comp perspective, in the teens to low 20s most recently in MinuteClinic.","Larry Merlo ","And your second question, in terms of payer mix, we have continued to see a high rate of adoption from health plans and even government sponsored programs. And if you look at MinuteClinic visits now that have some type of insurance copay tied to it, if you will, that number is now in the mid-80s.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of David Magee from SunTrust. Please proceed with your question. ","David Magee - SunTrust","First question, just on the specialty pharma, you called out inflation as being a factor, and I was curious if you could quantify that and specify whether that\u2019s sort of in line with the trend or are we seeing sort of a sustainable trend change there.","David Denton ","Especially inflation\u2019s been pretty consistent over the last several years, so it\u2019s generally 8% to 10%. You have to add on top of that mix, though, as new drugs come to the market they\u2019re fairly expensive, and then utilization is the third component. So that translates into trend or cost increases that our clients are seeing that are in the high teens, low 20s, and clearly managing this area has become our clients\u2019 top priority. And we\u2019ll talk more about what we\u2019re doing in this area on analyst day.","David Magee - SunTrust ","Do you have market share numbers on that bus year over year?","David Denton ","I don\u2019t have that with me. We\u2019ll probably touch a little bit on that at analyst day as well.","David Magee - SunTrust ","My last question has to do with the promotional environment that you anticipate on the front end. Have you sort of baked in a significantly more promotional environment this year relative to last year as it relates to the holidays? Or how do you view that at this time?","David Denton ","As Larry indicated before, we have seen the promotional environment increase over the last several months. I would say that while that has occurred in the marketplace, we have been pretty diligent in our approach to this. We have not really changed our promotional posture much. ","I\u2019d say we continue to use our loyalty card program to drive performance for us and to make sure that there\u2019s a good balance between what\u2019s happening from a front store sales perspective, but also quite frankly what\u2019s happening from a margin perspective. And we\u2019ve been consistently kind of growing our front store margin rate. And again, there\u2019s a balance there that we\u2019ll watch closely. ","Larry Merlo ","So let me just thank everybody for joining us this morning, along with your interest in CVS Caremark. And we will look forward to seeing many of you next month at our analyst day in New York.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, May 2, 2012. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Nancy Christal, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Nancy Christal","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. I'm here with Larry Merlo, President and CEO, who will provide a business update; and Dave Denton, Executive Vice President and CFO, who will provide a financial review. Per Lofberg, President of our PBM business; and Mark Cosby, President of CVS\/pharmacy, are also with us today and will participate in the question-and-answer session following our prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions]","During this call, we'll discuss some non-GAAP financial measures in talking about our company's performance, namely free cash flow, EBITDA and adjusted EPS. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find the definitions of the non-GAAP items I mentioned as well as the reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of our website.","And we also encourage you to download the slide presentation we posted on our website this morning. The slides summarize the information on this call as well as key facts and figures around our operating performance and guidance. As always, today's call is being simulcast on our website, and it will be archived there following the call for one year.","Finally, please note that we filed our Form 10-Q this morning and it's available through our website.","Now before we begin, our attorneys have asked me to read the Safe Harbor statement. During this presentation, we'll make certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Accordingly, for these forward-looking statements, we claim the protection of the Safe Harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We strongly recommend that you become familiar with the specific risks and uncertainties that are described in the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and that you review the section entitled Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements in our most recently filed quarterly report on Form 10-Q.","And now, I'll turn this over to Larry Merlo.","Larry J. Merlo","Well, thanks, Nancy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Well, we're certainly very pleased with the results we posted this morning. We reported adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.65 for the first quarter, with both retail and PBM results coming in at the high end of our expectations and EPS exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.02. And while our operating results came in at the high end of our expectations, the EPS beat was driven by financial-related items including the change in inventory accounting methods, interest and lower shares outstanding resulting from our successful capital allocation program, all of which Dave will cover more fully in his update. But overall, this was a terrific quarter with strong results across-the-board including our cash generation.","In the first quarter, we achieved the expected $0.03-per-share benefit from the impasse between Walgreens and Express Scripts. For the second quarter, we are projecting a $0.03 to $0.04 EPS benefit from the impasse, assuming the situation remains unresolved for the duration of the quarter. The benefit is expected to be slightly higher than the first quarter, primarily driven by greater operating efficiency in our pharmacies, and we'll also see a full quarter's run rate of ESI script volumes that transferred throughout the first quarter, as well as a modest ramp in the front store benefit from these new customers.","As a result of our strong first quarter results, as well as the inclusion of the Walgreens-Express benefit in the second quarter, we are raising our guidance for the full year. We now expect to achieve adjusted earnings per share for 2012 in the range of $3.23 to $3.33, with both ends of the range up $0.05 from our February guidance and up $0.08 from our initial guidance, which we provided at our December Analyst Day.","And please remember that we are taking the Walgreens-Express benefit one quarter at a time. We're not projecting benefits to quarters beyond the current one. So we would encourage you to only include the benefit in your models through the second quarter. We will report the estimated impact from this impasse to you, again, on a quarter-by-quarter basis throughout the year if it remains unresolved. And as I said, Dave will provide the details of our results, as well as guidance for the second quarter and full year, during his financial review.","Now let me turn to a brief business update, and I'll begin with our PBM. As you know, we had a terrific 2012 selling season, winning $7.1 billion in net new business on top of another $5.5 billion in incremental revenues from the Universal American contracts we picked up this year. So we expect to add $12.6 billion in net new revenues in 2012 with a 98% retention rate. And while it's still early in the '13 selling season, we're optimistic about the opportunities and continue to feel very good about our unique position in the marketplace. We are bullish about the receptivity to our model, along with our proprietary programs. Now there's obviously a lot of change in the marketplace related to the Walgreens-Express impasse as well as recent significant PBM consolidation activity. But the market continues to be competitive, yet rational, and with our stable business and unmatched breadth of capabilities, we believe we are very well positioned for success now and in the future.","So let me touch on renewals. To date, about 1\/4 of our scheduled renewals have gone through the renewal process, which is pretty typical for this time of year. And while we previously said we had approximately $16 billion up for renewal in '13, the number dropped to about $14.5 billion, largely due to the Health Net Med D PDP acquisition. And since we acquired the business, we're no longer including that contract in our renewal number. So given that it's still early in the season, we have about 3 quarters or $11 billion left to go through the renewal process, and we'll have a lot more to say about renewals as well as new business as we get further along in the selling season.","Now I do want to take a minute to address our recent decision to remove certain drugs from our formulary. And some of you have asked about this and have written about the issue based on market chatter. Let me clarify it. For those who may not be familiar, we made the decision to remove or require prior authorization for 34 drugs from our formulary. And to be clear, this change only applies to customers using our standard or template formulary. It does not apply to any of our customers with a custom formulary, which would include most of the health plans and some of our large employers. The 34 drugs we removed from our template formulary totaled only about 1.5% of the drug spend, and we made this decision in an effort to take unnecessary costs out of the system for our clients.","Now I recently attended our CVS Caremark client forum. We had in excess of 700 participants in attendance, and we had the opportunity to listen to our customers. And we were able to discuss the formulary change. What I heard from our clients was some dissatisfaction around the timing and the method of communicating the change, but not the philosophy of the change itself. Our clients understand the challenges we are dealing with regarding brand inflation, along with the proliferation of manufacturer coupons, which encourage the use of more expensive drug therapies. And they count on us to help them manage the drug spend. So we've certainly listened intently to client feedback. And going forward, we will make sure that any future changes get communicated earlier.","I think it's also important to note that since we implemented the change, there has been limited to no disruption to our members. So I hope that clarifies the formulary change for you. And while this decision has gained some prominence in the marketplace, we are confident that over the long term, this is the right decision, one that will drive savings for our existing clients as well as future clients while in no way compromising the clinical integrity of our offering.","So let me move on and provide an update on the progress we're making on selling our integrated offerings that capitalize on what we've been calling our integration sweet spots. And as you know and as we've mentioned many times, these are the products and services that are extremely difficult for stand-alone PBMs and pharmacy retailers to replicate. We currently have about 10.5 million lives covered under 850 plans that have implemented or committed to implement Maintenance Choice. And we have compelling data to share with clients demonstrating that Maintenance Choice has been successful in broadening access while reducing costs and improving prescription adherence. We're making Maintenance Choice enhancements and we believe they will provide a transformative member experience that will further differentiate CVS Caremark in the marketplace. And we're giving members what they want. They want more control and more flexibility in managing their maintenance medications.","The next generation of Maintenance Choice that we have been referring to is Maintenance Choice 2.0, includes a less restrictive or voluntary plan design option. And with our anticipated launch of 2.0, we expect the number of clients taking advantage of our Maintenance Choice offerings to increase dramatically over the next few years. And we expect many clients who have not yet adopted Maintenance Choice to try this version of the program and to recognize at least some of the savings associated with Maintenance Choice. And this new plan design option, along with the enhancements that we're making for both legacy and new Maintenance Choice clients, will be rolled out on a limited basis this year. And then we expect to make it broadly available beginning in January of '13. And once clients experience the benefits and savings of the program, we expect that some will consider adopting the more restrictive Maintenance Choice plan design option so they can maximize their savings.","As for Pharmacy Advisor, again, we have made very significant progress and our data demonstrates that we are identifying important opportunities for cost savings while improving adherence and closing gaps in care. And as an example, following one year on the program, recent analysis showed that certain members using CVS retail experienced a 17.2% decline in gaps in care, while members using Caremark mail experienced a 12.8% decline. And that compares with a 0.4% increase in gaps in care for a control group of members without Pharmacy Advisor. As for adherence to lipid-lowering medication, Pharmacy Advisor users had 26% lower first fill drop-off rates while mail users had 10.3% lower drop-off rates relative to a control group.","We now have more than 16 million lives covered by almost 900 clients committed to implement Pharmacy Advisor for diabetes, and that's up from 12 million lives at year-end 2011. Pharmacy Advisor is targeted to become available to both Medicare and Medicaid clients in '13. And once that occurs, we estimate that this program could potentially touch about 47 million lives over time.","This past month, we launched Pharmacy Advisor for a suite of cardiovascular conditions. And we plan to go live in January of '13 with 5 additional programs for depression, asthma, COPD, osteoporosis and breast cancer. And I think Pharmacy Advisor is just a great example of how our integrated assets are improving the health of those we serve in a very differentiated way.","Now moving onto some of the highest growth areas for the PBM. Once again, we saw significant increases in our Specialty Pharmacy business with revenues climbing 46.3% for the quarter. Primary drivers of the growth were the new payors such as the Federal Employee Plan, CalPERS, IBM, new product launches primarily in the Hep C and oncology areas, along with inflation. And excluding the addition of the Aetna specialty business, which we began filling in the second quarter of last year, specialty revenues still increased a very strong 34% versus last year's first quarter.","Our Med D business also continues to grow. We recently completed the acquisition of Health Net's PDP, and that shifted about 425,000 lives from our PBM to our PDP, bringing our total PDP lives to approximately 4 million. And we expect the transition to one enrollment system for the 2013 Med D plan year.","Before turning to retail, let me touch briefly on the Aetna contract and the PBM streamlining initiative. With regard to Aetna, we've completed the transition of both specialty fulfillment and mail fulfillment to our facilities, and our focus now is on the migration of Aetna's clients onto our platform. As for the streamlining initiative, it's on track to deliver over $1 billion in cumulative cost savings through 2015. As we've said, through this initiative, we're streamlining operations to improve productivity, rationalizing capacity and consolidating our adjudication platforms to one destination platform with enhanced capabilities. As we've stated, the benefits outweigh the costs this year and we continue to expect to hit the full run rate of annual savings, that being between $225 million and $275 million, beginning in 2014.","So with that, let me turn to the retail business, which is certainly taking advantage of an unprecedented industry-driven opportunity and gaining significant market share as a result. In the first quarter, our same-store sales increased 8.4% above the high end of our guidance range. Pharmacy comps increased 9.8% in the quarter with front store comps increasing 5.3%. Script comps increased 9.2% on a 30-day supply basis and 7.2% if counting 90-day supply as one script. Now this reflects strong underlying performance as well as a significant benefit from the Walgreens-Express impasse. And we estimate that the impasse added 350 to 400 basis points to our pharmacy comps in the quarter, which equates to about 5.7 million to 6.5 million prescriptions. Our script unit comps continue to outpace all of our primary competitors, even more so than in prior quarters. And as a result, we gained significant market share. And IMS data has our retail scripts growing approximately 15 percentage points, more than all other chains.","Now in addition to the benefit of script transfers from the Walgreens-Express dispute, pharmacy comps reflect an approximately 75-basis-point positive impact from the one extra day in the quarter due to leap year and a 50-basis-point positive calendar shift impact from one additional weekday. Conversely, pharmacy comps were negatively impacted by 305 basis points from new generics in the quarter and pharmacy comps were also negatively impacted by a weak flu season, but that was partially offset by the early onset of the allergy season given the unusually mild weather.","In the front store, we were up against an easier comparison due to the severe weather in the first quarter of last year. But having said that, I'm very pleased with our 5.3% front store comp, which was positively impacted by about 120 basis points from the extra day, as well as a successful Valentine's Day with sales up about 9% versus a year ago. And like pharmacy, front store sales were negatively impacted by the weak flu season, which was partially offset by an early allergy season. Front store sales also benefited from our new Express Scripts customers, although this was not material to our first quarter results. And as we've said previously, our initial focus was on making the prescription transfer process as seamless as possible. And we began to shift gears during the quarter to focus on converting these new customers to front store customers.","Now we've gotten a lot of questions on how to model the front store benefit related to these new pharmacy customers, and let me start by saying that while helpful, the front store benefit is not expected to be the major needle mover in the near term. To put it into perspective, assuming the run rate we've achieved in incremental scripts and then further assuming that we achieve a 20% front store conversion rate for those new customers, we would generate less than $0.01 in EPS per quarter. And the real win in the front store is in the opportunity to convert those pharmacy customers to loyal CVS shoppers for all of their front store needs. And of course, we're working to ensure that we get more than our fair share of that business over time.","So overall, I'm very pleased with our front store sales this quarter. We saw increased customer traffic and a slightly higher average ticket. Our ExtraCare loyalty program continues to be a key differentiator for us and we've had the program in place for well over a decade. And now with 69 million active cardholders, we continue to find new ways to enhance the offering. And as an example, our ExtraCare Beauty Club, it already boasts more than 12 million members and is helping to drive sales across the beauty business.","In addition, we're working on several digital initiatives to make things easier for our customers. We relaunched the CVS mobile app with full-blown ExtraCare functionality to enable customers to scan their phone, to manage their ExtraCare account, to view offers and send them to their card. And the customer feedback has been terrific.","During the quarter, we also continued to make progress on our clustering initiatives with plans to add another 50 urban stores this year. And we're also developing and testing additional clustering concepts and plan to have market tests in place later this year. And we believe these efforts around localization are a key component to optimizing the return on capital of our store program.","And as for our real estate program, we opened 72 new or relocated stores. We closed 7, resulting in 25 net new stores in the quarter, and we're right on track to increase our retail square footage growth by approximately 2% to 3% for the year.","Now before turning it over to Dave, let me give you a brief update on MinuteClinic. And despite the very mild flu season that we talked about, MinuteClinic revenues increased nearly 22% in the quarter versus last year, with approximately 86% of visits paid through some type of third-party insurance. Now MinuteClinic continues to enhance its role as a collaborator with integrated health networks, while at the same time adding new services and raising awareness. During the quarter, MinuteClinic and HCA's TriStar Health, which is the largest health system in Middle Tennessee, entered into a clinical affiliation to enhance access to high-quality, affordable healthcare services in the Nashville area.","Also as part of our strategy to maintain break-even status on an all-in basis while growing our clinic base, we closed some of our seasonal clinics during the quarter and we plan to convert others to full-time status. So as of the end of the quarter, we operated 570 clinics, including the opening of 9 new clinics.","And I think it's important to note that while MinuteClinic is a small business relative to the overall enterprise, it does receive a fair amount of airtime with PBM clients. It's an important piece of our integrated strategy and our clients are very interested in how MinuteClinic can help them reduce costs while keeping their members healthy. And we believe our plans to double our clinic count over the next several years should position us well to play an important role in solving the primary care physician shortage, especially with millions of newly insured individuals expected to enter the healthcare marketplace.","So with that, let me turn it over to Dave for the financial review.","David M. Denton","Thank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll provide a detailed review of our first quarter financial results. I'll also provide guidance for the second quarter and update our guidance for the full year of 2012.","But first, let me start with a summary of what we've been doing from a capital allocation standpoint. As you know, we raised our quarterly dividend this year by 30%, our ninth consecutive year with an increase. So in the quarter, we paid approximately $211 million in dividends. And given our earnings expectations for this year, we anticipate a payout ratio of approximately 21%, keeping us comfortably on track to achieve our targeted payout ratio of between 25% and 30% by 2015.","In regard to share repurchase, we had $3 billion left under our current authorization when we entered 2012. During the first quarter, we repurchased a total of 18.1 million shares at an average cost of $44.69 per share. So between dividends and share repurchases, we have returned more than $1 billion to our shareholders just in the first quarter. It is my expectation that, at a minimum, we will complete the remaining $2.2 billion on the current repurchase authorization this year. And between dividends and share purchase, we'll allocate roughly $3.8 billion to enhancing shareholder value.","And additionally, we continue to be focused on maintaining our credit ratings and have set an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA target of 2.7x.","And as I said before, we are committed to our capital allocation program remaining a vital component to driving shareholder value. Through it, we'll take advantage of the powerful cash flow generation capabilities of CVS Caremark, both in the near term as well as the longer term.","We generated more than $2.4 billion of free cash in the quarter, an increase of more than $840 million from the prior year, due mainly to an increase in our accrued expenses. We received advance payments from CMS for the April time period, which drove the increase in accrued expenses. With April 1 falling on the weekend, CMS sent the payments to us before the first quarter ended. And the same thing will happen in the second quarter and then it will reverse in the third. Without the advance payments, free cash flow was in line with the prior year period.","During the quarter, our underlying free cash flow was driven by strong earnings, as well as solid year-over-year improvements in accounts receivables and accounts payable. Partially offsetting these positive drivers was inventory, which increased on the retail side from year end as we stocked up to handle the influx of new customers. Of course, it was important to remain in stock during the time that customers were switching pharmacy homes, and we'll continue to monitor inventory levels going forward. And despite the quarterly dollar increase in inventory, inventory days within the retail segment improved by more than one day from the end of last year. And combined with gains in DPO and DSO, we reduced our retail cash cycle by more than 2 days so far this year.","As we continue to make process improvements, the retail team remains committed to its inventory reduction target of $500 million for the full year, and working capital improvements such as these are expected to continue to enhance our cash generation capabilities.","Given the lack of any sale leaseback activities, net and gross capital spending for the first quarter was $376 million, an increase of nearly $80 million from the prior year period.","Turning to the income statement. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.65 for the quarter with GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations and at $0.59 per share, both $0.02 above the high end of our guidance. As Larry said, while our operating results came in at the high end of our expectations, the EPS beat was driven by financial-related items including the change in inventory accounting methods, interest and lower shares outstanding.","I'll address all of these in a moment, but first, let me walk down the P&L. On a consolidated basis, revenues in the first quarter increased by nearly 20% to $30.8 billion.","Drilling down by segment. Net revenues increased by 32% in the PBM to $18.3 billion. The majority of the growth from last year was driven by the addition of the Universal American business to our book, as well as new client starts. However, we did see higher revenues than expected due to higher drug cost inflation, which was partially offset by increases in the generic dispensing rate.","PBM pharmacy network revenues in the quarter increased 34% from 2011 levels to $12.6 billion, while pharmacy network claims grew by 26%. Total mail choice revenues increased by 29% to $5.7 billion, while mail choice claims expanded by 17%. Our overall mail choice penetration rate was 22.8%, down approximately 120 basis points versus LY. This decrease was driven by the addition of the Universal American Med D business, which has a lower mail penetration rate than our average book of business.","In our retail business, we saw revenues increase 10% in the quarter to $16 billion. This increase was primarily driven by our same-store sales increase of 8.4% as well as net revenues from new stores, relocations and MinuteClinic, which accounted for approximately 150 basis points of the increase. And Larry talked about our pharmacy and front store comps in some detail, so I won't go into those here.","Turning to gross margin. The consolidated company reported 16.6% in the quarter, a contraction of approximately 185 basis points compared to Q1 of '11.","Within the PBM segment, gross margin was down approximately 120 basis points versus last year's first quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by price compression, increased expenses associated with a significant number of new client starts on 1\/1 and our expanding Medicare Part D operations. As you know, profitability in the Med D business is back-half weighted, with the Med D business experiencing losses in the first part of every year. So as our Med D business grows, this trend will become more pronounced.","Partially offsetting these was the positive margin impact from the approximately 275-basis-point increase and the PBM generic dispensing rate, which grew from 73.8% to 76.5%. This was due, in large part, to a 520-basis-point increase in mail choice GDR. New generic drug introductions had a positive impact, as did our continuous effort to encourage plan members to use generics whenever available and appropriate.","Gross margin in the retail segment was 28.5%, up approximately 10 basis points year-over-year, mainly due to the change in inventory accounting I mentioned a few moments ago. Excluding this change, gross margin at retail was down approximately 5 basis points.","In regards to the accounting change, the details are provided in the 10-Q we filed this morning, but let me summarize it for you now. Prior to this year, we valued pharmacy inventory in our stores using the retail inventory method. Beginning in January, all pharmacy inventory in the retail segment is now valued using the weighted average cost method, consistent with how the PBM values it. This only affects the pharmacy portion of our retail inventory. Front store inventory will continue to be valued using the retail method of accounting. In the pharmacy, we believe that the weighted average cost method provides a better matching of cost of goods sold with revenue. It also allows us to have a consistent inventory valuation method for all our pharmacy inventory across the enterprise.","So what's the overall impact from this change? Over an extended period of time, both methods produce similar results. However, because both methods use averaging, certain timing differences between the 2 can occur periodically. But due to how it addresses actual quantities on hand, the weighted average cost method results in a greater level of precision, leading to a better matching of cost of goods sold with revenue. Had we had not made this accounting change, we estimate our gross profit for the first quarter would have been approximately $30 million lower and our EPS would have been approximately $0.01 lower. The impact from this change was not considered in our prior guidance because the accounting change was not finalized at the time of our fourth quarter call. Going forward, the impact from this chain will be -- change will be included in our guidance.","Additionally, we plan to disclose the difference, if any, between each method in our 10-Q filings throughout 2012. And we don't expect the change to have a material impact on EPS for this year, but there are expected to be some quarters with a positive impact and others with a negative impact. And as I've mentioned, additional details of this accounting change are included in Note 2 to our financial statements, which are included in our 10-Q filings that we filed this morning.","Now putting this change aside, as we expected, we saw margin pressure from pharmacy reimbursement rates and the growth of Maintenance Choice. These unfavorable factors were partially offset by an increased generic dispensing rate, with retail GDR increasing by 290 basis points to 78.1%.","Total operating expenses as a percent of revenues improved by approximately 135 basis points versus the first quarter of '11.","The PBM segment's SG&A rate improved by approximately 25 basis points to 1.5%. This was primarily due to expense leverage gained by the strong revenue growth, which was partially offset by the addition of the operations associated with our acquisition the Universal American Medicare Part D business.","In the retail segment, SG&A as a percent of sales improved by approximately 45 basis points to 20.4%. This improvement in expense leverage was again driven by solid sales growth and continued discipline around expense controls.","Within the Corporate segment, expenses were up approximately $21 million to $168 million, or less than 1% of consolidated revenues, improving by approximately 5 basis points versus the same period in 2011.","And with the change in gross margin more than offsetting the improvements in SG&A as a percent of sales, operating margin for the total enterprise declined by approximately 50 basis points to 4.6%, in line with our expectations. Operating margin in the PBM was 1.9%, down about 90 basis points, while operating margin at retail was 8.1%, up about 60 basis points.","Retail operating profit increased a very healthy 18%, at the high end of our guidance range, and PBM operating profit declined 11%, also near the top of our guidance range.","And going below the line on the consolidated income statement. We saw net interest expense in the quarter decline by approximately $2 million to $132 million versus last year. Interest was favorable to our expectations due in large part to our strong cash flow position. Additionally, our expected income tax rate was 39%, as expected, and our weighted average share count was 1.31 billion shares, approximately 5 million shares lower than anticipated.","Now let me update you on our guidance for the full year '12 and provide guidance for the second quarter. Please note that this guidance reflects the potential estimated benefit that the Walgreens-Express Scripts impasse continues only through the end of the second quarter. It does not include any potential benefit beyond the second quarter. I'll review the highlights of our guidance, but you can find all the details in the slide presentation we posted on our website.","We currently expect to deliver adjusted EPS in 2012 of between $3.23 and $3.33 per share, reflecting very healthy year-over-year growth of 15.5% to 19%. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be between $3.01 and $3.11. This guidance includes the $0.03 to $0.04 benefit expect to see during the second quarter from the Walgreens-Express Scripts impasse and does not include any benefit for the third or fourth quarters. Taking into account the expected impact from the new ESI-Walgreens scripts in the first half, we currently anticipate a consolidated net revenue growth of between 13.5% and 15%.","Both segments of our business should see strong revenue growth, especially the PBM, which is benefiting from the addition of new clients following a great 2012 selling season. Also recall that our estimates include one extra day in '12 versus '11 for leap year.","Within the retail segment, we now expect revenues to increase year-over-year by 5% to 6%, an increase of 200 basis points over our prior guidance. Obviously, this increase is being primarily driven by the Walgreens-Express Scripts impasse that continued into the second quarter. We expect same-store sales for the year to be in the range of 3.5% to 4.5% and same-store scripts to be in the range of 5% to 6%. We continue to expect gross margin in this segment to be moderately up over 2011, while operating expenses as a percent of revenues are expected to be modest -- to modestly increase. As a result, operating profit margin in the retail segment now is expected to grow between 10.5% and 12.5%, another increase of 200 basis points from our prior guidance. Retail operating profit margin is expected to increase by 40 to 50 basis points.","Within the PBM segment, we are increasing our revenue growth expectations by 100 basis points to between 23.5% and 25.5%. Given the amount of drug price inflation we've experienced in the first quarter, we expect inflation to exceed our initial expectations throughout the year, although not at the levels we've seen to date. Gross margin in the PBM are still expected to be down notably, while we anticipate moderate improvement in operating expense as a percent of revenue. We expect a decline in the PBM's operating margin of between 30 and 40 basis points and an increase in PBM operating profit of between 11% and 15% for the full year.","The only other items of note at the consolidated level are interest and amortization. We are reducing our interest expense guidance by $10 million and now expect between $550 million and $560 million of net interest for the full year. At the same time, we have increased our amortization outlook by approximately $15 million to $475 million reflecting, the Health Net PDP acquisition in the PBM segment.","Our free cash flow guidance remains unchanged for the year at a range of $4.6 billion to $4.9 billion.","And for the second quarter, we expect adjusted EPS of between $0.78 and $0.80 per share, reflecting growth of 20% to 24% over the same period of last year. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operation is expected to be in the range of $0.72 to $0.74 in the second quarter. As I mentioned earlier, this includes a $0.03 to $0.04 benefit from the Walgreens-Express Scripts impasse. Consolidated revenues are expected to increase 16% to 17.5%.","In the retail segment, revenues are expected to increase 6.5% to 7.5% versus the second quarter of '11. While the majority of our top line increase reflects the continued share gains in retail, it also reflects an increase in drug inflation, which is helping to offset some of the deflation from new generic introductions. As with the PBM, we've assumed that we'll see more inflation going forward, but not at the first quarter levels. Same-store sales growth is expected to be in the range of 5% to 6%.","And as you model second quarter comps versus what we've achieved in the first quarter, you should keep a few things in mind with respect to the front store. We will have a slight negative Easter shift, given the holiday season is 14 days shorter in the second quarter this year versus last year. We also expect to see a tougher allergy comparison in the second quarter given the early onset of the season and the shift of sales into the first quarter. And of course, the benefit of leap day will not repeat itself. That said, we still expect front store comps to be healthy in the second quarter, just not at the level of the first quarter.","Same-store script growth is expected to be in the range of 6.5% to 7.5%. Operating profit in the retail segment is expected to grow between 16.5% and 18.5% during the second quarter.","Revenues at the PBM are expected to grow by 27% to 29%, largely reflecting the new client additions and the ramp-up in the UAM business. PBM operating profit is expected to be up 7% to 11% in the quarter.","So in conclusion, we've turned in another solid quarter, and our outlook for the year remains very good. We've also continued to generate very significant free cash flow, and that will play an important role in driving shareholder value now as well as in the future.","And with that, I'll turn it back to Larry.","Larry J. Merlo","Okay. Thanks, Dave. And as you've heard already, we had a terrific start to the year and I'm very pleased with our results across the enterprise. And I want to thank our 200,000 colleagues who are working very hard every day to help people on their path to better health. And on behalf of our senior leadership team, I can tell you that we feel very good about our position in the marketplace. And with our stable business and unique suite of assets, we're very well positioned in the industry for continued success.","So with that, let's open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig, Citigroup.","Unknown Analyst","This is Tiffany Konegen [ph] filling in for Deb Weinswig. Can you please provide some detail around the breakdown of the $7 billion of new wins this season?","Per G. H. Lofberg","Well, the biggest single one is the FEP contract, which was the mail order and the specialty business that we didn't have. We also renewed the retail part of that. So the incremental revenue that we got from the FEP contract was roughly $2.5 billion out of the $7 billion, and then the rest of it is made up by a number of other prominent employer and other types of customers.","Unknown Analyst","And also one additional question. Can you provide some more color around your decision to close the 25 Beauty 360 locations? And what is your strategy for beauty and cosmetics going forward?","Larry J. Merlo","Yes, let me take the first part of that and then I'll ask Mark to jump in. But as you know, we began this concept about 4 years ago. It was disruptive in the marketplace in terms of offering what had been only distributed through department stores and specialty beauty stores, certainly products not available in the drug channel. And we got tremendous learnings over that 3-, 4-year period. We found that we did not or were not able to secure all of the, call it, Tier 1 brands that would create a holistic offering for that prestige beauty customer. But again, it was a very successful innovative test where we got learnings that we can apply to our beauty business going forward.","Mark S. Cosby","So just a little color on top of what Larry said. We clearly believe in the beauty business. It's a huge priority for us as we go forward. It was a 25-store test where we learned a ton. We are in the process right now of a whole beauty reinvention and much of the learning that we took from those tests will be integrated into that beauty reinvention. Other things that we have in the works, I think, that have been effective on the beauty front have been this Beauty Club that we launched this past year, which now has 12 million members, and we continue to look for ways to take that to the next level; and then the successful launch that we had this past year of the Salma Hayek Nuance product exclusive to us. It came with industry accolades and customer accolades, and it is also meeting our sales expectations. So we have a lot happening in the beauty world these days. We are committed to it, and stay tuned for more on that front.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill of JP Morgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I have a couple of questions on the PBM side. First off, when you talk about the one quarter that's already been renewed, can you talk, either Per or Larry, about what your retention rate has been so far? And then secondly, can you also talk about what customers are looking for this year in the selling season? Are you hearing more around narrow networks? And obviously, you're well positioned to provide a narrow network. And what are you seeing competitively with all the disruption, and most notably recently SXC and Catalyst coming together, as well?","Larry J. Merlo","Yes, Lisa, let me take the first part, and then I'll ask Per to talk more about what he's seeing in the selling season. As we said in our prepared remarks, it's very early in the selling season. We're not going to provide any numbers around retention rates, and we just think it's way too early to talk about that with where we're at. And we'll certainly talk about that in a more holistic fashion as we approach the fall time frame.","Per G. H. Lofberg","And, Lisa, I think the network question is clearly on the table and I think that it's, I think, in part put on the table by the Express-Walgreens situation. And I think what many customers have realized is that you can actually serve the market very successfully with less than all of the stores around the country. And quite candidly, Express has done a nice job really managing transitions of their retail customers over to other participants in the network. So it is a viable option for customers where they, I think, will be looking at, due to the benefits, the savings that they can get from narrowing down the network somewhat. And they will kind of look at those benefits compared to other types of savings opportunities that are available to them through plan designs and that sort of thing. So I truly expect there to be a healthy discussion around network options as we get into this year's selling season.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can you help us, Per, to understand what level of savings a customer is looking for? I think that Walgreens has probably said that customers won't move for less than 5%. Our experience has been that, that's not the case, but perhaps you can give us some insights into the level of savings people are looking for, for a more narrow network.","Per G. H. Lofberg","Well, I mean, I think to get to 5% savings, you have to make very drastic cuts in the network. But this business is very price-sensitive, as you know, and customers will value a lot top line reductions of 1%, 2%, 3%. If you're a $1-billion health -- if you're a health plan that spends $1 billion on prescription drugs, 1% saving is $10 million and 2% savings is twice that. So it is very meaningful and I think it's clearly sort of worth consideration by customers.","Larry J. Merlo","And, Lisa, I think the wisdom that has been out there was a 2% to 3% number. And I think, to Per's point, that the paradigm that existed in terms of customer disruption, we're kind of living a learning laboratory, and Express has done a very effective job in terms of managing client and member disruption, that I think it's possible as a result of that, that you could see clients evaluate what would it mean for a 1% savings because the disruption is just not what people thought it might be.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple of things. So first on the PBM, when you think about all of the noise in the marketplace today, do you guys think the benefit in this selling season is more net new wins, the potential for that, or strong -- stronger margins on renewals of contracts that are up for renewal this year? Do you think -- does one, in your mind, weigh more heavily than the other as an opportunity this year?","Per G. H. Lofberg","Well, I mean, I do think that the opportunity to capture new business is probably the more important factor there. What is sort of interesting, I think, in this year's selling season is that in addition to looking at customers that are contemplating a change for January 2013, we actually have quite a substantial number of customers that are looking at 2014 change. And it's unusual, at least in my experience, to have that many customers kind of go out to market almost like a year ahead of plan, if you will. So that is a new phenomenon, I think, this particular season. With respect to the pricing, I really don't see any significant change compared to the past. I mean this is a very competitive business. It will continue to be very competitive business. And when plans go out to bid, they look very much at how to improve the economics of their drug benefits. So I kind of fully expect that the economics will be in the forefront of all of these opportunities.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","But is it wrong to think that with all of the -- again, all of the noise, all of the change that's out there that people might be a little more risk-averse right now? And if they're generally happy with your offering, a, there's a greater likelihood they stay with you, and b, it's going to take a lot more to -- price discount to bid them away. Or is that not right?","Per G. H. Lofberg","Well, I mean, I think if you have a successful service relationship with the customer, which is very much the case for us, I mean, typically as the incumbent, you have sort of the upper hand, if you will. And that sort of is what you see reflected in the high retention rates. But that doesn't really translate into a significant sort of margin opportunity. It tends to be very, very competitive and clients are really focused on trying to improve the economics of their drug programs.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right. And then just finally, Larry, 2 quick things on Retail. When you think about this whole Walgreen-Express ending at some point, how do you think that all plays out in terms of them trying to get business back? They'll probably do transfer coupons, maybe bigger than $25. How does that play out? How do you respond to that? And there should be an annuity benefit that you'll keep some percentage of these customers into '13, correct?","Larry J. Merlo","Yes, John, I mean, as we've discussed many times, we know that, that pharmacy customer is the hardest person to lose and the hardest person to get back once you've lost them. The longer this impasse goes on, the stickier that customer is going to be. And they're going to have multiple opportunities to visit a CVS\/pharmacy and establish a relationship with their CVS pharmacist. So yes, there will be a retention impact of this if and when the situation gets resolved.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dane Leone, Macquarie.","Dane Leone - Macquarie Research","Maybe starting with retail. Can you just kind of go into the plan, as we head into the back half of the year, to convert some of those new pharmacy customers into loyalty program customers or -- yes, I mean, front store shoppers.","Mark S. Cosby","Well, it's a big part of our game plan obviously. When we started this past year back in January, we had an aggressive plan, both in terms of marketing and in in-store initiatives, for attracting the ESI customers and then converting them into really whole store shoppers. The plan included marketing, both on the broadcast front as well as on the promotional front, and then we had a significant amount of activity around ExtraCare. We also did a tremendous number of things on the in-store front, including staffing. We added inventory where it was appropriate and then we had a major campaign, which we had -- saw some success that we think we will continue in the second half of the year around ambassadors, which we put in place in our top stores to really teach these new customers the services that we have available in our store, from e-mail capability to texting to ExtraCare and the power of ExtraCare, signing them up to ExtraCare, and of course our ReadyFill initiative. The big focus now is on service because we believe if we provide the best possible service experience, that will then lead to the more likelihood that the folks will retain, but then also use the full store. So we have a number of initiatives in place to convert the customer not only to a loyal pharmacy user, but also to a loyal front store user.","Dane Leone - Macquarie Research","Great. And 2 questions on the PBM side. Just following up on a previous question, I'm just curious about why customers would be sending out RFPs for the 2014 selling season this early, given all the disruption going on. And then another question. There's been some talk with consultants percolating over the last month or so just regarding potential IT issues on the Caremark destination platform. I was just hoping maybe you could just give some color on why we might be hearing about that. And is it just a normal noise? Or is there something more to focus on there?","Per G. H. Lofberg","Yes, I think, let me start with the last one. I mean there are really no IT issues associated with the destination platform. It's a very, very strong platform that will basically be able to handle a tremendous range of plan design requirements, capturing all the segments of our book of business. And we just -- earlier this year, we migrated all of our Med D business over to that platform, which is arguably the most complicated part of our business. So it's a very, very sophisticated state-of-the-art platform that will be able to robustly handle all of our requirements for many years to come. So that's not at all sort of an issue. With respect to the 2014 thing, I don't have any really definitive insight there other than what I've just said. I do think when you have this kind of market disruption that's going on right now and the M&A activities that you're familiar with, those types of changes can be kind of an impetus for many plans simply to just sort of ask themselves, maybe this is a good time for us to look at what's out in the marketplace and figure out what the options -- what options are available for them to provide this cost-effective drug benefit going forward. So I don't have anything other -- any other insights than that to offer.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler, Barclays Capital.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Larry, you were talking about the likelihood of retaining customers. I was just -- because of the former Walgreen customers. I was just wondering why you're being so conservative about not assuming any of it in the second half. Is that just because you don't know what Walgreens is going to do to try to win those customers back if this dispute is resolved?","Larry J. Merlo","Yes, Meredith, we have been -- I think going back to December, we had said that this was a very fluid situation and we certainly can't predict the outcome or let alone the timing of that, and that we would take this one quarter at a time, recognizing, as Mark just pointed out, there's an awful lot of things that we're doing to ensure that those new customers have an outstanding experience and that we convert them to not just a pharmacy customer but a front store customer. So we certainly expect that we'll talk about that at the appropriate time, and we'll provide another update on the next quarterly call in terms of where we're at should the situation be unresolved or resolved, for that matter.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So for CVS enthusiasts, then we should assume that you'd keep some of it?","Larry J. Merlo","Yes, Meredith, as we -- someone asked the question earlier, that this has gone on long enough that we would certainly expect some retention to take place, because these customers have had an opportunity to date to visit a CVS pharmacy perhaps 3, 4 times now and to begin to establish a relationship with their pharmacist.","David M. Denton","And I think, Meredith -- this is Dave. I think a couple of things, is that one, we want to put in our guidance things that we can control, and obviously, this situation is somewhat outside of our control, number one. But number two, while we've talked about it a lot, we're still pretty early in the process. We've kind of got 1.5 quarters under our belt here. And as time goes on, we'll know much more and we'll have a lot more clarity at that point.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. And then I have a question about your Medicare, your PDP business. This is the first quarter -- or first quarter that you've had the Universal American business. And obviously, that's always the weakest quarter for the PDP business. I was just wondering if there have been any surprises in terms of what customers are -- how many prescriptions they're filling and whether you feel comfortable with the premiums that you're getting paid in that business this year?","Per G. H. Lofberg","Yes, no surprises. It's very much on track with our expectations.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallucci of Lazard Asset Management.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Just a follow-up question or 2. In terms of the RFPs that you're getting on the PBM side going into the heart of the selling season here, can you talk about anything that you're seeing that's new or different in terms of what customers are asking for in those RFPs? I mean, you touched a little bit on maybe there's going to be more talk around narrow networks. Something else that we've heard is maybe customers looking to be -- to gain a little more control over the specific retailers that are in their networks as opposed to just sort of relative access points. Can you talk about that and anything other that you're seeing that's new or different?","Per G. H. Lofberg","Yes, I don't see anything to the kind of controlled aspect of your question. I mean, I think, typically, when they specify the parameters around networks, it has to do with access, geographic access, in relation to where their people are. And that's been a fairly broad-based sort of definition of what the network requirements should be based on. And so that's probably -- I mean I don't see any real change there. With respect to other things that people are looking for, one of the things that's sort of on the table right now for many employers is what their plans are with respect to retiree coverage and whether they're going to exit the Retiree Drug Subsidy Program into either a defined contribution or EGWP-type plans. So there's a fair amount of interest in those types of options, especially from large employer customers.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Great. Could you remind us if an employer does make a change there, let's say, toward an EGWP, what's the net effect for you all?","Per G. H. Lofberg","Pretty much -- I mean, it's not a major shift. We obviously -- there's a slight deterioration typically in the mail order aspect of it because in the EGWP plans, you can't have as aggressive mail order incentives as many employers have for their retirees today.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Right, okay. And then what about managed Medicaid? I know you guys are pretty big players there through some of your customers. Do you view that as a longer-term opportunity? Or what's the relative quality of that business and how you look at it?","Per G. H. Lofberg","Well, we certainly see that being a big growth area for us, and many states that have major fiscal problems are clearly kind of looking at switching out of fee-for-service Medicaid programs into managed Medicaid programs to improve the generic dispensing rates, to reduce the dispensing fees and so on, so that seems to be a pretty robust trend right now that certainly had a significant impact this year. But other states will continue to kind of look for those types of savings going forward and that's a very interesting market opportunity for us.","Larry J. Merlo","And, Tom, it's also an opportunity on the retail side because it gives us an opportunity -- it's going to vary by state and by PBM, but it gives us an opportunity to work with the PBMs around incentive programs rather than just being focused on just share reimbursement formulas.","Per G. H. Lofberg","And even going back to the network issue, many of these managed Medicaid programs are being set up around retail networks that have less stand-alone pharmacies in it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ed Kelly of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Larry, you've said previously that you did not expect to see a large -- that there'd be a large opportunity out there for new business wins because of the Express-Walgreens dispute. And I guess I don't want to put words in your mouth, but I guess it's because you didn't expect that Express would have that much difficulty in retaining business without Walgreens. Do you still feel that way now that we're sort of in the heat of the selling season and you're getting some feedback from clients?","Larry J. Merlo","Yes, Ed, I think we still feel that way. I think as you've heard us comment on several times, Express has done a very effective job in terms of managing the client member disruption so that it's not an issue. And I think, to Per's earlier point, that clients are always looking for ways in which they can capture savings. And I think that we don't know how it'll play out, but I think that there will be and is going to be more chatter around, what does a more restricted network mean in terms of potential cost savings for a respective client?","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","As we think about more restrictive networks and if we were to take a 5-plus-year view on sort of where the marketplace going, it seems like there's going be more prevalence of restricted networks, which I guess means that the decision to fill a script starts to move from the employee, which it's been historically, to maybe a bit more to the employer. So my question for you is, does that have any impact on the way you think about real estate opportunities, right? For instance, is it as critical going forward to have the high-cost main-on-main location as it's been in the past?","Larry J. Merlo","Well, Ed, I think as we look to the future, I think there's a lot of variables that continue to come in play. Keep in mind that part of that real estate strategy is the convenience of the front store offerings and the hours of operation that, that affords, which quite frankly, those elements are very important to clients and their members and I think will be part of the considerations that go into a decision to potentially restrict the networks. So I don't see, as we sit here today, any changes in how we think about our real estate strategy with that in mind.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And just real quick, last question for you. You brought in a lot of new business this year as well as last year. Can you just comment on how the execution of the new business has been? And does that create any limitation for you on how much business you'd be looking to try to pick up in the upcoming year?","Per G. H. Lofberg","Well, I mean, we did take on a huge amount of business, as you know, in January. And at this point, we're very sort of satisfied with the service levels and the operations around all of these new customers. To be quite candid, there were some moments in very early January when I think our systems were pretty much stressed and we had some spikes in the customer call centers that were -- caused a little bit of consternation. We pretty quickly got behind that, so it's not an issue any longer. But it was quite an effort in early January to manage all this inflow of business. And going forward, I think we obviously take all of these experiences and try to learn from them, try to find areas where we need to strengthen our processes and strengthen our systems, so we can continue to grow this business very successfully. And I don't really see any limitations there whatsoever.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Larry Marsh, Barclays Capital.","Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And for what it's worth, Per, to your earlier point, we participated in an industry call last week where several consultants said they are specifically recommending more of their customers go out to bid this year to see if they can capture more savings in their drug spending, because of the change in the industry, as you said. But my question is really I wanted to get you to discuss a little bit, briefly, your success in winning and retaining health plans through your PBM. You've lost what I thought were several visible health plans for '13, but also recently won Blue Cross Blue Shield of Hawaii from Medco. So I guess my question is, do you feel like you can continue to gain share in this segment, specifically addressing the concerns some might have that you're competing with them for Part D lives?","Per G. H. Lofberg","I mean, I do, Larry. We will never doubt that 100%, and the accounts that we lost early this year were -- they were hotly contested and we put in a huge effort on those and, I thought, gave proposals that were very aggressive and what we felt we could justify. So having said that, we're not going to win all the time. I do think that our model, especially with the integration with CVS retail and the MinuteClinic, is of increasing significance to the health plan segment. And that, I think, has become really a focal point for many of the health plan discussions right now, and in particular, health plans that have a significant Medicare population. As you probably know, Larry, the government has basically created the Star rating program as a way to measure health plan performance and also to pay health plans for their performance, and a significant portion of those Star ratings today are dependent on being able to improve adherence and close gaps in care for chronic medication users. And we have a particularly strong suite of capabilities to help health plans in that area. So I'm very, very optimistic about the growth opportunities in the health plan segment going forward.","Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right, thanks. And I guess, given that it's public, to the extent Cigna does decide to move forward with its outsourcing of its combined pharmacy benefit assets, why might they consider you given you already service their large competitor, Aetna?","Larry J. Merlo","Well, I think, Larry, that obviously, the point that Per just made about our integrated model, I think, creates an awful lot of interest among clients of all types, especially health plans, as you think about more and more of this business becoming B2C and the opportunities that we have to serve varying needs.","Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right, okay, great. And a quick -- real quick follow-up. To the extent Express does choose to move forward to terminate Medco's retail network agreement with Walgreens for 2013, are there any notable incremental costs you need to incur to help drive that seamless transition like you did with Express? Or do you feel like you've already learned and you've expensed most of that already with the Express Scripts switch?","Larry J. Merlo","Yes, it would be very minimal, Larry. I mean it would be investing in some of the store labor, okay, as Mark talked about, to ensure that, that transition experience becomes a seamless one, because there is some administrative duties that have to be performed as part of that transfer process.","David M. Denton","But again, we could easily handle that from a capacity perspective with no issue whatsoever.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin of Jefferies.","Scott Andrew Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","A couple of housekeeping items, Dave. The inventory change, you said it added $30 million to gross profit. I didn't hear a breakdown on segments. Do you have one?","David M. Denton","Yes. It's all Retail Pharmacy because the change only affects our Retail Pharmacy inventory accounting method.","Scott Andrew Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So then I also noticed in the guidance, it seemed you beat by $0.02, you raised by $0.05, if I'm missing something, and you said it was mostly below the line. So it seems like we got an extra $0.02 or...","David M. Denton","Well, I think if you look at it, we beat by $0.02 for the quarter and then we raised essentially by $0.03 due to the Walgreens-Express impasse, $0.03 to $0.04.","Larry J. Merlo","For the second quarter.","David M. Denton","For the second quarter.","Scott Andrew Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","For the second quarter, okay. That's great. And then ExtraCare. I didn't hear -- maybe again it's been long, maybe I missed it. ExtraCare cardholder numbers during the quarter, how much was that up?","Larry J. Merlo","We didn't provide, Scott, the quarter number, but we currently have 69 million active cardholders. So it's up a couple of million from our last update.","Scott Andrew Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Up a couple of million. And then one final one as I just kind of run through these checks. Is the number of pharmacy shoppers that also use the front end, say, over a 6-month period high? Or is it low?","Larry J. Merlo","Well, Scott, the number that we've talked about in the past is when you look at that pharmacy customer and ask, what percent are purchasing something in the front at the time they're picking up their prescription, that number is right around 30%.","Scott Andrew Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","But over a 6-month period, I would assume it must be much, much higher, right, because sometimes you're just running in there to pick up your scripts, you're going through the drive-through or whatever. But I guess that's what I'm trying to understand and how -- I think you threw out a 20% conversion on some of these Express people, and I would think over time it could be a lot higher unless I'm missing something.","Larry J. Merlo","Yes, Scott, that's true, although we have not quantified that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Willoughby, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Larry, given your competitors' continuing commitment to your retail excess, are there more aggressive strategic moves you could make to enhance the opportunity? You mentioned the store clustering opportunity. Is that an acceleration of store openings? Or is that more or less in line, just a bit more focused? And can you give us kind of a target market maybe where something like that would happen?","Larry J. Merlo","Yes, Bob, I mean, we are following through on our plans. I would say the one thing that we're doing in response to your question is that we have entered new markets over the last couple of years and we have a rich and robust pipeline of stores. So I'll take a market like St. Louis where we have probably 10 or 11 stores today and another 15 or 18 in the pipeline. And we're looking at those new markets to see if we can accelerate what has already been approved as real estate.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, but the overall number of stores more or less in line with what you've guided to over the past.","Larry J. Merlo","Absolutely.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And maybe more bluntly, Larry, what's the economic reason not to ultimately exclude Walgreens from your pharmacy networks -- from your PBM pharmacy networks? Why go restrictive when you can knock them out completely?","Per G. H. Lofberg","Bob, I mean first off, I mean, we have a long-term contract with Walgreens, so that's sort of the basis from which we operate. And as we do with all of our network partners, we will continue to look for sort of the best mix of participating chains and independents and the economics that, that will lead to. So I'm not going to make any predictions one way or another, but certainly having Walgreens in the network on competitive terms is a good thing for our customers.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Would you foresee excluding them? Any meaningful damage to your PBM profitability or growth opportunity?","Per G. H. Lofberg","We have no plans in that regard.","Larry J. Merlo","And we wouldn't speculate on that, Bob, as well.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser, Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Question on the inventory change. I just wanted to clarify, is this only an accounting change? Or is this also a signal that you're just kind of like looking potentially at a more structural change to how you think about managing inventory across the organization? And really, what I'm getting at is, are you also looking at potentially consolidating the purchasing for the PBM and retail segment as part of managing the inventory?","David M. Denton","Ricky, this is Dave. This is purely an accounting change, although we think it will be helpful to us from an operational perspective over time. Keep in mind that today, the purchasing across our enterprise, both from a PBM perspective and a retail perspective, is already consolidated. So we leverage the purchasing power of our organization across both of our segments.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just by the fact that you're using 2 different wholesalers?","David M. Denton","Correct. But we -- that is correct, but we still purchase them centrally through our operations.","Larry J. Merlo","And, Ricky, we use the wholesalers geographic to a large degree actually across our retail enterprise.","Okay, everyone. So thanks for your interest and your time today. And if there's any follow-up questions, I know you know how to get ahold of Nancy. So thanks, again.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation, and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Have a great day, everyone."],"6455":["CVS Caremark Corporation (NYSE:CVS) Q2 2012 Earnings Call August  7, 2012  8:30 AM ET","Executives","","Nancy Christal \u2013 SVP, IR","Larry Merlo \u2013 President and CEO","Dave Denton \u2013 EVP and CFO","Per Lofberg \u2013 President, PBM Business","Mark Cosby \u2013 President, CVS Pharmacy","Analysts","","John Heinbockel \u2013 Guggenheim securities","Dane Leone \u2013 Macquarie","Deborah Weinswig \u2013 Citi","Robert Willoughby \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Scott Mushkin \u2013 Jefferies","Steven Valiquette \u2013 UBS","Matthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Frank Morgan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Ross Muken \u2013 ISI group","Lisa Gill \u2013 JPMorgan","Ricky Goldwasser \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Operator","Welcome to the CVS Caremark Second Quarter Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions)","I would now like to turn the conference over to Nancy Christal. Please go ahead.","Nancy Christal","Thank you, Tara. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. I\u2019m here with Larry Merlo, President and CEO, who will provide a business update; and Dave Denton, Executive Vice President and CFO, who will provide a financial review. Per Lofberg, President of our PBM business; and Mark Cosby, President of CVS\/pharmacy, are also with us today and will participate in the Q&A session following our prepared remarks.","During the question-and-answer session, please limit yourself to one or two questions so we can provide more analysts and investors the chance to ask the questions.","During this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures in talking about our company\u2019s performance, namely free cash flow, EBITDA, and adjusted EPS. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find the definitions of the non-GAAP items I mentioned, as well as the reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, on the Investor Relations portion of our website.","I also recommend that you download the slide presentation we posted on our website this morning. The slides summarize the information on this call, as well as key facts and figures around our operating performance and guidance. In addition, note that we plan to file our Form 10-Q today before the close of business and it will be available through our website at that time. As always, today\u2019s call is being simulcast on our website and it will be archived there following the call for one year.","Now before we continue, our attorneys have asked me to read the safe harbor statement. During this presentation, we will make certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.","Accordingly, for these forward-looking statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We strongly recommend that you become familiar with the specific risks and uncertainties that are described in the Risk Factors section of our most recently-filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and that you review the section entitled Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements in our most recently filed quarterly report on Form 10-Q.","And now I\u2019ll turn this over to Larry Merlo.","Larry Merlo","Thanks, Nancy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to hear more about our strong second quarter results, as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year.","Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.81. That\u2019s up 25% from the second quarter last year and $0.01 above the high-end of our guidance.","Our retail operating profit increased 18.5%. Our PBM operating profit jumped 14.3%. Both at or above our expectations. So we\u2019re very pleased with this strong operating performance.","The retail business continued to take advantage of the unprecedented opportunity presented to us by the stalemate between Walgreens and Express Scripts. This resulted in significant market share growth in the quarter, and as anticipated, we realized about a $0.035 benefit in Q2 from the impasse.","Now with the recent news that Walgreens will re-enter the broadest Express Scripts network this September 15, we estimate that we will generate an additional benefit of approximately $0.05 per share in the second half of the year. That estimate assumes that in the fourth quarter, we retain at least 50% of the prescription volumes gained from the stalemate. Additionally, the $0.05 per share benefit is net of the estimated investments we\u2019ll make to maximize retention.","Now given our strong results year-to-date and our outlook for the rest of the year, we are raising and narrowing our guidance for the full year. We now expect to achieve adjusted earnings per share for 2012 in the range of $3.32 to $3.38. That\u2019s up from our previous range of $3.23 to $3.33 and up approximately $0.15 from our initial 2012 guidance of $3.15 to $3.25, which we provided last December at our Analyst Day.","So we\u2019re very pleased with the upward trend in our expectations, and Dave will provide the details of our results as well as guidance for the third quarter and full year during his financial review.","Now I\u2019ll turn to a brief business update, and I\u2019ll begin with our PBM. I think as all of you know, the 2013 selling season is well underway. RFP activity is up about 7% year-over-year, and we\u2019re pleased with our overall success in the season thus far. As in prior years, most health plans and large employers have made their decisions for January 1, and our focus is now on the mid-2013 opportunities plus a significant number of 2014 opportunities. The pricing environment remains competitive but rational, and we continue to provide consistent and differentiated offerings that continue to serve us well.","Now as previously reported in the marketplace, we experienced some contract losses earlier in the selling season. However, I\u2019m happy to report that we have continued to win new business along the way, with gross wins totaling $3.5 billion, resulting in net new business of $640 million to date, and that is on a 2013 impact basis. Our new client wins include major Fortune 100 companies as well as regional health plans in both the commercial and Medicare or Medicaid segments.","I think it\u2019s important to note that we are seeing increased interest in narrow networks, and obviously, with 1%, 2%, 3% savings possible, some clients took a hard look at this option and have come to the conclusion that this makes sense for them. In fact, clients representing about 20% of the new revenues signed for 2013 have adopted a limited pharmacy network, and that excludes those clients who signed on for Maintenance Choice.","The clients adopting limited networks are a mix of both employers and health plans. So while we are not seeing a watershed change in the adoption of limited networks, it\u2019s clearly a factor in the selling season, and it will continue to be on the table as a cost-savings opportunity for clients. Additionally, just over half of our scheduled renewals for 2013 have gone through the renewal process. That\u2019s pretty typical for this time of year. And our retention rate currently stands at 96.3%.","Now we continue to see strong interest in the proprietary programs we offer \u2013 what we call our integration sweet spots. And let me review our progress with two of our flagship products, Maintenance Choice and Pharmacy Advisor.","We currently have approximately 10.7 million lives covered under 880 plans that have implemented or committed to implement Maintenance Choice, and we\u2019re seeing more of our new clients adopting Maintenance Choice right out of the gate. So to put that into perspective, 63% of the lives adopting Maintenance Choice in 2012 were from new clients, and that compares to only 14% back in 2009.","We also have compelling data demonstrating that Maintenance Choice has been successful in broadening access while reducing costs and improving prescription adherence. As we\u2019ve discussed previously, we\u2019re making enhancements to the program to provide a more transformative member experience that will further differentiate CVS Caremark in the marketplace.","The next generation of Maintenance Choice, which we have been referring to simply as Maintenance Choice 2.0, includes a less restrictive or voluntary plan design option that we\u2019ll offer, in addition to our legacy Maintenance Choice program. And this new option, along with the enhancements we are making for all Maintenance Choice clients, is currently in pilot and expected to be broadly available in January of 2013.","Another of our flagship programs, Pharmacy Advisor, is also using our integrated assets in a very differentiated way to lower healthcare costs and improve the health of those we serve. We now have 16.2 million lives covered by more than 900 clients committed to implement Pharmacy Advisor for diabetes. And additionally, I\u2019m pleased to report that we have 10.7 million lives covered by 550 clients already enrolled in Pharmacy Advisor for cardiovascular conditions, which launched this past April. And given our success to date, we expect to go live next year with five more Pharmacy Advisor programs addressing additional chronic diseases.","Now let me touch briefly on some other highlights of the second quarter PBM results. First, our specialty pharmacy business continued to achieve significant growth with revenues increasing a very healthy 44%. That growth was driven by new PBM clients, new product launches as well as drug price inflation.","Another important PBM growth driver is Medicare Part D. We currently have more than 4 million lives in our PDP, and just last night, CMS released the benchmark results of the 2013 Medicare Part D competitive bidding process. Now of those low-income members assigned to us, we expect to retain our current members in 30 of the 34 regions that compares to 33 of 34 last year.","We are below benchmark status in 20 regions, de minimis in 10 others. In the three regions where we lost represent approximately 240,000 low-income subsidy lives that are subject to reassignment. Now we will of course know more about our total number of beneficiaries for the 2013 plan year when CMS announces later this year the low income subsidy auto-assignees along with the results of the annual open enrollment period.","Now before turning to retail, let me briefly touch on that Aetna contract and PBM streamlining initiative. With regards to Aetna, our focus remains on the migration of Aetna\u2019s clients onto our platform, and we successfully transitioned the first waves of Aetna clients on July 1st and August 1st.","As for the streamlining initiative, we are on track to deliver over $1 billion of cumulative cost savings from 2011 through 2015. And as we\u2019ve stated previously through this initiative, we\u2019re streamlining PBM operations to improve productivity, rationalizing capacity and to consolidating our adjudication platforms to one destination platform with enhanced capabilities. And today approximately 60% of our book to business now on the destination platform with nearly 70% expected to be transitioned by year-end.","Some other examples of the progress we\u2019re making as part of our streamlining efforts include a new set of features to our caremark.com website that includes a faster and easier prescription refill process along with the ability to present cost-effective drug alternatives and other cost savings opportunities. Additionally, we\u2019ve made significant process on our new state-of-the-art automated mail order pharmacy in Illinois, which is on track to begin filling prescriptions in Q3 of this year. As we\u2019ve stated previously, we expect to hit the full run rate of annual savings from the streamlining initiative of $225 million to $275 million beginning in 2014.","So with that, let me turn to the retail business. In the second quarter, our same-store sales increased 5.6%, in line with our 5% to 6% guidance. Pharmacy comps increased 7.2% in the quarter with front store comps increasing 2.3%. Script comps increased 9.8% on a 30-day supply basis and 7.7% when counting 90-day supplies as one script. Now this reflects strong underlying performance as well as a significant benefit from the Walgreens\/Express impasse. We estimate that the stalemate added 410 to 430 basis points to our pharmacy same-store sales and 400 to 430 basis points to our script comps in the quarter, equating to about 6.5 million to 7 million scripts. Now on the flipside, pharmacy comps were negatively impacted by approximately 500 basis points in the quarter, which is related to the recent generic introductions.","Now in light of the timing of the recently announced settlement by our competitors, we expect to retain the vast majority of the scripts we gained through the third quarter and to retain at least 50% in the fourth quarter. Many of you have asked how we expect to accomplish that level of retention. And while it obviously wouldn\u2019t make sense to discuss our specific retention strategies for competitive reasons, I can assure you that we have a highly detailed multifaceted plan in place to achieve our goals. It includes customer outreach, in-store touch points, advertising and promotions. And our plan is based on sophisticated analytics and it makes economic sense. So we are very confident that we will retain a significant portion of that business.","It\u2019s also important to note that we have continually searched for ways to improve and differentiate our pharmacy offering. For example, our Retail Pharmacy adherence program is now in its fifth year and we continue to be pleased with its strong performance. In the first half of this year alone, our pharmacy teams proactively delivered 40 million live customer interventions across all of our stores helping to improve adherence and keep our customers healthier. And I just want to say that I am very proud of the hard work and efforts of our pharmacy teams, they\u2019re doing a great job.","As for the front store business, both customer traffic and average front store ticket increased in the quarter. We estimate that the Walgreens\/Express impasse positively impacted our front store comp by more than 100 basis points in the quarter. In contrast, front store comps were negatively impacted by the seasonal compression of two fewer selling weeks in the Easter holiday period, as well as the early end to the allergy season.","The latest data shows that CVS has gained front store share versus last year when compared to drugstore and multi-outlet competitors. Our market share growth in the second quarter was 123 basis points and 18 basis points respectively. Our ExtraCare loyalty program continues to be a key differentiator and now with more than 15 years of history, today we have roughly 70 million active cardholders. And our vast wealth of experience enables us to continue to develop both new and better ways to enhance the offering for our customers.","As for our real estate program, we opened 60 new or relocated stores, closed 9, resulting in 27 net new stores in the quarter and we remain on track to increase our retail square footage growth by approximately 2% to 3% for the year.","Now before turning it over to Dave let me just briefly touch on MinuteClinic. Revenues increased 17% in the second quarter and MinuteClinic continued its strong growth. We opened 14 net new clinics ending the quarter with 584 clinics in 25 states and the District of Columbia. About 85% of the visits were paid through third-party insurance in the quarter and we continue to enhance MinuteClinic\u2019s role as a collaborator with integrated health networks, adding three new affiliations to the 15 health system affiliations already in place. And physicians from these new affiliates will serve as medical directors for local MinuteClinics and the organizations will collaborate on patient education and disease management initiatives. We\u2019ll also work toward fully integrating electronic medical record systems to streamline communications around all aspects of patient care.","We continue to focus on new programs at MinuteClinic aimed at identifying and monitoring chronic conditions. As an example, we\u2019re focused on identifying patients with elevated blood pressure and encouraging them to follow-up with MinuteClinic or their primary care physician. As a result, we\u2019ve seen a 50% increase in blood pressure evaluations compared to the same quarter last year. And we believe our plans to enhance our services and to double our clinic count over the next several years should position us well to play an important role in helping solve the primary care physician shortage, especially with millions of newly insured individuals expected to enter the healthcare marketplace.","And on that positive note, let me turn it over to Dave for his financial review.","Dave Denton","Thank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. I plan to walk you through a detailed review of our second quarter financial performance, as well as our 2012 guidance. I\u2019d like to start with a summary of how we\u2019re using our strong free cash flow to return value to our shareholders.","In the second quarter, we paid approximately $209 million in dividends. We still anticipate a payout ratio of approximately 21% this year and are well on track to achieve our targeted payout ratio of 25% to 30% by 2015. Additionally, we repurchased a total of 26.6 million shares during the quarter at an average cost of $44.65 per share, drawing upon approximately $1.2 billion of our current repurchase authorization. So between dividends and share repurchases, we\u2019ve returned more than $1.4 billion to shareholders just in the second quarter and year-to-date we\u2019ve returned more than $2.4 billion to our shareholders.","We continue to target an adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.7 times. And even with our focus on maintaining our current credit ratings, I continue to expect that at a minimum we will complete the remaining $1 billion of the current authorization throughout this year. So between dividends and share repurchases, we\u2019ll allocate roughly $3.8 billion to enhancing shareholder value during 2012. We expect to continue to generate very substantial free cash flow in the near-term, as well as the longer-term, and our disciplined capital allocation program will remain a vital component of our efforts to drive shareholder value.","We generated $3.2 billion of free cash year-to-date and $790 million in the second quarter. The advance payments we received from CMS in the first quarter are driving the outsized free cash flow generation year-to-date but we expect this to reverse itself in the third quarter given a normal CMS payment schedule. Nonetheless, we\u2019re on track to reach our free cash flow target range for the year of $4.6 billion to $4.9 billion.","Inventory days within the Retail segment have improved by nearly three days from the end of last year and combined with gains in both DPO and DSO, we have reduced our retail cash cycle by nearly four days so far this year. And that\u2019s despite our efforts to stock up to meet demands created by the Walgreens\/Express Scripts impasse.","As we continue to make process improvements, the retail team remains committed to its inventory reduction target of $500 million for the full year and working capital improvements such as these are expected to continue to enhance our cash generation capabilities. Given the lack of any sale-leaseback activity, net and gross capital spending in the second quarter were both $441 million, an increase of $40 million from the prior-year period.","Turning to the income statement, as Larry mentioned, adjusted earnings per share was $0.81 for the quarter while GAAP-diluted EPS from continuing operations came in at $0.75 per share, both $0.01 above the high-end of our guidance. The EPS beat was driven by the strong performance in the PBM, a more favorable tax rate, and a slightly lower weighted-average share count than expected. And I\u2019ll address all of these in a moment but first let me walk you down the profit and loss statement.","On a consolidated basis, revenues in the second quarter increased more than 16% to $30.7 billion. Within the PBM segments, net revenues increased 28% in the PBM to $18.4 billion. The majority of growth from last year was driven by new client starts as well as the acquisition of the Universal American Medicare Part D business in late April of last year. Additionally, revenues were aided by higher drug price inflation which was partially offset by increases in the generic dispensing rate.","PBM pharmacy network revenues in the quarter increased 30% versus last year\u2019s second quarter to $12.6 billion while pharmacy network claims expanded by 14%. Total mail choice revenues increased 25% to $5.7 billion while mail choice claims increased more than 15%. Our overall mail choice penetration rate was 22.9%, up 30 basis points versus last year. The continued adoption of Maintenance Choice by our clients and use of the program by their members helped to drive the mail penetration rate upward while the substantial growth in Medicare and Medicaid within our book of business tempered that growth.","In our retail business, revenues increased 7% in the quarter to $15.8 billion. This growth was primarily driven by our same-store sales increase of 5.6% as well as net revenues from new stores, relocations, and MinuteClinic which accounted for approximately 140 basis points of the increase. And Larry talked about our pharmacy and front store comps in some detail so I won\u2019t go into those here.","Turning to gross margin, the consolidated company reported 17.7% in the quarter, a contraction of approximately 150 basis points compared to Q2 of 2011. The decline is largely a mix issue given the lower gross margin PBM business grew revenues faster in the quarter than the retail business.","Within the PBM segment, gross margin was down approximately 80 basis points versus last year\u2019s second quarter. The decrease was driven primarily by price compression and changes within the PBM mix of business. Partially offsetting these negative impacts was a 390 basis point increase in the PBM\u2019s generic dispensing rate which grew from 74.1% to 78%.","New generic drug introductions had a positive impact, as did our continuous efforts to encourage plan members to use generics wherever available and clinically appropriate. Gross margins in the Retail segment was 30.1%, up approximately 35 basis points over LY. This was driven primarily by the 350 basis point increase in retail GDR expanding from 75.6% to 79.1% which was partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure.","Additionally, in the second quarter, the change in inventory accounting that I highlighted on our last call was a drag on profits as we expected, had we not made this accounting change we estimate that retail gross margin would\u2019ve been up approximately 55 basis points, gross profit dollars would\u2019ve been approximately $31 million higher and our adjusted EPS would\u2019ve been approximately $0.02 higher in the second quarter.","This impact though was considered in our prior guidance so there is no need to adjust your models for this. For the year, we continued to expect the accounting change to add approximately $0.01 to our EPS.","Total operating expenses as a percent of revenues improved by 140 basis points versus the second quarter of last year. The PBM segment SG&A rate improved 45 basis points to 1.4%. This was primarily driven by strong revenue growth as well as improvements derived from the streamlining initiative. These were partially offset by a full quarter of expenses associated with our acquisition of the Universal American Medicare Part D business versus the partial quarter we had last year given the late April close.","In the Retail segment, SG&A as a percent of sales improved approximately 55 basis points to 20.8%. This improvement in expense leverage was again driven by solid sales growth and continued discipline around expense controls. Within the Corporate Segment, expenses were up approximately $14 million to $176 million. And with the changing gross margin nearly matching the improvement in operating expenses as a percent of sales, operating margin for the total enterprise was roughly flat at 5.6%, slightly better than our expectations. Operating margin in the PBM was 2.8% down about 35 basis points while operating margin at Retail was 9.3%, up about 90 basis points.","Retail operating profit increased a very healthy 18.5% at the high end of our guidance range. PBM operating profit exceeded our expectations and increased 14.3% above the top of our guidance range given the timing of certain expenses.","Let me also note that the cadence of earnings in the PBM this year is expected to be slightly different from the quarterly pattern we see in a typical year. And I\u2019ll speak to that in a few minutes as it affects your models for both the third and the fourth quarters.","Going below the line on the consolidated income statement, net interest expense in the quarter declined approximately $16 million from last year to $132 million. Additionally, our effective income tax rate was 38.7% better than we expected and our weighted average share count was 1.29 billion shares, approximately 3 million shares lower than we anticipated.","Now let me update you on our guidance for both the full year and provide guidance specifically for the third quarter. And I\u2019ll review many of the highlights here but you can also find the details of our guidance in the slide presentation that we posted on our website this morning.","As Larry said, we currently expect to deliver adjusted EPS for 2012 of between $3.32 and $3.38 per share, reflecting very healthy year-over-year growth rate of 18.5% to 21%. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations expected to be between $3.09 and $3.15 per share. Now this guidance contains the $0.05 benefit we expect to see during the second half of the year from the Walgreens\/Express Scripts impasse. It includes our projected retention benefit, offset by the investments in marketing and promotions that we anticipate making to achieve that level of retention.","At a minimum, we expect to generate approximately $0.03 per share of benefits in the third quarter and approximately $0.02 per share of benefit in the fourth. We now anticipate consolidated net revenue growth for the year between 14% and 15%. Both segments of our business should see robust revenue growth, especially the PBM which continues to benefit from the addition of new clients following last year\u2019s strong selling season.","Also, recall that our retail estimates include a one extra day in 2012 versus 2011 for leap year. Within the Retail segment, we now expect revenues to increase 5.5% to 6.25% year-over-year, an increase of 25 basis points at the high end over the prior guidance. We expect same-store sales growth for the year to be in the range of 4% to 4.75% and same-store script growth to be in a range of 6% to 7%.","We are seeing greater pressure from generic introductions on the top line, and as a result we expect the impact on pharmacy same-store sales from recent generic launches to ramp-up to more than 800 basis points in the third quarter and more than 1,000 basis points in the fourth. We expect gross margin in the segment to be notably up over 2011 while operating expenses as a percent of revenue are expected to modestly deteriorate. As a result, operating profit in the Retail segment now is expected to grow between 14% and 15%, an increase of 250 basis points at the high end from prior guidance. Retail operating margin is now expected to increase by 65 to 70 basis points.","And as you think about your quarterly models for the remainder of the year, please note that we expect an above-trend increase in Retail SG&A growth in the fourth quarter. There are essentially three factors driving this. First, we expect to incur expenses related to transition of our photo business from wet to dry photo processing. Second, we plan to make greater marketing investments. And third, we are comparing against disproportionally lower spending levels in Q4 of last year. Recall that expenses were down 3.5% in the fourth quarter of last year as we responded to the softer sales trends we were experiencing at that time. So that is just something to bear in mind as you do your quarterly models.","Within the PBM segment, we are narrowing the range to the high end of our revenue growth expectations by 100 points \u2013 100 basis points to between 24.5% and 25.5%. We continue to expect gross margins in the PBM to be down notably while we anticipate moderate improvements in operating expenses as a percent of revenues. We expect a decline in PBM operating margins of between 30 and 35 basis points and an increase in PBM operating profit of between 13% and 15% for the year, bringing the bottom of the range up by 200 basis points.","There are several expectations at the consolidated level that have been updated so let me quickly review those here. Given the strength that we\u2019re seeing in the use of Maintenance Choice program, we\u2019ve increased our outlook for the intercompany revenue eliminations as a percent of combined segment revenues to about 10.25%. Additionally, for the full year, we now expect expenses in the Corporate Segment to be between $680 and $690 million and interest expense of between $530 and $540 million. We also have increased our amortization outlook by approximately $5 million to $480 million and expect the full-year tax rate of approximately 38.7%. Weighted average share count for the full year is expected to be 1.29 billion shares. Our free cash flow guidance remains unchanged for the year at the range of $4.6 billion to $4.9 billion.","And while we are not changing guidance for free cash flow, there\u2019s one timing headwind that I want to mention. At year-end, the Health Net PDP is expected to be in the receivable position from CMS for the plan year 2012. This is primarily due to higher low-income subsidy in catastrophic utilization. This cash will not be received from CMS until February of 2014 as we consolidate Health Net into the core\u2019s SilverScript\u2019s PDP business. So this may cause us to come up \u2013 to end up near the lower end of our free cash flow guidance range. However, I\u2019m optimistic that our strong underlying free cash flow will offset this timing headwind, but we\u2019ll see how the second half goes and we\u2019ll monitor the situation very closely.","For the third quarter, we expect to achieve adjusted EPS in the range of $0.81 to $0.83 per share, reflecting growth of 15% to 18% over the same period of LY. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $0.75 to $0.77 in the third quarter. Operating profit in the Retail segment is expected to grow between 15% and 17% during the quarter, capturing our retention assumptions that I discussed earlier. PBM segment operating profit is expected to grow modestly at 4% to 7.5% in the quarter.","Now it\u2019s important to note that we\u2019ve a few factors this year that will affect the timing of profit flows between the third and fourth quarters, impacting our expected PBM operating profit growth rates. One factor affecting the quarterly cadence of PBM profits is our Medicare Part D PDP business. This business runs as an insurance company with profits based on where the plan is performing versus its bid. As most of you know, there is a tiered risk share between the plan and the government based on performance levels versus that bid.","With that as a background, in Q3 of last year, we began realizing synergies from the acquisition of the Universal American\u2019s PDP business that was not included in the Universal American\u2019s bid, resulting in more favorable performance and lower than normal loss ratios in the third quarter. This resulted in higher profits in the third quarter of 2011. As we then move through the risk sharing tiers in the fourth quarter we ended up sharing more of this favorable performance with CMS than we normally would have, was reduced profits in the fourth quarter.","This year, the progression is more typical and it will result in a tough year-over-year comparison in the third quarter and a favorable comparison in the fourth. In fact our implied expected growth in the PBM operating profit in the fourth quarter based on the assumptions I just gave you is more than 30%. So again, this is only a matter of timing between Q3 and Q4 as our full-year growth outlook in the PBM operating profit remains solid at 13% to 15%.","Wrapping up the quarterly guidance, consolidated revenues are expected to increase 11.75% to 12.75%. In the Retail segment, revenues are expected to increase at 3.5% to 4.5% versus the third quarter of 2011, taking into account the share gains from the impasse. As I said, new generic introductions are expected to greatly deflate our top line growth with the impact expected to be greater in the third quarter than we experienced in the second quarter. Same-store sales growth is expected to be the range of 2.5% to 3.5% while same-store script growth is expected to be in the range of 6.5% to 7.5%. Revenues of the PBM are expected to grow by 22% to 23% largely reflecting new client additions and some branded drug inflation.","So in closing, the second quarter was a very strong quarter and our earnings and cash flow outlook for the remainder of the year is excellent. We will continue to apply a disciplined approach to capital allocation using our strong free cash flow to enhance shareholder value.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Larry.","Larry Merlo","Okay. Thanks, Dave. And as I said, we are very pleased with our strong operating results this quarter across the company and as we look forward we\u2019re confident that we have the right plans in place to achieve significant retention of our new retail prescription volumes. And additionally, while the PBM selling season continues, we have achieved positive net new business to date and we\u2019re focused on the opportunities that remain. And we believe that our competitive position remains very strong, given our differentiated suite of services that cannot be easily replicated and we will continue to reinvent pharmacy for better health and for better shareholder value.","So with that, let\u2019s open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Larry Merlo","Good morning, John.","John Heinbockel \u2013 Guggenheim securities","When you think about the progression of generics, how do you think we\u2019re going to experience the MACing progression here versus past cycles? And when you look at how generics fall fiscal 2013 versus 2012, 2013 will be bigger but could it be as big as 50% or 75% bigger or more balanced than that?","Larry Merlo","Well, John, I think as we\u2019ve been talking about generics for more than one year now I think what we\u2019re seeing is it\u2019s performing exactly the way we believed it would and the way we\u2019ve modeled. And we had said that we would maximize profitability for those drugs that had exclusivity periods once the 180-day exclusivity period expired and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing with Plavix and with Lipitor.","And with drugs like Plavix that do not have an exclusivity period, we\u2019re able to maximize that profitability on day one. I think, again, as we acknowledge that during that break-open period where the exclusivity period is no longer in effect, while we see MACing increase, we also see significant reductions in cost of goods and that\u2019s what makes a net positive for the business. So we have not seen any surprises from the way we\u2019ve modeled things from an acquisition cost, as well as MACing, as well as what we\u2019re seeing in terms of the actual penetration of the percent of the brands that have now switched to the generic.","John Heinbockel \u2013 Guggenheim securities","But it is \u2013 the impact will be greater in 2013 or now?","Larry Merlo","Well, John, I mean we\u2019ll talk more about that as we provide 2013 guidance. Obviously, when we think about the first half of 2013, we\u2019ll be comping up against the exclusivity period of Lipitor and we\u2019ve just got to model the rest of the year beyond that. And again, we\u2019ll talk more about that as we get closer to providing 2013 guidance.","John Heinbockel \u2013 Guggenheim securities","All right. And then with respect to front-end, which was actually pretty good. Did you see, as others have, sort of a slowdown toward the end in June specifically? And have you seen any signs of the consumer retrenching? And then to go along with that, what do you think happens promotionally in the back half of the year with respect to the front-end? Not with Walgreens trying to recover Express business so much, but as they launch their loyalty program do you think the promotional environment heats up or not so much?","Larry Merlo","Yeah John, let me \u2013 the first part of your question, I think that we saw the second quarter get off to a slow start for some of the reasons that we had acknowledged in the prepared remarks in terms of the allergy season being frontloaded, if you will, as well as the Easter comp. And quite frankly, a slow start to the summer selling period as we had a pretty rainy May. So we saw things improve as we ended up going to the latter part of the quarter. I think the consumer still remains cautious and is looking for value and as we\u2019ve talked many times, we look to ExtraCare to provide that value in a very differentiated way. I think if you back out the activity associated with the Walgreens\/Express issue, we see the promotional environment being relatively normal as we move into the second half of the year.","John Heinbockel \u2013 Guggenheim securities","Okay. And there\u2019s really no reason for you to have to respond to their loyalty program, correct? That\u2019s \u2013 I would think.","Larry Merlo","Well, John, listen, we \u2013 again, as we\u2019ve been at the loyalty program for the better part of 15 years. Okay? We\u2019ve got tremendous learnings. We\u2019ve got over 70 million active cardholders and we\u2019re not done. We\u2019re continuing to look for ways to enhance value and continue to take ExtraCare to new heights. So we\u2019re always trying to figure out how we can do that and you see that come to life in the marketplace. But in terms of your specific question, in terms of do we respond to a competitor introducing a loyalty program, no, we respond to continuing to bring enhancements that add value to our existing program.","John Heinbockel \u2013 Guggenheim securities","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Dane Leone with Macquarie. Please proceed.","Dane Leone \u2013 Macquarie","Hi. Thank you for taking the question. Congrats on a great quarter. I guess just a question on the PBM side. Can you just remind us how the progression usually goes throughout the year with renewals, retention rates seemed a little lower than how you ended the year last year, is this expected to increase as you complete the remainder of your renewals? Or are you seeing something different competitively on the PBM side? Thanks.","Dave Denton","This is Dave. Maybe I\u2019ll start with that. Our retention rate is slightly lower than it was last year, as you recall. Larry mentioned it on the call that we had started the year with a couple of losses. I would say that kind of where we are from a renewal standpoint through this period of the year is fairly consistent with where a typical year would land so we\u2019re not seeing anything too abnormal there. And I think that retention rate should be \u2013 our expectation is that\u2019s probably where we\u2019ll end the year as well.","Dane Leone \u2013 Macquarie","Okay.","Larry Merlo","Acknowledging that that would be slightly less than last year.","Dane Leone \u2013 Macquarie","Okay. And just a point of clarification on a previous remark that you made regarding narrow networks, that 20% of was it new clients signed up, looking to enter into a narrow network excluding Maintenance Choice or \u2013 sorry, could you just clarify that comment?","Larry Merlo","Yeah, that 20% was excluding Maintenance Choice and it was looking at new client revenues.","Per Lofberg","So typically, a restricted network is one approach for customers to save money, Maintenance Choice is an alternative approach. In a way, that\u2019s a restricted network too because for maintenance meds it dramatically focuses patients on mail order or CVS retail for maintenance meds so both of those are in play with many customers currently.","Dane Leone \u2013 Macquarie","And so this is \u2013 was noted as being an uptick year-over-year. You\u2019re seeing an increase in the amount of interest into entering in narrow networks, correct?","Per Lofberg","Yep.","Dane Leone \u2013 Macquarie","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig with Citi. Please proceed.","Deborah Weinswig \u2013 Citi","Great. Thanks so much, and congratulations on a great quarter. Actually building on the last question, can you just talk about how CVS is in a unique position to really capitalize on your networks?","Larry Merlo","Yeah. Deb, thanks for the comment. And as we\u2019ve discussed many times, our retail organization has worked very hard with all of the PBMs to establish long-term relationships. And relationships that focus on serving the respective client members in an effort to manage costs and improve the health of those that we\u2019re serving.","And I think that strategy will continue to serve us well as we move into the future. And the dialogues that the retail organization is having with other PBMs about the opportunities that we bring from an execution point of view with narrow or more restricted networks.","Deborah Weinswig \u2013 Citi","Great. Thanks. And then a follow up question, I was very impressed with the specialty growth this quarter. Can you discuss both on the retail side and the PBM side what you\u2019re seeing on the specialty side?","Per Lofberg","Well, the specialty growth is heavily focused on the PBM part of the business. And it\u2019s driven by a couple of different factors.","I mean one factor is simply signing up more PBM lives. That in and of itself drives specialty growth. But also the underlying utilization of specialty due to new drug introductions and the inflation of the AWPs in the specialty category are driving the revenues.","So both SAP and Aetna, which were large new accounts, they contributed significantly to the growth of our specialty business.","Deborah Weinswig \u2013 Citi","Okay. And the last quick question \u2013 I believe you said Maintenance Choice 2.0 is currently in pilot. I don\u2019t know if you have any feedback at this point?","Per Lofberg","Well, it\u2019s a very good extension of the current Maintenance Choice program. And the basic changes to that program has to do with the plan designs, where we can now offer access to CVS retail for plans that don\u2019t have a mandatory mail-order program. So people can have access to CVS retail using the lower mail-order co-pay, as long as we have the ability to contact those members and inform them of those savings.","And the second feature associated with Maintenance Choice 2.0 has to do with flexibility for the consumer where we\u2019re building the capability to allow consumers to basically decide for every prescription they get, whether they want to have it sent to their home or whether they want to pick it up at a CVS retail store. And they will be able to use their smartphones or go to website to just decide, based on what\u2019s most convenient for them, where they would like to pick up the prescription.","So it\u2019s very easy plan for our customers to adopt because it doesn\u2019t require them to change the basic benefit design, like what they have to do with a mandatory mail-order program.","Deborah Weinswig \u2013 Citi","Great. Well, thanks so much, and best of luck.","Larry Merlo","Thanks, Deb.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robert Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","Robert Willoughby \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Larry or Dave, can you prioritize possibly the PBM profit drivers here sequentially? Is it generics, first? Deal synergy, second? PBM streamlining and then maybe Aetna or other factors that drove that improvement?","And then the other question, just with the Walgreens resolution, is there any change in the economics you have with Express or changes in your pharmacy network positioning whatsoever?","Dave Denton","Well, Bob, maybe I\u2019ll just touch upon the progression around the earnings sequentially.","Keep in mind too that, from a cadence perspective, Medicare Part D, as we talked about on the call, the cadence of that earnings progression is slightly different this year than has been historically. Typically, you see the front half pretty modest, the back half of the year more accelerated from a profits progression perspective.","I think it\u2019s clear that, as we think about the PBM business in general, generics are a big driver of economics in this space. And you\u2019re seeing the generic wave begin to take effect in 2012. And I think progression from a generic standpoint is pretty impactful this year, and probably into the future as well.","Larry Merlo","And I think, Bob, the other thing to note is, as we\u2019ve discussed previously, that we talked in the prepared remarks about the streamlining initiative, and the benefits outweigh the costs in 2012, so that\u2019s also contributing to the performance.","Your other question, Bob, in terms of economics on the retail side with Express Scripts \u2013 the settlement between Walgreens has no impact in terms of the relationship that we have. As we\u2019ve acknowledged, we\u2019ve had a very good relationship with Express on the retail side of the business, and I know our retail organization continues to look forward to working with them into the future.","Robert Willoughby \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Scott Mushkin \u2013 Jefferies","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I was hoping you could talk at least conceptually about profit growth as we move out of 2012, as almost all the questions I\u2019m getting are on that issue.","It appears the level of new business coming into the PBM will not be as great, which is usually good for profits. Retail, on the other hand, would seem poised for much slower growth going forward. I guess I\u2019m looking for any thoughts on how we get an encore on what looks like just a spectacular 2012.","Dave Denton","Hey, Scott. This is Dave. I\u2019ll start this off.","I think I\u2019d hearken you back a little bit to the Analyst Day presentation, where we laid out our roadmap for \u2013 I\u2019ll say profit growth projections over the next several years, as well as the cash flow projections that we have for our business. And I think both of those, as we look at where we are, and as we think about the next several years, are pretty impactful.","And we laid out, I think, a series of items that we believe are going to drive our performance from an enterprise perspective. As we\u2019ve talked about, we\u2019re beginning a phase of the generic wave that will be very impactful from a profit-growth perspective. We\u2019re beginning a wave of utilization that we\u2019ve not seen before, as the baby boomers turn into the over-65 population and utilization trends will begin to increase over time.","And then furthermore, both the PBM and retail business have very specific plans to both gain share, to reduce costs and improve the underlying performance of their business, top to bottom, as they drive more share through their fixed asset base.","So I think without giving specifics to 2013 because it\u2019s clearly we\u2019re way too early for that, there are some very macro trends and efforts that we\u2019re focused against, day in and day out, to drive \u2013 also to your point \u2013 an encore of 2012, as we think about the next couple of years.","Scott Mushkin \u2013 Jefferies","All right, perfect. And I also I guess I have a little housekeeping item but also another question. Mail choice, I think is now about 9.5% of PBM script volumes with the growth being driven by new Maintenance Choice adopters. Where can mail choice go over the next few years? And how does that impact overall enterprise profitability?","And then the housekeeping items, I think you said 20% of the $3.5 billion in gross wins are narrow networks, but I didn\u2019t hear how much of that is also Maintenance Choice. So I was wondering if you could give us that data? And then I\u2019ll yield. Thank you for taking my questions.","Larry Merlo","Scott, let me take the housekeeping issue, and then I\u2019ll ask Per to go back to your question. The 20% that \u2013 just to be clear, the 20% that we talked about in terms of net business from a revenue perspective \u2013 excludes Maintenance Choice. So those clients adopting Maintenance Choice would be on top of that 20%.","Scott Mushkin \u2013 Jefferies","And do we have how much that is, Larry? That\u2019s what I was looking for.","Larry Merlo","We do not have that at this point. There\u2019s more dialogue taking place. That\u2019s something we\u2019ll talk about later in the year.","Per Lofberg","With respect to the growth potential, you recall that Larry pointed out that we currently have about 10.8 million lives that are using our legacy Maintenance Choice program, and that\u2019s the program that requires a \u2013 essentially a mandatory plan design.","We presented, I think, at Analyst Day last December that when we roll-out Maintenance Choice 2.0, that really allows us to access a large portion of our customer base that have a mail-order benefit but that don\u2019t require people to use mail order for maintenance meds. So that will probably triple or so the potential in our book of business. So we \u2013 I think we projected back at Analyst Day that we could reach in excess of 30 million lives with that type of program.","Dave Denton","And, Scott, I would also go back and look at \u2013 as we introduced Maintenance Choice a few years ago, keep in mind the progression of adoption. It started off relatively slow. And as more people adopted it, it began to accelerate into either existing clients or new clients.","We expect that Maintenance Choice 2.0 will also follow that same pattern as people \u2013 first-movers will try the program, test it, make sure it works to their satisfaction, and then can communicate that broadly into the benefit community.","Per Lofberg","Another thing that might be worth mentioning is that you may recall from our Analyst Day presentation that, last year, in going into 2012, we had a number of new customers that adopted Maintenance Choice right out of the box, that came from other PBMs with mandatory mail-order programs. And we see the same pattern in this year\u2019s selling season. So we have a number of new customers that are coming on board in 2013 that are putting in Maintenance Choice right out of the gate.","Scott Mushkin \u2013 Jefferies","And how is affecting enterprise profitability? And that\u2019s it for me.","Dave Denton","When we introduced Maintenance Choice, either 1.0 or 2.0, the enterprise benefits at the end of the day, so it drives disproportionate performance for us.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with UBS. Please proceed.","Steven Valiquette \u2013 UBS","Hi. Thanks. Good morning, Larry and Dave. So I guess \u2013 just separate from the loyalty card discussion earlier on the call, it just seems like over the past several weeks that some in the investor community have been concerned about the Express\/Walgreens settlement maybe leading to some sort of overall general pricing battle on the retail side of the business to either get back or retain customers that are in transition this year.","So I guess in light of that, are you able to just at least confirm that the upcoming marketplace dynamics post-September 15 are unlikely to lead any material change in overall pricing behavior on the part of CVS? I mean, is this going to be sort of business as usual, generally speaking? Or is it just too premature to make that statement? I\u2019m just trying to get more color on that. Thanks.","Larry Merlo","Steve, we see business as usual. If the question is really targeted to our relationship on the retail side with other PBMs, we don\u2019t see that changing, as I mentioned earlier.","And as it relates to the incremental scripts that we picked up over the past several months, as I acknowledged in the prepared remarks, we will be doing some promotional efforts to maximize our retention. But we\u2019ve reflected that in our outlook for the balance of the year.","Steven Valiquette \u2013 UBS","Okay. But nothing out of the ordinary that\u2019s going to lead to...","Larry Merlo","Nothing out of the ordinary, Steve.","Steven Valiquette \u2013 UBS","Okay. Okay, thanks for the clarification. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Matthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks a lot. Good morning. It\u2019s Matt.","Larry Merlo","Hi, Matt.","Matthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Sorry about that. Thanks a lot. Good morning. It\u2019s Matt. Can you hear me?","Larry Merlo","Yep. We can hear you. Good morning.","Dave Denton","Good morning.","Matthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Great. Good morning. Just a follow-up question on Walgreens. You talked about your plans for fourth-quarter retention. How do you think about the longer-term prospects for the remainder of that business? Is 50% a transitional number? Is there some expectation that, over time, some of that business sticks with you? And how have you gone through the thought process about those numbers?","Larry Merlo","Yeah, Matt, I think \u2013 first of all, let me just mention, as we\u2019ve talked many times, that pharmacy customer is a sticky customer \u2013 the hardest person to lose, and once you lose them, the hardest person to get back.","And our pharmacy and store teams have done an outstanding job of introducing the CVS brand to those new customers over the last several months. And the feedback we\u2019ve gotten from those customers has been very positive.","I\u2019ll let Mark talk in a little more specifics in terms of what we learned over that period of time that brings us to the point that we made about how we see the retention in the fourth quarter. And we\u2019ll talk more about that as it relates to 2013 at Analyst Day. But I\u2019ll flip it over to Mark.","Mark Cosby","Thanks, Larry. We\u2019ve been working on this retention plan for nine months, and as Larry said, we are definitely ready. Just a few facts I think to bolster that.","70% of our ESI customers are within two miles of an existing CVS store, and 90% of those customers are within five miles of a store. So that speaks to the stickiness of those customers. And we know the value of each of those customers, and we will be particularly focused against those top customers.","So our number one focus has been providing a great customer experience for those new customers. Some good evidence for you might be that 55% of those customers have signed up on our auto-refill program, and 83% of those customers are signed up on our ExtraCare loyalty program. So they are well ingrained in the services that we provide within the company.","And then customer service has been a big focus for us. Our measures are strong, and our feedback has been very positive.","When you think about the response, our response will be very comprehensive. It will focus on our top customers, as I mentioned earlier. The actions will include various advertising methods, promotions to retain the customers, particularly our top customers. We will also do a series of customer outreach programs in advance of the 9\/15 date as well as post the 9\/15 date, and we will have a number of customer touch points within the store.","So we value our new ESI customers, and we will do everything possible to retain them in the coming months. And as we transition into 2013, we do have a strong retention game plan in place.","Matthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Mark, those numbers are extremely helpful. Just one follow up for you or for Dave. I don\u2019t know if you mentioned the private label penetration within the front end this quarter on a year-to-year basis. Any color on the progression of that would be very great.","Dave Denton","Our private label penetration is about 17%. Essentially flat year-over-year at this point in time.","We continue to focus on it, Matt. And as we\u2019ve said, we see opportunities to improve that over the coming years to get that mix up to 20%.","Matthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.","Dave Denton","No problem.","Larry Merlo","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Frank Morgan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Good morning. Going back to that last question, the 50% retention, is it primarily tied to the statistic you gave on the amount of new customers that have already enrolled in the auto-refill? Is that the primary driver for the assumption behind retention?","Dave Denton","Frank, it\u2019s one of many estimates we have, as far as how we think we\u2019re going to drive retention into the business.","I would say the teams have done a very specific analysis \u2013 I\u2019ll say at store, at customer level, to understand the retention. And we feel very good about our \u2013 the outlook for this year with that.","Frank Morgan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. One more and I\u2019ll hop. Just curious if you could kind of give us, as it related to the selling season this year, have you seen more interest from say the new Catamaran or the Optum in the selling season? Have they become a bigger player? Have they migrated more upstream into some of the larger employer markets? Thanks.","Per Lofberg","They certainly are, both serious competitors and we see them being active and aggressive and certainly will count them as serious competitors going forward.","Larry Merlo","Next question.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with ISI group. Please proceed.","Ross Muken \u2013 ISI group","I guess as we look at the selling season sort of the outcome I think this is certainly better than many of us were looking for. I guess in terms of the progression or the competitive landscape or how some of the newly formed entities kind of approach retention, et cetera, I mean what was sort of the bigger surprises to you just in terms of what others were doing? And how did you think about that as it relates to 2014 and kind of how some of the newer entrants are going to be positioning themselves going forward? And how do you feel like that matches up against what you\u2019ve been doing with your offering?","Per Lofberg","I can\u2019t say that there are any surprises in that regard. I think it\u2019s a healthy competitive environment where you now have multiple business models to sort of choose from. I think we feel very good about our ability to differentiate what we offer in ways that are not easily replicable by others.","So as I mentioned earlier, I think Maintenance Choice clearly is a competitive edge for us especially with customers that previously have had mandatory mail order programs and likewise with health plans there is a lot of interest in our retail sort of footprint and the ability to use both the pharmacists as well as the MinuteClinics as adjuncts to the way they manage their healthcare services. So we have I think a pretty interesting suite of services that will serve us well in the future competitive environment.","Ross Muken \u2013 ISI group","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Lisa Gill \u2013 JPMorgan","Thanks very much, and good morning. I just had a couple of...","Larry Merlo","Good morning, Lisa.","Lisa Gill \u2013 JPMorgan","Good morning. Couple quick follow up questions around the selling season. Clearly we all know about the lessons that you\u2019ve had on the health plan side but the $3.5 billion of net wins was much better than we\u2019re anticipating. Can you just help us understand how much of that is maybe health plans versus corporate business as we start to think about profitability going into next year? And then as a follow up to that, Per, we\u2019ve talked to some of your customers, Maintenance Choice has been a big driver around retention. Can you talk about retention rates around Maintenance Choice and the competitive dynamic that that brings in maintaining some your customers?","Per Lofberg","Sure. First, Lisa, as you know, we probably will defer until much later in the year to give you sort of a more in-depth view of the specific wins and so on in the selling season but as Larry mentioned in his introductory comments it really kind of cuts across the board both Fortune 100 type companies that have joined us and a number of them with Maintenance Choice right out of the gate.","But also in the health plan segment both the commercial health plan segment as well as the Medicare, Medicaid segments and as you look from prior presentations the managed Medicaid area is one that is growing very rapidly for us both in terms of new customers but also existing customers taking on new states or new populations that are rolled into the managed Medicaid program. So that\u2019s the big picture and I think later on in the fall we\u2019ll probably be able to share with you more details in terms of the specific accounts and so on.","Lisa Gill \u2013 JPMorgan","And then I guess just one other follow up question around narrow networks, and I guess, Larry, this would be for you, or for Mark. If we look at the settlement between Walgreens and Express Scripts, it\u2019s only for them to participate in the broadest networks for Express Scripts so clearly they\u2019re pushing narrow networks as well this selling season like you did. What are you hearing from those in the marketplace?","My guess would be that you\u2019re part of many of the narrow networks for Express than some of the others. Are you starting to hear that we\u2019re seeing traction with others in the marketplace around narrow networks as well?","Larry Merlo","Well, Lisa, I mean as we talked we\u2019re seeing what\u2019s happening in the Caremark book of business with new clients and we\u2019re hearing and seeing similar results from the retail side of the business. And I think, as we mentioned earlier, having a long-term relationship with the other PBMs becomes extremely important in terms of being a partner with others as they\u2019re looking to create narrow or differentiated offerings in the marketplace.","Lisa Gill \u2013 JPMorgan","Great. Thank you very much.","Larry Merlo","Okay. We\u2019ll take one more question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Ricky Goldwasser \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Good morning, and thank you for taking my question.","Larry Merlo","Good morning.","Ricky Goldwasser \u2013 Morgan Stanley","I have a follow up on the selling season and then another question. So when you look at your net new business of $600 million, which came in ahead of expectations, can you provide some color on your underlying assumption? Specifically, does the number include some second half 2012 business wins that\u2019s spill into 2013? Or only 2013 new starts? And are you also taking into account growth that your managed care partners are seeing?","Per Lofberg","It does include the annualization of some of the accounts that came on in the second half of 2012.","Ricky Goldwasser \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay.","Dave Denton","Which is consistent with our methodology.","Per Lofberg","That\u2019s the way we always report it.","Dave Denton","Right.","Ricky Goldwasser \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay.","Larry Merlo","But, Ricky, it would not include anticipated growth that is not quantified at this point in time. That would not be in that number.","Ricky Goldwasser \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. So you\u2019re not assuming growth of your base business in it?","Larry Merlo","That\u2019s correct.","Ricky Goldwasser \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then when we think about the year-over-year impact from Walgreens, just to help us sort of model, did you see some benefit already in 4Q 2011 that we should kind of like factor in as we think about 4Q 2012?","Larry Merlo","Ricky, in the fourth quarter, we saw a very small benefit. We really began to see most of the benefit in the January timeframe. We saw a little bit in December. But as we stated back then, it was not material to our results.","Per Lofberg","Ricky, just to clarify one thing. As I said in response to an earlier question, we do include new lives that are added in the managed Medicare space to some of our existing customers as some of the states roll in, new lives into the managed Medicaid program from fee-for-service Medicare. And so, some of our existing customers pick up additional lives as a result of that.","Dave Denton","But that is known, it\u2019s not estimated at this point in time.","Per Lofberg","Exactly.","Ricky Goldwasser \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. But that\u2019s helpful because that could help us bridge the difference between the losses we\u2019ve heard of and some of the wins versus the number that you\u2019ve provided today.","Per Lofberg","You\u2019ll get more detail later on in the year as we get closer to the end of the selling season.","Ricky Goldwasser \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, thank you.","Per Lofberg","Thank you.","Larry Merlo","Okay, everyone, thanks for your interest in CVS Caremark, and we\u2019ll talk to you soon.","Operator","Thank you.

My name is Melissa and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the CVS Health Q1 2019 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. Joe Krocheski, Vice President, Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Joe Krocheski","Good morning everyone and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the conference call to discuss CVS Health's first quarter 2019 results and outlook for the remainder of the year. As a reminder, this call is being recorded on Wednesday, May 1st, 2019.","I'm Joe Krocheski, Vice President of Investor Relations for CVS Health. I'm joined this morning by Larry Merlo, President and CEO; and Eva Boratto Executive Vice President and CFO.","Following our prepared remarks, we'll host a question-and-answer session. Jon Roberts, COO; Karen Lynch, President of Aetna; Derica Rice, President of Caremark; and Kevin Hourican, President of CVS Pharmacy will also be joining us for the question-and-answer section.","In order to provide more people with a chance to ask their questions during the Q&A, please limit yourself to no more than one question with a quick follow-up.","In addition to this call and our press release, we will have posted a slide presentation on our website that summarizes the information in our prepared remarks as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance. Our Form 10-Q will be filed later today and that too will be available on our website once filed.","Please note, during this call, we will make certain forward-looking statements that reflect our current views related to our future financial performance, future events, and industry and market conditions, and forward-looking statements related to the integration of the Aetna acquisition including the expected consumer benefits, financial projections, and synergies.","These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what may be indicated in the forward-looking statements.","We strongly encourage you to review the information in the reports we file with the SEC regarding these specific risks and uncertainties, in particular, those that are described in the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K and the cautionary statement disclosures in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. You should also review the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in this morning's earnings press release.","During this call, we will use non-GAAP financial measures when talking about the company's performance and financial condition. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find a discussion of these non-GAAP measures and the comparable GAAP measures in this morning's earnings press release and the reconciliation document posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website. And as always, today's call is being broadcast on our website where it will be archived for one year following today's call.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Larry Merlo. Larry?","Larry Merlo","Thanks Joe. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. Today I'm pleased to report that we are off to a strong start to the year as evidenced by our first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.62 which exceeds our initial expectations. The strong performance was driven by all businesses achieving or exceeding what was contemplated at the high end of our guidance ranges with the Health Care Benefits segment leading the favorability.","Now, earlier this year, we provided 2019 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $6.68 to $6.88 and as a result of our Q1 performance, we are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance to $6.75 to $6.90. This reflects the positive momentum in the business, while acknowledging it's early in the year. We remain singularly focused on driving both near and longer term value for our shareholders.","And our first full quarter as a combined entity with Aetna was a success on many fronts. We executed smooth January 1 implementations and both the Pharmacy Services and Health Care Benefits segments posted significant Medicare Advantage membership growth, continued to grow share in our Retail Pharmacy, and we realigned some of our operations to drive greater value.","In addition to highlighting these operational achievements, I'll provide updates on important operational initiatives that we called out during our fourth quarter call, progress on our integration and transformation initiatives, the 2020 PBM selling season, and potential policy changes impacting the Medicare Part D program.","So, let me start with the notable progress we made on actions to mitigate the near-term headwinds impacting our business. First, our retail sales momentum remains strong, supported by continued focus on our clinical care programs and network relationships.","Adjusted prescription volume for the Retail\/Long-Term Care segment increased a healthy 5.5% for the quarter. Additionally, our Long-Term Care business is on track to achieve our targeted margin improvements given our cost management efforts and we continue to work diligently in driving growth for the assisted living space.","In the PBM, our new guaranteed net cost pricing model continues to garner interest from clients and benefit consultants and will have a small number of clients adopting it this year and we expect higher adoption in 2020 and beyond.","We also embarked on a new effort to reduce costs across our enterprise through improvements in productivity and driving efficiencies across our operations. And Eva will provide details on that initiative shortly.","Moving to our integration of the Aetna business. We are very pleased with the progress we have made. Currently, we are tracking to the higher end of the $300 million to $350 million synergy goal for 2019 and we are on our way to exceed our initial target of $750 million in 2020. And while the synergies are important, the CVS-Aetna combination is about bringing to market new approaches to health care delivery and management.","In our Houston HealthHUB stores, we are demonstrating our ability to bring more health care services into communities meeting people where they are. We are using our data and analytics capabilities to offer people the next best action to achieve their best health and in doing so driving down health care costs. Our vision is for these consumer experiences to be seamlessly connected across digital and clinical interactions resulting in elements of health becoming part of one's regular routine. The benefits of lower health care costs will have positive financial impacts throughout our enterprise","These new store formats illustrate how CVS Health is evolving and differentiating to address the changing health care landscape. And while it is early we are very encouraged by the initial results in our Houston stores. The various product and service offerings are performing at or above our expectations. And given these results we will expand the HealthHUB model to fill out the Houston market and we'll provide further details on our rollout strategy next month. But this is the first of many innovations we'll share with you at our Investor Day.","Moving to the 2020 PBM selling season, our retention rate currently stands in the mid-90% excluding the impact of Centene. The 2020 selling season has been somewhat unusual with no single factor contributing to lower than expected retention. And importantly, our service levels and performance metrics remain at historically high levels and we expect to return to historical retention levels in future periods.","And finally, let me discuss the role of rebates in Medicare Part D and how our Part D plans are preparing for the 2020 bid. And I want to begin by acknowledging the clarifying guidance that CMS issued for plan sponsors that bids should reflect current law and not the newly proposed rebate rule. That guidance also stated that there are a number of issues that need to be addressed before the rule can be finalized. And should a rebate will be implemented the CMS demonstration project provides plans protection from much of the risk in applying rebates at the point of sale.","Additionally, this demonstration project will allow the administration to evaluate in real time the potential impact to Part D members' premiums and to the actual costs that will be incurred by CMS. This is both a prudent step and an important analysis before such a significant change to the Part D program is made permanent. The demonstration project will allow the administration and the private sector to learn together and make adjustments to the Part D program over a more reasonable period of time. And we plan to participate in the demonstration project aided by the learnings from our Allure PDP product.","And more broadly the renewed focus nationally on what the next phase of access to affordable quality health care will be has generated significant attention in recent weeks. This is an important discussion and we will continue to be an active participant. That said regardless of what shape and form the next stage of health care takes, we remain confident that the private sector will play an essential role in both shaping and executing that next stage. And importantly, we remain best positioned to create and capture new opportunities in this ever-evolving landscape through our local assets, our end-to-end health care offerings and our ability to drive engagement positively impacting consumer health.","So let me turn the call over to Eva to walk through the key items for the quarter and an update of our full year outlook.","Eva Boratto","Thanks, Larry and good morning, everyone. Consistent with prior quarters you can find a slide presentation posted to our website this morning that provides the details of our first quarter results and the financial statements changes we discussed back in February. First quarter results are reported on a comparable basis and the reconciliations to GAAP measures can be found in the press release and on the Investor Relations portion of our website. For non-GAAP, keep in mind that we are now excluding amortization of intangibles from our operating income numbers.","I want to reiterate what Larry said. We exceeded the projections we laid out for this quarter and we're pleased with our 2019 results thus far. Our adjusted EPS was above the high end of our guidance range at $1.62 with all segments performing at or above our expectations and Health Care Benefits leading the way. Consolidated revenue grew 34.9% in Q1 2019 above the top end of our guidance range. This year-over-year increase was largely driven by a full quarter of managed care operation included this year versus last. Health Care Benefits which includes our SilverScript Medicare Part D business contributed $17.9 billion of revenue for the quarter.","Adjusted consolidated operating income grew nearly 57%, primarily due to the addition of the Aetna business. The Health Care Benefits segment contributed $1.6 billion to adjusted operating income.","In the PBM, revenue increased 3.1% with adjusted claims up 2.8% versus Q1 of 2018, driven by net new business and the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice. PBM adjusted operating income decreased 4.2% as operating margins contracted 20 basis points due to continued price compression and the Anthem investments. Additionally outstanding rebate guarantees as well as drug price inflation remained consistent with our original expectations.","We released our 2018 PBM cost drug trend report last month. The trends are a validation of the crucial role that we play in the health care system and the value that we provide to our clients and their members in keeping prescription drug costs affordable.","Caremark was again successful in delivering on this goal through the use of our formulary and cost management tools. Last year unit costs for non-specialty medications decreased 4.2% for commercial clients, while we also held unit costs on specialty products to an increase of just 1.7%, despite even higher list price increases.","Unit cost growth overall was only 1.2% with the total cost trend rising 3.3% due to increased utilization including improvements in adherence. And importantly, we were able to drive down the average out-of-pocket costs for plan members for the sixth year in a row helping patients stay adherent and improving overall health.","In Q1 the Retail\/Long-Term Care segment performed better than expected. We delivered strong adjusted script growth with adjusted same-store script growth of 6.7% despite the weaker flu season. This was driven by the continued adoption of our Patient Care Programs collaborations with PBM and preferred status in a number of Medicare Part D networks.","Our market share in Q1 stands at 26.2%. Additionally front store comps increased 0.4%, despite the shift of the Easter holiday to later in April which was approximately an 80 basis point headwind. As expected first quarter Retail\/Long-Term Care adjusted operating income declined 18.9%.","The year-over-year decline was driven by factors we've previously discussed, including continued reimbursement pressure with fewer offsets; higher expenses reflecting the wrap of last year's investments using savings from tax reform; and year-over-year performance of our long-term care business. Additionally we incurred higher legal costs in the quarter.","As we have discussed before we are continuously looking for ways to optimize our asset portfolio. In doing so, we made the decision to close 46 underperforming retail pharmacy locations.","We reported a $135 million charge in the Retail\/Long-Term Care segment in Q1 related to the store closures primarily representing the operating lease, right-of-use asset impairment charges. Consistent with our non-GAAP definition this charge is excluded from our non-GAAP metrics.","And finally Health Care Benefits started off the year strong with revenue and adjusted operating profit ahead of our expectations. Underlying these results we grew to serve over 700,000 additional medical members in the quarter driven by strong Medicare Advantage and commercial ASC membership growth and the initiation of new Medicaid contracts in Kansas and Florida.","Our total health MBR was 84% in the quarter, a good start to the year. The MBR reflects moderate medical cost trends and favorable prior year reserve development across all of our core products.","As a reminder, given the timing of the close of the Aetna merger, the year-over-year results are not comparable for our Health Care Benefits segment. Our days claims payable was 45 days for Q1 which is lower than historical Aetna results. This difference was driven by the inclusion of SilverScript's operations which lowered the metric by about 5 days given faster claims submission times.","Going below the adjusted operating income line, our interest expense and weighted average shares were in line with expectations with a slightly lower income tax provision.","We generated strong cash from operations this quarter of $1.9 billion. We repaid nearly $900 million of long-term debt in the quarter which includes $375 million of long-term notes that matured and $500 million of the term loan outstanding using available cash to reduce long-term debt and interest expense.","In the quarter, we also delivered more than $600 million to shareholders through dividends. It's important to note that our commercial paper balance was temporarily elevated at the end of the first quarter given timing of customer receipts.","That balance was fully paid-off on April 1. And since quarter-end, we have maintained an average commercial paper balance of less than $200 million. Taking all of this into account, since the close of the transaction we have repaid approximately $4 billion of debt.","Turning to our 2019 guidance, as Larry said, we are raising the guidance range to account for favorable performance during the first quarter. This brings our full year adjusted EPS range to $6.75 to $6.90. We now expect consolidated full year 2019 revenue in the range of $251.2 billion to $254.4 billion, and adjusted operating income between $15 billion and $15.2 billion.","For the segments, we expect full year 2019 adjusted operating income in the Pharmacy Services segment to be in the range of $4.86 billion to $4.92 billion, the Retail\/Long-Term Care segment in the range of $6.63 billion to $6.71 billion, and the Health Care Benefits segment in the range of $5.18 billion to $5.24 billion.","Our outlook for each of the segments was updated given the outperformance in the first quarter. The factors affecting the year have not materially changed from what I discussed back in February, which are summarized in the slides we posted on our website this morning. Recall that both the deal synergies and the incremental investments are expected to disproportionately affect the Health Care Benefits segment.","As Larry said, we are tracking to the higher end of the synergy range for this year and are on track to exceed our target of $750 million in 2020. These synergies will stem from the elimination of duplicative corporate and operational functions, purchasing efficiencies and some medical cost savings including formulary alignment.","As we discussed on our February call, we are also making investments to achieve our longer-term goals. These investments center on digital enhancements and the development of new programs to accelerate growth.","We continue to expect incremental investment spending to be between $325 million and $350 million in 2019. In addition, we also continue to expect integration costs of approximately $550 million, which are excluded from our non-GAAP guidance metrics.","Our cash flows are expected to remain strong this year delivering between $9.8 billion and $10.3 billion of cash flow from operations, of which we expect $4.2 billion to $4.6 billion to be available for debt repayment this year. In addition to paying down our 2019 maturity, we plan to pay down the rest of our term loan by year-end.","The cash from operations will be reduced by net capital expenditures of approximately $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion and shareholder dividends of approximately $2.6 billion, after increased retained capital needs for our insurance subsidiaries commensurate with our strong year-to-date membership growth in the Health Care Benefits segment, particularly in the government space.","As I stated, we expect to have $4.2 billion to $4.6 billion available for debt pay down in 2019. We are laser-focused on improving the cash generated by our business. And as we have discussed previously, we are working on a number of initiatives to further improve our cash generation which would yield upside to our current projections.","Turning to operating efficiencies, both CVS and Aetna have had a strong history of executing successful cost reduction and productivity initiatives. And through our integration, we are seeing the opportunity to make productivity gains across the enterprise. We have consolidated various programs across the enterprise into one enterprise modernization initiative.","We expect the savings and productivity gains this initiative generates to help offset the competitive dynamics we are experiencing, drive the creation of more affordable products for our customers, and provide capacity that will help us achieve our financial targets as we continue investing in our strategic and transformational initiative.","We are confident that this initiative will help drive longer-term growth in the combined business beyond 2019. We expect this initiative to generate run rate savings of $1.5 billion to $2 billion in 2022, and this is over and above our deal synergy targets.","Finally, I want to touch on expectations for earnings progression for the rest of the year. Year-over-year growth of consolidated adjusted operating income will be highest through the first three quarters as we wrap the addition of Aetna.","We expect to see adjusted operating income growth in our Retail\/Long-Term Care and PBM segments improving as we move throughout the year. Adjusted operating income within Health Care Benefits is expected to be greatest in Q1 and lowest in Q4. For Q2, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.68 to $1.72.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Larry.","Larry Merlo","Thanks, Eva. We are pleased with the progress and momentum we demonstrated in the quarter as we position ourselves to win in this evolving health care landscape. The breadth of our assets capabilities and experience meaningfully differentiate us from others in the market and provide us unique opportunities to create a company that generates superior value for shareholders and all the constituencies we serve. Next month, we plan on sharing our long-term targets including more specific details on the innovative products and services we plan to bring to market to achieve those goals as well as our earnings, cash flows and debt targets. And we look forward to seeing many of you in New York City on June 4.","So with that, let's go ahead and open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Lisa Gill","Thanks very much and congratulations on the first combined quarter. Larry, let me start with the selling season. I know you said that, there wasn't anything specific to the losses that you've seen thus far for 2020. But if I look at, at least what The Street knows about it looks like they're primarily coming on the health plan side. So do you think that now that you own Aetna that's playing anything into those decisions around health plans doing business with CVS? That would be my first question.","And then secondly, as we think about that health plan business as it relates to your retail business can you just talk about utilization as far as script goes? Do you \u2013 are you seeing a lot of those scripts coming through CVS? Or will we see a combined loss of both of those going into 2020?","Larry Merlo","Yeah, Lisa, good morning, and I'll take the first part of the question. Lisa, what's interesting is we've just had our Caremark Client Forum a few weeks back. Several of us were there. We spent time with the broader audience as well as our advisory groups, which we have that for each discipline within Caremark. And I would describe the health plans as having an ongoing tremendous amount of interest in terms of what it is that we're doing around transformation and interest in terms of how that can create value for them. So I did not get any sense whatsoever that this notion of channel conflict is entering into the selling season or entering in as a concern. And actually, quite the opposite, wanting to understand where we're at with the transformation and when and how they can benefit from those innovative products and services.","Eva Boratto","And Lisa, this is Eva. On your second part of your question I would say, as you know our retail business has worked very strong over the last couple of years to improve our relationships, with other payers and have constructive network offerings. So we'll continue to work on and develop those relationships and don't see anything meaningfully step back there.","Lisa Gill","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore. Your line is open.","Ross Muken","Good morning, guys. Congrats. So I guess maybe on the retail side, I mean, it seems like the HealthHUBs and I recently saw one myself down in Houston are pretty impressive new institutions. I'm trying to get a sense \u2013 and I don't want to steal too much from the Analyst Day, but just in terms of the progress you've made there and the feedback the sort of loop of figuring out what models work what don't the sort of traffic uptick. So I guess when \u2013 maybe less on sort of anything numerical, but when do you think you'll be able to give us sort of updates on rollout sell-through to sort of the Aetna member base other creative sort of solutions you can come up with if any on the Medicaid side? Just a better sense of how that sort of plan is going to evolve and then how you're able to sort of incorporate that with some of the other omnichannel things you're doing as well as some of the front-end refresh overall?","Larry Merlo","Yea, Ross, it's Larry. Great question and I'll take the first part and then I'll ask Kevin to comment perhaps to your point about \u2013 it's difficult to talk quantitatively at this point because we still have a limited amount of time, but I'll ask Kevin to talk qualitatively in terms of what we're seeing, what we're hearing from those that we're serving. Ross, I would describe where we're at today as we got more things right in our concept of what a HealthHUB is then things that we missed. And there are some things that we're tweaking, but as you heard in our prepared remarks, we're ready to complete the Houston market in the coming weeks. And to your other question, we will have a more detailed view of the rollout strategy beyond Houston as it relates to this year as well as 2020. So bottom line as you heard in our remarks we are excited about the opportunity.","Kevin Hourican","Yes, Larry. And I \u2013 sorry, It's Kevin. I appreciate the question. We call it creating a compelling place to shop, a reason for the consumer to want to come into the store. And that HealthHUB format is achieving that objective. The consumer reaction has been quite strong.","We've added thousands of net new items to the front store in the self-care and wellness arena, expanded MinuteClinic services. We've expanded the pharmacists' interactions with patients with greatest needs.","And last but not least, we're really intrigued by the addition of a new position in our store called the care concierge, which is the glue that's kind of pulling together these ecosystems that can help answer consumers' questions about any and all health care needs that they have, including health care benefits in partnership with Aetna and other health plans in the future.","And as Larry said at our Analyst Day, we'll talk in more detail about the expansion plans. We're working aggressively on that as we speak and can share those details on June 4.","Larry Merlo","Ross, the -- maybe just wrapping up this topic. One of the things that we are learning, that I know is of interest is, out of the gate we've talked about our hub-and-spoke concept. So if you look at what does it take to complete the Houston market, we needed about another 20 stores, which would represent about 15% of the stores in that metroplex, if you will.","So we are learning how to build out this hub-and-spoke concept, acknowledging that there are things that we're learning in these stores that we will apply broadly to the stores that aren't hubs in the market. And again, as Kevin mentioned, we'll talk more about that at -- on June 4. But again, the things that we are measuring, the metrics that we're using internally, we're very pleased. They're all meeting the objective or ahead of our target.","Kevin Hourican","So just last comment. This is Kevin, again. You asked about omnichannel. We recently announced that we expanded home delivery same day to over 6,000 stores in partnership with Shipt and we're pleased to see consumer adoption to even more convenient home delivery.","Ross Muken","And, I guess, maybe on the benefits business, I mean, it seems like you've done, obviously, quite well coming into this year on membership. You had momentum there. As you think about other types of places to integrate the asset base and maybe deeply tie in also, sort of, what you're doing on Caremark.","I guess, is there anything like anecdotal, as you've integrated and as you've sort of game-planned, again, maybe at a very high level and you'll share more detail at the Analyst Day, but things where, well, we wouldn't have thought we can do that, or an area of focus where you think you can really sort of move the needle, as you start to laser in on maybe some of these bigger cost opportunities that exist within that sort of cost base?","Larry Merlo","Well, Ross, two points on -- to that question. Kevin mentioned the care concierge. And we're gaining a tremendous amount of learnings in terms of what exactly our customers are looking for, based on the interactions this position is having with them. And it covers a wide range of topics.","I think the second thing is, there is certainly a lot more that we can do around specialty, based on some of the things that we're seeing and learning. And the third thing, Ross, that I would mention is that, we've got -- you've seen one of the concept stores, but as you think about the various segments that we serve, we could see a HealthHUB that is modified from what you may have seen in Texas, that would play to that segment of beneficiaries, but recognizing that they have different needs than what we may see more broadly in a market. So those are some things that we're working on as well.","Ross Muken","Thanks, Larry. Appreciate the commentary.","Larry Merlo","Thanks, Ross.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte from SVB Leerink. Your line is open.","Ana Gupte","Yes. Hey, thanks. Good morning. Glad that you had a good quarter. I wanted to get some color on what the potential would be for growth in 2020. And I, obviously, am not looking for guidance or anything. But if you take a look at your synergy guidance, which you're saying confidently, is above $750 million and it sounds like there's some enterprise savings building on top of Aetna.","The Anthem story should become positive, offsetting some of the standard G&A pressures. And even though you have Centene, maybe, they kind of cancel out, maybe net positive. The PBM brand inflation guarantee sounds like that is tapering off and the Omnicare headwind should get better.","So when I look at the headwinds offsetting that that could be retail margin pressure, PBM margin pressure. But on balance, where do you see -- I mean, do you think around this close to $7 EPS handle now in 2019, you can go into 2020?","Larry Merlo","Yes. Ana, it's Larry and first I -- we appreciate the question. And as you were just ticking off, there are certainly a lot of moving parts as it relates to 2020. And as you heard in our prepared remarks, the point of today's discussion, in light of Investor Day that is a month away, is really to zero in on our Q1 results, our outlook for 2019.","We understand and appreciate the questions that are out there beyond 2019 and I can assure you that next month we'll share our near or long-term targets including the details on how we achieve those targets on June 4th.","Ana Gupte","Okay. Then maybe just if I can ask on the quarter and follow-up on the margins in retail. I mean, you've come now in line. You've exceeded your original guidance at least on the revenue. And then on the PBM margins, how do you see that shaping up for the industry as a whole into the selling season for the PBM? And in retail with your ability to steer Aetna into your CVS network, does that give you an edge that can offset some of the secular pressures?","Eva Boratto ","Hi, Ana. This is Eva. I'll try to break apart your questions there. Overall for both of the legacy businesses retail and PBM, our margins, our performance came in at or better than expected. And some of the headwinds that we outlined, whether it was inflation the rebate guarantees, some of the challenges with long-term care, we performed certainly within our expectation.","As we said, longer-term, as we think about the store right moving toward providing more services and greater opportunities, higher value, we see those as the opportunities to improve our margins and our performance in that business.","Ana Gupte","Great. Thanks for the question. Good luck in the quarter.","Eva Boratto ","Thanks Ana.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ricky Goldwasser","Yeah. Hi. Good morning. And congrats for a good start for the year. My question is around the cost savings that you identified $1.5 billion to $2 billion. Should we think about these as net cost savings or gross? And how should we think about the cadence to 2022? And are most of these cost savings coming from the retail segment? Or are they more broadly achievable throughout the enterprise?","Jon Roberts","So Ricky, this is Jon. So yes, this modernization effort that we're talking about is -- it's a transformative program that's comprised of initiatives including the work already underway for integration, the business unit productivity programs that we traditionally work on, and then initiatives that are enterprise-wide as our companies have come together. And we're calling that long-term value or LTV initiatives.","And there's four core pillars of this program, and I'll just give you a couple of examples. First is, we want to share simplicity and at the same time deliver cost -- substantial cost benefits, and we want to do that while improving our consumer experiences.","So within that broader effort, these enterprise initiatives take advantage of the combined company's unique capabilities and assets, while helping us accelerate our savings goals. So some examples of these opportunities include call centers, digitalization of shared services, demand management and rationalization of our IT infrastructure. So this is a multi-year effort. These are net savings numbers. And we'll talk more specifically about this at our Analyst Day on June 4th.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe from Citigroup. Your line is open.","Joe Krocheski ","Ralph.","Ralph Giacobbe","Sorry about that. Yes. Thanks for the question. You called out a favorable prior year and specifically 4Q and then provider recoveries. I was just wondering what the provider recoveries relate to the size of those and over what period of time? Thanks.","Eva Boratto","Hi, Ralph. This is Eva. In terms of the prior period development consistent with Aetna legacy practices there was no prior period development included in our guidance. Overall, we experienced favorable development across all of the core businesses as I said in the prepared remarks. And from a magnitude perspective, you can think about it as consistent year-on-year with development last year.","Was there another question Ralph? In terms of I think your question also maybe around the settlement with HCA that was taken into account in some of our initial accounting with the acquisition and is not reflected in our results.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ann Hynes from Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.","Ann Hynes","Hi. Good morning. So since last earnings I think the question I get most from investors is on the retail operating profit. Walgreens reported obviously since you reported and they had similar results. And a lot of investors ask me, if this is the new norm. So can you just talk about what you think can happen in the market or what headwinds will ease over the next couple of years to stabilize the operating profit trajectory of this business? Thanks.","Eva Boratto","Hi, Ann. It's Eva. I'll start and Kevin will jump in, in terms of longer term. As you look at our Q1 results, the headwinds are very consistent with what we described as we provided our guidance. Over half of the contraction was attributable to the tax reform investments, our long-term care as well as the incremental tax expense that we cited in this quarter. As you think about the tax reform investments those subside.","We are -- those are completed and in the run rate as we get to the back part of the year. We do expect Omnicare performance to improve as we go forward and we do expect generics to improve next year in the near term, although won't be a tailwind as you think about longer term. And we continue to see opportunities to drive services in our stores and increase products as an opportunity to mitigate the traditional headwinds.","Kevin Hourican","And Eva Kevin -- thank you. This is Kevin. I'll just build on that on the longer term. We will talk about this more on June 4. But if you think about the opportunities to improve profitability in the upcoming years think about it in a five-part plan. First is drive industry-leading comp store script growth through our clinical adherence programs and increased medication adherence in script drug. Second is cost of goods sold improvement through Red Oak Sourcing.","Third is to improve retail productivity through automation and process improvement. Fourth as we talked about briefly on the last call, a new contracting approach that aligns our incentives for reimbursement through lower overall Medicare costs and sharing those savings. And lastly, we're seeing optimistic things in our front store business through health and beauty, sales and profit growth that are drawing more customers into our store.","Eva Boratto","And I'll just wrap up with one more thing. Obviously the costs the enterprise modernization initiative that Jon spoke to will benefit all aspects of our business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Justin Lake","Thanks. Good morning. First just last quarter you gave us some color on rebate guarantees. Wanted to come back to that just in terms of I think there was a little confusion around whether -- or do rebate guarantees actually get better year-over-year? I know eventually they'll unwind and you'll renegotiate these contracts with less guarantees in them. But does it get better next year meaning positive year-over-year? Or is it just less negative year-over-year?","Derica Rice","Justin. Hi, Justin, this is Derica. What we stated was that the rebate exposure will peak in 2019 and then that exposure will begin to dissipate over the ensuing years. So we expect that exposure to get less in 2020 and 2021. And so far this year, it's pretty well within our expectations that we laid out within our guidance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Your line is open.","Steven Valiquette","Thanks. Good morning, Larry and Eva. So maybe somewhat similar to a couple of the other questions. For the PBM business, just given all the discussion around rebate minimum guarantees, cost guarantees et cetera I was kind of curious at a high level just around the Anthem customer contract. Without getting any numbers just qualitatively only does CVS already have strong visibility internally on what the profit contribution is likely to be from this contract in 2020? Or conversely, just given all of the discussion around guarantees that are baked into many contracts now, could there still be high volatility either up or down for CVS' profits from this large contract in 2020? Thanks.","Derica Rice","Hi. This is Derica again. That's a great question. We appreciate it. When we provided our color commentary regarding rebate guarantees and our exposure that included Anthem as well. So when I talked about it our exposure peaking in 2019 and then subsiding in ensuing years that factored in our Anthem contract as well.","Larry Merlo","The other thing Steve to keep in mind and I think you heard this on Anthem's call last week that the vast majority of that conversion takes place in the second half of this year to include the Medicare business converting on 1\/1\/20.","Eva Boratto","And Steve the only additional piece I'll add on that as you think about when we onboard large health plans, the margins tend to be thinner earlier in the contract period as we execute on our programs and initiatives to drive improvements in the overall margins and profitability.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Robert Jones","Great. Thanks for the questions. I guess just two quick ones, one on the PBM side. Of the $47 billion I think you guys highlighted that was up for renewal this year, how much is left to still be renewed? And then just on the Aetna side of the business I'm curious if you would just share how the performance would have compared to internal expectations, if not for the prior period development in the quarter? Thanks.","Larry Merlo","Bob, it's Larry. I'll take the first part. And Bob, we had said we have $47 billion up for renewal. We're just over halfway through the renewal season. It's pretty consistent with where we would have been at this point in time with prior years.","Eva Boratto","And in terms of Aetna overall, underlying, the business performed well, including the prior period development. It's early in the year. We -- recall, we onboard a lot of new memberships, so we're monitoring that claim activity very, very closely. But I would say on all fronts, we're pleased with Aetna's performance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glen Santangelo from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.","Glen Santangelo","Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. Larry, just wanted to shift gears a little bit and go back to the Retail\/Long-Term Care segment. Your scripts in that segment were up 5.5%, which is a little bit stronger than expected, particularly given we had a weaker-than-expected flu season. And so, I'm kind of curious if you could dive into that a little bit more and give us a sense for maybe what drove that trend.","I'm guessing it's kind of too early that it's related to the benefits from the acquisition, but anything you can give us on the sustainability of that trend and what drove that will be helpful. Thanks.","Kevin Hourican","This is Kevin. It's a good -- appreciate the question. Think about our script growth coming from three components. One is network relationships the third-party payer contracts which are contributing to growth. The second is organic growth through our clinical adherence programs. So by keeping a patient adherent to their medication therapy, it helps them on their path to better health and it drives our business. We're doing very well on those clinical programs and we see sustainability of that growth. ","And then the third piece would be new services. We've introduced some compelling new unique services like our Saving Patients Money program, multi-dose packaging and home delivery, as I spoke to earlier. And we're seeing some nice growth in those newer services that we've brought to the market.","Operator","Your next question \u2026","Larry Merlo","I was just going to say, Glen, we see those in terms of being foundational and not episodic in nature.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee from Cowen. Your line is open.","Charles Rhyee","Yeah. Thanks for taking question. Just staying with the Retail segment for a second here. One of your competitors on their call a couple of weeks ago kind of cited generic deflation or the moderating effect of generic deflation as a factor in some of their results. I haven't really heard you guys talk about that. Can you talk about sort of the -- what you're seeing in terms of moderating generic deflation? Because it looks like that trend has been continuing to moderate through March. And how are you kind of thinking about the environment here as we move forward for that?","And is that -- and I guess related to that is that already baked into your guidance when you talked about sort of you look at the 10% down with half of it being from -- partly from generics. My assumption had -- my thought had been that you would really be referring more to the prevalence of the break-open generics and not necessarily generic deflation. If you could just provide some color on that, that would be great. Thanks.","Eva Boratto","Yeah. This -- Charles, this is Eva. In terms of what we're seeing as it pertains to generics, it is all included in our guidance. And as we outlined back in February, what we're seeing is overall fewer opportunities with break-open generics this year. It is a lighter year relative to the prior years than what we've seen and we see it improving in 2020.","Jon Roberts","And then Charles, the only thing I would add is -- you've heard a lot of talk about the improvements in the FDA process that allows suppliers to more rapidly get to the market. That gives us more flexibility. And so, we are seeing less opportunity in 2019 as Eva said, but we think Red Oak continues to deliver value for us -- significant value for us and we expect that to be even better as we move forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","A.J. Rice","Hi, everybody. Thanks for the question. Obviously, the last few years one of the bright spots for Aetna was the growth in MA. And as it's come on board with you guys, Medicare Advantage enrollments accelerated. I wonder if you could just parse out a little bit how you're seeing that growth this year. Is that expanding geographies which was part of the story the last few years? Or is it market share gains?","And I know the rule of thumb on Medicare Advantage. In the first year those members typically come on at sort of a breakeven level. Is that what you're assuming? Or is there any reason to think you guys might be able to bring them on more profitably or not?","Karen Lynch","Hi, A.J. It's Karen. I would characterize our Medicare Advantage growth coming from a number of places. One, yes, our services area expansion has generated a fair amount of growth for us. But I would also say that we are continuing to grow in our existing footprint and that our same-store growth has generated good Medicare Advantage growth for us.","I would also tell you our continued excellence in Star is helping the performance of this product. And we've also been strengthening our clinical management activities, which I think has been resonating in the marketplace.","I would also look to the product and product flexibility and our zero-premium plan which has allowed us to grow this year as well. And then we have been very strongly managing our distribution channels. And I would say it's the combination of all those factors that are really driving it. Relative to the margin what I would say is, we are tracking in line with our expectations. We typically expect to see lower margins on first year business, but there's nothing in our metrics that give us any pause for any deterioration. And I would just say that we're in line with what we expected on margins.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Percher from Nephron. Your line is open.","Eric Percher","Thank you, Eric Percher and Josh Raskin from Nephron. Larry, you sound more constructive on the safe harbor proposal after the CMS guidance and the demo announcement. Obviously, there is a lot of potential unintended consequences. As we looked at your comments there was a comment toward the end around disallowing of pharmacy purchase discounts which would appear to impact you as a buyer and dispensing pharmacy. So I wanted to ask is that material in your view? And what action do you take to try to offset that if it occurs?","Larry Merlo ","Well, Eric let me make sure I'm following your question because as we have talked about rebates, we have always provided an all-in number as it relates to rebates. And so we don't see any issues there or misalignments. If I'm following your question what we have talked about is we see rebates as a form of discounting. And we can get into a lot of discussion around how that has brought the net price of pharmaceuticals down for the clients and members that we serve. And if you look at rebates as discounts what we emphasize is through the private sector there has been a lot of good things happen in that regard. And rebates can take some other form, but we must make sure that the private sector competition that results from that that drives down price that the ability to -- for that to continue in the form of some type of discounts doesn't go away.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Caliendo from UBS. Your line is open.","Kevin Caliendo","Hi. Good morning. One quick question on the prior year development. I just -- I know it wasn't contemplated in the original guidance, but in the updated guidance is there any incremental prior year development built into those numbers? That was the first one. And then the second one on the PBM side historically when we've seen companies with low retention a lot of times they've been able to offset some of the losses by dipping down into the mid-market and maybe taking some share there. Is there a similar strategy or something you can do to offset the headwinds for 2020 on the PBM side strategically?","Eva Boratto","So I'll take the first question, Kevin regarding prior period development. The only thing that is reflected in the numbers we presented today was the prior period development realized in Q1. No projections go forward consistent with our initial guide and legacy Aetna practices.","A \u2013 Larry Merlo","And Kevin, it's Larry. In terms of the second question \u2013 Kevin, while we provided an update on the selling season as it stands today obviously there's still a lot of runway remaining for the 2020 selling season. And we'll continue to provide updates. So we still have a long way to go before we complete the season.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Costa from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Peter Costa","Good morning. Question on the Health Care Benefits business and your maintained guidance on medical benefits ratio of 84%. Given the favorable prior period development, you'd think you'd be sort of on the lower end of that range at this point in time. Can you -- would you say that you're at the lower end of the range at this point? Or do you think really it's the full range that you're thinking about? And then will you not have the seasonal pattern that Aetna typically had which was a rising medical loss ratio through the year because of all the deal synergies?","Eva Boratto","Hi, Peter. It's Eva. It's early in the year, so we provided the range and we'll stick with that range. Obviously as we progress throughout the year we'll provide additional updates. There was a lot of membership growth as Karen cited which we'll continue to monitor their utilization. In terms of the progression throughout the year, as we stated we moved SilverScript over to the Health Care Benefits segment which carries a different quarterly pattern than the traditional Aetna pattern where on the SilverScript it's highest in the first quarter and reduces as you go throughout the year given the risk corridor sharing. So that's a key driver of why you see maybe a little bit of a higher-than-expected Q1 MBR.","A \u2013 Larry Merlo","I think we have time for two more questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Q \u2013 Michael Cherny","Hi, thanks for taking the question. Larry, I want to go back to a comment you made earlier regarding your recent PBM user meeting and the conversations you were having with health plans and the engagement level. I guess as they think about what you're becoming as an integrated entity now that you own Aetna, what are they looking for you, the new CVS qualitatively to provide for them? And that engagement push is there a realization or understanding of what you're doing with the store base and with the HealthHUB initial push that can help them drive potential value going forward?","A \u2013 Larry Merlo","Yes Mike. First of all we -- as part of that meeting, we did provide an update as to the work today to include the HealthHUBs. And I would say that there's a growing realization that if we describe this as consumerism in health care is here to stay. So the fact that we have these customer-facing assets is I think what is gaining a lot of interest and attention in terms of what that potentially can mean. And it reflects some of our earlier discussions, some of the points that Kevin made that as you think about -- if I just focused on the bricks-and-mortar retail store for a minute that we're beginning to see this evolution through the HealthHUBs of it's not just selling thousands of products. It's a combination of products and services that the dynamic in health care at some point, even though, we're seeing more and more health care in the palm of your hand and that's an important part of our strategy, at some point that consumer has to be touched. And we have the unique way to do that in a surround-sound way.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Hima Inguva from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Q \u2013 Hima Inguva","Thank you. Congrats on a good quarter. Eva just wanted a little bit of clarification on the pace and cadence of delevering that you expect. Maybe if you could share the timing on when you see getting to the three times leverage target and then also any color on your recent conversations with the credit rating agencies would be great. Thank you.","A \u2013 Eva Boratto","Yes. Thanks for the question, Hima. As we said consistently, our top priority is to deleveraging get to our low three times rating. We're pleased with our paying down the term loan early, $500 million we paid in Q1 and we expect to pay that full term loan down by the end of the year. And at this point, I -- we're not going to provide our longer-term leverage road map there. We'll provide that at Analyst Day.","That said, as we continue to look for opportunities to generate cash to pay down this debt and we're working on initiatives on working -- improving working capital, a full review of our portfolio as well as the cost initiatives that Jon spoke about, we believe, in addition to driving growth in our business will enable us to continue to improve our leverage.","Larry Merlo","So just wrapping up here, there were a lot of questions. We appreciate all the questions. We're trying to track to make sure we've answered everything, recognizing there were multiple pieces to questions. One of the things that I do want to clarify, I think Ricky had asked the question about the enterprise modernization, the cost reduction, were the numbers gross or net. And we want to be clear that those numbers that Eva provided were after any expenses incurred to execute that. So those were net improvement numbers. And listen obviously Joe and his team are available for follow-up. And we look forward to hopefully seeing all of you on June 4.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

Welcome to the CVS Caremark Q4 2013 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on Tuesday, February 11, 2014.","I would now like to turn the conference over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Nancy Christal. Please go ahead.","Nancy Christal","Thank you, Frank. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I am here this morning with Larry Merlo, President and CEO, who will provide a business update and Dave Denton, Executive Vice President and CFO, who will review our fourth quarter 2013 results and 2014 guidance.","Jon Roberts, President of PBM and Helena Foulkes, President of Retail Business, are also with us today and they will participate in the question-and-answer session following our prepared remarks. During the Q&A, please limit yourself to no more than one question with a quick follow-up so we can provide more callers with the chance to ask their questions.","Please note that just before this call, we posted a slide presentation on our website that summarizes the information you will hear today as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance. Additionally, please note that we filed our Annual Report on Form 10-K this morning and is currently available on our website.","During this call, we will use some non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company's performance including free cash flow and adjusted EPS. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find the definitions of these non-GAAP items as well as reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of our website.","As always, today's call is being simulcast on our website and it will be archived there following the call for one year.","Now before we continue, let me to read the safe harbor statement.

We strongly recommend that you become familiar with the specific risks and uncertainties that are described in the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K.","Now, I will turn this over to Larry Merlo.","Larry Merlo","Okay. Thank you, Nancy and good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us today. I am very pleased with our fourth quarter results with adjusted earnings per share coming in at the high end of our guidance at $1.12 per share, capping off a terrific year. For full year '13, we delivered strong growth in revenues, gross margin, operating margin and earnings across the CVS Caremark enterprise. Excluding one-time benefits, in both 2012 and '13, adjusted earnings per share increased nearly 16% with PBM operating profit increasing nearly 15% year-over-year and retail operating profit growing 10% and Dave will discuss our financial results and guidance in greater detail during his financial review.","So with that, let me provide a brief business update highlighting our progress since we met at analyst day in December. As you know, last week we announced our decision to exit the tobacco category, a category which we believe is inconsistent with our growing role in the changing healthcare marketplace. Simply put, this was the right decision at the right time. There is a far greater focus emerging on health outcomes, managing chronic disease and reducing costs. And exiting the tobacco category more closely aligns us with the goals of patients, clients and providers positioning our company for future growth. It is also important to recognize that we are doing this from a position of strength.","The response to-date has been overwhelmingly positive across an array of key constituents including customers, clients, both current and prospective, [benefit] [ph] consultants, legislators and policymakers and public health and Medicaid officials, all of whom see the health benefit, as well as the role that pharmacy can play in advancing smoking cessation and better managing chronic disease. Again this decision puts us full alignment with the goals of not just our clients and patients, but others across the healthcare delivery chain to include physician practices and hospital systems. Since our announcement we are already hearing increasing dialogue about the concept of quality or outcomes based pharmacy networks and as we move forward, we believe quality and outcomes will be important measures of success in the rapidly evolving healthcare marketplace.","Now one of the questions that frequently has been asked over the past week is, what about the other products we sell? Well, let us be clear. You cannot compare a bar of chocolate or a bag of chips to a pack of cigarettes. Those products used in moderation will not harm one's health. The same cannot be said about tobacco. There is no amount of tobacco use that\u2019s considered safe. As we stated last week, the decision to exit the tobacco category does not affect our 2014 segment operating profit guidance, our '14 earnings per share guidance or our five-year financial targets provided at Analyst Day. Our business is strong and we have near-term offsets to the profitability impact of this change. We strongly believe this decision will further strengthen our position as a healthcare leader, further differentiate us from competitors and better position the company for growth going forward, and Dave will touch further on the financial implications during his financial review.","Now, let me turn to some early observations about the impact of the Affordable Care Act. While we all know enrollment on the public healthcare exchanges was slow and be bumpy at the outset, all signs point to improvements in the enrollment process and increasing awareness among eligible consumers.","The latest data now shows 3 million exchange enrollees, but it's still pretty early to say definitively what the impact from the public exchanges will be in the short-term. With regard to Medicaid expansions, there are positive signs that enrollment is increasing.","In January, HHS reported that December Medicaid determinations were up 73% over a three-month baseline period in states expanding Medicaid, obviously a positive indicator. Now, although it remains to be seen how many people ultimately gain coverage this year, we are encouraged by the recent progress and we believe CVS Caremark is well positioned to serve these new customers across our enterprise assets.","Furthermore, we are well-positioned as an enterprise to support our health plan partners. We offer a variety of capabilities that help them engage, educate, enroll and manage the care of individuals in exchange products. Our strong relationships with health plans have allowed MinuteClinic to be broadly included in exchange products and for CVS Pharmacy to be part of many limited and preferred pharmacy network relationships across the country.","Overall, we are happy with the progress that we are seeing and we continue to expect a modest net positive benefit from health reform this year. ","I also wanted to touch briefly on our recently announced 10-year agreement with Cardinal Health to form the largest generic sourcing and entity here in the U.S., the world's largest generic drug markets.","We are bringing together two of the most knowledgeable and experienced generic sourcing teams in the world, teams with a track record of working collaboratively to drive results. The structure will be simple and it's designed to be flexible to marketplace changes and easy to do business with through centralized decision-making.","With our combined volume and capabilities, this venture will help spur innovative purchasing strategies with generic manufacturers that create value while enhancing supply chain efficiencies. As we stated previously, we are excited about this venture, our teams are already hard at work with the goal of the operational by July of this year.","Moving on to an update on the PBM business, since Analyst Day in December, our results for the '14 selling season did not materially changed. With nearly 90% of our renewals complete, client net new business totals $2.4 billion, with our retention rate at 96%. Remember that this net new business excludes the impact from attrition in our Med-D PDP business.","As Jon referenced at Analyst Day, we lost $1.3 billion in '14 revenues related to last year's CMS sanction, and as you are also aware, we are pleased that CMS lifted the sanction at the end of December. Now that we are out of sanction, we are once again able to enroll new choosers who are [agent] of the program, which is expected to help offset any ongoing natural attrition. Then later this spring, we look forward to also enrolling low-income subsidy auto assignees as defined by the CMS process.","We currently have about 3 million lives in our PDP, and we see significant opportunity to grow the business over the long-term. With the changes that we have made to strengthen the Med-D management team along with the remediation steps we have taken, we believe that our long-term growth goals in the Med-D space are very achievable.","As for the 2015 selling season, still too early in the season for a substantive update, but I can tell you that the marketplace is active and we are very well-positioned to both, retain business and gain share with our unique suite of capabilities and strong service record.","Now, as you know we currently provide retail, mail and specialty PBM services to the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program, many refer to it as FEP and those contracts are up for renewal for 2015. At this point in the process, there is nothing to report, in regard to these contracts other than to note that we are very happy with our FEP relationship as well as the service and value we are providing to FEP and their members and we expect to know the results of the RFP process sometime during the first half of this year.","Let me update you on our progress related to our long-term strategic agreement with Aetna. The migration of Aetna's commercial business to the CVS Caremark platform has been completed and we have been working with the Aetna sales team to ensure that their clients now have access to CVS Caremark's differentiated offerings. Programs such as Maintenance Choice and Pharmacy Advisor are currently being offered to their clients to help them save money while improving member health and our joint efforts have been successful to date. In addition, we also working with Aetna to implement and administer their exchange offerings and other government programs resulting from the Affordable Care Act.","Turning to our Specialty business. Growth remain strong in the fourth quarter as revenues were up approximately 22% year-over-year. The growth was driven by drug price inflation, utilization, new product launches and new clients. As we noted at Analyst Day, we expect to see significant growth in the specialty pharmacy space and we are well positioned to capitalize on this opportunity.","Last month, we completed the acquisition of Coram, a market leader in specialty infusion services and enteral nutrition. This provides us with a new set of capabilities to manage not just the cost of infused drugs but also to reduce the length of hospital stays and to help patients move from higher cost sites of service like hospital outpatient centers to more cost-effective locations such as the patient's home or a physician's office. No other organization brings the range of specialty assets, the depth of experience or the integration of care that the combination of CVS Caremark and Coram is now able to deliver.","In addition, our new Specialty Connect offering remains on schedule for its 2014 roll out. The specialty offering, think of it as being analogous to our Maintenance Choice program for traditional maintenance medications. Specialty Connect integrates our mail and retail capabilities, providing both choice and convenience for members while preserving the central clinical expertise that leads to better health outcomes. We are looking forward to having this fully implemented this year and are excited by its prospects.","Finally the acquisition of Novologix last year has provided us with an unmatched claims editing technology. Through Novologix, plans can manage drugs paid under their medical benefit with the same level of precision that is routinely expected for PBMs leading to significant cost savings for the plans. We are now reviewing thousands of claims daily for our largest Novologix client using this unique technology and we expect to be able to assist many more clients as we work towards a broader roll out.","So I think you can see why we are very excited about all the ways we are raising the bar in specialty as we develop innovative offerings that capitalize on our unique ability to optimize cost, quality and access in the specialty pharmacy arena","Now moving onto the retail business, we had another solid quarter. Total same-store sales increased 4%, while pharmacy same-store sales increased 6.8%. Our Q4 volumes were muted given a slow start to the flu season compared to strength in the prior year with flu related scripts down nearly 10% year-over-year. In Q4, pharmacy same-store sales were also negatively impacted by about 230 basis points due to recent generic introductions and that is a 90 basis decline from the impact we saw in Q3. Our pharmacy same-store scripts increased 3.8% on a 30 day equivalent basis and the growth in our Maintenance Choice program continues to result in a greater than historical rate of conversion from 30 to 90 day scripts.","Now, as you know, our goal this past year, 2013, was to retain at least 60% of the scripts we gained during the impasse between Walgreens and Express Scripts. I am pleased to report that we exited '13 with the retention rate ahead of our expectations.","Our numbers have held steady now for several quarters and we expect no further loss as a result of the impasses resolution. Given that these scripts are now part of our base business, there will be no need to provide updates going forward.","As for the front store business, comps decreased 1.9%, reflecting a decline in traffic partially offset by an increase in basket size. Recall that we are comping against a very strong cough and cold season we experienced in December of 2012, and our cough and cold business was down about 5% in the quarter.","As far as the seasonal business goes, we had a very good Halloween season, while Christmas was roughly flat to last year. Keep in mind that we have one less shopping week between Thanksgiving and Christmas. On a two-year stack basis, our front store comps were 2%, notably better than the 1.1% two-year stack front store comp performance we saw in Q3.","Our front store margins were up slightly this quarter, and with our ExtraCare loyalty card, we continue to drive engagement among our members through personalized value across all channels. As you have heard us say many times with 15 years of testing, refining and fine-tuning, we are better able to optimize our promotions and drive profitable sales.","Overall, roughly 85% of our front store sales and 70% of our front store transactions use ExtraCare. Today, despite almost universal availability of loyalty programs, customers continue to rate our program, substantially above the rest and have significantly higher engagement levels.","Now, one of the many ways we offer value to our customers while driving profitable sales is, by using ExtraCare to drive traffic usage of our store brands. For the 13 years store brands represented about 17.8% of our front store sales and our goal to move that to more than 20% over the next few years, with opportunities identified across the number of categories. Customer acceptance continues to grow and our store brand quality has never been better and we continue to innovate to meet our customers' evolving needs.","Turning to our new store program, we opened 77 new or relocated stores, we closed to during the fourth quarter, resulting in 58 net new stores in the quarter. For the year, we opened 247 new or relocated stores, closed 13, resulting in 156 net new stores and that equates to 2.4% square footage growth.","Let me briefly touch on MinuteClinic, which delivered more than 10% growth in revenues this quarter, despite the tough comparisons with the strong flu season in 2012. We opened 74 net new clinics in the quarter, including clinics in new states and markets such as New Hampshire and the San Francisco, San Jose Bay Area.","We reached a milestone, ending the year with 800 clinics across 28 states in the District of Columbia. As our President of MinuteClinic, Andy Sussman noted on Analyst Day, we plan to open at least 150 new clinics this year and our long-term goal is to create a national platform that supports primary care by providing integrated, high-quality care that is convenient, accessible and affordable.","Now those of you, who attended our Analyst Day, probably remember Andy's video that highlighted our new telehealth at MinuteClinic pilot programs. I am happy to note that we have now launched 28 sites in L.A., San Diego and Orange County, California. Our California nurse practitioners are now providing patient care remotely through sophisticated video technology and audio equipment, with licensed vocational nurses assisting patients and we plan to expand this exciting pilot to a second state later this year and we look forward to the results.","With that, let me turn it over to Dave for the financial review.","David Denton","Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone. Today, I will provide a detailed review of our 2013 fourth quarter results and review our 2014 guidance. As I typically do on these calls, I want to begin with a wrap-up of last year's capital allocation program and how we have been using our strong free cash flow to return value to our shareholders.","In the fourth quarter, we completed the accelerated share repurchase program that we began in October, and repurchased approximately 26.6 million shares for $1.7 billion. So for all of 2013, we repurchased approximately 66 million shares for $4 billion, averaging just over $60 a share. We have $693 million remaining on our 2012 share repurchase authorization in addition to the $6 billion our Board authorized in December of last year. Additionally we paid $268 million in dividends in the quarter, bringing our total for the year to $1.1 billion. We finished the year with a payout ratio of 23.9% and our strong earnings outlook this year combined with the 22% increase in the dividend we announced at Analyst Day, puts us on track to achieve our targeted payout ratio of 25% at some point during 2014 more than a year ahead of our schedule.","So between dividends and share repurchases, we returned approximately $5.1 billion to our shareholders throughout 2013. Our expectation is that we returned more than $5 billion to our shareholders again in 2014 through a combination of dividends as well as share repurchases. We generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow during the fourth quarter and approximately $4.4 billion for all of '13, down $771 million from 2012 levels. The decrease in 2013 was driven by the increase in accounts receivable due to the timing of payments from CMS in connection with our Medicare Part D business partially offset by improved inventory management as well strong earnings growth. We had mentioned on our last call that 2013 free cash flow might fall short of our expectations, and in fact, we did in the year short of our goal. This was driven by the timing of certain cash receipts being delayed from late 2013 in to early 2014. And as a result of this timing shift, we are raising our 2014 free cash flow guidance by $400 million to a range of $5.5 billion to $5.8 billion.","Aside from these timing items within receivables, we made great strides in improving our cash cycle through better management of payables and inventory, especially within the retail segment. Our retail cash cycle improved by nearly a day and a half in 2013 and we remain committed to further improvements as we move forward. For the year, our net capital expenditures were $1.4 billion. This included $2 billion of gross CapEx offset by $600 million in sale leaseback proceeds. This level of CapEx was more or less in line with prior year spending levels.","As for the income statement, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations came in at $1.12 per share, at the high-end of our guidance. GAAP diluted EPS was $1.05 per share. The quarter was somewhat atypical as you know, largely due to the timing of Med D profits, as well as the timing of break-open generics relative to 2012, while our operating segments each performed near or above the high-end of expectations.","Now let me quickly walk down the P&L. On a consolidated basis, revenues in the fourth quarter increased 4.6% to $32.8 billion. In the PBM segment, net revenues increased 5.2% to $19.6 billion. This growth was attributable to drug price inflation particularly in our specialty business as well as new specialty clients and products. Partially offsetting this growth was an increase in our generic dispensing rate which grew 110 basis points versus the same quarter of LY to 81.1%. ","In our retail business, revenues increased 5.6% in the quarter to $17.2 billion driven primarily by strong pharmacy same-store sales growth.","As far as gross margin, we reported 19.3% for the consolidated company in the quarter, a contraction of approximately 75 basis points compared to Q4 of '12. Within the PBM segment, gross margin declined 100 basis points, again versus Q4 of '12 to 6.2%, while gross profit dollars decreased 9.2% year-over-year. The decline in profit dollars was primarily attributable to the shift of Med D profitability from Q4 into Q3 as expected, and previously discussed. Also contributing to the gross profit dollar decline were fewer claims in Medicare Part D, due to the loss of lives. Partially offsetting these drivers was the improvement in GDR.","Gross margin in the Retail segment was 30.7%, down approximately 55 basis points over last year. This decline was largely driven by continued pressure on reimbursement rates, partially offset by the 110-basis point increase in retail GDR to 81%. Additionally, our private-label sales increased 50 basis points as a percent of front store volume to 18.6% in the quarter.","Total operating expenses as a percent of revenues moderately improved from Q4 of '12 to 12.6%. The PBM segment SGA rate was essentially flat at 1.6%, while SGA as a percent of sales in the Retail segment improved approximately 55 basis points to 21%. Within the Corporate segment expenses were up approximately $16 million to $198 million. Our continuing efforts with respect to cost control, once again allowed us to deliver very good results across the enterprise.","Operating margin for the total enterprise declined approximately 60 basis points to 6.8%. Operating margin in PBMs declined approximately 95 basis points to 4.6%, while operating margin at Retail, was essentially flat at 9.7%.","For the quarter, we exceeded our estimates for operating profit growth in both, the retail and PBM segments. Retail operating profit increased to solid 5.8%, exceeding expectations by approximately 135 basis points, reflecting better generic performance. PBM operating profit declined 13%, some-200 basis points better than our guidance range. The PBM benefited from favorable purchasing economics and better than expected specialty growth.","Going below the line on the consolidated income statement, net interest expense in the quarter decreased approximately $25 million from last year to $135 million, due primarily to lower average interest rates. Additionally, our effective tax rate was 39.2%. Our weighted average share count was 1.2 billion shares, only slightly higher than anticipated.","Before turning to guidance, I want to call your attention to an immaterial accounting correction that was disclosed in our filings today. It relates to how we recognize revenue in the retail segment and it had a minor impact on the prior period financial statements. Historically, we have recognized revenue from the sale of prescription drugs in our pharmacies at the time the prescription was billed as opposed to when the prescription was picked up by the customer as required by GAAP. For substantially all prescriptions, the bill day and the pick-up date occur in the same reporting period and the effect on both, revenue and income from recording prescriptions upon bill as opposed to delivery is immaterial.","During the fourth quarter of '13, we began recognizing revenue when the script is picked up by the customer. This immaterial correction is reflected retrospectively in the historical financial statements that are presented in the Form 10-K that we filed this morning, so you can find all the details there.","Now, let me switch gears and update you on our guidance. You can find all the details in the slide presentation that we posted this morning on our website, on our focus on our highlights here.","I want start with the first quarter as we are revising our EPS ranges upward to reflect the stronger quarter in the Retail segment than we previously anticipated. We now expect consolidated revenues to increase 4.25% to 5.50% in the first quarter. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.03 per share to $1.06 per share in GAAP diluted EPS of $0.97 to $1 per share. This is $0.07 higher than our previous guidance and equates to adjusted EPS growth of 24.25% to 28.25%.","Now about half of the $0.07 upward revision is simply a profit timing adjustment versus our original plan. Additionally, strong underlying trends in our Retail Pharmacy business are continuing into our 2014 outlook, especially as it relates to generic performance. The ongoing strength in our core Retail Pharmacy business will help offset the loss from our decision to exit the tobacco category, which I will talk more about in just a moment. As a result, while we are maintaining our retail revenue growth guidance of 3% to 4.5% for the first quarter, we are increasing our operating profit growth guidance to 14.5% to 16.5%. Our first-quarter guidance for the PBM segment remains unchanged with operating profit growth of 21.25% to 28.25%.","As you know, last week we announced our planed exit from the tobacco category. On a 12 month basis, we estimate that we will lose $2 billion in revenues, about $1.5 billion directly from tobacco sales and other $0.5 billion from the rest of that shoppers' basket. That equates to approximately $0.17 per share on an annual basis. Given the expected timing for implementing this change, it will cost $0.06 to $0.09 per share in 2014, almost entirely at the back half of the year impact.","Now let me switch gears and speak about our full year outlook. For the full year, including the impact from exiting the tobacco category, we are able to maintain the company's previous earnings and segment operating profit guidance. This is due to the strength of our core business trends noted earlier, as well as other profit enhancing initiatives which we expect to offset the $.06 to $.09 shortfall. Within retail, we are lowering our 2014 topline expectations to reflect the elimination of the tobacco category throughout the year. For the year, we now expect retail revenue growth of between 0.75% and 2%, a reduction of approximately 125 basis points related to tobacco and comp growth is now expected to be down 0.25% to up 1%. Comp script growth remains unchanged.","As we exit the tobacco category, we will break out the impact to our reported comps on a quarterly basis until we cycle through this change so you can see our underlying performance. We continue to expect retail operating profit growth for the year of 7% to 8.75%. PBM guidance remains unchanged and I will point out that with a strong topline finish in 2013, the jump-off point has moved up. So maintaining revenue growth guidance of 7.25% to 8.5% means that the dollar range actually shifted up by about $275 million. PBM operating profit is expected to be up 6.75% to 10.75%.","Given the topline changes I just noted, we expect full year consolidated net revenue growth of 4.25% to 5.5%. We have fine-tuned the yearly guidance for revenue eliminations and now expect the percent of segment sales eliminated to be approximately 10.6%. We also continue to expect consolidated operating profit margins to expand 15 to 25 basis points. We still expect adjusted EPS to be between $4.36 and $4.50 a share. This reflects strong year-over-year growth of 10.25% to 13.75% if you exclude the impact of the legal settlement from the third quarter of '13. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $4.09 to $4.23 per share. We remain confident with these ranges despite our decision to exit the tobacco category by October 1, and we remain committed to utilizing our strong free cash flow performance to enhance shareholder value.","And with that, I will turn it back over to Larry.","Larry Merlo","Okay. Thanks, Dave. As you have heard this morning we had a strong finish to 2013 and we are having a strong start to the New Year and I just want to acknowledge and applaud the efforts and hard work of our more than 200,000 colleagues who were responsible for that.","So with that said, let's open it up your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","Larry, quick question on tobacco. It's pretty easy to quantify the negative part of this. As you guys made this decision, how you tried to get your arms around the positive piece i.e. share that Caremark or retail might pick up because of the stand you took. Were you able to do that - I mean, you are not going to say it publicly, but were you able to get your arms around what that share benefit could be?","Larry Merlo","John, good morning. Thanks for the question. John, I think as you heard us talk last week and we reiterated it this morning this decision is about CVS Caremark playing a growing role in our healthcare system, so if you go back to Analyst Day, we talked a lot about our strategy to gain share of a growing pie, and we believe that this decision positions us to do that as we move forward recognizing that.","You think about the retail customer, you think about whether it's the client, be it the employer, health plan, but there's also a new customer emerging, okay, provider groups and hospitals, and I think that the decision that we made to acquire Coram, I think puts an exclamation point on that in terms of the role that we will play with hospitals in terms of delivering care.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","Okay. Then I guess just as a follow up on your first quarter guidance, so the retail business performing at a much better rate than what you had talked about in December, so a lot of that is generic, so it sounds like retail gross margin right, substantially better than you would have thought, but you also mentioned timing issues being half of the benefit. Where is the timing coming from?","David Denton","John, this is Dave. I think as I said in my prepared remarks, about half of the raise of the $0.07 is essentially a shift, if you will, or a cadence shift, if you will, around the quarters from our profit plan. Quite frankly, as we exited 2013 and we reassessed our forecasts for the balance of the year, some of the profits that we thought were going to happen later in the year actually kind of happened a little sooner, so we just kind of readjusted our plan, so you would expect half of that is just a shift, the other half is kind of underlying strength in our business, driven primarily by I will say generics within our business.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research. Please proceed.","Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research","Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to understand a little bit, I think, Dave, you said you raised the first quarter by about $0.07, we have a $0.06 to $0.09 headwind from tobacco, but it seems you are being pretty conservative with your full year outlook given the strength in the first quarter.","The strength in the first quarter is something you think is going to end? I was just trying to understand a little bit, why you are looking to take a little bit more conservative view on the full year.","David Denton","Scott, this is Dave. Here we are in February 11, you know, we got a lot of time ahead of us. I think as we said our core businesses are performing nicely, we continue to manage the business kind of at a very detailed levels that deliver both, top line and bottom line results and this is our best estimate for the balance of the year and we will see how it plays out.","Clearly, we do have a headwind from tobacco and we are working to manage that offset. I think the teams rallied around [just tried] [ph] to get that done and we are working against that.","Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research","Okay. Then I had one, it's a little bit more strategic. In your new flagship store in Columbus Circle, with your kind of updated format and just understanding strategically, with Helena there, and where you see maybe the re-models going where you see retail going, one thing that talked about you taking tobacco off maybe something else is going to go there, so I just want to more strategically understand the plans for the Retail segment and try to get those comps back positive. It seems like there is an enormous amount of opportunity there.","Larry Merlo","Yes, Scott. It's Larry, I will start and then Helena can jump in with her thoughts as well. Obviously, when you look at that 8 to 12 feet that tobacco commands today, okay, there will be something replacing that space. To be clear, it's not going to make up $2 billion in revenues, but it will be something and there are some things that are being tested as we speak and we will make a decision on that over the next several weeks, but I will turn it over to Helena and she can share her thoughts, especially with her being new in her role.","Helena Foulkes","Okay. Thanks, Scott. I guess, just stepping back a little bit. I have been in the role for about six weeks. I think in general what I am seeing is, as you heard today, the business is fundamentally strong and our focus is on executing and accelerating growth for the future. We are certainly focused on building on our foundation of pharmacy strengths and there focus even more on differentiating our service where we can leverage our enterprise asset. We are seeing this tobacco decision as an opportunity to connect even more with consumers, as an expert in health and beauty and to build our loyalty with them. And as we focus, specifically on the front store, it's really around driving what we call, smart growth, and I think there it has three elements. The first is taking ExtraCare to the next level. The second is focusing on our core strength in health and beauty. And the third is driving our store brand penetration.","Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research","All right. Perfect. Thanks for taking my question. I really appreciate it, guys.","Larry Merlo","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Frank Morgan from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets","Good morning. I appreciate your comments, Larry, about the near-term offset that are available for you out there, but I was just hoping that you might be able to prioritize the offset, things like the new generic joint venture, the Coram, the SilverScript, the accelerated buybacks, how would you prioritize the order of those in terms of their ability to offset this and actually still offer offset and an upside rather than just filling the hole from the tobacco?","David Denton","Frank, this is Dave. Maybe I will start with that. I think first and foremost, as you can see, is our underlying business is performing, at the moment, at a very solid level. I think without going into a series of programs that we have in place because there is not one silver bullet around the offset here as we are working across multiple levels to either manage sales, margins and expense to, I will say, fill the hole that from a profit perspective, that has been generated from the reduction of tobacco sales. I will tell you that we are not using share repurchase to offset that. We are trying to fill the hole at the operating profit line. We are not using share repurchase to fill the hole from an EPS perspective. So we are focused on the operating profit line from that perspective, Frank.","Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Thanks. One, in a different direction, just on NovoLogix. Is this a incremental revenue opportunity for you or is this just a value-added service that you are making available to your existing clients? And if it is a revenue opportunity, can you talk a little bit about what the potential is there? Thanks.","Jon Roberts","Frank, this is Jon. So I think you should think of NovoLogix as being a value-added capability that enables us to help plans manage their specialty spend on the medical side and we believe that this capability will lead to our growth in specialty fulfillment of drugs that are billed under the medical benefit. So we think it is synergistic to our overall specialty strategy.","Larry Merlo","So, Frank, I describe it as an enabler that allows us to win more business in the marketplace.","Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Thank you.","Larry Merlo","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Larsen with Leerink Partners. Please proceed.","David Larsen - Leerink Partners","Hi, guys. Congratulations on a good quarter. Can you just give us your latest thoughts on exchange based plans and the profitability around those scripts? Are you actually seeing any volumes and any thoughts there? Thanks.","Larry Merlo","David, I will start and I think the others will jump in here. It's very early and I think as we had discussed, I think a few months ago is this question came up, we see the probability similar to our health plan business and recognizing that we are different than the health plan business of the past. We believe there will be an opportunity going forward to introduce many more of the cost management tools that had been widely accepted in the employer space but not as accepted in the health plan space. We see that tide beginning to turn.","David Larsen - Leerink Partners","Okay. Great. Just one more, I think on the retail side, 6.8% same store pharmacy growth, that looks very good. I think that was the best growth rate in six quarters. What drove that?","Larry Merlo","Dave, I don't know that there was any single item that drove that. It was disproportionate to other quarters. I think it reflects the ongoing growth in our Maintenance Choice product and the adoption of that and nothing out of the ordinary.","David Larsen - Leerink Partners","Great. Okay. Thanks a lot.","Larry Merlo","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan","Thanks very much. Good morning. Larry, you made a comment earlier, where you talked about outcome-based pharmacy networks. Can you help me to understand how that will work? Is that going to be more of a risk a risk-based relationship? Is there an opportunity for outside for incremental profit based on keeping the patient adherent to the drug? How should we think about that?","Larry Merlo","Yes. Lisa, it's a great question and one that we have given a lot of thought to in making the decision about tobacco products. I will give you two examples of where we think that the decision will make a difference. If you look at ACOs and physician practice groups today, they are increasingly focused on outcomes, because more and more of it is being linked to their reimbursement rates and a key areas that ACOs are focused on, is the role that tobacco place in exacerbating a lot of chronic conditions that are driving cost up in the healthcare systems, so many of these ACOs have developed number of metrics to track this. The results their programs take aim at smoking cessation, again, the use of these products as part of their part of their reimbursement models.","If you think about all the different ways that we serve, millions of customers each and every day through our retail pharmacies, our MinuteClinics, our patients and pharmacy counseling through Caremark channels and we see our decision more fully aligning with your outcomes-based reimbursement models [taking] and you and we think that we will become the pharmacy of choice for these entities and physicians.","I think another example was what I had alluded to earlier in one of the early questions about the role that hospitals play and the fact that with the Coram asset now, that creates a different dialogue with the hospitals and their physicians.","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan","Then, Larry, you know it's only been a week since you made the announcement. Obviously, I applaud you for making this decision as a healthcare provider. Can you talk about hasn't been any change in the last week as far as patients recognizing this, customers recognizing this? I know you said you have had good feedback from whether it's your customer or benefit consultants etcetera, but have you actually seen any increase in volume on the pharmacy side from this or it just too early to tell?","Larry Merlo","No. Lisa, I think it's way too early to tell. I mean, obviously, you know the news was well-publicized across the country in a variety of channels and a variety of stakeholders weighing in support of that decision. Everything that we have at this point is really anecdotal. We have heard from our store teams and our field teams across our Retail and PBMs businesses. Again, all positive, so we will see how that plays out going forward.","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan","Okay. Thank you.","Larry Merlo","Thanks, Lisa.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs","Thanks for the question. Just wanted to follow-up on specialty, you mentioned the clients in specialty helping drive sales in the quarter. I was wondering if you could share any more details on where you are winning in specialty space? Then I guess, can you give us any sense of your expectations for special Specialty Connect, and how that could increase penetration of PBM?","Jon Roberts","This is Jon. What's interesting is, we are moving with the selling season and we are off to a pretty strong start. We are actually seeing an increase in standalone specialty RFPs and we think we are extremely well positioned (Inaudible).","As we think about the strength of specialty, I think it's not any single capability, but it's our suite of capabilities that are leading to our growth in the segment. As we also think about the rollout of Specialty Connect, which is now underway, you see a lot of patients actually walking into retail stores today that end up getting turned away in the 20%, 25% of specialty prescriptions that start in a retail store. We will now have the ability to take care of those customers and fill those descriptions by connecting our specialty backend and the clinical capability with our retail asset. It is interesting, customers with Specialty Connect have an option to have their prescription mailed to their home or office or mailed to their local CVS and pick it up in the CVS. We see very similar to Maintenance Choice about half the customers want it sent to their local CVS where they pick it up and the other half want it sent to their home or office. So we are very bullish on this opportunity. It is differentiating in the marketplace. It is resonating with clients and it is resonating with patients.","Larry Merlo","Hi, Bob, it's Larry. Just to tag on with one other point. It goes back to something that we had talked about at Analyst Day and the fact that clients are seeing high double-digit growth in specialty, okay. Their appetite to do something different is much different today than it was in the past. Recognizing that the patients that are on a specialty med, they are dealing with some complex issues, but the fact that these costs are growing, 17%, 18%, 19%, people are more willing to entertain programs that can bend the cost curve than they have in the past. To Jon's point, and in our prepared remarks, we feel that we are very well positioned to serve the client needs in a variety of ways.","Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs","I think that all makes sense. Just to follow-up on the selling season, and I know it's really early but any anecdotal things you can share with us as part of what clients are asking for, is there anything that\u2019s resonating more this year, whether it be restrictive formularies in our networks and then I guess just generally how would you characterize the pricing so far as you go through renewals early in the RPF cycles?","Jon Roberts","So, Robert, this is Jon. I will take that and it is interesting that our client, Coram, that we had in the fall of last year, I asked, and these were larger floor clients, what was their number one priority as far as us helping them to manage their drug spend and it was unanimous that specialty is their top priority. They are looking for help to manage those escalating cost that Larry referred to. Our capabilities now enable us not to just manage specialty under the pharmacy benefit but we have expanded our capabilities to manage under the medical benefit. So I think that\u2019s what's different as we move into this selling season. People are very focused on specialty and the capabilities. I would characterize the selling season as off to a strong start. We are seeing activity early on from health plans and governments, state governments or government entities. We expect the employer activity to be strong, and if you remember, this past selling season, we saw our peak activity was down slightly. It appears to be returning to a more normalized level. As far as the pricing environment, I would say, it is very consistent with what we talked about over the last several years. It's very competitive but it continues to be the rational. We think we are well positioned with our size and scale and capabilities and differentiated products to be very successful in the marketplace.","Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thanks so much.","Jon Roberts","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee from Cowen and Company. Please proceed.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company","Thanks, I wanted to ask a follow-up on a question on specialty. As we think about the market where you are starting to have, particularly in the biotech space, the introduction of oral medications and particularly as I am thinking about HepC here, can you talk about how that is being dispensed through Caremark and also in the retail channel and how do you envision this as you think about other medications that are coming out, sort of these high cost drugs that are no longer injectable? How are you treating this? Do you see this as a big opportunity in the retail space for you? And then how do you push that with payors as well? Thanks.","Jon Roberts","Yes, Charles, this is Jon again. There has been some new oral drugs that have been introduced in the HepC space. Sovaldi and Olysio are two examples. If you look at the treatment, the cost to treat these patients, either over a 12-week or 24-week period, it is somewhere between $80,000 and $90,000 and up to north of $100,000. So these are very expensive drugs that still require big investments in inventory, clinical expertise to follow-up, we need to make sure these patients on these very expensive therapies actually take the medications over the course, so that investment actually results in a favorable outcome.","Our approach is, these are specialty drugs for HepC. We do have the capability to, with Specialty Connect to service these patients in our retail stores, so even though the route of administration may move from injectable world, we don't see significant shifts in how these specialty drugs are going to be handled.","With HepC specifically the current drugs, obviously are combined with drugs like interferon that require special handling and our injectable, so that's an example of why we think it will continue to be treat as a special disease.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company","That's helpful, and as a follow-up, are you seeing any sort of pushback from payors at this point around - given the cost?","Larry Merlo","Well, I mean, I talked about how\u2026","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company","Patient population is big.","Larry Merlo","I talked about from a cost perspective, these high cost drugs and therapies are clients' top priority, so when clients start on these therapies, they are very interested in making sure that patients are appropriately managed and that they complete those therapies and HepC is a great example of that, that's why the special handling and capabilities we have in specialty serve the needs of our clients with these very expense treatments.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line Tom Gallucci from FBR. Please proceed.","Tom Gallucci - FBR","Good morning. Thank you for all the details. A couple follow-ups. Dave, on the generic strength in the retail business, just curious what sort of the underlying drivers are there? You are thinking it's a stronger volume or better purchasing and I guess where I am going with it is, does any of this sort of leak over benefit to PBM side of the business as well?","David Denton","Tom, this is Dave. Good question. I think as you know, we work hard and focus a lot of energy on managing the generic profitability is very important to us and there is a lot of efforts underway to do that. I would say there is a combination of not just one thing that's improving our performance here. It's a combination of many things, and you touched up on a little bit.","One is, we are clearly continue to drive generic utilization. You are shifting branded drugs generic equivalents and actually just even where we have a generic brand or generic product available actually GDR even further there. We are always very focused on figuring out how to lower the cost of goods sold in those generic products and our procurement efforts are focused against that.","I think the later in the years as we have our joint venture up and running, but we are not really thinking about that at this point in time. Then average on time and finally, kind of establishing, I will say, win-win arrangements between payors and ourselves to figure out how we reduce both, pharmacy costs and lower overall healthcare costs by driving utilization in generics, so all three of those components are playing important roles. We think about it.","I would say the very short-term a lot of, say, the outperformance in generics are happening in generics is more likely dispensed in a retail locations as opposed to the mail locations, so that at the moment the profitability beat is being funneled more into the retail dispensed channels.","Tom Gallucci - FBR","Yes. That's great. Thanks, Dave. The other question I had, Larry, I know you touched on a little bit more, your earlier remarks around outcome-based pharmacy networks. I guess, some of the idea behind the Caremark CVS integration was adding this value to the payor Pharmacy Advisor whatnot, do you see yourselves as retailers contracting as sort of the preferred provider on a value-based sort of basis anytime soon? What sort of metrics do you think would be included in contracts like that?","Larry Merlo","Tom, that's another great question and the answer to that, is yes. Tom, I think that there are a variety of metrics that could be included in that from something as simple as dispensing the low-cost therapy whenever possible largely generic to keeping people adherent on their medication something we have talked a lot about and you could define that by we have talked about that at Analyst Day, you can define that by a medication possession ratio, so, yes, I think that that\u2019s the direction that pharmacy needs to go and we are certainly prepared to move on that.","Tom Gallucci - FBR","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Magee from SunTrust. Please proceed.","David Magee - SunTrust","Hi, good morning. First question, on the generic side, as you look at the conversions playing at the balance of the year, it has a timing with regard to that and the benefit, does that change in your thinking?","David Denton","Dave, this Dave. Not substantially. As you know, the break open generics are pretty modest in 2014. So we have not changed our expectation about that or timing of that.","David Magee - SunTrust","Then secondly, more of an immediate term question. With regard to ACA, as you think about that over a three year period, how you would you rank the impacts on your business from all the change there?","Larry Merlo","Dave, maybe I will start and I will ask others to jump in. The base line on the Affordable Care Act is really about driving new members into the healthcare pool. So over the next several years you are going to have something like 35 million Americans who enter some form of health coverage and with health coverage, it will drive utilization within our channels. So I do think that you will see that expansion happen really in two areas, both in the exchange market, whether that be mostly the public exchange, but also in Medicaid that the level of availability for Medicaid increases you will see that extend as well.","David Denton","Dave, consistent with what we have said in the past, we see a more immediate benefit coming from Medicaid expansion than we do the growth in exchange population occurring more over time.","Larry Merlo","I do think that the second piece is that the next evolutions we talked about early today, from a strategic perspective, is as the healthcare system evolves, again, back to outcomes and performance metrics, you are going to see reimbursement focus on those and that will be driven by those who can perform well and effectively in managing care and in management costs down. I think we are very well positioned to take advantage of that over time.","David Magee - SunTrust","Great. Thank you.","Larry Merlo","Thanks, David.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Zach Sopcak - Morgan Stanley","Good morning. This is Zach Sopcak in for Ricky. I wondered that Larry, you had mentioned the positive feedback you had gotten on the tobacco decision and one of those sources was the Federal government. You have heard from the HHS and from the administration as well. I was just curious if you are anticipating any kind of a positive impact to your government business as you are going out to bid this year from that?","Larry Merlo","Well, it\u2019s a great question. I mean, obviously, as we have discussed, we think that our decision creates even further alignment with our client. So I would think that all things being equal, okay, that this certainly gives us another check next to our name. But I think that we still have to be priced correctly and we still have to serve the client correctly. So this decision doesn\u2019t take the place of the basic blocking and tackling elements that we work hard to serve our clients each and every day.","Zach Sopcak - Morgan Stanley","Okay, great. Thank you. Then I am just wondering if you can give us some incremental color on the tobacco shopper and if that profit contribution has declined in recent years or didn't flatter up? Then also if that shopper tended to be a utilizer of prescription services as well?","Larry Merlo","Let me start and I think Helena will jump in as well. We do not see this decision having any negative impact on our pharmacy business and it's quite possible to have a positive impact, okay, recognizing the response from the healthcare community in terms of this action. I think the tobacco business at CVS Pharmacy is one that has largely been convenient space. As a matter-of-fact if you look at tobacco transactions, about 97% of those transactions are pack unit sales, not carton sales, so there is a convenience element of that purchasing that will go away and maybe I will ask Helena just to comment on the related sales associate with the tobacco purchase.","Helena Foulkes","Sure. As Larry said, we are not a destination for the category. The other data point that I would add to that is, if you look across the whole industry only 4% of cigarettes or even sold in all of drugstores, so you it's never been an important part of the overall category sale.","We think that we have done our job in terms of estimating the sales that come along with those and you see those in the estimates, but in general that I think is isolated around the front store impact. It's very hard to tell what other impacts there will be. Certainly, the feedback in the last week has been overwhelmingly positive, people really feel like this is the right thing to do, positioning us as a healthcare leader and there has been really significant passion among consumers and our employees and a lot of stakeholders, so all of that makes us feel somewhat optimistic.","Zach Sopcak - Morgan Stanley","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Willoughby from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","Robert Willoughby - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Larry, Dave, in the past you had to slide that did show the CVS share of Caremark accounts. Can we get that on a quarterly basis? Do you have metric for the quarter where that has trended to?","David Denton","Bob, you are right. We have shown that. We showed that at Analyst Day at about 30% and we will take your feedback under advisement and more to come.","Robert Willoughby - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Forecasting, Larry, can I give you a point of corner or is that just too aggressive?","Larry Merlo","We are not going to answer that one today, Bob.","Robert Willoughby - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I will ask tomorrow.","Larry Merlo","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ajay Jain from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed.","Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald","Hi. Good morning. Actually, most of my questions have been asked already, but I just had a housekeeping question on cigarettes. That business is already excluded at this point from your comp base, based on how you are reporting front end comps both, for 2014 and for all the corresponding periods last year?","Larry Merlo","No. It is not excluded. Those sales are in our comp base - will happen as we cycle on to the back half of this year. We produce comps, we will give you the impact on our comps, so you can get the sense of our underlying true performance in front store.","Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald","Okay, so based on how they are going to be reporting, so then your front end comps could be somewhat understated for the next couple of quarters into sales impact would have been higher from a year ago, is that the right way to look at it?","Larry Merlo","When you get to the back half of the year, yes. That's true, because right now, we said we would exit by October 1st, so it's really more of a back half 2014 dynamic than it is the first half of 2014 dynamic.","Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald","Okay. Thank you.","Larry Merlo","You are welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly from Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse","Yes. Hi. Good morning, guys, just a couple of follow ups for you. First on tobacco, could you tell us what percent of your most loyal customers end up purchasing tobacco? The U.S. in total, right, is like 20%, but it's less for women than it's less again for the elderly and where I am going to is, is there any risk that you could possibly lose the non-tobacco trips of that customer and how is that sort of factored into the $2 billion that you have talked about?","Larry Merlo","Ed, it's Larry. I mean, Ed, we have done a lot of analysis with all the information available to us. As you have seen in the numbers, based on that work, we believe the related businesses account for about on an annualized basis, about half $0.5 billion, so you could think of it for every tobacco's dollar that we forgo, there is a companion sale of about, call it, $0.30 on that tobacco dollars that moves along with it, okay, and were estimated that that would be part of the lost sales.","Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse","And is that companion dollar, is that what's in that tobacco basket or?","Larry Merlo","Yes, it is.","Helena Foulkes","Yes.","David Denton","Tobacco shopper.","Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse","Okay. So I guess you will have to monitor what goes on with those non-tobacco trips of those customers, I guess, right?","Larry Merlo","That\u2019s right.","Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse","Okay, great. Thank you.","Larry Merlo","Thank you. We are going to take two more calls, Frank.","Operator","Our next question comes from Meredith Adler from Barclays Capital. Please proceed.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital","Thanks very much for taking my question. Obviously a lot of my questions have been asked but I would like to talk just a little bit about Specialty Connect and just understand a little bit better, how would it actually function at the store? I think you said you would connect a specialty customer who opt-in with a new script with somebody at the specialty pharmacy. Is that something you do at the moment? Would you have a follow-up afterwards? I am assuming that the pickup, if it's done at the store is in a temperature controlled packaging as if it would have gone to their home. It isn't handled as a product by the stores? Am I getting that right?","Larry Merlo","Meredith, this is Larry. Let me start and then I will ask Jon to pick up where I leave off. There is one important premise, Meredith, to that specialty customer today and there are many, many examples where that customer goes into a retail environment to get their specialty med filled and they can't, okay, and the pharmacist cannot help them. They turn them away, okay, and it has to do with all the complexities. It's much more than just the fact that particular pharmacy may not stock a high-cost product. So it starts with that premise and then I will let Jon pick up it up from there.","Jon Roberts","Yes, and then, Meredith, all this is powered by technology that connects the retail store with our specialty platform and it guides the store staff through the onboarding process of this patient. I think that really is the differentiator here. A lot of these products, retail pharmacists just don\u2019t see. They aren\u2019t familiar with. So enabling this through technology, connecting it back to specialty, providing a pathway for the clinicians to speak to that patient around either special training or questions or follow-up that needs to occur. If you talk to our specialty patients, they actually talk about their pharmacists. They about the retail pharmacist and they talk about the specialty pharmacist. They view that as a care team that\u2019s taking care of them and giving them the flexibility to get their medication in the way that\u2019s most convenient for them.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital","So you don\u2019t envision this person bringing in a specialty script as dealing with a one-time situation of filling it and then somehow completely turning over the relationship to the specialty pharmacy, but it would continue to be a partnership? Is that right?","Jon Roberts","Yes, right. So, Meredith, that\u2019s exactly what I mean. It's going to be a team that is helping this patient. The retail team will be able to answer some questions and the specialty team will answer other questions for the patient. What the challenge is for specialty patient, it\u2019s a challenge for the physician and it\u2019s a challenge for the patient, because we are now opening up 7,600 points of access, as opposed to what we have now, which is really just specialty mail, it is going to make it much easier for the physician and its going to actually get that patient on their therapy sooner. That care will happen through that team and it\u2019s all connected and powered by the technology platform that we have seen and now we can see that patient or this enables us to see that patient across our enterprise and all our platforms.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital","And just a real quick follow-up to that. Are you planning to train the technicians? My interaction at a CVS store is mostly with the technician, not with the pharmacist. So are they in this loop or do you plan to keep it just for the pharmacist?","Helena Foulkes","Sure, Meredith. This is Helena. Yes, we are rolling this out across the chain as we do any retail program. We have got full training performances and technicians and I think the beauty of the technology that Jon just described is, from a store team perspective, it looks like filling any other prescription that they fill and so it's not a completely new process to them. It looks very much like filling a normal prescription, so to speak, and that\u2019s one of the things that has given us the most positive reaction so far from our store team.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital","Great. Thank you very much.","Larry Merlo","Thanks, Meredith. Okay. Last question please?","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Ross Muken from ISI Group. Please proceed.","Ross Muken - ISI Group","Maybe I thought I would just start first on your MinuteClinic. What have we seen in terms of the types of things folks are coming into the store for? We have seen a broadening out maybe be the types of treatment people are seeking and I am just curious from like a capacity utilization perspective and some of the older stores or the sites that have been in place. How fast we see them get up in terms of the newer one to some of the legacy levels?","Larry Merlo","Ross, it's Larry. I mean what we are seeing is a heightened awareness and consumer acceptance, which if you look at the earlier markets, as we have been able to you increase the number of clinics within that market, obviously there's a halo effect to the older clinics.","I think that, our MinuteClinic team is working on broadening the scope of services provided and that is in development and that's in development with the 30-some hospital affiliations that we have established acknowledging that we are triaging patients from MinuteClinic to the institution and you know and vice versa.","I think the other important point is, the fact that MinuteClinic is seen as a value-added benefits by our PBM clients and many of those early adopting MinuteClinic programs that offer reduced or in some cases zero co-pays and that too has driven utilization, so I think it's an evolving story that as we move to the future, you will see us expand our scope of services, but you we will do that in collaboration with our care partners.","Ross Muken - ISI Group","Great. Thanks, Larry. Maybe a quick one for Dave, you are still carrying a pretty good amount of balance sheet capacity. You guys have done a great job of tuck-ins for the last few years. Coram, obviously, the most recent.","How would you sort of characterize sort of the tuck-in M&A environment just in terms of activities, the number of assets out there that potentially could be interested, obviously. Can you talk about specifics, but I am just trying to get a sense for tone, because it feels like in general the M&A part of market has gotten a little bit more active to start the year.","David Denton","Ross, this is Dave. I don't know that I can comment too much on that I would just say that as we have been very clear is that we do generate a substantial amount of cash flow that we are putting that cash flow to use.","First, in dividends and share repurchases, but just as importantly putting that cash changes kind of on the M&A side, I think, if you look across our business, I don't think we see any hopes as far as an asset compliment that we need to be successful in the marketplace?","Having said that, I do think there is opportunities for us to continue to do bolt-on acquisitions, harness the synergies, increase our scale and continue to deliver superior service to either existing customer base or reaching new customers.","Ross Muken - ISI Group","Great. Thanks, Dave and congrats guys on a number of great announcements.","David Denton","Thanks, Ross.","Larry Merlo","Just ramping up, again, let me thank everybody for your time this morning and your continued interest in our company. Nancy her team as always are available for any follow-up questions that you might have. Thanks again.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

My name is Lisa and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the CVS Health Q2 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Larry Merlo, you may begin your conference.","Larry Merlo","Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Before we get started, I'd like to introduce our new Senior VP of Investor Relations, Valerie Haertel, and Valerie brings more than two decades of investor relations experience in the healthcare and financial services sectors and we're excited to have her on board.","So with that, let me pass the call to Valerie to get us started.","Valerie Haertel","Thank you, Larry and good morning. I'm excited to join the CVS Health chain and look forward to working with all of you. I would like to welcome you to the conference call to discuss CVS Health's second quarter 2019 results and outlook for the remainder of the year. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","In addition to Larry, I'm joined this morning by Eva Boratto, Executive Vice President and CFO. Following our prepared remarks we'll host a question-and-answer session. I'm Joe Krocheski, Vice President of Investor Relations for CVS Health. I'm joined this morning by Larry Merlo, President and CEO; and ","Following our prepared remarks, we'll host a question-and-answer session. Jon Roberts, Chief Operating Officer; Karen Lynch, President of Aetna; Derica Rice, President of Caremark; and Kevin Hourican, President of CVS Pharmacy will also be joining us for the question-and-answer session.","In order to provide more people with a chance to ask their questions during the Q&A, please limit yourself to no more than one question with a quick follow-up.","In addition to this call and our press release, we have posted a slide presentation on our website that summarizes the information in our prepared remarks as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance. Our Form 10-Q will be filed later today and that too will be available on our website once filed.","Please note, that during this call, we will make certain forward-looking statements that reflect our current views related to our future financial performance, future events, and industry and market conditions, and forward-looking statements related to the integration of the Aetna acquisition including the expected consumer benefits, financial projections, and synergies. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what may be indicated in the forward-looking statements.","We strongly encourage you to review the information in the reports we file with the SEC regarding these specific risks and uncertainties, in particular, those that are described in the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K and the cautionary statement disclosures in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. You should also review the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in this morning's earnings press release.","During this call, we will use non-GAAP financial measures when talking about the company's performance and financial condition. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find a discussion of these non-GAAP measures and the comparable GAAP measures in this morning's earnings press release and the reconciliation document posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website. And as always, today's call is being broadcast on our website where it will be archived for one year following today's call.","Now, I'll turn the call back over to Larry.","Larry Merlo","Well, thanks Valerie, and welcome to our team. Well Q2 is a very strong quarter where we continue to execute against our objectives and build on our positive momentum, with adjusted earnings per share of $1.89 exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Now this performance was driven by strong operating results across the enterprise with Retail\/Long-Term Care and Pharmacy Services performing above expectations.","Importantly, these results reflect strong revenue and share gains across the enterprise. Given our results to date as well as our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance to $6.89 to $7 and Eva will provide a more in-depth review of our results and our updated guidance in her remarks. We are highly encouraged by our strong results through the first half of the year, demonstrating our continued focus on executing strategic priorities we outlined at our June Investor Day.","We are transforming our company and the healthcare industry and accelerating enterprise growth as we move forward. Our first priority is to continue to grow and differentiate our businesses and nowhere is this differentiation more apparent than in our retail stores through the conversion of our HealthHUBs. At our June Investor Day we announced plans to convert 1500 locations to hubs by the end of 2021. As part of this plan we will be expanding to three more Metropolitan areas later this year and we'll add an additional 10 areas in the first half of 2020.","Our expansion strategy is reinforced by the strong results we are seeing in our initial hub locations, including increased customer traffic and incremental sales in pharmacy front store and MinuteClinics. We've also received strong consumer feedback reflected in net promoter scores at the HealthHUBs outpacing our broader chain by about 900 basis points. So we're extremely excited with reception to our innovative offering that will allow us to engage with consumers in a differentiated manner in the communities where they live and importantly improve health outcomes.","In our Health Care Benefits segment we continue to show strong momentum, particularly in our government business. On July 19, we were notified that we were one of two health plans awarded a statewide five-year contract to serve the Healthy Kids program of Florida. So we're excited to build on our strong existing relationship with the state and its physicians, health systems and other providers, to support healthy outcomes in this important geography. And this win speaks to our breadth of capabilities in serving the Medicaid populations.","We also continue to see opportunities to further grow our Medicare products. With Medicare Advantage, our competitive products, strong [stars] [ph] performance and continued geographic expansion position us well to capture significant growth opportunities in the marketplace. And our expansion for 2020 will provide coverage access to about 80% of Medicare eligible lives.","In Medicare Part D, we are utilizing the best practices of the combined organization and are pleased with the preliminary benchmark results received from CMS for the 2020 plan year where we qualified in 31 of 34 regions. Now I want to remind you that we see opportunities to accelerate PDP to MA conversions to provide our members with incremental value from an integrated medical Pharmacy Benefit and our PDP bids reflect this strategy which may result in fewer choosers selecting SilverScript.","In our Pharmacy Services segment we continue to provide value to our clients through our cost management programs, while also earning high marks in both client and member satisfaction. And we are pleased with our progress on the 2020 selling season. Post Investor Day our gross new businesses increased by $600 million with net new business improving by about $1.4 billion..","The second quarter also marked the beginning of the implementation of the IngenioRx business. The first wave of members were migrated on May 1, and by the end of Q2 we added millions of IngenioRx members to our platform. To date the migration has gone flawlessly due to the thoughtful planning and dedicated execution of the joint implementation team comprised of colleagues from both IngenioRx and CVS Health.","Our second priority is to deliver transformational products and services. One of the key initiatives is our chronic kidney care program which includes the early identification of chronic kidney disease, targeted patient engagement and education to help slow disease progression, and increasing access to transplant and home dialysis to optimize care.","Last month we received FDA approval to initiate the clinical trial of our Hemodialysis System. This system is designed to make home hemodialysis safer and simpler while allowing patient's to receive longer and more frequent dialysis treatments where the research has shown leads to better health outcomes. And we have already enrolled our first patient and up to 70 patients will participate in the clinical trial. We expect the trial to be completed over the next 16 to 18 months with product launch to occur in 2021.","This strategy is aligned with the administration\u2019s recently announced Advancing Kidney Care initiative aimed to help improve early detection and expand treatment options for kidney disease including home dialysis. The administration's focus is in line with the core objectives of our own Kidney Care Program and we look forward to being able to dramatically improve the treatment experience for millions of Americans suffering with kidney disease.","We've also made meaningful progress on another key transformation program, our comprehensive oncology solutions, where we're aligning stakeholders around a common goal of improving the quality of care while reducing costs for plan sponsors and patients. We recently launched our pilot program with the cohort of Aetna members and providers across 14 states. This provider group will use our NovoLogix proprietary technology platform to drive adherence to clinical guidelines, cost effective therapy choices, and enable value-based payments.","For patients we are providing high touch engagement through a dedicated team of nurses to enhance the patient experience and improve adherence to their therapy regimens. Our goal is to expand the pilot to more Aetna members and providers later this year.","Our third priority is to enhance our consumer-centric technology infrastructure to support many of the new programs and services we are implementing through our transformation efforts. This includes integrating data and enhancing our analytics capabilities, developing an intelligent engagement platform, and seamlessly connecting digital and physical capabilities to improve the customer experience. Now we've launched several new integrated next best action pilots in our HealthHUBs and MinuteClinics aimed at closing gaps in care and improving chronic condition management.","Additionally, we have enhanced our ExtraCare programs system architecture. We are now live with machine learning tools that will further improve the reach and relevance of our customer engagement. Also we announced earlier this week, the nationwide expansion of our CarePass subscription program, which is delivering on our expectations to drive increased trips and spending levels from enrolled members and customer feedback on the program has been very positive.","And finally, we are focused on becoming a more innovative and efficient operator by executing on our integration strategy and modernizing our enterprise functions. On the integration front, we are making excellent progress and are ahead of where we expected to be at this point in the year. We now expect to deliver approximately $400 million of synergy value this year with the largest contributor to our outperformance being formulary optimization. We have also fully integrated our mail operations ahead of our initial targeted integration date. Our expectation of approximately $800 million in synergies for next year remains on track.","Our enterprise modernization efforts are also underway and we are still in the early stages of execution on the program with meaningful savings expected to begin accruing next year. But we're encouraged by the early work to identify savings opportunities and the leadership structure and cross functional teams required to support these activities has been built out and through these opportunities we expect to generate net savings of between $1.5 billion $2 billion in 2022.","So as you can see in our results, as well as our future plans, we are successfully executing on the priorities that we laid out at our Investor Day. Through the priorities we firmly believe that we will be able to accelerate enterprise growth and position CVS Health to deliver on our operational and financial objectives, creating significant shareholder value in the process.","Now before I pass the call over to Eva, let me briefly comment on the current legislative and policy environment, along with our ongoing efforts to drive solutions that save patients money and reduce overall healthcare costs. First, the administration's withdrawal of the rebate rule provides perhaps the most significant recognition today of the importance and the value of the PBM and the significant cost increases that would have resulted in eliminating the power of formularies to drive price discounts and lower premiums for Medicare Part D beneficiaries.","Additionally, the administration's extension of our real-time benefit capability to allow Medicare Part D beneficiaries and their physicians and pharmacists the ability to find lower-cost therapeutic alternatives will result in real savings for members and the Medicare Part D program and our data shows the beneficiaries are saving about $90 per bill when prescribers are utilizing the toll. But beyond the PBM, we continue to advocate for policies that lower out-of-pocket costs for consumers and demonstrate the innovation and cost savings solutions the private sector can deliver as the broader questions of access costs and quality are debated nationally.","So with that, here is Eva to walk through our financial results for the quarter, as well as our updated expectations for the balance of the year.","Eva Boratto","Thanks Larry, and good morning, everyone. As Larry said, Q2's performance exceeded our expectation with broad-based strength across the enterprise, and as such we're raising our outlook for the full year to reflect this outperformance. Adjusted earnings per share of a $1.89 was above the high end of our guidance range by $0.17. The quarter benefited by approximately $0.06 from nonrecurring items including realized investment portfolio gains and prior year's development.","Health Care Benefits performed in line with expectations and Pharmacy Services are our PBMs and retail Long Term Care outperformed our expectations. The quarter also benefited from a lower effective tax rate due to timing and lower interest expense primarily due to the early repayment of the outstanding term loan.","Consolidated adjusted revenue grew 35.8% in Q2 2019 also exceeding our expectations. The year-over-year increase was largely driven by the addition of Aetna as well as higher volume in both the PBM and retail Long Term Care segments. Health Care Benefits, which includes our SilverScript Medicare Part D business contributed $17.4 billion of revenue for the quarter. Adjusted consolidated operating income grew 55.1% primarily due to the addition of the Aetna business and growth in the PBM, partially offset by a decline in Retail\/Long-Term Care. The Health Care Benefits segment contributed $1.4 billion to adjusted operating income.","Now let me through the results of our segments. In our PBM revenue increased 4.2% with adjusted claim volume up 4% versus Q2 2018. The increased was driven by net new business and the continued adoption of our Maintenance Choice offering. PBM adjusted operating income increased 9.7% as operating margins expanded by about 20 basis points due to increased claims volume and favorable purchasing economics. Drug price inflation remains consistent with our expectations.","Our Retail\/Long-Term Care segment also performed better than expected with revenue up 3.7% driven by higher prescription volumes. We delivered strong adjusted script growth of 5.9% with cost scripts up 7.2%. This was driven by the continued adoption of our Patient Care programs, collaborations with other PBMs and our preferred status in a number of Medicare Part D network, as well as a prolonged allergy season. As the result of our strong script growth, our market share in Q2 increased 120 basis points to 26.5% versus Q2 of 2018.","Additionally, front store comp sales increased 2.9% driven by continued growth in health and beauty, a longer cough and cold season, and an approximate 80 basis points benefit from the shift of Easter shopping season to Q2. Second quarter Retail\/Long-Term Care adjusted operating income declined 8.3% year-over-year. This represents an improvement from our expectations due to increased pharmacy volume and front store performance. The drivers of the year-over-year decline are consistent with what we had discussed previously.","And finally, Health Care Benefits continued to perform well. Revenue exceeded our expectations in the quarter driven by strong growth in Medicare products. As a reminder, year-over-year results for the Health Care Benefits segment are not comparable to either legacy CVS or legacy Aetna results due to a variety of factors including the acquisition of Aetna, inclusion of SilverScript in our 2019 Health Care Benefits results, and a temporary suspension of the health insurance fee in 2019.","Our total health MBR was 84% for the quarter, a result that benefited from favorable prior period reserve development across all of our core products. Our MBR reflects overall moderate medical cost trends. However, we did experience modest pressure in a specific portion of our middle market commercial book. We have taken appropriate action to mitigate the impact. Despite this modest pressure we continue to expect our MBR for the full year to be within our initial guidance range with a bias towards the upper half.","Our days claims payable was 48 days for Q2. Compared to Q1 days claims payable increased by three days due to the seasonality that is typical of our PDP business. We remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves and our reserving process. As I mentioned earlier, the Corporate segment benefited from $57 million of realized investment portfolio gains, which contributed to the outperformance in the quarter.","Turning to cash flow and our use of capital, this quarter regenerated strong cash from operations of $5.3 billion due to improved working capital and earnings performance. We also returned more than $6 million to shareholders through dividends. We repaid $1 billion of long-term debt in May representing a portion of the term loan outstanding, and in July we repaid the balance of the term loan of $1.5 billion. Taking all of this into account, since the close of the transaction, we repaid approximately $6.6 billion of debt and we are focused on continuing to delever and remain on track with the plans we outlined at our Investor Day in June.","With that, let me turn to an update of our guidance for the remainder of the year. As Larry said, we are raising and narrowing our 2019 guidance range to reflect the favorable performance. We now expect our consolidated full-year adjusted earnings per share to be $6.89 to $7. We now expect consolidated full-year 2019 revenue in the range of $251.4 billion to $254.2 billion and adjusted operating income between $15.2 billion and $15.4 billion.","For the segments we expect full year 2019 adjusted operating income in the Pharmacy Services segment to be in the range of $5.06 billion to $5.12 billion, the Retail\/Long-Term Care segment to be in the range of $6.68 billion to $6.76 billion and the Health Care Benefits segment to be in the range of $5.18 billion to $5.24 billion. The increase in guidance reflects the outperformance in the segments including the acceleration of synergies primarily benefiting Pharmacy Services. It also reflects the investment portfolio gains and prior period development within HCB in our Q2 results.","Our full year 2019 GAAP EPS guidance is now in the range of $4.93 to $5.04. This reflects the improvements across our business partially offset by a loss of approximately $200 million on the sale of our Brazilian subsidiary Onofre. This loss primarily reflects the elimination of the cumulative foreign currency translation losses from shareholders equity. The transaction closed in the third quarter and is consistent with our strategy of optimizing our portfolio of assets.","We are also raising our cash flow guidance and now expect to deliver strong cash from operations between $10.1 billion and $10.6 billion of which $4.5 billion to $4.9 billion will be available for debt paydown this year. Our strong cash projections include the improvement to our underlying business performance, as well as early benefits from our initiative to reduce pharmacy inventory in our retail stores by $1.5 billion. We continue to expect capital spending of $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion.","Our earnings progression for the year is expected to be consistent with the cadence discussed on our May earnings call. The first three quarters will have the highest year-over-year growth as we wrap the addition of Aetna, and we expect Health Care Benefits adjusted operating income to be the lowest in Q4 due to the cyclical nature of that business. For the third quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.75 to $1.79.","In summary, we delivered a strong quarter of performance exceeding our expectations. We remain confident we will be able to achieve our financial and operating goals for the full-year and over the longer term.","With that, we would like to open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Robert Jones","Great, thanks for the questions. I guess maybe just on synergies and the execution there, clearly, things seem to be going well with the expectation now for $400 million, Eva if I heard you correctly, versus the previous communication of $300 million to $350 million. It sounds like the $800 million is still intact for next year. So, I was wondering if maybe you could just share a little bit on where you're realizing synergies ahead of the previous expectation on a segment level. And then any sense you can give us on what those synergies might have contributed to the quarter would be helpful?","Larry Merlo","Yes, Bob, it's Larry. I'll start, and then I think Eva will jump in terms of your second question. But to your point, we're really pleased with how the integration is going. The over delivery to our initial guidance is largely in two areas, one is the formulary optimization, and the second one is, we're just being able to transition functions a bit faster than we had modeled and probably the biggest example is the consolidation of our mail operations and pharmacy.","Eva Boratto","And Bob, the only thing I would add is, you're exactly right, our $800 million for next year remains intact, $400 million for this year, with the largest benefit accruing to the PBM. I would say the other impacts are pretty consistent with what we had previously and it was a contributor to the PBM outperformance.","Larry Merlo","And Bob, just going back to Analyst Day, recall we said $800 million in 2020 with a goal now of $900 million in 2021.","Robert Jones","Got it. No, no, thanks for that clarification Larry, and then I guess just one quick follow-up on the Rx comp really strong in the quarter, better than we expected, probably better than we've seen for a few quarters. Could you maybe just talk about where you're seeing growth there? Is it really coming more from a share shift from the other large retail players or is this more maybe share gains from some of the smaller independent players out there, because I don't necessarily think there has been an increase in just overall script volume and yet, obviously you guys saw a nice pickup in the quarter. So, just any clarity there would be really helpful. Thanks.","Kevin Hourican","Yes, hi Bob, this is Kevin. And I'll answer that question. So yes, we're really pleased with our top line script growth. We're growing at two times the market. The vast majority of our script growth is coming from our clinical programs, which are intended to increased medication adherence for the patients that we serve, so those are existing customers of ours.","And if we can keep them more adherent on taking their medications to keep them healthier and it also drives our business. As Eva mentioned, we also have strong strategic partnerships with third-party payers, and we're seeing growth with the major payers being able to ship share to us based on our preferred relationships. Those are the two primary drivers.","Robert Jones","Great, thanks so much.","Larry Merlo","Thanks, Bob.","Eva Boratto","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Justin Lake","Thanks, good morning. You talked about the PBM seeing benefit in the quarter from increased synergies, but even beyond that, it looks like a pretty dramatic improvement versus the trends you saw in the first quarter. So, you can walk us through the drivers of this improvement and talk about sustainability? Because it doesn't look like you're projecting similar year-over-year performance of the back half of the year within the updated guidance range?","Eva Boratto","Yes. Thanks, Justin. It's Eva, I'll start and then Derica will jump in. As we look at the beat on the PBM, I would say it came from a couple of key areas. First, we had strong performance on overall script and continued growth in Mail Choice with Maintenance Choice being a contributor, as well as what we just spoke about, around the acceleration of synergies.","We also had higher rebates earned in the quarter, and this is a function of our procurement activities with pharma that we do on an ongoing basis as well as improvements in formulary compliance, which helps us mitigate some of the liability issues that we spoke about earlier in the year. So overall, we're pleased with the performance here. Specialty continues to perform well, and I'll hand it over to Derica.","Derica Rice","Hi, Justin, this is Derica. I think Eva captured it very well. The team has done a good job of driving formulary compliance with our clients and that's allowed us to improve our earned rebates and cover that rebate exposure. So we are tracking very well to mitigating the headwind that we talked about at the beginning of the year and we fully do expect that it will peak this year in terms of our rebate exposure and you should absolutely expect dissipation of that exposure, as we look forward to 2020 and 2021.","Justin Lake","All right, thanks. And just a quick follow-up. Eva, you talked about modest pressure in the middle market commercial book, as you might imagine the managed care side of the world beats their interest when you start talking about pressure on the commercial side. Can you just give us some more color whether it was price or cost and as much detail as you can behind the drivers of that and what you're doing to mitigate it?","Karen Lynch","Hey, Justin, it's Karen. I'll take that one. What I would say is, I think that it's a very specific portion at the low end of our middle market and we are seeing pressure in very specific regions. We are seeing a little bit of pressure in utilization across the medical cost categories. But what I would emphasize it is not across our entire commercial book, it is a very specific \u2013 it is in our 51 to 100 and it is in very select geographies. And what we're doing about it, we took very specific actions, we are intensifying our medical management in those geographies.","Justin Lake","And Karen, can you tell us the magnitude? Is it 10 bps, the 25 bps or 200 bps?","Eva Boratto","Yes, Justin. We're not going to call that out exactly, but I would say, as you look at our overall MBRs, what we're expecting overall, we're still well within our guidance range and the other areas are performing well.","Larry Merlo","One of the things that I would point out to keep in the back of your mind, as we go forward that, we are building natural hedges in our business now, when you look at this business model. So to the extent that we see utilization trends and you can go beyond what Karen was talking about and just look at something like a flu season. It's easy to get your head around that. To the extent we have an extreme flu season, that is a headwind for our insurance business. It becomes a tailwind for our retail and PBM business. So we will have some elements of those natural hedges as we move forward.","Justin Lake","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.","Lisa Gill","Thanks, good morning. Larry, you talked a little bit about the HealthHUBs and talked about the trends in traffic, Rx, MinuteClinics, front-end, et cetera. I know you're going to say it's probably pretty early on, but is there any way to put numbers around this. So, as we start to think about this story over the next several years and we start to think about 1,500 HealthHUBs, what this could look like for the Company?","Larry Merlo","Yes. Lisa, it's a great question and Lisa, as we go forward, we want to -- we do want to get more stores under our belt to move from qualitative definition to more quantitative definition. We have talked about the fact that we are really pleased with the feedback that we're seeing from customers from a service performance point of view. Net promoter score is up 900 basis points over the chain average, and we are seeing additional traffic, and we're seeing that translate into sales momentum, additional sales in the front store in the pharmacy as well as MinuteClinics.","Eva Boratto","And Lisa, if we were to just contextualize where the value is going to come from, I'd highlight three areas. As Larry said, first the store traffic, just the underlying dimensionally of our retail stores. Second, the value we can bring to Aetna and the Health Insurance business around medical cost savings. And third, opportunities in the PBM in our open-source model to deliver to deliver value there.","Lisa Gill","Okay, great. And then just as a follow-up to that, you talked about 9,900 stores today, 1,500 ultimately having HealthHUBs in them. And any updated thoughts post the Analyst Day on what the right number of stores is, is it the 9,900 or do you think that it will be lesser number as we think about the next several years?","Kevin Hourican","Hi Lisa, this is Kevin, I'll take that one. So we don't have a targeted store count. But what I'll do is I'll come back to our Investor Day presentation, where we talked about the fact that we continuously evaluate our real estate portfolio. A couple of key points I'd like to highlight on today's call.","First is our portfolio of stores is robust and highly productive. We view it as a competitive strength. It's important to note that we've reduced the number of new store openings per year. So if you go back a few years ago that would have been 300 per year, this year 2019 we opened 100 new stores, so obviously a reduction. 2020, I would project that we will open approximately 50 new stores, so that does telegraph or reducing the number of new stores that we are opening.","Our focus currently as Larry mentioned is on our HealthHUBs expansion. In order to increase the productivity of our retail stores through the new services and the traffic that we can drive to our stores through those services and to enable Karen and Derica's business to lower medical cost through being in that local community setting and providing improved care.","Our new store openings will focus in the future on markets like the Pacific Northwest, where we're under-stored, in high-growth areas, like New York City in places like Texas, where we can definitely fill in. And lastly, we will continue to aggressively evaluate our store portfolio to ensure we're delivering the highest level of financial returns.","Larry Merlo","And I think just -- maybe just a couple of other quick points. I think underlying Kevin's comments are, we have extreme flexibility in our portfolio. And with the number of leases that come up on an annual basis and we review the productivity of the entire fleet and have flexibility for probably on average about 500 locations every year.","The other point also to keep in mind Lisa, your questions started with the HealthHUBs and we are continuing with our thought process around a hub-and-spoke model. So we are in the process of finalizing what that spoke, how that supports the hub concept in the fact that there will be more subtle changes in spokes across a geographic area.","Lisa Gill","Very helpful. Thank you, Larry.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ricky Goldwasser","Yes, hi, good morning. Larry, in the prepared remarks you talked a little bit about the MA strategy for next year. Can you expand on that kind of like in how you talked a little bit about kind of a potential decline in SilverScript, which could benefit the dual business, if you can help quantify kind of like the potential opportunity there?","Karen Lynch","Hi. Ricky. It's Karen. Let me comment on the Part D. What I would say is as a result of the combined Company and some of the successes that we both had relative to our Part D market, what we've done is, we've modified our product designed to better reposition our portfolio to support a broader consumer appeal, and then continuity for MA-PD conversions.","And so, the report that what we're doing with the portfolio this year is, it's a multi-year strategy and we are ensuring that our consumers will have choices that will better meet their specific needs. And what we're really very happy about where our preliminary benchmarks came in as Larry said, we're at 30 what we call site 31 out of 4 regions. So we feel good about where we're positioned relative to Part D next year.","Ricky Goldwasser","Okay. And follow-up on the selling season, obviously the, you've won some business since Analyst Day. Can you give us a little bit more detail on what parts of the market you're winning in and also where are we in the selling season, so how much of the book is left at this point?","Derica Rice","Sure. Hi Ricky. This is Derica, I'll take that question. We're about 90% to 91% of our way through the selling season. So we are off to -- we're closing the end and we're actually beginning to get bids for 2021, if you can imagine. But in terms of the update since our Analyst Day discussion, as you heard from Eva earlier this morning, we were able to improve our gross new business by about $600 million, and we improved on a net basis, about 1.4 total.","And that was driven by both, one we've been able to retain some business at a higher level than we thought, business that we initially lost, both in the collective and at the state level and then secondly, we've also seen further delay in the Centene migration and so that's helping us a bit as well in terms of contributing to that number.","And operationally, we've continued to have very, very high service levels. So those gross new wins I highlighted earlier, the majority of those were taking place in the employer segment and on the government side.","Ricky Goldwasser","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Your line is open.","Steve Valiquette","Great, thanks. Good morning everybody. So with the large EPS beat in 2Q relative to guidance by almost $0.20 and then 3Q '19 also coming in well above the Street by almost $0.15, it does seem that the full year 2019 EPS guide could have been raised by maybe even more than $0.10 to $0.14 that you're raising it by. And maybe it's just conservatism, but the question really is, just regarding the implied 4Q guidance, and you mentioned Aetna or the HCB segment having seasonally lower profits in 4Q versus the rest of the year. I'm just curious if there's anything else worth calling out regarding different seasonality for either the retail segment or the PBM for 4Q that's different this year or did the Street just mis-model at the back half of the year from your view? Thanks.","Eva Boratto","Hi, Steve, it's Eva. Overall what I'll say is, we're really pleased with how we're executing in the results in the quarter and the raise to our guidance. I think, as you think about quarter-in, quarter-out some of the headwinds that we spoke about how generics can affect us the rebate guarantees, you can have some seasonality of that one quarter to another. You called out the lower profitability of that and then in the fourth quarter with their typical seasonality, you can get some lumpiness with the PDP between Q3 and Q4, that's always been something that depending on where you are on the curve there that that can change. So there are the key items I would call out and overall, we're pleased with our performance thus far relative to our expectations.","Steve Valiquette","Okay.","Larry Merlo","Steve, it's Larry. I'd just emphasize or underscore couple of Eva's points and remind everyone that we did move the SilverScript business out of the gate over to the Aetna business and we're really happy that that we made that move out of the gate, because I think it gives us the flexibility that Karen had alluded to earlier, and I'm confident that that will pay dividends next year.","Keep in mind that when you look at the quarterly cadence of the PDP business, it doesn't follow the quarterly cadence of the Health Care Benefits business broadly, it's kind of backwards in terms of the roll to Q1-Q4 in play. So that -- we're doing our best to provide that level of transparency in terms of the moving parts from a comparison point of view, but certainly the IR team would be happy to follow up with you on that.","Steve Valiquette","Okay. No, I appreciate the color and congrats on the results. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore. Your line is open.","Ross Muken","Hi. Good morning, guys and congrats. In the beginning, Larry you highlighted a couple of kind of interesting new endeavors for the business that's sort of built off the Analyst Day. You talked about hemodialysis and some of what you're doing in oncology and then the hospital to home. I guess as you think about the number of these new programs that Alan and others are sort of working on across the business, what sort of the customer response in terms of the consumer, as well as sort of other plans?","And then what other types of entities are now also coming to you, looking to sort of partner -- because obviously you have a very unique sort of footprint across sort of the healthcare landscape it now with sort of a lot of these new efforts and endeavors, it may attract kind of others to want to work more closely with you to bring their sort of technology, et cetera, to your member base. So just give us a feel for kind of how that's all developing and the inbounds that are coming into you?","Larry Merlo","Yes, Ross. Thanks for the question, because it is a great question and it really does speak to the opportunities in front of us. From a customer point of view and I'll define the customer as the user now, okay? The feedback has been very good and quite frankly it's validating our beliefs and our strategy that there is a growing emergence of the retail health consumer, and it's also giving us the confidence to move forward as we outlined where we're going with the products and services, not just in pilot, but the broader rollout of things that we've discussed.","The flip side of that is, there is also a growing interest from our health plan partners in terms of how we can partner. Eva alluded a bit to that in terms of the want to one of the potential value drivers, and certainly those inbounds are -- there are robust discussions with Derica and his team in terms of the opportunities there. And then, the third bucket of opportunity is just the inbounds coming from other potential partners in terms of how we can work together to be part of the solution that leads to additional innovation.","So, Ross, I would say that is probably something that we underestimated in terms of the potential for those opportunities and what that could mean and we certainly got a team exploring those and we'll talk more about that as they come to fruition.","Eva Boratto","And Ross, this is Eva, if I could just add one thing to Larry. We wrap it all up, it just speaks to the power of our ability to touch the consumer through our retail, through our retail footprint and bring all of this together and just the complementary nature of our business to others who are in the healthcare system.","Ross Muken","And maybe just on retail, I mean I think a previous question sort of touched on front-end, but it feels like it's actually even excluding the Easter shift, sort of gotten a bit better or at least you're executing well there. I know, you also recently sort of rolled out kind of the CarePass subscription more nationwide. I guess, how are you feeling in general, just about sort of the comp trajectory there and some of the things that you're changing and shifting in terms of being able to sustain not just gross profits in that part of the business but actually continue to comp?","Kevin Hourican","Yes. Hi, Ross, it's Kevin, and thanks for the question. And, we're really pleased with our front store business and the Easter shift did contribute positively. But that was the reason to be small percentage. The growth in our business is coming from our health and beauty strategies that are taking share from the market and growing share of wallet with the customers that we continue to serve. So it comes from a couple of key components. Our store remodels are increasing comp store sales in the locations where we remodeled, renewed focus on improving the customer experience within our stores, which is increasing NPS.","And if you know, the retail equation, improving customer service does pay forward improved sales in the future and we're improving our ExtraCare program through targeted personalization which is increasing the reach and relevance of the offers to our customers and we're seeing dividend from those investments in technology that are fueling those capabilities.","I'll just touch on the CarePass question that you asked at the end. Yes, we did announce earlier this week, the expansion of CarePass nationwide, I'll just say a couple of points on that. You know CarePass starts with the customer. Our customers increasingly are looking for time saving activities. They are time-starved and they're looking for increased value.","We view CarePass is extending that convenience advantage of CBS by offering free delivery 24 access to a pharmacists in the 20% every day discount. We're seeing very positive results from the enrolled members that we have in our pilot markets. The $10 promotional reward in particular is what's increasing trips to our stores into our digital properties and that increased visit frequency is what's driving the return positive for CVS. So therefore, we are confident to roll it out nationwide and now it's a matter of how many members we can enroll and in what pace we can enroll them.","Ross Muken","Great, thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","A.J. Rice","Hi, everybody. Just first your Medicare Advantage enrollment obviously this year has been a big bright spot for you. I wonder, now we got two quarters of claims under your belt. Do you have a call that out, so I'm assuming you're claims experience with those new labs has been about as expectations, and I know you're bids for 2020 and have already been submitted you guys some changing landscape there. I think the opportunity for expansions maybe is mitigated a little bit in the hip coming back. Any early commentary on how you think about the opportunity for 2020 in MA?","Karen Lynch","Hi, AJ, it's Karen. So yes, we're very pleased with our Medicare growth. And I'll just remind you that as we grew substantial amount of members, both in our individual and group membership. Our growth in individual came from service area expansion that was about 25% of our growth and then the remainder came from the existing footprint. Our claims and our first year business, as you would expect is performing exactly where we thought it would be. So we feel good about the performance of the Medicare business, as it stands today. As you know, we're halfway through the year, so the claims are still maturing. But everything, all the metrics and everything looks in line with where we would have expected.","Relative to our 2020 bid, we took a very balanced approach to 2020. Our go-to-market strategy included a broad portfolio of remaining at zero premium PPL and HMO plans, we feel good of our ability to further build plans. We also were able to offer new supplemental benefits and we are also able to leverage the enterprise MinuteClinics by offering zero co-pay or lower co-pays at MinuteClinics.","And we also were able to use some or incorporate some of our new differentiated capabilities within CVS. So we will be offering the HealthHUBs in Houston. We are offering, as you might recall, Investor Day, I talked about the hospital-to-home benefit, we are offering that across the portfolio. We're now calling that Healing Better. We also are offering over-the-counter and durable medical equipment benefits through our retail store and then leveraging the pharmacists' through Pharmacy panels.","So we are -- we'll look forward to telling you more about Medicare in the fall when more of the information is publicly available.","A.J. Rice","Okay. If I could just quickly pivot, obviously the public press is talking a lot about the situation with China. You guys haven't talked much about that. I don't know whether the front end you source much from China, but I'd be interested. I know some in the Retail Pharmacy segment do, I'd be interested to know how you're dealing with it. If it's an issue at all for you, and maybe you source better than others, and maybe it even could be an opportunity for market share gains. Any comment on that?","Larry Merlo","Yes, AJ it's Larry. I mean as you think about our overall portfolio, we do not have any sizable business that would go outside domestic. So the impact in terms of the current trade issues, we haven't seen materialize in our business. It's something that we continue to monitor as you think about our suppliers, but it's not something that is commanding a lot of our attention at this point.","A.J. Rice","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Your line is open.","Lance Wilkes","Yes, good morning. Could you talk a little bit about performance in the Medicaid line? And in particular, are you seeing any sort of cost pressures in that how are claims progressing? And then what steps are underway to kind of work on the pipeline and conversion of that pipeline going forward?","Karen Lynch","Lance, it's Karen again. So, I just want to remind everyone that we manage our Medicaid book of business through a diversified set of contracts, whose performance as you know vary state by state and program by program and we're currently in 16 states serving various programs. Right now, what I would say is our Medicaid MBR is performing in line with expectations and performed where we thought it would perform. As you would imagine, we are working through pulling various plants operate at different levels of performance and we feel that we've got the right actions across the board.","So we feel good about relative to Medicaid. I would also comment Lance that I'd remind you that we have a new contract in Kansas that is performing where we thought it would be. We've had some operational challenges out of the gate, but we feel that we've got those covered through operational execution and remediation plans.","Lance Wilkes","Great, and just related to your comment earlier on SilverScript to MA opportunities for conversion, could you talk a little bit about with your Aetna experience, what have you seen historically as far as conversion rates from PDP to an MA product and then what do you see as an outlook for that now that you've got the bigger and more sizable SilverScript pool there?","Karen Lynch","Lance, we were having very good success in the conversions prior to the acquisition and we obviously had to put it on hold, on halt when we divested the business. So, I feel given that we have the largest PDP now and given some of the repositioning of the portfolio that we will be doing, I view this as a good opportunity, as I mentioned at our Investor Day for continued growth in our Medicare business and we'll be actively working on those conversions and our product positioning, the PDP will help assist that and we're very excited about the possibilities for growth there.","Eva Boratto","And Lance, just to remind you Karen has shared at our Investor Day that Aetna as a standalone company between the years 2015 and 2019 was able to convert more than 82,000, and I think to the point Karen made, that was skewed to the earlier years in that range given the transactions going on and the focus of the business.","Lance Wilkes","Great, thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Michael Cherny","Good morning and thanks for all the color so far. I want to dive a little bit back into some of the cost trend comments. You kind of talked Karen about the very narrow book of business within middle market commercial, you gave some color on Medicare and Medicaid. I guess just more broadly across your business, to just get a little more clarity on some of the moving pieces, whether it's the elongated flu season in the camp and retail, just like how to think about what you've seen so far from overall broader perspective in some of the commercial markets or some other areas?","Karen Lynch","Yes, what I would say is, generally medical cost trends are performing in line across the board, what I mentioned earlier, with the small end of the middle market, that's very specific in geographies. We're seeing -- we're not seeing significant inpatient, we're seeing more broadly cost trends and more in the specialty pharmacy area than most, but that's trending in line with prior years at the same level.","So there is nothing in medical cost trends that are really out of performing and what we've seen in the past. So we feel like, like every year we are doing the things that we need to do relative to medical cost management, but nothing stands out in medical cost performance to really speak of other than those four markets that I talked about earlier.","Eva Boratto","Yes, and Mike, I just want to reiterate, we are still comfortably within the range of the initial guidance we had provided albeit at the upper half at this juncture.","Michael Cherny","That's definitely helpful. And then Eva, just a question for you, if we look at the new high-end of the guidance range, you're essentially at where you had thought about for the at least number for 2020. How should we think about the new guidance relative to the base level heading into 2020 beyond relative to the Analyst Day targets?","Eva Boratto","Yes, thanks for that Mike. Overall, obviously we feel really good about the momentum of our business and our execution here as we've continue to progress through '19. And what I'd say at this point is, we remain confident in the low single-digit growth that we provided at our Investor Day. That said, I just want to go back to a couple of the comments that I made in my prepared remarks, to contextualize some of the nature of the beat as well as the range I'd remind you that about $0.06 of that was distinctly 2019 items, such as capital gains and prior years development, and there are things that I wouldn't think about is the run rate or annualizing, if you will.","Michael Cherny","Perfect, Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee from Cowen. Your line is open.","Charles Rhyee","Yes, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about, if we think about the HealthHUBs strategy here and sort of we're basically trying to sort of redesign sort of the healthcare delivery experience for consumers here in this case. But that's the trend that we're seeing elsewhere and out there, and we have a number of private companies that have redesigned the primary care experience for employers and their members and their employees basically.","And when we think about the CVS strategy here, is this something where we're going to have to invest more heavily in terms of the internal sort of infrastructure basically to make more higher end experience or do you think in the future as we think about different types of people who will be going to the HealthHUBs will be stratifying sort of population and types that will want to go to a CVS versus want to have a different experience? Trying to think about how we should think about the market sizing and the opportunity here.","Larry Merlo","Yes. Charles, it's Larry. And I guess, a couple of points around that. First from a CapEx point of view in terms of the build out is, as we've said in the past, we're able to repurpose. I'll call it retail real estate capital that we've used in the past to the growth of the HealthHUB concept. So that is not of a concern in terms of an additional cost point of view.","The second point embedded in your question is, if you think about the assets that we have assimilated, we're going to be able to create a more seamless experience than what may exist out in the marketplace, when you think about the role that a Health Care Benefits place from a plan design, and the role that the PBM plays, and then obviously that all comes together in the community.","So, we think that will create an advantage for us against potential standalone competitors, and it goes back to the earlier point where I think that's where there is growing interest in terms of how we can work together in terms of the inbounds that are coming in from other potential partners. I think your third point is, look, as we think about the economics of that model beyond the build out obviously, we'll do that with the same financial discipline that we've done with anything else acknowledging that as Eva pointed out, you have three value drivers in there.","You have the value of the HealthHUBs as a standalone business entity, you have the value that's created in terms of reducing medical costs that accrues to Health Care Benefits. And then the value that's created in an open platform, I'll call it reseller model where we can partner broadly with others.","Charles Rhyee","That's helpful. And if I could just one follow-up. I'm not sure you touched on it, but obviously the Senate Finance Committee passed [indiscernible] their version of a bill with some proposed some significant changes in the Part D program. Just trying to get your thoughts on, how you view those changes? Do you think that that will create savings for seniors who are struggling with out-of-pocket costs? Thanks. And sort of the impact for you guys, as you think about the plan to - the program design change? Thanks.","Larry Merlo","Yes, Charles. Look, there are a lot of proposals across both chambers of Congress, if you will, at this point. And first of all, we share the goals and objectives of reducing healthcare costs, reducing drug costs further, okay and reducing consumers out-of-pocket costs, and we certainly advocate for those that we believe will in fact enable that.","To your point, there absolutely are tools that have been used in the private sector in the commercial business as well as Medicare Part D that can be applied more broadly in the market, and I would say that -- as it relates to drug pricing, it validates the role of the PBM and actually expands the tools that have been demonstrated to reduce drug costs. So I would say, on balance, we're encouraged by the proposals that we're seeing in terms of helping us do more not less.","Charles Rhyee","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Caliendo from UBS. Your line is open.","Kevin Caliendo","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Are you -- do you have any expectations for Pharma or what are your expectations for pharmacy reimbursement in the second half of the year? Do you expect it to remain sort of stagnant or flat, are you expecting any changes to that?","Eva Boratto","Hi, Kevin, this is Eva. I would say, we expect no changes from what we've communicated previously and as we've been trending through the year.","Kevin Caliendo","There's a question earlier about flu and I was thinking about this. In terms of, if we were to have a very severe flu season, when we think about the entire enterprise of CVS, would it be a positive or a negative given maybe the increased costs, but at the same time potentially increased sales through the pharmacy PBM, whatever? But how would you, when you think about that, how would you think about it in terms of the enterprise?","Larry Merlo","Kevin, I think it becomes - there becomes degrees of relativity in that question. And I would say, that it could end up falling both ways depending on where you put that on the relative scale. My point earlier is perhaps different than standalone competitors. We've got a natural hedge in our enterprise recognizing that we could have a headwind in one area and it's a tailwind in another area, and that provides a point of differentiation.","Eva Boratto","Yes the other way to think about it too is it would depend on hospitalizations, because if they are significant hospitalizations then it would tend to be higher medical costs which would outweigh the pharmacy script. But I think if it wasn't hospitalizations it might be, it could be potential like Larry said net neutral.","Kevin Caliendo","Great. Well, thank you so much, guys.","Larry Merlo","All right, thanks. We'll take two more questions, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Borsch from BMO Capital Market. Your line is open.","Matthew Borsch","Yes, thank you. I was hoping you could look -- I realize it's which too early for guidance for 2020, but when we think directionally about script volumes and the strike that you've been able to generate over at least the last couple of years, do you think you can continue that in 2020? I mean, you tapped a number of wells in particular getting on more networks and yield of the a lot from that and also medication adherence, do you have further to go that you think you can continue at this sort of rate?","Eva Boratto","Matt, this is Eva. I'll start, I'll go back to the comments that that we made at our Investor Day, and we do continue to see script growth as the key driver of our expected performance. And with our clinical services, we've been gaining market share with our rollout of the HealthHUBs ","We continue to expect to see that as an overall tailwind.","Kevin Hourican","Now, this is Kevin. I just have one piece of color, just the adherence opportunity is still very large for us and for the industry. Reports are that up to half of the people who begin maintenance medication will not actually beyond that medication a year later, due to a host of reasons, carefulness cost for some, and we're doing a lot to help save money for our customers to address the cost barrier and helping them with the forgetfulness piece through programs like home delivery and our script path program. So we see continued strength in here.","Matthew Borsch","And if I could ask one sub-question, I think your largest competitor is closing 200 stores in the U.S., do you know those locations, is that something that you could benefit from in any material way?","Larry Merlo","Yes. Matt, we saw the announcement this morning and we saw as part of that announcement the locations, were not disclosed.","Matthew Borsch","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And our final question today comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Your line is open.","Ralph Giacobbe","Thank you. Thanks for squeezing me in. I guess, the enrollment numbers specifically on kind of the commercial risk market have been, are under pressure for a little while. As we head into, and maybe get more clarity on sort of the selling season on the medical side for 2020, could you just give us any color on whether or not you expect that trend to sort of stabilize or maybe improve? And then how much of the value prop of the combined entity is sort of resonating or if it's just too early to tell at this point?","Eva Boratto","So I'll talk to the 2020 selling season. In the national accounts space, it's been a long season this year. We sell interestingly enough have, we're in active discussions with some very large customers on new business. We still have some large renewals. So it's really hard to predict what national accounts will look like for 2020 at this point. I would say the same thing about our Group Medicare business, our pipeline is still active, it's a very late season.","We have had some wins in our Group Medicare business and we also were able to successfully retain one of our largest, out to bid retiree medical account, and we were able to do a full replacement there, so we feel good about that. And we don't anticipate any significant terminations in our Group Medicare business. So that's what I'd comment on the 2020 season right now.","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay, thanks. And just one more quick one, could you give us just more of a sense of how the Long-Term Care business performed in the quarter and any detail on sort of underlying earnings power I guess in that business at this point? And just how you're thinking about that segment relative to the Board strategy? Thanks.","Jonathan Roberts","Yes. So this is Jon, I'll take that question. So we continue to make progress with Omnicare. As Eva said, we are ahead of plan. Our service is improving. That was a big opportunity and our clients see it and are pleased with our progress. As we're out competing for new business in the marketplace, I would say we are winning more than we have historically won over the last few years. And our retention of our existing business is improving, and that's primarily due to our improved service, but it's not where we want it to be and we're continuing to work on that.","And we're also finally making good progress on managing our costs. So we have more work to do. We continue to see opportunity to grow in independent and assisted living and our differentiated offerings in that space are helping us win in that part of the market.","Larry Merlo","Okay, so thanks Jon and look, just as a recap, we're at the midpoint of 2019 and first, we're very pleased with the strong financial results we've delivered in the first half of the year. They are demonstrating our ability to successfully execute on the priorities that we established in response to industry headwinds.","Second, it is still very early in our transformational journey, but I think you can see we're working quickly in the development of new products and services that will transform the consumer health experience and you're seeing tangible signs of those efforts. We've talked about that this morning. It's summarized in our slides.","And finally, all of this provides and gives us the confidence that we will be able to realize the potential of our innovative and powerful new business model delivering enhanced value to our clients, the consumers we serve and certainly our shareholders, and we'll look forward to talking more about that in the quarters to come.","So with that, thanks again for joining us today and have a great rest of the summer.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

Just before this call, we posted a slide presentation on our website that summarizes the information you will hear today, as well as key facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance. I encourage you to take a look at that. Additionally, we plan to file our quarterly report on Form 10-Q by the close of business today and it will be available through our website at that time.","During this call, we\u2019ll use some non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company\u2019s performance, mainly free cash flow, EBITDA and adjusted EPS. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find the definitions of these non-GAAP items as well as reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of our website. And, as always, today's call is being simulcast on our website and it will be archived there following the call for one year.","Now before we continue, our attorneys have asked me to read the Safe Harbor statement. During this presentation we'll make certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Accordingly, for these forward-looking statements, we claim the protection of the Safe Harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We strongly recommend that you become familiar with the specific risks and uncertainties that are described in the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our upcoming quarterly report on Form 10-Q.","And now I'll turn this over to Larry Merlo.","Larry Merlo","Well, thanks Nancy. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. Let me begin by saying that we are very pleased with the strong first quarter results. As expected, the influx of new generic drugs was a key driver of our year-over-year profit growth across the enterprise. And that said, both our retail and PBM segments delivered operating profit growth well above our expectations for the quarter. And this out performance was driven by stronger than expected script volumes due in large part to the strong flu season, strong specialty growth and favorable purchasing and rebate economics.","Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the quarter came in $0.83, that $0.03 above the high end of our guidance. And we also generated $1.3 billion in free cash flow and we remained committed to our disciplined approach to capital allocation, continuing to focus on returning significant value to your shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Now given our strong results in the first quarter and the fact that it is still very early in the year, we are narrowing our guidance range for 2013 by raising the low-end of the range $0.03. And Dave will provide the details of our guidance during his financial review. But please note that this guidance takes into account the expected impact on our Medicare Part D business from sequestration. And it also includes costs in our Med D business associated with resolving issues that arose following plan consolidation at the beginning of the year.","We now expect to achieve adjusted EPS for '13 in the range of $3.89 to $4. And with these first quarter results, the year is off to a great start. So with that, let me provide a business update and I will start with the PBM. As it relates to the 2014 selling season, it's still too early to provide a specific update at this time. From what we have seen to date, pricing remains competitive yet rational and we continue to be confident that we are in a great position in the marketplace with our unique products and services.","Our client interest in our Maintenance Choice offerings continues to increase. We now have about 16.3 million lives covered by more than 1200 plans that have implemented or committed to implement our Maintenance Choice offerings, and that\u2019s up from 15.8 million lives at our last update, and up from 10.5 million lives this time a year ago. Since we have introduced Maintenance Choice 2.0, a majority of this new growth is coming from this new plant option. And if clients continue to look for ways to manage and control costs, Maintenance Choice continues to be an attractive option generating savings of up to 4%. ","Our flagship clinical program, Pharmacy Advisor is succeeding and moving a significant portion of PBM members to optimal levels of medication adherence and a recent study showed that about half of members who were non-adherent before participating in Pharmacy Advisor actually became adherent within a year of being in the program. In addition, there was a 5.8% decrease in the prevalence of gaps in care for diabetics and we know that improving adherence to prescription regiments can lead to significant savings and better health. And a recent CBO report late last year estimated that a 1% increase in the number of prescriptions filled by Medicare beneficiaries would lead to a 20 basis point reduction in overall healthcare costs. And in 2012, we saved clients more than $643 million in their overall healthcare spend as a result of improved medication adherence for chronic conditions and our Maintenance Choice and Pharmacy Advisor programs contributed to these improved adherence rates and cost savings. ","Now with all the change on the horizon, what are we hearing from our clients? Well, we just completed our recent client advisory forum a few weeks ago. We had an opportunity to spend time with about 800 clients. Obviously they\u2019re very focused on the implementation and administration of the changes resulting from the Affordable Care Act while continuing to look for innovative ways to both lower costs and improve outcomes. And with our integrated breadth of assets across retail pharmacy where we interact with 5 million customers a day, our PBM as well as our medic clinics, we can engage with patients through our unique clinical programs to help drive better outcomes. And we are very well aligned with the goals of health reform and well positioned to be an important part of the solution.","Our clients are also looking for help in effectively managing the rapidly growing costs in specialty pharmacy. As we\u2019ve talked many times, we\u2019ve projected that spending on specialty drugs will grow 20% annually, double from 2010 to 2016 to more than $120 billion. And through a combination of technology, process, clinical programs, we are able to provide a variety of solutions to help our clients effectively manage their specialty spend while continuing to ensure access for these medications for the patients who need them the most. As an example our new specialty medical benefit program aimed to apply effective drug management for that portion of specialty flowing through the medical benefit. This is an area which has been largely unmanaged in the past due to the lack of transparency and it poses significant challenges to both employers and health plans.","Now we recently acquired a technology platform that helps us identify and capture cost savings opportunities for specialty drugs build onto the medical benefits and our focused specialty cost management will apply clinical -- accurate drug pricing, prior authorization and other targeted recommendations, including the most cost effective site of care. In addition, growing competition in pharma across many of the specialty categories represents another key opportunity for us to help manage client spend. You look at categories such as growth hormone, hepatitis C, rheumatoid arthritis, MS. We have opportunities to manage formularies and rebates so that our clients benefit. ","And I\u2019m happy to report that our specialty pharmacy business continued its healthy growth in the quarter, with revenues increasing nearly 20% versus the same quarter last year. And the specialty growth was driven by new PBM clients, new product launches, along with drug price inflation.","Now, we\u2019ve talked about the CMS sanction on our Medicare part D prescription drug plan during our last earnings call. We have been working closely with CMS to resolve the issues that arose after plant consolidation at the beginning of the year. We submitted a plan of action for CMS and we are making great progress against that plan. Now the sanction means that we cannot enroll new individual SilverScript members or market our SilverScript plan to potential individual members until the sanction is lifted. And the sanction will be lifted when CMS is satisfied that the issues are fixed, not likely to recur and clearly our goal is to have the sanction lifted before the next open enrolment period in the fall.","And again, the timing of that decision lies with CMS. Moving on to our retail business, we had another very strong quarter. Our goal is to retain at least 60% of scripts gained during the impasse between Walgreens and Express Scripts, and we are pleased with our results which are exceeding our expectations. In fact, our retention rate has not changed much for the past several months, so at this point we believe we have essentially achieved our steady states retention rate. And we remain very confident that we will continue to repaying at least 60% of the scripts in 2013.","During the quarter, total same store sales decreased 1.2%, and that was largely due to the significant impact from new generics on the revenue line. Pharmacy comps decreased 2.3%. However, script comps increased 2% when counting 90-day scripts as one, and increased 4.7% when counting 90-day supplies as three scripts. Our new generics had a negative impact of about 925 basis points on pharmacy comps in the quarter. And on the flip side, we had a notable benefit from a very strong flu season from both flu related scripts and flu shots which positively impacted pharmacy's same store sales in the quarter by about 90 basis points.","As for the front-store business, comps increased 1.4%. The absence of leap day had a negative impact on the front-store comps of about 120 basis points, while the timing of Easter had a positive impact of about 65 basis points. During the quarter, front-store traffic was down slightly while the average front store ticket increased notably. And the latest data shows that CVS has continued to gain front-store market share versus a year ago. When compared to drug and multi-outlet competitors, our front-store share growth in the first quarter was 120 and 10 basis points, respectively.","Turning to our real estate program. We opened 52 new or relocated stores, closed nine, resulting in 28 net new stores in the quarter. And this puts on pace to achieve our 2% to 3% square footage growth targets for the year. MinuteClinic recorded exceptional revenue growth in the quarter. Sales were up 50% versus the same quarter last year, and this was of course bolstered by the very strong flu season that we referenced earlier. And in addition to treating acute patients in the quarter, we continued to develop wellness programs along with programs aimed at monitoring chronic conditions. And the growth that we have experienced in MinuteClinic's non-acute services is helping to reduce the seasonality of the business.","We opened nine net new clinics in the quarter, ending the quarter with 649 clinics in 25 states in the District of Columbia. And our expansion plans called for the opening of 150 clinics this year and to end 2013 with just under 800 clinics. So with that let me turn it over to Dave for the financial review.","David Denton","Thank you, Larry, and good morning everyone. Today I will give \u00a0a detailed review of our first quarter results, then I will provide the guidance for the second quarter and update our full year 2013 outlook. But before I get to that, I want to highlight how we have been enhancing shareholder value through our disciplined capital allocation program. During the first quarter, we paid approximately $277 million in dividends and given our continued strong earnings outlook this year, we remain on track to achieve our targeted payout ratio of 25% by the end of this year, two years ahead of our original schedule.","Additionally, we have purchased approximately 7.4 million shares for approximately $393 million at an average price of $53.24 per share. And we still expect to complete $4 billion of share repurchases for the full year 2013. So between dividends and share repurchases, we returned approximately $670 million to our shareholders in the first quarter alone and we continue to expect to return approximately $5 billion for the full year. We generated approximately $1.3 billion of free cash in the first quarter, and we have made excellent progress in reducing our cash cycle. In fact, through the first quarter, we have taken nearly two weeks out of our cash cycle over the course of the last nine quarters.","The improvement has been greatest within inventory but all drivers have benefited from our increased commitment to extracting value from our value tree. We remain committed to further improvements as we look into the future.","Now given the issues we experienced following our Medicare Part D consolidation earlier this year, we may have some timing issues with respect to CMS payables and receivables that affect our cash flow delivery for this year. While we are maintaining our guidance for free cash flow of between $4.8 billion and $5.1 billion this year, we are working to offset this headwind to our free cash target and we\u2019ll update you on our progress on future earnings calls.","Now turning to the income statement, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations came in at $.83 per share, approximately $0.03 above the high end of our guidance. ","GAAP diluted EPS was $0.77 per share, and as Larry mentioned, the EPS beat was driven primarily by the higher than expected prescription volumes, due in large part to the intense flu season, strong growth in specialty and favorable rebate in purchasing economics. These positive drivers were partially offset by some below the line items, including higher than expected interest, a slightly higher tax rate and more shares outstanding. These were also partially offset by the impact of the previously announced Medicare Part D sanctions and the measures we have taken to resolve some of the issues we experienced following our Med D plan consolidation on January 1.","Now let me quickly walk you through the results. On a consolidated basis, revenues for the first quarter declined by 0.1% or approximately $35 million to $30.8 billion. Revenues were essentially flat which compared very favorably to our guidance for revenues to be down 2.5% to 4%. The increase in revenue in the PBM and retail segments were offset by significant increase in intersegment activity, primarily driven by the increased adoption of our Maintenance Choice program. Within the segments, PBM net revenues increased 0.1% or approximately $11 million to $18.3 billion. This growth was approximately 180 basis points above the high end of our guidance. The outperformance was driven by higher than anticipated claims volume, again primarily from flu and Maintenance Choice.","Specialty pharmacy was also a key revenue driver, primarily due to new clients, new products and drug cost inflation. This was mostly offset by the significant impact from new generics. In fact, PBM\u2019s generic dispensing rate increased nearly 400 basis points versus the same quarter last year to 80%."," Revenues in the retail business increased 0.2% in the quarter or approximately $27 million to 416.1 billion. New generic introductions also negatively impacted retail sales, with our retail GDR increasing approximately 310 basis points versus the first quarter of 2012 to 81%. The heavy incidents of flu and greater Maintenance Choice volumes drove the outperformance in retail sales.","Now turning to gross margin, we reported 18.1% for the consolidated company in the quarter, an increase of approximately 155 basis points compared to Q1 of \u201912.  Within the PBM segment, gross margin increased by approximately 85 basis points versus the same quarter last year to 4.2% while gross profit dollars increased approximately 25% year over year. This increase year over year was primarily driven by the large increase in GDR, higher volumes and better acquisition costs and rebate economics. These positive margin drivers were partially offset by price compression and costs in our Medicare Part D business associated with the issues that arose following plant consolidation at the beginning of this year.","Gross margin in the retail segment was 30.9%, up about 230 basis points over last year.  As with the PBM, this improvement was again driven primarily by the increase GDR.  Additionally, gross profit dollars increased 8.3% year over year within the retail business. The improved GDR also had an impact on expense leverage which was optically negative, while growth of expense dollars was in fact within normal parameters.","Total operating expenses as a percent of revenues increased approximately 60 basis points from Q1 of \u201912 at 12.6%, while total SG&A dollars grew by 4.7%. The PBM segment SG&A rate was flat to LY at 1.5%. This was primarily driven by benefits and lower cost from the streamlining effort. Partially offsetting these items were investments in Med D related to our ongoing remediation efforts. In the retail segment, SG&A as a percent of sales increased by approximately 85 basis points to 21.3%, while expenses grew by 4.3%. As expected, this too was mainly due to the deleveraging effect of the growth in generics. Within the corporate segment, expenses were up approximately $31 million to $199 million, primarily due to increased legal cost.","Now adding it all up, operating margin for the total enterprise improved approximately 95 basis points to 5.5%. Operating margin of the PBM improved approximately 80 basis points to 2.7%, while operating margin at retail improved about 150 basis points to 9.6%. For the quarter we beat our growth estimates for operating profit in both the retail and PBM segments. Retail operating profit increased a very healthy 18.5%, exceeding expectations by approximately 7 percentage points. The PBM businesses operating profit was once again very solid, growing 42.9%, nearly 12 percentage points above our guidance range.","Going below the line of the consolidated income statement, net interest expense in the quarter declined approximately $6 million from last year, to $126 million in the quarter. The debt refinancing we did in the fourth quarter was the primary driver of this decrease. Additionally, our effective tax rate was 39.2%, which was slightly higher than we expected. Our weighted average share count was 1.24 billion shares, also a little higher than anticipated. Combined, the variance versus our expectations and interest to tax rate and the share count, offset the over performance of this segment by about a penny.","Now let me update you on our guidance, and I will focus on the highlights and you can find additional details of our guidance in the slide presentation we posted on our website this morning. As we stated in the press release, we have narrowed our EPS ranges to reflect our first quarter performance. Our revised guidance also reflects the cost in our Medicare Part D business, associated with resolving issues that arose following plan consolidation at the beginning of the year as well as the estimated impact on our Medicare Part D business from sequestration.","With respect to sequestration, our understanding was that the 2% cut affects the direct subsidy payment received from CMS for plan members, including both [OIS] and (inaudible) members. However, the cut only impacts our captive, wholly insured PDP business which represents about $3.6 million of our Silver Script Medicare lies. All things considered, we have raised the low end our guidance by $0.03. We currently expect to deliver adjusted EPS in '13 in the range of $3.89 to $4 a share, reflecting excellent year-over-year growth of 13% to 16.5% after removing the impact in 2012 related to the early retirement, the extinguishment of debt.","GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operation is expected to be in the range of $3.54 to $3.75. We have increased our top line outlook and now expect consolidated net revenue growth of 1.75% to 3%. This guidance reflects the solid performance across the enterprise year-to-date and the range is 100 basis points higher than our previous guidance due to better volumes as well as specialty inflation. Guidance for operating profit growth in our retail segment has been raised while we have brought up the low end of the range in the PBM segment. We now expect retail operating profit to increase 7% to 8.5% year-over-year and PBM operating profit to increase 11% to 14%.","We now expect corporate expenses to be between $745 million and $760 million, a bit higher than our previous guidance due to higher legal expenses. However, it is in line as the percentage of consolidated revenue to our prior guidance, given the increase in revenue expectations. We are increasing our expectations for net interest expense for the year by approximately $20 million to account for some capital leases and we now expect between $495 million and $505 million of net interest expense.","We are increasing our weighted average share count forecast slightly to 1.22 billion shares, up from 1.21 billion shares. And as I said previously, our free cash flow guidance for the year remains in the range of $4.8 billion to $5.1 billion. However, we are working to manage through some cash flow headwinds largely due to Medicare Part D. and I\u2019m very pleased with our significant cash flow generation capability which should continue to play an important role in driving shareholder value both now and well into the future.","In the second quarter we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.94 to $0.97, reflecting growth of 16.25% to 20.25%, versus the same period of last year. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $0.88 to $0.91 in the second quarter.","Within the retail segment, we expect revenues to increase 0.75% to 2.25% versus the second quarter of last year. The revenue increase will be driven by solid volume growth, dampened somewhat by the continued growth in generic utilization. We expect same store sales to be essentially flat, with guidance for total same store sales in the range of negative 0.25% to positive 1%.","Script costs are expected to increase in the range of 1.5% to 2.5%. In the PBM, we expect revenue growth of between 0.5% and 1.5%, also impacted by volume growth that is dampened somewhat by generics. ","Operating profit in the retail segment is expected to grow 7.25% to 9% in the second quarter, while operating profit in the PBM segment is expected to grow 26.5% to 32.5%. So expect another very solid quarter as we look ahead.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Larry Merlo.","Larry Merlo","Thanks Dave and I think as you just heard it, Dave described this was a very solid quarter with strong financial results across the board and again the year is off to a great start. We continue to be excited by the opportunities to bring meaningful solutions to today\u2019s healthcare challenges and we strongly believe we are very well positioned to do so.","And with that, why don\u2019t we go ahead and open it up for your questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question coming from the line of Dane Leone with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question. ","Dane Leone - Macquarie Research","Congrats on a great quarter. I was just wondering if you could put out a ballpark EPS from sequestration just to help us understand how that hedge flows through the P&L and the direct reflection into the guidance update that you said.","David Denton","This is Dave. I can answer that generally. We\u2019re not going to give a specific number to that. I think what\u2019s important is that it doesn\u2019t affect all of our lives. It only affects those lives that are directly subsidized by the federal government and part of our capitated program which is about 3.6 million members. ","Dane Leone - Macquarie Research","I guess we can work through the math there. This is more of a high level question, so not to anyone specifically, but food for thought. We\u2019ve seen a very tepid employment recovery in the U.S. Sequestration is posing an additional headwind. We\u2019ve seen the overall unemployment rate hold steady but the labor participation rate has been dropping essentially implying that there would be more individuals on insurance population right now and that\u2019s actually increasing. When you speak about the 50% horizon in MinuteClinic, are you seeing a higher amount of uninsured come through clinic that\u2019s driving the demand volume there? And I guess maybe any broader color on how you see the cyclical strength in unemployment impacting the business would be great.","Larry Merlo","Yeah. As it relates to MinuteClinic, actually it's the opposite. We are seeing a growing number of MinuteClinic visits accompanied by some type of health insurance, which I think is really representative of the fact that it becomes a high quality lower cost option for employers, for health plans, and I remember in the early days we had about 20% of visits that were covered by some type of insurance. That number is approaching, it's not there yet, but it's approaching 90%.","In terms of the unemployment, I think we continue to see on the retail side a cautious consumer and we continue to look for differentiated ways to bring value to that consumer through our ExtraCare program. And I think on the PBM side, we have projected that utilization would be relatively flat and that\u2019s pretty much what we are seeing.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Robert Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Willoughby - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Larry or Dave, can you comment just on the renewal process for Caremark's pharmacy agreements with Walgreens. What's really changed in the dynamics here, what do bring new to that table that might afford you some leverage?","Larry Merlo","Well, Robert, I think while we don\u2019t talk about specific contracts, okay, I think we have continued to work with all of the providers in terms of bringing value to the overall equation in terms of providing access, and at the same time insuring that we are working on behalf of our clients to make pharmacy care affordable. And I think that that our management team has done a very effective job in that regard.","Robert Willoughby - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Any sense of how big Walgreens is in your pharmacy networks today from a volume perspective versus three years ago?","Larry Merlo","We are not going to get into these specifics. We haven\u2019t disclosed that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Matthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Two quick questions, if I could, on the PBM side. First of all, you maintained your claims guidance for the year I think despite somewhat better first quarter. If you could talk about the drivers thereof, I don\u2019t think sequestration would rally factor into volumes but any color there would be great.","David Denton","Yeah, this is Dave. Sequestration will not factor into volumes. So I think as you saw, we had a very solid first quarter from a volume perspective. I think you know, we are only a few months into the full year so I think our trends look promising but we don\u2019t see a trend that is changing substantially other than the fact that we again had a very solid flu season for the first -- like in the January- February period.","Matthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs","That\u2019s helpful. And secondly, just any update you can give us on the selling season to date and any impact that healthcare reform might be having on your clients as they think about [switching] renewing etcetera?","John Roberts","Yeah, Matt, this is John. As we talked to our employer clients, they are clearly focused on the administrative requirements for healthcare reforms. As an example, tracking hours for part-time employees. So I think as a result of that, we are actually seeing fewer RFPs in that part of the marketplace than we did a year ago. But when you look at the overall dollars that have come to the market, it's actually up a little bit.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Steven Valiquette with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Steven Valiquette - UBS","A couple of questions here. First, is this carry from the moratorium on the marketing for Part D, just to clarify, does that apply just Silver Script individual Part D or does that potentially impact some of the group Part D EGWPs as well?","Larry Merlo","No. it applies to the SilverScript. And keep in mind that we manage for our health plan customers their products and this does not apply to that segment.","Steven Valiquette - UBS","And then also just -- go ahead.","John Roberts","I\u2018m sorry, this is John. The other thing I would add is on EGWPs clients, they have people aging into their plans throughout the year. And so if we are able to administer that and enroll those people in Medicare.","Steven Valiquette - UBS","Just a quick question on the Medicare eligibles within the employer clients. The RDS or Retiree Drug Subsidy conversions to -- I\u2019m assuming you would probably convert either to EGWPs or to individual Part D just given your footprint. But just curious where we stand on that process, whether most of that may have already occurred by 1\/1\/13 or some of that is still ahead of us for 1\/1\/14?","John Roberts","This is John, Steve. So we did see some migration in 2013 to EGWPs. I think with the advent of thee healthcare reform, I think employers are going to continue to or will take a wait and see attitude to see how the exchanges perform, but over time we do expect to see a subset of the employer market either continuing to move their members into EGWPs or moving them potentially directly into the exchanges.","Larry Merlo","Steve, just to add one further point of clarity as it relates to your Med D question around SilverScript. We continue to work with employer customers who have an EGWP or who are planning to implement an EGWP to keep them updated on the status of the sanctions. We cannot market say to those EGWP clients until the sanction is removed.","Steven Valiquette - UBS","Most of those conversions presumably would happen on 1\/1\/14, right? So as long as you resolve it sometime in the next call it three to six months like you\u2019d talked about it shouldn\u2019t really impact the business at all as long as there is decent time before 1\/1\/14. Is that the way to think about that?","Larry Merlo","That\u2019s correct Steve and as we mentioned in our prepared remarks we have made great progress on our plan and that\u2019s exactly our goal, working closely with CMS.","Operator","Our next question coming from the line of Tiffany Kanaga with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Tiffany Kanaga - Citigroup","I'm calling from Deborah Weinswig's team. What do you expect for the cadence of share repurchases for the balance of the year in order to hit your $4 billion full year target?","David Denton","Tiffany, this is Dave. We\u2019re very committed to returning significance back to our shareholders, both in the form of dividends and share repurchases. I think our share repurchases were a tad light in the first quarter. We said that generally speaking that the cadence would follow the same pattern as last year. so I would anticipate if you just looked out, looked at last year, that cadence and compared it to what\u2019s left of the remaining of this year is probably the best way to model it at this point in time.","Tiffany Kanaga - Citigroup","Can you give us an update on how digital initiatives are driving topline and margins and how your strategy's evolving now that you appointed Brian as Chief Digital Officer?","Mark Cosby","This is Mark Cosby. I\u2019ll come from a couple of angles. Just overall digital a number of new things that have come into play over the course of the last little while. At the end of the last year we updated our digital site itself and it\u2019s significantly easier to use. We\u2019ve also done a couple of things from a mobile standpoint that have been big drivers for us. We launched a five star rated mobile application towards the tail end of last year that is performing very well for us. And then most recently this last month we came up with a version for the iPad which is essentially a virtual store. If you haven\u2019t used it I would encourage you to get on and try it. But it\u2019s also coming out with some rave reviews. So, all of these things in addition to some other initiatives that we have coming forward are enabling personalization. Digital is just one mechanism that we\u2019re using to drive that effort.","Larry Merlo","Tiffany, I\u2019d just add one point. I think that some of the things that Mark is alluding to has really advanced our digital capabilities. More from a utility or a utilization point of view versus a product point of view. And we have gotten very high marks from consumers on some of the more recent releases in terms of how this is making it easier for them to shop both in the front-store as well as the pharmacy.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your question.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","Two things, Larry. So when you think about the renewal of the wholesales relationships with McKesson and Cardinal, what was the thought process behind that, we are dealing with pretty basics, but the thought process, what you might be doing differently in those contracts that you weren\u2019t before? And then promise of daily delivery and whether you are playing around with that today?","Larry Merlo","John, I mean, as you know, we remain one of the largest purchasers of pharmacy in the country. We essentially buy all of our generics directly from manufacturers and consolidate the vast majority of brand purchases with our wholesalers and then engage them for deliveries to our stores between fill-in deliveries from our own distribution centers. And we are pleased with the results of the wholesaler RFP and was announced last week, we have contracts with both Cardinal and McKesson. They both do a great job for us and we feel that we are getting the best economics this way if it allows us to create, I will say, the most efficient network. And it also provides for us a safe, continuous and cost effective supply chain.","So we have always looked at the ways in which we can provide further innovation. And I am sure that we have got some pilots that are in the planning process, and, again, we are always open to ways in which we can take costs out of the supply chain and we will continue to push the envelope around that.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","Is daily delivery a thing of interest to you?","Larry Merlo","John, we have experimented with that in the past and we -- keep in mind the arrangements with our wholesalers provide daily delivery today. So, quite frankly, we are pretty pleased with the process that exists today. But, again, we will continue to push the envelope and look for new ways or perhaps changes in the marketplace that creates new opportunities.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","And then lastly, just on the front-end, would it be fair to say that front-end growth is basically flat and if you then think going forward -- because we keep hearing rumblings, competitive activity picking up a little bit. A lot of people are unhappy with their traffic. What do you see now and where do you think that goes if traffic remains light for a lot of these guys, lot of your competitors?","Larry Merlo","Look, John, maybe I will start here and then as Mark to jump in. The first quarter was -- on front traffic it was probably a little lumpy. We had acknowledged it was down overall. We got some benefits from the flu season early in the quarter but that was compromised by a lot of uneven weather patterns and then of course we were going up against having an extra day last year from leap day. And all that Mark talked about, some of the things that his team is working on, acknowledging that we continue to have this cautious consumer who is looking for value.","Mark Cosby","I think the other thing just to add, and Larry had it in his comments, was that the share, you know we picked up share in both, in drug world as well as outside in the multiunit world. So from that perspective it was good. The number one thing we are working on in the front to get traffic into a better place falls under the headline of personalization. I mentioned a few things when we talked about digital earlier. But it's all about providing unique engagement to the customers through all the ways that they use it. From service, products and promotion. ExtraCare is the piece, really the center piece of all that. As you know, we have a 15-year history with that program. It\u2019s very effective and we know through that 15 years that it\u2019s more than just issuing cards. That\u2019s the easy part. ","It\u2019s about the data that we use and how we engage with customers given what we know and been very successful over years, but not resting on our laurels. We had a couple of programs coming out over the last couple of years that have been effective for us. The Beauty Club that launched has been very effective. We also just two months ago launched a pharmacy and health rewards program which is about encouraging adherence, retention and acquisition. And then the biggest thing that we\u2019re doing that we talked about at Analyst Day was this program we call Conversion which is customer specific opportunities to drive frequency basket and profit growth. ","Two growth drivers there, what we call Pure Conversion, getting customers who are in our store today to buy more broadly across the store. And then the other piece that we call Share of Wallet which is about getting people to buy deeper within categories that they all already purchased in. both of those types of offers started a couple of months ago and have been extremely successful for us. As a subset of that, we\u2019re looking at ways to deliver more opportunities to our customers. We\u2019ve doubled the number of emails that we send out to customers, both from a subscription perspective and in terms of an offer perspective. And probably the biggest headline is what we\u2019re doing with this ExtraCare coupon center or what our bloggers call the magic red coupon machines. ","And the reason customers love this program is because they get the coupons before they shop as opposed to after they shop, which leads to three to five times the redemption of a normal receipt at the end of a transaction and then actually 15 times the redemption of what a normal SSI coupon would drive. And that has led to 40% increase in the number of offers and engagements of our customers within the store. So all of this falls under the headline of personalization that\u2019s just a tidbit of what we\u2019re working on. But those are the big things that we believe will drive both sales and profits, provide true differentiation versus what other folks are doing and will allow us to build on it over time.","Larry Merlo","Hey John, let me just underscore one point because we\u2019ve gotten a lot of questions because the royalty space is a lot more active today than it was a couple of years ago. And Mark mentioned that issuing the cards is the easy part and we know that because we\u2019ve probably issued more than 300 million cards over the life of ExtraCare. But what\u2019s a lot harder is driving real changes in consumer behavior and I think that Mark outlined an awful lot of activities that we have underway that really allow us to optimize our promotion and maximize incremental sales to drive share in a very effective and efficient pattern. And we have not seen any declines in our ExtraCare activity as a result of some of our competitors getting into the royalty space.","Operator","Our next question coming from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley","Have a couple questions. First of all on the selling season, John, I think you talked about the fact that the overall dollars are up a little this year despite the fact that RFPs are lower. So can you talk a little bit more, can you expand on what type of clients are you seeing this year. And yesterday it was reported that you won Blue Cross Blue Shield contract. Are you expecting to see more movement within the managed care side?","John Roberts","Ricky, so we have seen some health plans early on. I\u2019m not sure you\u2019ll see a lot more moves this late in the season, but CareFirst was a good example of a very sophisticated health plan. Very pleased to have been awarded the business for a 1\/1\/14 start and it\u2019s a full service contract for retail mail on specialty. So that being said it\u2019s still early in the season and we\u2019ll have more to say on our next call about how things are going. But fewer contracts. I think the contracts that are out there are obviously bigger if the dollars are slightly up.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley","So should we assume that it's just a bigger contract or not necessarily a large employer, but more --?","John Roberts","Yeah. I think you could assume that.","Larry Merlo","Ricky, I think one of the things we heard at the client forum that I alluded to, was that clients are very consumer with input -- with doing all the things that need to be done as part of the implementation of the Affordable Care Act in January. So I think we walked away with the sense that maybe there is some -- people have a lot on their plates right now.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then one technical question. When we model the impact from sequestration and the costs that are associated with the Part D, how should we think about it, like of where would it flow through your P&L? Does it flow through the PBM segment and if so, should we adjust kind of like the top line for sequestration? And then cost of goods for Part D?","David Denton","It does. Ricky, keep in mind that it was effected I think April 1, so it's really a nine month affect to it. I would say from a modeling perspective, it's probably -- you are probably not going to see it, it's just not big enough to call out that much.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley","Okay. So based on the number that you gave in the beginning of the call, we kind of like [did that standalone] somewhere on like the $0.02 to $0.05 drain. So are we in the ballpark or is the impact more muted than that?","David Denton","Ricky, I can't comment on that. But I think what would be important to do is, kind of go back and understand the fact that it covers nine months, it affects only the direct subsidy that we receive from the federal government for our Silver Script plan. And if you just kind of went back and look at the national bid, look at the member premiums and kind of do the math, you could get into the amount that\u2019s affected by the 2%. So I would encourage you maybe to do that math.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Ross Muken with ISI Group. Please proceed with your question.","Ross Muken - ISI Group","So you guys had a number of new innovative solutions on the PBM side over the last couple of months. With the 2.0 program and sort of what you are doing around specialty and specialty retail, I mean where are you seeing the most interest from the customer base particularly on the employer side for several of these offerings. And then also on the exchange side, as you think about some of the reform coming down the line, how do you feel like MinuteClinic is kind of playing into that piece? And do you feel like that strength there gives you any advantage for that sort of opportunity?","Larry Merlo","Yeah, Ross, let me start here and then John will jump in. But, again, just coming back from our client forum a few weeks ago, I was very excited in terms of, some of the things that you have mentioned, whether it's Maintenance Choice 2.0, all of the specialty initiatives that we have underway and as well as the interest in MinuteClinic, I came back and said, the things that we are working on are very, very much aligned with what clients are most worried about and looking for solutions. And I will let John pick it up from there to get little more specific.","John Roberts","So when we talk to clients on what their priorities are, it's obviously managing cost for both the plan and the number. So I think that\u2019s why Maintenance Choice has been so embraced by the marketplace. And Larry talked about the growth from where we were in '12 up to $16.3 million numbers in '13. Combined with Maintenance Choice we are seeing interest in narrow networks, preferred networks. Again, I think clients are looking for ways to manage their direct cost. The other thing that clearly is a top priority is specialty. And we have talked about the trends in specialty, the clients are seeing that it's becoming a bigger part of their overall drug spend, and half of it is somewhat hidden under the medical benefit. So as we talk to clients about our capabilities to manage specialty across both pharmacy and medical, there is a high level of interest. And we actually have employer clients that are working with us with their health plans to move programs forward to manage that.","And I think the last thing I\u2019ll mention is employers get the value of keeping their members on medication and lowering overall healthcare costs. So that\u2019s really our Pharmacy Advisor program and everything we\u2019re doing around adherence. The fact that we\u2019ve expanded. We now have 10 conditions on our Pharmacy Advisor program. We now have Pharmacy Advisor in Medicare to help our clients with their Stars programs. And then just to what Larry said around MinuteClinic, for our clients we can offer a reduced copay or a zero copay for their members. So we\u2019re able to extend the benefits to their members at no additional cost, make primary care more accessible for them. So it\u2019s really a win, win, win. But that\u2019s what we\u2019re hearing from our clients around what their priorities are.","Operator","Our next question coming from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan Chase & Co. ","Larry, I was wondering if could you maybe give us your initial thoughts around ACA from the drug retail side and maybe if Mark wants to chime in, are you signing early preferred type relationships on the Retail Pharmacy side, whether it's with managed care entities or some of the private exchanges? How should we think about Retail in 2014, 2015, as these exchanges are rolling out?","Larry Merlo","Lisa, it\u2019s a great question and obviously there are an awful lot of discussions taking place. And I would talk about the fact that those discussions are being had in CVS Caremark, that we can do much more than just provide a retail distribution point for exchanges in their members. And it really picks up where John left of in terms of an awful lot of very robust conversations in terms of the role that retail pharmacy plays along with the role that our MinuteClinics play when you think about providing primary care and chronic care support. So I think we\u2019re probably still a little early to talk about anything definitive. But an awful lot of interest in terms of what CVS Caremark can offer. ","I think specifically as you think about retail, I think that if you go back to the implementation of Medicare Part D I think pharmacists across the country played a key role in terms of educating and helping seniors enroll in the Medicare Part D program. And I certainly see a role that our pharmacists can and will play around education and information for members or potential members as they think about what it is that they are going to need to do to enroll in exchanges. And we\u2019re certainly looking to be very active from an education and infuriation perspective.","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan Chase & Co. ","So Larry, would you anticipate that we will see -- we have talked to some of the managed care guys that have said hey there's 68,000 retail pharmacies, we probably don't need that many. They can envision doing half of the retail pharmacies and having someone like a CVS as an anchor. Are those the conversations that you're having at this point and do you think that's the direction it will move in or is it too early to say because we're very early in the discussion?","Larry Merlo","Yeah, I think it\u2019s still too early. I think that the discussions that we\u2019ve had probably across the gambit of all different possibilities. My sense is that at least for this first year it\u2019s going to be a learning laboratory for everyone. And I think that there\u2019s probably -- my sense is that there\u2019ll probably be a little more conservatism in terms of how people think about it until some of those learnings kick in and people can be perhaps a little more definitive in terms of where the market is headed.","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan Chase & Co. ","And then I guess my second question just would be around specialty. Clearly great growth in specialty. Continues to be something that plan sponsors are looking for. Can you help us understand how many of your customers buy specialty from you today on the PBM side? So what are the future opportunities? One, is it expansion to the rest of your PBM customers? Two, opportunities for restrictive networks around specialty? How do we think about that opportunity over the next couple of years? Thanks.","Mark Cosby","So Lisa, I would think about it in two buckets. One is with our employer clients, the vast majority of employer clients have exclusive arrangements with us around specialty. So all of their specialty spend is going through our channel. With health plans, they tend to take an approach of having several specialty providers and we work with those health plans to make sure that we are getting not only our fair share, but with our capabilities, more than our fair share. And so they may limit it two providers to half a dozen providers.","And then you have the open market where those numbers can really go really anywhere. And I think that links in to what we are doing with our integrated specialty solution. And we have got people that are calling on these specialty positions talking about our capabilities and working with them to get those referrals into our channels because we are easy to do business with, for the physician and for the member. So I think you are going to see -- we think specialty is going to be one of the fastest growing areas because if you look at the drug pipeline, in 2016 eight of the top ten drugs by revenue are going to be specialty. That\u2019s clearly where pharmas focus from a pipeline perspective. And I think you are going to see not only new drugs in the same categories but I think you are going to see the expansion of the drugs into new categories of specialty.","So I see tremendous growth which is why we are as focused as we are on a holistic approach and solution to specialty, so that we can manage the member as they progress in their disease state from a pharmacy benefit to a medical benefit than in managing appropriate care, appropriate therapy and making sure they are getting their specialty med at the most cost effective site.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays Capital. Please proceed with your question.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital","I think I am still a little bit confused about things you expect to happen in Medicare Part D at the end of the year. Obviously, there is sequestration. I think you have been clear about which of your members will be impacted by it. I guess I am little less clear about the guidance you have given and what that reflects in terms of the sanctions from CMS. Is there something in your guidance that is assuming some probability that you don\u2019t get this resolved before the next selling season? Or are there just other costs associated with that in the numbers?","David Denton","Meredith, first and foremost, I think that is largely a 2014 topic as it relates to our ability to accept auto assignees in the back half of the year. So it's not really more but it's not really a '13 issue, it's more of a '14 issue. Clearly, our guidance is comprehensive of all the cost and effort that we think is required to, one, correct the situation, and two, insure that the situation will never happen again, and three, go through any remediation effort that we need to get done to make sure that our members are served appropriately and CMS is satisfied that we are fully in compliance and we have no issues.","And, finally, it does assume that we are not adding any additional lives. Because we at this point of time cannot mark it from a Silver Script perspective and so there is no lives being added to our book. In fact lives, due to attrition, are slightly declining month over month. And it maybe -- Meredith, the sequestration question keeps coming up. So maybe I will take a step back and give you a little bit of color on that. And just to put this in perspective, sequestration as it relates to our Silver Script insurance business for the nine months, is probably going to impact us to the tune of $0.01 to $0.02, somewhere in that ballpark is probably a good estimate at this point in time. As it relates to -- again, that's the effect of government sequestration on business for this year.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital","Well, I guess I am just so struggling to understand, you have had a fantastic first quarter, and congratulations, and guidance for the second quarter is above where the Street is. So I am just kind of struggling to know why the year didn\u2019t change, it's not very big impact from sequestration unless you think the cost in terms of the sanctions are going to up substantially --","David Denton","Well, Meredith a couple of things. First and foremost we\u2019ve said very clearly that our performance for this year is going to be somewhat front half loaded versus back half loaded due to the influx of generics and the timing of the break open status of those generics. And so you\u2019re seeing that play out. Secondly we do -- as we said, we do have some costs in the back half of the year and the first half certainly through the first quarter a lot of that was related to the incidents of flu volume being pretty high, driving volume. We\u2019re again just a few months into the year. I think our outlook looks very solid. But I think it\u2019s just too early to predict how the rest of the year is going to play out. We\u2019re very comfortable with where we stand, but we\u2019re -- I think as you know we\u2019re one quarter in to a four quarter year and we\u2019re going to play this out.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital","That's very helpful.","Larry Merlo","And Meredith, as you know, we have not raised guidance based on first quarter results for the reasons that Dave mentioned in terms of we still have most of the year still ahead of us. And as Dave mentioned, we remain very confident in our guidance and outlook for the year. But that\u2019s something that we\u2019ll continue to obviously talk about as we get more of the year behind us.","Operator","Our next question coming from the line of Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse","Nice quarter. Dave, just to start off, a quick question for you on the free cash flow guidance. I guess the tone of your voice sounds like maybe there is a little risk around that if you can't mitigate the CMS stuff. Is that fair? Are we talking about a material number or is it small?","David Denton","Well, I think as you know we had -- we\u2019re not changing our guidance from a cash flow perspective. As we said clearly at the first of the year we had some systems issues that affected our Medicare Part D business and the result of that is really changing where we anticipated our receivables and payables to be at the end of this year with the federal government. So it\u2019s really more of a timing issue as it relates to \u201913 versus \u201914. I\u2019d say we\u2019re working hard to offset those and we\u2019re optimistic that we can do that, but I just want to make sure that everybody understands where we stand at this point in time.","Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse","And then Larry, just a question for you on adherence. You talked about the savings. My question for you is how do you really measure that? How do you market that to clients and actually get paid for it? Is it just in your scripts or is it in additional PBM wins or is there some other way?","Larry Merlo","Let me start then. Again John will jump in here. But we have built a pharmacy care economic model where we can actually evaluate on a client by client basis, looking at claims. The opportunities that we believe we have to improve adherence and a corresponding benefit in terms of overall healthcare costs. And we\u2019re actually beginning to guarantee savings associated with that. And quite frankly it\u2019s very consistent with what you\u2019re seeing in the star ratings in the Medicare program in terms of this aspect of clinical if you will being a component of that evaluation.","John Roberts","This is John. To add to that, PBM traditionally have managed bad trends and we continue to do that and clients want us focused on that. But they also realize the good trends or having their members take more medication lowers overall healthcare cost. So we\u2019re able to as Larry said show into a specific client and with the pharmacy care economic model show where their members are, what the opportunity is and if we get them in here what the medical savings are. There\u2019s buy-ups for certain programs and we guarantee returns for their investments. And clearly when you say are we seeing more wins in the market? As the market moves to taking more risk for overall healthcare costs, we believe this program offers a competitive advantage. We publish our results around Pharmacy Advisor in peer reviewed journals. Troy Brennan, I think has done a terrific job, our Chief Medical Officer, in validating our activities and publishing those results so that they are credible from a client perspective. I think that does lead to more wins in the marketplace, particularly for those clients that are assuming more risk with healthcare reform.","Larry Merlo","And I think what we are talking about here is really the beginning of what will be a new, I\u2019ll call it reimbursement model, okay. That really ties to outcomes management, people have been talking about this for years, but no one has figured out a way to quantify it. And we believe -- not believe, we know we are on the leading edge of actually building the underpinnings with which to do that as we go forward. And it think that we are probably in the first or second inning of the nine inning game here, but we believe that this is a big idea in where the market needs to head when you think about the rising costs of healthcare and what clients are expecting from us. And, quite frankly, what they pay us to do for them and their members. ","Maybe, we will take two more questions, I think.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Tom Gallucci with Lazard Asset Management. Please proceed with your question.","Tom Gallucci \u2013 Lazard Capital","I guess first question is on the purchasing and the rebate economics. I am not sure I heard you really get into what some of those drivers were. Are we talking about some of the formulary changes that you made or other benefit design changes that the clients are making? Can you help us understand where that\u2019s coming from?","David Denton","Again, we continue to -- this is Dave, and I will ask John to chime in here a little bit. We continue to push each and every day on how to more (inaudible) for the clients and members that we serve. Part of that is through how they go back and work with either branded manufacturers or generic manufacturers to lower cost or increase the rebate yield. And I think we continue to be pretty successful in that area. And this is probably not one answer at the end of the day. There is a lot of things that are across our business that we are doing. Whether that be changes in our formulary, whether that be changes in our UM program, whether it be how we tailor our programs to drive value in this area.","John Roberts","Yes. So there is two ways to drive value. One is through rebates, which the vast majority of that value gets passed to our clients and we do that through our formulary strategy which has been very successful. And making sure appropriate branded drugs area available but we negotiate very aggressively with manufacturers to bring the net cost down for our clients. The other thing is, with all the generics that have come to the market over the last couple of years, there are now, in most therapeutic categories, enough generics that provide appropriate level of care. So we also have available for our clients, what we describe as a value formulary which limits even further branded drugs that are available and boosts the overall generic fill rate across that clients book of business and deliver savings in that way.","So we offer programs that have a lot of flexibility that deliver a lot of savings and value for our clients and we continue to work very hard to bring them new value each and every year.","Tom Gallucci \u2013 Lazard Capital","And then another topic, you have touched on a little bit but I wondered if you could go a little bit more in depth. You are hearing a lot more out there, especially with some of the competition about having the medical benefit and the pharmacy benefits under one roof to more effectively manage, particularly the specialty area. I thought it was interesting I think about CareFirst release, they talked about your supported integrating pharmacy data and their data. Can you talk about some of your capability as how you sort of sell against the in-house model in this area?","Larry Merlo","Yes. So our capabilities allow us, and I will talk about CareFirst because we think supporting our clients in this integrated model makes a lot of sense. And PBM is traditionally managed specialty under the pharmacy benefit and the health plan has managed specialty under the medical benefit. And as that member moves across those benefits there's handoffs that have taken place. So our capabilities now allow us on behalf of CareFirst, to manage that specialty part of their spend and those members much more effectively than they were in the past. I think as a standalone PBM, we can do the same thing. And we can integrate with employers\u2019 health plans to do the very same thing. So it really, with large employers they have multiple health plans. So, we think our model resonates because they have one provider managing that overall spent. With the smaller employers that may have a single health plan, we think partnering with our health plans to provide those same services makes sense for that book of business too. So we can support both ways and we think both ways are very effective.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is coming from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research","In your prepared remarks you talked a couple of times about favorable rebate economics. I am curious if you could give us a little bit of color or further color on what that is referring to? And also interested if the generic payback period and where that trend goes from here in terms of generic benefit, how that should play out from here as we work through year and into next year?","David Denton","Well, this is Dave, Eric. Maybe I will kick it off and ask John. Again, I think from a rebate perspective, again, it's a lot of little things that we are doing across our book of business to drive favorable economics for our clients. And this gets back to very specifically focusing on the formulary verse specifically focusing on the _ leveraging all the programs that we have in place to drive value for our members and the clients. And that drives again rebate performance. That drives back a little bit to reducing cost of goods sold for our clients. And we shared some of that. I think from a generics perspective we\u2019re in a very heightened time period which the generic utilization continues to expand. The generic pipelines do look robust for quite frankly for the next several years. We\u2019re working very effectively across our book of business, not only to drive economics in generics, but also improve performance from a generic penetration adherence perspective. And I think all of those drive value for us and for our clients. ","Larry Merlo","Eric, let me just add one point to what point Dave mentioned and it goes back to the formulary because we still get questions every now and then. We had a lot of noise two years ago when we made the formulary changes that as we\u2019ve acknowledged many times that the strategy was absolutely spot on and I think that your question is really an extension of what clients are now experiencing at the benefit of that strategy. I think what we had acknowledged was right strategy. We needed to do a better job from an execution point of view, largely tied to the timing of the communication. So the clients have certainty around the new plan year and all the changes that would take place. So that was a good learning for us. But I think that we\u2019re seeing the financial benefits of that as we speak. ","Listen, I\u2019ll just wrap up here. And we certainly appreciate everyone\u2019s time today, appreciate the questions. I think the questions had been very much aligned with where we\u2019re making investments in the business, investments that are aligned with our clients\u2019 expectations and needs. And while we know we have many challenges ahead of us in the healthcare space we are certainly excited by the opportunities that we have to bring meaningful solutions. So thanks for your time again this morning and we\u2019ll talk to you soon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

The slide summarizes the information you will hear today as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance. Additionally, our quarterly report on Form 10-Q will be filed by the close of business today and it will be available on our website at that time.","Please note that during today\u2019s presentation, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. By their nature, all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements for a number of reasons we described in our SEC filings including the Risk Factors section and cautionary statement disclosures in those filings.","During this call, we\u2019ll also use some non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company\u2019s performance including free cash flow and adjusted EPS. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find the definitions of these non-GAAP items as well as reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of our website.","And as always, today\u2019s call is being simulcast on our website and it will be archived there following the call for one year.","And now, I\u2019ll turn this over to Larry Merlo.","Larry Merlo","Thanks, Nancy. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us to hear more about the terrific third quarter results we posted this morning. Overall, we met or exceeded our expectations on every key measure-performance. Our adjusted earnings per share increased from 9% to $1.15 per share, a penny above the high end of our guidance range. Both the PBM and retail segments exceeded our revenue expectations along with the retail business delivering expanded gross margin. Operating profit in the retail business grew 8.8% at the high end of our expectations while operating profit in the PBM grew 8.5% exceeding our expectations. ","In the PBM, our performance was primarily attributable to stronger than expected claims volume and favorable purchasing economics. Additionally, we generated $1.4 billion free cash in the quarter and given the favorable tax effect of the debt extinguishment we are increasing our guidance range for free cash flow for the full year by approximately $200 million to $5.7 billion to $6 billion.","Now given our strong performance, we are also narrowing this year\u2019s adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $4.47 to $4.50 and that\u2019s from a range of $4.43 to $4.51 and again excludes the cost this quarter associated with the early extinguishment of debt. ","And Dave will provide the details behind our financial results and guidance during his review. So with that let me turn to the business update and I\u2019ll start with the 2015 CVM selling season which I\u2019m pleased to report has continued its growth trajectory.","Gross wins for \u201915 currently stand at 6.4 billion and that\u2019s up 1 billion from our last update with net new business standing at 3.1 billion up 500 million from our previous report. And let me point out that this excludes any impact from our SilverScript PDP. ","Now pricing this selling season remain competitive yet rational and our business wins reflect growth in the employer, health plan and government sectors and our success again reflects our track record of generating savings for appliance through our suite of unique capabilities.","Now, when you look at the 3.3 billion in business we lost, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that about 50% was lost through acquisition and another 25% was attributable to clients moving some of their members, primarily retirees into the open market and through our strategic relationships with health plans along with our competitive SilverScript product offering we believe we are well positioned to capture beneficiaries enrolling in open market plans. So we\u2019re very pleased with the selling season and our team is already ramping up for what we expect to be another successful welcome season for early 2015.","Now as per 2015 renewals, we\u2019ve completed more than 80% of the 26 billion in business up for renewal with the retention rate of just over 96%. Our clients continue to be very focused this season on achieving better control of specialty spend and we continue to differentiate our specialty offerings to provide a high level of clinical support to patients while managing trend for our clients and driving continued share gains in the business. Our specialty revenues were up about 53% year-over-year driven by new business, the high cost Hep C drug Sovaldi along with the addition of the Coram infusion business.","Now through Q3 numerous clients have signed up for our site-of-service management product that\u2019s enabled by the acquisition of Coram earlier this year. And we also continue to see client interest in adoption of our medical pharmacy management offering enabled by the acquisition of NovoLogix. So we remain optimistic that we can continue to gain specialty pharmacy share and you\u2019ll hear a lot more about our strategy to capitalize on existing opportunities at Analyst Day. ","Now before turning to retail, let me touch briefly on our Med-D product SilverScript. As expected, we currently have about 3 million lives in our individual PDP and we expect to end the year with about the same amount with monthly add-ins from new chooser enrollments and dual auto assignments expected to offset normal monthly attrition and we\u2019ll update these numbers early next year as we get the result of open enrollment and along with the low income subsidy of signees. But we continue to see significant opportunity to grow the individual PDP business over the long-term and are pleased with our product positioning in the market for 2015.","Now moving on to the retail business, which again produce solid results and let\u2019s talk first about pharmacy. Continuing the strong trend that we saw in the second quarter, we once again gain pharmacy share in Q3. Year-over-year our pharmacy market share increased about 40 basis points on a 30 day equivalent basis. Pharmacy same store sales increased 4.8% versus the same quarter last year while pharmacy same store scripts increased 5.1% again on a 30 day equivalent basis. ","Now, these strong pharmacy same store sales include the negative impact of approximately 190 basis points due to recent generic introduction and another 190 basis points from the implementation of Specialty Connect which transfers specialty scripts from our retail segment to our PBM segment.","As expected we\u2019ve seen no discernible impact on our pharmacy business from the decision to exit the tobacco category and I\u2019ll come back to that in a minute. Regarding health reform, not much is new since our last update and we continue to see a modest positive benefit to our script transform reform and that\u2019s largely from the expansion of Medicaid. Our overall pharmacy margins increased again this quarter and we\u2019re in line with our expectations and on our last call I talked about the impacts of generic inflation and pharmacy reimbursement pressure and given all the market commentary I want to reiterate those comments again today which are reflected in our third quarter results.","Recall that when we gave our \u201914 guidance last December, we told you that we expected continued pressure on pharmacy reimbursement. And the market is generally consistent with what we anticipated. As to generic inflation, while cost of goods inflation does exist on selected generic items, the deflationary nature of the generic market remains intact and within our expectations. Now there has also been a lot of discussion in the market about Medicare Part D plan designs that impact retail pharmacy network so let me touch on that as well.","First, let me remind you that this is an annual process. And in 2014, CVS is preferred provider in five of the top 10 Med D plans and that's based on lives. For 2015, CVS has contracted with 20 regional and national Part D plans where CVS is positioned as a preferred provider. Now we have taken a disciplined approach to participation in these networks ensuring that market impression and share analysis provides the right economics.","Now turning to the front store, we saw a continued decrease in traffic that was partially offset by an increase in the average customer ticket. Our front store comps were down 4.5% and adjusting for the tobacco compact costs would have been approximately 480 basis points higher. We are tracking in line with where we expected to be with respect of the front store impact of our decision to exit tobacco. And if you normalize this quarter for the tobacco exit, in the second quarter for the Easter shift, our pro forma front store comp performance reflects a modest sequential improvement from Q2. Additionally, we produced a solid improvement in front store margins in the quarter. It is important to note that less than one-third of our front store margin improvement was driven by the absence of lower margin tobacco sales with the rest of the improvement reflecting our strategy of driving store brand sales in making responsible investments in promotion.","And for the past two years now, we have been talking about utilizing extra care in differentiated ways to balance sales and margin growth. We continue on that trajectory and you will hear more about our plans next month. As for store brand sales, we saw notable gains in Q3. Store brands represented 20.1% of front store sales and that's up about 210 basis points from Q3 last year with gains across health, beauty, general merchandise and edibles. Now roughly half of the improvement in store brand penetration relates to the exit from tobacco as there is zero store brand penetration in the category. And we see significant opportunities to continue to expand our share of store brand products by building on our core equities and health and beauty while also seeking opportunistic growth in other categories.","Now turning to store growth on September 4, we completed the acquisition of Navarro, the largest Hispanic-owned drugstore chain in the U.S. In addition to acquiring the 33 Navarro stores, we also opened up 45 new CVS pharmacies, relocated 13, closed 4, resulting in 74 net-new stores in the quarter and we are on track to achieve square footage growth of 2% to 3% for the year.","As for CVS\/MinuteClinic, we opened 76 net new clinics in the quarter, adding two new states, New Mexico and Nebraska in several new markets. We ended the quarter with 936 clinics in 30 states plus the District of Columbia and we expect to open more than 30 additional clinics in Q4. Now CVS\/MinuteClinic has steadfastly continued on its strong growth trajectory. In the quarter, revenues and customer visits increased more than 25% and 30% respectively versus the same quarter last year and we also added eight new health system affiliations throughout the quarters bringing the total number of affiliations for CVS Health to 44 across the country. So CVS\/MinuteClinic continues to build a platform that supports primary care by providing integrated high-quality care that is convenient, accessible and affordable. Now before turning it over to Dave, I also want to update you on the progress that has been made by the very talented team we've assembled at Red Oak Sourcing, our venture with Cardinal that formed the largest generic sourcing entity in the U.S.","With its combined volume and capabilities, this new relationship will help spur innovative purchasing strategies with generic manufacturers along with enhancing supply chain efficiencies. To date, Red Oak has met with above 40 suppliers covering more than 90% of the cumulative generic spend. Manufacturers continued to be transitioned from the legacy purchasing programs of both CVS and Cardinal to the new Red Oak purchasing platform. And we are extremely pleased with our progress to date and we look forward to Red Oak's future contributions. So with that, let me turn it over to Dave for the financial review.","Dave Denton","Thank you Larry and good morning everyone. This morning I will provide a detailed review of our solid third quarter results followed by an update on our guidance including the first look at our fourth quarter guidance. But before I do that though let me begin as I typically do and highlight how our disciplined approach the capital allocation continues to enhance shareholder value. ","During the third quarter, we paid $324 million in dividends to our shareholders. We have already surpassed the 25% dividend payout level and we are making continued good progress towards achieving our 35% payout target by 2018. Additionally, we will purchase more than 10 million shares for approximately $800 million at an average price of $78.51 per share. Year-to-date we've repurchased more than 37 million shares for $2.8 billion and we still expect to complete at least $4 billion of share repurchases for the full year of '14. So between dividends and share repurchases, we have returned more than 1.1 billion to our shareholders in the third quarter alone and return more than 3.7 billion during the first three quarters of the year. Our goal has been to return more than 5 billion in 2014 and we remain on track to meet that goal. ","As Larry said, we generated more than $1.4 billion of free cash in the third quarter bringing our total for the first nine months of the year to approximately $3.6 billion. The key driver continues to be our healthy growth in earnings coupled with continued improvements in our retail cash cycle fueled mainly by performance and payables. All in, we now expect to generate free cash flow between $5.7 billion and $6 billion in 2014 up from our prior guidance of $5.5 billion to $5.8 billion driven in large part by the tax benefit associated with loss on the early extinguishment of debt.","I want to note that there is a chance that our cash flow delivery for the year may come in even stronger than our new guidance that I said today, as we may receive some late year repayments a few days early. However, anything we generate for 2014 above our new guidance is likely to be simply a pull forward from 2015.","We will keep you posted of our progress and update you with any new information on Analyst Day. ","Now turning to the income statement, adjusted earnings per share from continued operations came in at $1.15 per share up 9% year-over-year and a penny above the high end of our guidance range. As we anticipated in our guidance this includes a $0.03 negative impact to earnings per share from our decision to exit the tobacco category.","As Larry said our earnings reflects strong growth across both of our operating segments. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.81 per share. Now as you know in September we retired some long term debt replacing that with debt at lower interest rates. We bought back $2 billion in an average rate of 6% and replace it with five and 10 year notes totaling $1.5 billion at an average rate of 2.74%. By replacing this portion of our debt at lower rates we\u2019re likely to see a $0.01 benefit this year from a reduction of interest expense and should see an incremental improvement in our annual interest expense for about $0.03 next year using today\u2019s share count.","There was a cost of $521 million in the third quarter associated with the retirement of these outstanding notes or approximately $0.27 per share and as Nancy said this debt extinguishment and the associated cost were not included in our prior guidance.","So with that let me quickly walk you through our underlying results. ","On a consolidated basis, revenues in the third quarter increased 9.7% or approximately $3.1 billion to $35 billion. PBM net revenues increased 15.7% to $22.5 billion. The strong performance was driven by net new business, specialty pharmacy growth, branded drug inflation and product mix.","Offsetting this to some degree were lower mail choice claims reflecting the continued decline in traditional mail order volumes and an increase in generic dispensing. The PBM\u2019s generic dispensing rate increased to approximately 180 basis points versus the same quarter of LY to 82.5%.","Compared with our guidance PBM revenues were slightly favorable to the high end due to stronger network volume and the delay the couple of generic launches that were expected to occur during the third quarter. As we noted last quarter with the implementation of Specialty Connect we have transferred revenues out of the retail pharmacy segment and into the PBM segment as the PBM took over the dispensing of nearly all specialty prescriptions filled by CVS Health.","Given the high cost of specialty drugs, this transition had a larger impact on sales dollars than script volumes as expected. The impact on sales dollars in the third quarter was approximately $210 million and we expect a similar impact in the fourth quarter. As expected, the shift enhanced year-over-year top line growth in the PBM by approximately 115 basis points while dampening revenue growth at retail. As Larry said it had a 190 basis point negative impact on retail pharmacy comps but keep in mind that it had an insignificant impact on retail script volumes.","Overall revenues in the retail business increased 3.1% in the quarter to $16.7 billion. Sales in the retail segment were better than expected driven primarily by product mix, volumes and the delay of the generic launches that I just mentioned.","Compared to the third quarter of last year, retail GDR partially offset these positive factors increasing by approximately 180 basis points to 83.3%. Retail revenue growth was also dampened by the exit from the tobacco category that was fully complete at the beginning of September. As anticipated, front store cost would have been approximately 480 basis points higher if tobacco and the estimated basket sales were excluded from both this year and last year.","In fact, looking at the retail segment, total revenues and adjusting for both the impact from tobacco as well as the impact from Specialty Connect pro forma growth would have been 6.5% a pretty solid performance.","Turning to gross margin the consolidated company posted an 18.5% margin for the quarter, a decline of approximately 40 basis points compared to Q3 of '13. This margin decline was the result of a mix shift as the lower margin PBM segment grew faster than the retail segment. Furthermore, this trend was accelerated as we experienced a modest decline in the PBM\u2019s gross margin. And within the PBM segment, gross margin declined approximately 40 basis points versus the same quarter of LY to 6.2% while gross profit dollars increased approximately 8.4% year-over-year.","The decline in margin year-over-year was primarily driven by typical client price compression and mix, which is only partially offset by the increase in GDR and better purchasing economics. Now gross margin in the retail segment was 31.3% up 125 basis points over LY. Gross profit dollars increased 7.4% year-over-year, the margin improvement was largely driven by an increase in pharmacy margins which benefited from the increase in GDR and better purchasing economics partially offset by continued reimbursement pressures. At the same time, we saw front store margins expand in the quarter driven mainly by change in product mix including higher store rent sales and our strategy of making responsible investments and promotions.","As Larry stated, less than one third of our front store margin improvement was driven by the absence of tobacco. Total operating expenses as a percent of revenues improved by approximately 30 basis points from Q3 of \u201913 to 12.1%, while total SG&A dollars grew by 7%. The PBM segment expenses grew by 7.9% and its SG&A rate was 1.4% an improvement of approximately 10 basis points from LY. ","Now in the retail segment, SG&A as a percent of sales increased by approximately 75 basis points to 22.1% while expenses grew by 6.8%. This growth in expense primarily reflects higher legal and operating cost.","And within the corporate segment expenses were up $17 million to $196 million, the increase was primarily related to our strategic initiatives as well as IT investments. So adding it all up, operating margin for the total enterprise declined approximately 10 basis points to 6.4%. Operating margin in the PBM declined approximately 30 basis points to 4.8% while operating margin at retail improved about 40 basis points to 9.1%. For the quarter, PBM operating profit was strong growing 8.5% which was higher than we expected. Retail operating profit increased a very healthy 8.8% at the high end of our expectations. So going below the line on the consolidated income statement, net interest expense in the quarter increased approximately $32 million from LY to $153 million.","The debt we issued in the fourth quarter of last year was the primary driver of the increase. Although, we did see some benefit from the debt extinguishment at the end of this quarter. Our weighted average share count was 1.16 billion shares and finally our effective tax rate was 39.7%. ","So with that, let me shift and turn to our 2014 guidance. I\u2019m going to concentrate on the highlights here but you can find the details of our guidance in the slides that we posted on our website earlier this morning. For the year we expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share of $4.47 to $4.50 per share, reflecting strong year-over-year growth of approximately 12.75% and 13.5%. And to be clear, as Nancy noted at the start of the call, our guidance and the year-over-year growth comparisons remove the impact of a loss of the early debt extinguishment in the third quarter of this year as well as the impact of the gain from the legal settlement we recorded in the third quarter of last year. ","This makes the numbers more comparable and better demonstrates our underlying performance. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operation is expected to be in the range of $3.93 to $3.96 per share. In effect, we\u2019ve narrowed our adjusted earnings per share guidance range taking the bottom end up $0.04 and the top end down by about a penny thereby increasing the midpoint about penny and a half. Our revised guidance reflects our solid performance through the first nine months for this year as well as our confidence in our outlook. As expected this guidance also assumes share repurchases totaling at least $4 billion for the year and $0.01 benefit from our debt transaction.","In the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be the range of $1.18 to $1.21 up 6% to 8.75% from Q4 \u201913. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations\u2019 is expected to be in the range of $1.12 to $1.15 per share. This fourth quarter guidance includes a negative impact from tobacco exit for approximately $0.03 to $0.04 per share consistent with our initial expectations and bringing the impact for the year to approximately $0.07 to $0.08 per share. ","As you all know, sequentially, Q4 profit growth is expected to be somewhat lower than what we've experienced year-to-date. So before I walk you through the details, I would like to point out a few factors influencing the quarterly profit cadence across our business. First, the timing of the impact of break-open generics presents the tough comparison versus Q4 of LY. ","Second, Q4 is the first quarter that we will see the full financial effect from our decision to exit the tobacco category. And finally, due to the success of 15 selling season, we are investing incrementally in our welcome season to ensure a successful migration of new customers. ","Now I will go through the details of our fourth quarter guidance. Within the retail segment, we expect revenues to be up 0.25% to 1.75% versus the fourth quarter of LY. Adjusted script comps are expected to increase in the range of 3.5% to 4.5% while we expect total same store sales in the range of down 1% to up 0.5%. We expect front store same store sales to reflect a negative impact relative to the tobacco exit of approximately 900 basis points in the fourth quarter. We expect to see another significant improvement year-over-year in retail gross margins in the fourth quarter. This is expected to be driven by a number of factors such as better purchasing economics which includes the quarterly payment from Cardinal as well as the exit from tobacco. ","As we noted, the tobacco exit drove only a small portion of the margin expansion we saw in the third quarter. The impact is expected to ramp in the Q4 once we see a full quarter's impact. We expect the retail segment's operating profit to increase 4.5% to 6.25% in the fourth quarter. And now for the PBM segment, we expect revenues to increase 16.75% to 18.25% for the fourth quarter and adjusted claims to be between 270 million and 275 million claims and we expect to see a notable decline in PBM gross margins during the fourth quarter again due to price compression and drug mix.","In addition, the expected margin decline reflects the additional investment in our people processes and technologies; we are making to ensure another successful welcome season given the share number of new clients we are taking on for 2015. As a result of our success, we made solid investments during the third quarter and expect to continue to invest through the first quarter of next year. ","Combined with the strong revenue expectations, we expect the PBM segment operating profit to be flat to up 2% over last year in the fourth quarter. As a result, for the total enterprise in the quarter, we expect revenues to meet up approximately 9% to 10.5% from the fourth quarter of '13. This is after intercompany eliminations which are projected to equal about 10.8% of combined segment revenues. This elimination ratio has been trending higher due to the tobacco exit which obviously does not affect pharmacy revenues. With the total company, gross profit margins are expected to be down significantly from last year's fourth quarter driven largely by mix. Operating expenses as a percent of revenues are expected to notably improve in the fourth quarter. PBM operating expenses as a percent of revenue should show modest improvement driven in part by the growth of high cost specialty drugs year-over-year. Retail expense leverage should moderately decline given the loss of tobacco related sales with only a small amount of associated reductions in expenses and we expected operating expenses in the corporate segment to be between $200 million and $205 million. We expect operating margin for the total company in the quarter to be down 30 basis points to 40 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. We expect net interest expense of between a $125 million and a $135 million and a tax rate of approximately 40% in the fourth quarter.","We anticipate that we will have approximately 1.15 billion weighted average shares for the quarter, which would imply approximately 1.17 billion for the year. And as I said, we now expect to generate free cash flow in the range of between $5.7 billion to $6 billion for the year. So in summary, this was a very solid high quality quarter with strong financial performance across the enterprise. And importantly, our outlook remains strong. We continue to remain focused on using our strong free cash flow to ride value for all our stakeholders both now as well as into the future. And so with that, I will turn it back over to Larry Merlo ","Larry Merlo","","Okay, thank you Dave. And I just want to say again that I am very pleased with our performance year-to-date and I do want to take a moment to thank our colleagues across the CVS Health Enterprise for everything that they are doing day in and day out to serve our many customers and stakeholders while driving results. And as a pharmacy innovation company, we are focused on our growing role in shaping the future of healthcare, and with our unmatched enterprise assets we are very well positioned for today and at the same time we\u2019re still hard at work on the next innovation that will prepare us for tomorrow and drive value well into the future as we look forward to sharing those with you next month at our Analyst Day. So with that let\u2019s open it up for your questions.","Question-And-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities ","","So guys, I wanted to drill down a little bit on the Retail gross margin performance. Is there any more color front end versus pharmacy on a relative basis one versus the other, because either pharmacy was up a decent amount or X tobacco front end was up a very considerable amount. And so I'm thinking about the two of those. And then what impact would Specialty Connect transfer have on your pharmacy margins?","Larry Merlo ","","Good morning John its Larry and I\u2019ll take the first part and then I think Dave will go ahead and jumped in. John, as we described in our prepared remarks I think we talked about some of the variables in play that impacted both front store and pharmacy margins. We saw growth in both of those areas but I think as you know we have not historically broken those out, other than qualitatively or directionally talking about the factors that are impacting. And obviously in the front store there is going to be some adjustment because of eliminating the lower margin tobacco products and we talked about the fact that, that represented about a third of the improvement that we saw. And as we\u2019ve been talking out for quite some time I think our retail team has done a very effective job in terms of walking that fine lines we\u2019ve described it as the balance between art and fines in terms of how do you drive traffic and sales in a responsible way so that it has a flow through to the P&L and part of that is also reflected in the growth in store brands as well.","And I think in the pharmacy segment again there has been a lot of cross turns in the market but similar to what we talked about in the front we\u2019ve brought that same level of discipline as we\u2019re thinking about participation and preferred restricted networks. And at the same time some of the factors that are in play in terms of driving generic utilization and formulary management et cetera, et cetera.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","And Specialty Connect on pharmacy?","David Denton","","Just in general specialty drugs are typically branded drugs almost exclusively branded drugs -- lower gross margin rate so it would have a slightly positive effect on retail pharmacy as you script those drugs out and move them to PBM but very modest.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","And then lastly on -- with regard to what you're doing promotionally, are you -- what are you learning about promotional elasticity? Because it seems like you're promoting a little less, you're not seeing a traffic drop off, so is promotional elasticity in a lot of cases not as great as we thought it was?","Helena Foulkes","","I think we spent a lot of time over the last year so really using our extra care data to look at promotional effectiveness so what we\u2019re doing there is understanding; you promote which product who you\u2019re inviting into your stores eventually. So we\u2019ve been using that just to balance ourselves and make sure we\u2019re making the right promotional investments.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","George Hill - Deutsche Bank ","","Larry, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about moving some of the specialty business outside of the medical benefits and into the pharmacy benefit. And I don't know if you are able to quantify either the types -- modified the success you're having their or can you talk about which types of clients do you think are most likely to want to rethink how they manage debt Specialty Benefits that's executed under the medical side and maybe think about it on the pharmacy side.","Larry Merlo","","Good morning George its Larry I\u2019ll start and ask Jon to jump in here. Again this is something we spend a fair amount of time talking about at Analyst Day last December and the capabilities that the NovoLogix technology that really serves as the driver to be able to do things on the medical side of pharmacy that we think have been largely unmanaged I think we\u2019re in a point now where we can sit down with a respective client and look at their claims that if you will and actually show them the opportunities that we can bring the savings that are derived as a result of that.","Jon Roberts","","Yes and George this is Jon. So I would think about this in two ways. One is the ability to move some of the specialty drugs out of the medical benefit and into the pharmacy benefit rheumatoid arthritis is a good example so that we can use our existing capabilities tools utilization programs to effectively manage those for our clients and we do have clients that have an interest in doing that and something we continue to recommend. For the balance of the specialty drugs are managed under the medical benefit we have what Larry talked about the NovoLogix capability to essentially do everything we\u2019re doing on the pharmacy side today, prior authorizations, reprising, utilization programs and manage those programs under the medical benefit.","We\u2019re primarily seeing interest from our health plans with the NovoLogix tool and we have got a lot of success there in growing that business.","George Hill - Deutsche Bank ","","Okay. That's interesting color and it's helpful to hear that you're seeing success on the plans I. I've made have thought it would have been more with the employee sponsors may be a real quick follow-up for Dave and Larry I am sorry for dispensing with the pleasantries to start the Q&A but Dave how about -- is there any number you can kind of give us to kind of characterize where we are coming up the curve on Red Oak and try to quantify success there? Thanks and I'll hop back in. ","Dave Denton","","Well, George as you think about Red Oak as we mentioned in our prepared remarks I think the team has gotten off to a terrific start and I do want to emphasize that we essentially airlifted if you will very talented individuals from CVS and from Cardinal that were performing those functions within each company respectively. So, we don\u2019t have a brand new team that is doing this work so I can tell you it\u2019s a very talented team if you sat with these individuals you would know which individuals came over from CVS and which ones came over from Cardinal so I think the management team there has done a terrific job in terms of blending the culture and so on. I think as we talked about value being created, George, there is really three ways that value gets created. One is from the fixed payments that Dave alluded to in his prepared remarks and the fact that we\u2019ll see the first of those payments flowing through the P&L in the fourth quarter of this year.","The second is based on a set of predetermined milestones that if they\u2019re achieved there is the opportunity for additional payments to CVS and again I want to emphasize that those are milestones derivatives, if those milestones are not achieved there aren\u2019t additional payments but if they\u2019re there will be and then the third is, this is where scale and expertise and knowledge comes into play that we believe that there will be opportunities to further lower our acquisition cost from what exist today.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research, please go ahead.","Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research","","I had a housekeeping item and then I wanted a strategic question. And Dave, was the debt retirement part of the guidance originally or no? I think you said it and I just missed it and I apologize. ","David Denton","","No, Scott it was not part of our guidance originally.","Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research","Okay, perfect. And this isn't much more of a strategic question maybe we'll hear more about it when we get to Analyst Day, but it seems to me taking a step back that the Retail business is a little bit at a crossroads. And I'm specifically talking on the front end. You've obviously taken tobacco category out, but photos diminished a lot, the cards are not what they once used to be. You guys are adding a lot of clinics in which means not only for pharmacy but people are coming in for health reasons. And then we got the change in the healthcare business where more consumers are going to be making their choices. And then I overlay that with lots of assets tied up in Retail and wondering where you think the business is going on the Retail side and how do you manage all this dynamic? ","Larry Merlo","","Got it, I will ask Helena to talk a little more about that.","Helena Foulkes","","Okay, good. Yes, I mean I think we\u2019re thinking very holistically from the customers perspective just in terms of the experience and how we want to use our asset and certainly we mentioned before we are focusing on driving profitable growth we think when the customers think that CVS she is thinking first and foremost about pharmacy and health and beauty is a really important part of that CVS and continue to invest in health and beauty and elevate our presence there we are also spending a lot more time talking about digital and thinking about the connection between stores and digital and really enhancing the experience of our customers around digital. So, I\u2019m excited about the work with that going on there. It\u2019s again particularly focused in the pharmacy but the front stores are an important part of that as well.","Jon Roberts","","Hey Scott, this is Jon. From a client perspective, they use a retail locations just really synergistic to their goals of being able to reach the consumer, influence that consumer, change that consumer\u2019s behavior and lower overall healthcare cost. So, I think you have to think about really as an integrated model not just as a standalone retail pharmacy bolted on to a pharmacy to integrate all these channels.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of David Larsen with Leerink Partners, please go ahead.","David Larsen - Leerink Partners","","Can you please talk about these relationships that you've developed with these larger health systems? What value is CVS bringing to these health systems that's unique to the Retail channel? And then can you touch on the goal of the in-store clinics and how you see that expanding overtime potentially with more specialty services and potentially lab and is that helping you win on the PBM side? Thanks.","Larry Merlo","","Yes, Dave it\u2019s a great question. And I think as I mentioned, we now have 44 of those affiliations and I think we've got a number of pilots underway with several of those health systems where we are actually transmitting the patient CMR back and forth. I think that it is a synergistic opportunity where both parties see the opportunity as a referral source. There are patients that we are seeing that have to be referred to for more comprehensive work up and further diagnosis. And at the same time, recognizing our focus on acute care, there are services that we can provide, high quality at a much lower positive care and as we've talked many times getting the visit out of the emergency. So I think it starts there I think with we are in the early innings of the capabilities that we have. I think as the second part of your question we are doing point of care testing in our clinics today and we are evaluating the various technologies that exist in terms of playing a deeper and vigor role and we are excited about a pilot that we now have underway in one of our Texas markets where we are actually performing infusion services in one of our clinics. So I think you will hear us talk a little more about that at Analyst Day but I think there are a number of opportunities that we have there. ","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. ","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan","","Thanks very much. I just had a couple of follow questions on the PBM selling season. Larry or Jon can you talk about plan design changes for 2015. And then secondly just there are several amount of question in the marketplace of, is CVS winning because of its combined offering Jon that you talked about today as being fully integrated or have you been winning because of merger related activity and some other things in the marketplace? So if you can give us some of the comment around that as well as your thoughts on plan design changes for 2015?","Larry Merlo","","Let me take the second question and I will put the first question back to Jon but Lisa I think is again as you've heard us talk in the past, you've got to be right on and competitive on pricing, you've got to deliver service, so I think those are ticket for the games. But beyond that I think we have an off a lot of differentiators and it's a clich\u00e9 to say that when you see one client you see one client but they all have different priorities and I think that we have a growing list of services and products that meet the needs of very diverse clients, whether it's maintenance, choice, Specialty Connect Pharmacy advisor we just talked about MinuteClinic, our leadership and growing position that exists in specialty and as well as the consultant services and that exist within our Medicare Part D assets whether it's providing that service for health plan or our standalone SilverScript products. So we can go on and on with that, okay but I think that we are all very confident and bullish on the fact that our integrated assets are making a meaningful difference in the marketplace in terms of reducing the cost of care and at the same time improving the quality of that care. So I will flip it over to Jon if he wants to add anything to that and then talk more about plan designs.","Jon Roberts","","Yes. So Lisa I am out in front of a lot of new perspective clients have been over the last year obviously very pleased with the results of the selling season. I would say service issues that they may be experiencing kind of get them to look at what else is available in the marketplace but it's clear once we sit down and talk about everything that Larry covered they see our value proposition and I think it's led to a lot of our success. I think as far as plan design changes we're obviously see more movement consumer driven health plans. We're the member there's more financial responsibility particularly upfront. So we are seeing providers, a high interest of providers in fact most of 50% providing coverage of generics so that there isn\u2019t a negative impact on adherence which we are very pleased to see. I think other things around plan design are I think you are going to see more interest in narrow networks as we are kind of, as we are returning to higher trend I think plans are going to be looking to at the lower cost and ways like that. And I think when you think of narrow networks you really got to just aggregate the different segments. ","If you look at Medicare Part D, clearly we are seeing a lot of preferred networks there, managed Medicaid, we see them narrow networks employers have been great adopters of maintenance choice but we are also seeing movements into narrow preferred networks. And commercial health plans really have been I would say the slowest to adopt these plan designs, but I think with the growth of exchanges I think you\u2019re going to see movement there. So when you look at the new business wins that we brought on this year we have about a third of our new wins adopting different plan designs and moving into narrow networks as an example.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs ","","To follow-up on the PBM and the net wins you mentioned over $1 billion better relative to this update this time last year. Can you talk a little bit more about where you're winning and any sense you can give us on mix around profitability of where you're winning? I know you mentioned some shifts in where people are looking to go with narrow networks, just curious on how that all impacts the profitability of the pretty successful season you've had this year.","Larry Merlo","","Bob, again I think we mentioned in our prepared remarks that we\u2019re very pleased in that the wins that come across all sectors of the business, we\u2019ve seen it on the important side on the health plan side as well as the government sponsor side. So we\u2019re pleased with that. The dynamic in terms of the profitability I don\u2019t think that dynamic we have seen materially changed that typically over the life of the contract you see profitability of those contracts improve and typically it is at its low point in that first year of the new contract.","Jon Roberts ","","Bob this is Jon. As trend continues to grow and there has been a lot of discussion about that the slowing down of the generic pipeline, the growth in specialty I think the good news is that we are seeing this in the new business wins, these clients are going to be adopting our programs which help them lower our cost but are also good for us and improve our profitability. So we think it\u2019s a win-win and there is good alignment there.","Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs","That's helpful. And if I could sneak one in on the preferred networks, a big focus around part D this year. As somebody with a fairly unique vantage point on both as a part D provider, plan provider and then also has obviously a retail network, can you talk about what you're seeing as far as the rise in the appetite for preferred networks? And any notable change in the economics in participating in these preferred networks?","Larry Merlo","","Bob, I think that obviously we have seen an accelerated growth in Med-D. I think from our retail provider side as I mentioned earlier there is going to be a step down in margin associated with participating in those networks as one of the preferred providers and once again I think our retail team has done a very effective job in terms of evaluating the step down in margin against the anticipated share shift and as a result of that there are plans that make sense to participate in a preferred way. There are other plans where it doesn\u2019t make sense. Keeping in mind that all Med-D plans are not equal when you look at the co-pay delta that exist for the beneficiary, the consumer in terms of preferred, not preferred as well as the make-up of that Med-D plan in terms of, if it has a high percentage of low income subsidies they are not subject to the co-pay differentials. I\u2019ll refer to them as the chooser beneficiaries. So I used those as just two examples as well as geographic strength and presence that go into that evaluation.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Percher with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Eric Percher - Barclays","","Thank you. Eric Percher, and Meredith Adler here for Barclays. So question on Specialty Connect now that you have couple of months under your belt as you focused on providing access to the open market, the market where you don\u2019t have captive pair lines, have you focused on actually investing in market to the physician or the patient or is this more in manner just being able to capture scripts that walk in to the doors of the store and I imagine you would have an advantage in that marketing effort given your name brands?","Jon Roberts","","Great question, we\u2019re very happy with how Specialty Connect is performing. We\u2019re seeing a very high level of patient satisfaction and it\u2019s been deployed across our retail stores in specialty pharmacies. Let me say it\u2019s start because there is client component to this also when our clients value this capability and they see this is another differentiated service that we offer and somewhere the maintenance choice has been very successful where we see about 50% of the people want to keep their specialty script up with the local CVS and other half want it sent home. And so realizing most of our important clients are exclusive with us. This is a big benefit that they can give their members. ","Now when you go to the open market and these are physicians and patients that get to choose our specialty pharmacy. They value service and convenience of Specialty Connect offers. And we have, and have had for years well north of 100 people out working with physicians and talking about the services that we provide and getting their patients started on specialty medications and so this is just we think this just gives us an added advantage in the marketplace because it\u2019s going to be more convenient for their patients and it provides a high level of service for their physicians.","So, we\u2019re very bullish on this in both the open market and also the market for our clients we think it gives us an advantage. What\u2019s interesting is that our pharmacy teams love it, because it\u2019s leveraging our integrated assets that no one in the marketplace can and allows them to serve their patients in their local pharmacy and pharma is also very happy with it the inherent results they see in this program because it's equal to or better than what they see traditional specialty pharmacy and better than adherence that they see and normally see in Retail Pharmacy so overall very happy.","Eric Percher - Barclays","","It sounds like the value of your commercial basis is quite strong and you\u2019re feeling on the open market is not that this is so much something new but it captures and allows you to capture incremental lives I guess where I\u2019m going is that some of the big players without captive lives have seen a lot of growth in the open market, it doesn\u2019t sound like you think that you\u2019ve left a lot there on the table?","Jon Roberts","","No, we\u2019ve seen a lot of growth in the open market as well. So, we\u2019re growing both segments so very happy, this gives us we think an advantage over the traditional open specialty pharmacy players.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Wiltamuth with Jefferies & Company, please go ahead.","Mark Wiltamuth - Jefferies & Company","","Hi, good morning. On the specialty story, you said 53% growth here in the specialty business, what\u2019s the organic growth excluding the Coram acquisition and maybe give us a little more color on the drivers behind that growth because that\u2019s a very large number relative to the 20% growth is kind of expected in the broader marketplace?","David Denton","","Hey Mark, it\u2019s Dave. Exclude Coram I think our growth in specialty is about 44% for the quarter so while Coram did contribute to the growth it was not an overwhelming driver of that performance. I\u2019ll flip it to Jon.","Jon Roberts","","And\u2026","Mark Wiltamuth - Jefferies & Company","So is it mostly Sovaldi?","David Denton","No, that is one product but that\u2019s certainly that was not the lion share of the growth.","Jon Roberts","But yes we\u2019ve added new business we\u2019re seeing existing clients primarily health plans narrow their networks they normally have several preferred pharmacy so we\u2019re seeing more interest and pushing more share into our channels and we\u2019re rolling the open business as well as I talked about so we\u2019re very happy with the performance of specialty.","Mark Wiltamuth - Jefferies & Company","And what's your sense on the awareness out there in the marketplace? Because we did a survey earlier this year and some of the employers still weren't completely tuned into the coming wave of specialty spending.","Jon Roberts","","Clients that I speak to are very aware of it and they\u2019re seeing it in their trend growth so it was something we talked about at our client forum this year. Specialty is their number one priority, they\u2019re looking for ways to control those cost as an example, very high interest and formula strategies but four years ago there wasn\u2019t a real strong interest in, very interested in some of our capabilities around side of care that we can do with NovoLogix. So, yes I think they\u2019re very aware of specialty.","Larry Merlo","","And Mark, I think that has been a step change over the last let\u2019s say 12 months and I think for the reasons that Jon mentioned, they heard it was coming and now that they\u2019re seeing the impact of drugs like Sovaldi they\u2019re very anxious about ways in which we can bend that cost curve if you will.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with UBS, please go ahead.","Steven Valiquette - UBS","","So seeing the topic of exchanges had thankfully moved to the back burner, but with your disclosure that's roughly $800 million or so of business that was lost to exchanges for 2015. And I guess, at first blush, it seems like a big number but then the fact that it equates to just under 1% of your total annual PBM business, it seems pretty manageable when you put it in that context. So I know it's hard to predict this, but I'm curious do you think that roughly 1% attrition is a reasonable run rate for exchange risk over the next few years? Or could that change higher or lower for any specific reason that you foresee right now? Thanks. ","Larry Merlo","","Well, Steve I think it\u2019s important to put this in context I mean I think the Red Oak around people migrate, active employees migrating over to the exchanges but Red Oak around that has quite a down tremendously and other than perhaps small employee organizations we\u2019re not hearing any of that in mid and large size companies. I think as we alluded into in our prepared remarks I think that and it\u2019s not in consistent with what we\u2019ve talked about in the past. I do think that if there is any trend emerging it is employers getting out of the retiree business and I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing back to our earlier comments and it\u2019s kind of hard to put a number on that but I don\u2019t see anything migrating beyond that at this point in time.","Jon Roberts","","And Steve, this is Jon. And just remember we have an opportunity to recapture those lives through our health plan relationships and also for retirees or Silver Script product that as you can see it is very competitive this year. So we think we will do well and some people move into that exchange.","Dave Denton","","Yes. Steve this is Dave, maybe just one other comment. We could maybe harken back a little bit to the some of the comments we made several quarters ago. If you look at the exchange market and you look at the assets that we have in place across our enterprise, we are very well positioned from the exchange perspective in a sense that one, you obviously can plug in from a PBM perspective. I think about plugging in from a specialty perspective, from a retail perspective, from a clinic perspective, there is a host of assets that we have here that really we can plug and play and really meet the needs of the exchange population and really with our touch points with consumers across the marketplace really allow us to kind of utilize those assets in meaningful ways to drive value for both consumers also plan sponsors in the exchange markets.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. ","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company","","Thanks. A question here. Just got a couple of follow ups. On the MinuteClinic side, can you talk about any sort of metrics in terms of what sort of your same store visits are looking like for stores that have been opened longer than a year? And also maybe any sort of metrics around one of the referral benefits from your earlier health lines partner has been looking like.","Larry Merlo","","Yeah, Charles we have not broken out your second question in terms of referral visits. I think in our prepared remarks, we've talked about the fact that year-over-year visits were up 30%. Now that is not a comp number we have not broken that out, okay. But I can tell you that, that growth did not come just from new clinics. We are continuing to see healthy growth in clinics that have been open for a couple of years now.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company","Okay, that's helpful. And secondly just a follow up on sort of the preferred networks in Medicare Part D, it seems like the issue with the contracting here is where you set sort of this overall effective rate on the pricing. It seems like from your comments that you guys have not had as much of an issue in Medicare Part D as you negotiated your way into these preferred networks or chose not to be in them. My question is really around the overall effective rate. I mean it seems like this is a negotiated rate, whether it sort of puts and takes on when you go to health plans to negotiate this, in particular is this, do you give up something for a higher overall effective rate and what you've gained for negotiated more aggressive on? Thanks.","Dave Denton","Hey, Charles. This is Dave; maybe I will take that, just one comment. I think we\u2019ve been very disciplined and I think applied somewhat of a sophisticated lens to this activity. As you can imagine, as Larry stated earlier it\u2019s not all Medicare Part D products and benefit designs are created equal. And I think we look at the each one of those designs, we analyze the utilization impact and the share movement impact based on the design and the co-pay differentials and we understand what makes sense for us and what makes sense for our plan sponsor. And we also compare and look at the makeup of that membership base and understand whether it's a low income subsidy base or a chooser base and that creates different dynamics in the marketplace. So we've factored all that in and essentially underwrite our performance there and make choices that we think are economically in the best interest of CVS Health, but also the best interest of our health plans and best interest of the consumers that we serve and I think we have been very disciplined around our approach to that. ","Larry Merlo","Okay. Carlos we will go ahead and take two more questions please. ","Operator","Very well. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Willoughby from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Robert Willoughby - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","All right just a quick one. Dave how much of the cash flow benefit for the year might be, might you consider one time in nature i.e. tobacco inventory reduction. And then secondary what's driving the higher accounts receivable days. Is there any opportunity to bring that down?","Larry Merlo","Yes, a couple of things. One is I don't think there is anything that is necessarily one time in nature per se if any material nature absolutely normal cadence of recoveries for Medicare Part D which is kind of baked into kind of our run rate. So I don't see anything abnormal from a cash flow delivery perspective. And I think both from a receivables and payables perspective I think if we continue to work on a payable side and probably still some opportunities. On the accounts receivable side is really, we are probably constrained a little bit as it relates to Medicare Part D and a performance and requirements around CMS which is probably not a lot that we can do to influence that specifically other than just make sure that we are fully on top of it managing it effectively.","Robert Willoughby - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And that's on the retail side.","Larry Merlo","It\u2019s most on the PBM side frankly.","","Robert Willoughby - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Fair enough. Okay, thank you.","Operator","","The next question comes from the line of John Ransom with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","John Ransom - Raymond James ","","Two questions, what you are guys saying it is too early in terms of the specialty trend for 2015 and how much of that will affected by the lapping of Sovaldi and I have one follow-up.","Dave Denton","","I think it\u2019s probably little too early to chat about specialty trend in specifics as it relates to 2015. I would say that Jon and his team have been working with client to kind of outline that if you don\u2019t manage specialty trend over the long-term, that you can see trend in kind of the mid-teens level over the next several years but I think that what we have been working with our clients to do is go back and outline a series of steps and activity that they can implement with us that can actually help them manage that trend down to very reasonable levels they chose to do so. And we\u2019ve been very explicit with our clients and working very diligently with them to make sure they understand those tradeoffs.","Jon Roberts","","John the only thing I\u2019d add what Dave said is that, when you look at the 2014 specialty trend I mean it is going to be double digits and so all these going to play a big role in that. And there is, we actually saw on the back half of this year that the utilization in the Hep C market primarily driven by Sovaldi plateau. We\u2019ve seen Harvoni launched already and we\u2019re actually seeing an uptake in utilization and most of that uptake is coming at the expense of Sovaldi. But also there is a new MV product coming out in December that will compete with Harmony. And so our plan is to leverage our formulary strategy and bring cost down and we\u2019ll determine which products one or more actually are on our \u201815 formulary so I think we are going to have a little different dynamic as we move into \u201815 because we\u2019re now seeing competition in the Hepatitis C category.","John Ransom - Raymond James ","Right. And my other question was the pushback of Nexium a needle mover in terms of your original guidance for this year and what you're now thinking about for fourth quarter?","Jon Roberts","","It is the push back and it is change to our expectations but I think that shift in that change is fully contemplated our guidance for this year I think the actual launch date of that is recycle into \u201815 is still up in the air quite frankly we are not certain. So we keep posted on that we\u2019ll keep watchful eye on that. We may know more by Analyst Day I think we may not. But we\u2019ll see where we are. ","Larry Merlo","","Okay. So with that, once again let me thank everyone for your time today and for your ongoing interest in our company and we look forward to seeing hopefully all of you next month in New York.

During this presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded, Tuesday May 2, 2017.","Now, I'd like to turn the conference over to Nancy Christal, Senior VP of Investor Relations. Please go right ahead, ma'am.","Nancy R. Christal - CVS Health Corp.","Thank you, Tommy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I'm here this morning with Larry Merlo, President and CEO: and Dave Denton, Executive Vice President and CFO. Jon Roberts, Chief Operating Officer; and Helena Foulkes, President of CVS Pharmacy, are also with us today and will participate in the question-and-answer session following our prepared remarks.","During the Q&A, please limit yourself to no more than one question with a quick follow-up, so we can provide more people with a chance to ask a question. Please note that we posted a slide presentation on our website before the call. It summarizes the information in our prepared remarks as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operational performance and guidance. Later this afternoon, we'll be filing our Form 10-Q, and it will also be available on our website.","During today's presentation, we'll make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws. By their nature, all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements for a number of reasons as described in our SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section and cautionary statement disclosures in those filings.","During this call, we'll use some non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company's performance.

And, as always, today's call is being simulcast on our website and it will be archived there following the call for one year.","And now, I'll turn this over to Larry Merlo.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Well, thanks, Nancy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us to hear more about our first quarter results. Total company revenues increased 3%, slightly above the high end of our guidance. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.17, a slight contraction versus a year ago, but $0.04 above the high end of our guidance range. We generated approximately $3.1 billion of free cash during the quarter, and we continued on our path of delivering significant value to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases.","Now, while we're pleased with our financial performance versus our expectations, we won't be satisfied until the total enterprise returns to sustainable, healthy earnings growth. Now, given our Q1 performance and the fact that it is still early in the year, we are maintaining our full year adjusted EPS guidance range of $5.77 to $5.93, and Dave will review the details of both our results and guidance in his remarks.","Before diving into the business review, I do want to touch on the continued role that CVS Health plays in making health care more affordable, more accessible and more effective. We are continuously innovating to offer solutions that lower cost for our clients and members, and these efforts are driving meaningful results.","Our recently published 2016 Trend report highlighted our PBM's commercial book of business trend coming in at only 3.2% compared to an unmanaged trend of more than 11%. At the same time, our members saw their out of pocket costs decline by 3%.","We effectively purchase generics through Red Oak Sourcing using our size, scale and expertise. And we encourage generic utilization to drive down costs, with generics now comprising about 87% of scripts filled across the enterprise. To more effectively manage the cost of the remaining scripts, we employ sophisticated formulary management tools to ensure that the right patient receives the right drug at the lowest possible cost.","And we create plan designs that lower member out-of-pocket costs while managing health outcomes. For example, we offer our clients the option to adopt point-of-sale rebates, which enable their members to directly benefit from lower negotiated costs for branded drugs. We also offer a preventive drug list, where drugs for common, chronic conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension, are made available to members at a $0 co-pay, effectively at no cost. This encourages adherence, better health and, ultimately, lower overall health care costs.","We're also working on innovative solutions for the uninsured. We brought to market a dramatically lower cost alternative to EpiPen. And we've now announced a program called Reduced Rx, its goal to offer dramatic discounts on certain drugs directly to patients. As an example, customers will be able to purchase a Novo insulin product for $25 per vial, a potential savings of as much as $100.","So overall, our integrated model enables us to effectively address costs across the health care system, and not just through our PBM but also through our retail, specialty, MinuteClinic and long-term care capabilities.","Now, let me turn to the business update, and I'll start with the PBM selling season. Since our last update, the expected revenue for 2017 has grown, with gross new business of $8.5 billion and net new business of $5.4 billion, and that's up about $1 billion from our last update. And the majority of this increase relates to our clients' Medicare add-on lives, which were still being reconciled at the time of our last call.","We closed out the 17th selling season with a strong retention rate of 96.5%, and 2017 was another successful year in a string of strong selling seasons for CVS Caremark.","Turning to the 2018 selling season, we're off to a solid start across both the commercial and health plan spaces. Our integrated products and services are resonating strongly and remain differentiated in the market, and we've already had some contract wins for 2018.","Additionally, we were pleased to have been selected as one of two pharmacy partners by the Health Transformation Alliance. HTA is comprised of large, sophisticated employers, many in the Fortune 100 listing, and we see the potential for incremental multi-year growth opportunities as we work with these innovative companies.","Of course, we were disappointed to learn of the loss of the FEP specialty contract. And, as we have stated previously, the loss of this specialty contract, which is expected to generate 2017 revenues of about $2.8 billion, is not expected to have a material impact on our 2018 operating profit.","We continue to believe it's important to maintain our pricing discipline in the marketplace, which has served us very well over many years. And let me also remind you that we will continue to provide retail pharmacy and mail order pharmacy services to FEP's more than 5.4 million Federal employees, retirees, and their dependents, under separate agreements that run through 2018. And I would also note that our service and satisfaction metrics within the FEP business are at an all-time high.","As far as renewals, we have about $23 billion up for renewal in 2018 and that's comparable with the previous year from a percent-of-business perspective. We've completed about 43% of our client renewals to-date, which is ahead of where we were last year at this time. Now, it's still early in the selling season. And at this point, the magnitude of bidding opportunities is actually flat to down versus the 2017 selling season. And consistent with our past practice, we will provide a more quantitative update on the 2018 selling season on our Q2 earnings call in August.","Just this past week, we held our Client Forum. We had a record attendance of nearly 1,000 attendees. And the forum provides us an opportunity to update our clients on our latest innovations in products and services, while gaining important feedback on their evolving priorities. Our recently-announced Transform Diabetes Care program, which is a value-based clinical program to better manage diabetics, is a great example of our continued innovation and evolution towards outcomes-based care. This program was very well received by our clients, as it's very much aligned with their priorities of lowering overall health care costs.","And we expect to roll out Transform Care programs for four additional disease states over the next 24 months.","Consistent with recent years, clients want help in managing the fast-growing specialty costs, while, at the same time, driving improved patient outcomes. And our comprehensive set of specialty solutions helps them do just that. We continue to see client interest in adoption of our medical pharmacy and clinical care products. And these industry-leading capabilities have helped us achieve sustained above-market growth rates in our Specialty business. And in the first quarter, specialty revenues increased 10%.","Now, moving onto the first quarter results in the retail Long Term Care business, total same-store sales decreased 4.7%, with pharmacy same-store sales down 4.7%, in line with our expectations.","Pharmacy sales comps were negatively impacted by approximately 480 basis points due to recent generic introductions. Same-store prescription volumes declined 1.4%. That's on a 30-day equivalent basis. And it's expected the decisions to restrict CVS from participating in the TRICARE network beginning in December and many Prime networks beginning in January, negatively impacted Pharmacy sales and script comps. The network changes had about a 460 basis point negative impact on volumes, while the absence of leap day had about a 120 basis point negative impact on same-store prescription volumes.","Now, if you adjust for both the network changes and leap day, same-store prescription volumes would have been about 580 basis points higher. And this would have increased script comps 4.4% in the quarter on a 30-day equivalent basis.","Now, we're very focused on working with all payors to drive volumes and capture share as we look to 2018 and beyond. Our partnership with Optum to provide a 90-day retail solution to their ASO clients and members is progressing nicely. Our teams are currently working on the implementation of what we'll call the clinical wrap for the offering, which includes our Health Tag and ExtraCare Health Card. We're also in the process of co-creating materials that will support Optum's sales team in their go-to-market efforts, so we're making good progress in anticipation of the July 1 launch.","At the same time, we're exploring other potential ways to partner with Optum to best leverage the joint capabilities of both companies, all with the goal of driving better health outcomes and reducing costs. We're also continuing the dialogue with other PBMs and health plans, offering a menu of services to partner more broadly, leveraging CVS Pharmacy's compelling value proposition, along with our enterprise capabilities, including those such as MinuteClinic services, Infusion and Long Term Care, so more to come on these potential partnerships.","Let me touch briefly on the CVS Pharmacies in the Target stores. Putting the network changes aside, we're continuing to see improving script performance versus prior quarters. And the strength of our patient care programs and Maintenance Choice continues to drive performance. So the Target pharmacies are moving in the right direction.","Turning to the front store business, comps decreased 4.9%, reflecting softer customer traffic related to a number of factors. 175 basis points of the comp decrease relates to the absence of leap day versus 2016 as well as the shift of Easter into the second quarter.","Our comps also reflect our decision to rationalize our promotional strategies and, to a lesser degree, the network changes that reduced our script volumes and had some associated front store impact. Now, despite the decline in front store comps, front store gross margin once again improved nicely in the quarter versus last year, which speaks to the success we've had with our personalization and promotional strategies.","We also remain focused on growing our Beauty, Health Care and Personal Care businesses, and these efforts involve a number of actions that include a new store design and enhanced customer experience. The new store formats offer an expanded assortment of healthier food, health-focused products and additional beauty offerings paired with discovery zones in key categories. And while the new store format is focused on 70 stores this year, we will continue to evolve as we test and learn in order to meet the needs of our customers.","Recognizing the growing presence in the digital market, we've also been focused on enhancing our online and mobile capabilities to create an integrated health and pharmacy experience that only CVS can provide. Building on the strength of our digital tools within pharmacy, where 60% of our patients are using them, we're focused on defining the next generation of convenience for our customers. And these ideas range from our Curbside program to same-day delivery options as well as enhanced mobile functionality, to name a few.","And finally, Store Brands remain an area of both strength and opportunity. Our Store Brands represented 22.8% of front store sales in the quarter. That's up about 85 basis points from a year ago. There are significant opportunities to expand the share of Store Brand products by building on core equities in health and beauty, while seeking growth in other areas where we can provide customers a good value proposition.","So with that, let me turn it over to Dave for the financial review.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone.","This morning, I'll provide a detailed review of our 2017 first quarter results, followed by a brief update on our guidance. As I always do, first, I'll start with a summary of how we continue to enhance shareholder value through our strong capital allocation program. During the quarter, we paid approximately $516 million in dividends, after increasing the quarterly cash dividend by 18% for this year. Our 12-month trailing dividend payout ratio currently stands at 36.8%, but keep in mind that this ratio was artificially high, as it includes some expenses that are more temporary in nature, such as the loss on the early extinguishment of debt that we incurred LY, as well as the other items described in our non-GAAP reconciliations on our website. Nevertheless, we remain well on track to achieve our targeted payout ratio of 35% by the end of 2018.","In addition, we have continued to repurchase our shares. In the first quarter, as part of our previously announced accelerated share repurchase program, we bought back approximately 36 million shares for about $3.6 billion. So between dividends and buybacks, we returned approximately $4.1 billion to shareholders in the first quarter alone.","You should also note that the final receipt of shares from the ASR occurred in April, closing out the transactions a little earlier than anticipated. In total for the ASRs, we repurchased approximately 46 million shares at an average price of $78.74 per share.","Looking forward to the remainder of the year, we have about $14.6 billion left in authorizations to repurchase shares, and we continue to expect to repurchase $5 billion for the full year. As a result, our expectation is that we will return more than $7 billion to our shareholders in 2017 through both a combination of dividends and share repurchases.","As Larry mentioned, we generated $3.1 billion of free cash in the first quarter, which is unusually high, due, in large part, to the timing of receipt of a Medicare Part D payment. This was expected, given that April 1 fell on a weekend. We continue to expect to produce free cash of between $6 billion and $6.4 billion for the full year.","Now, turning to the income statement, adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.17 per share, a decline of 1.4% over last year. Keep in mind that these results are on a comparable basis, and the reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted earnings per share can be found in the press release as well as on the Investor Relations portion of our website.","Adjusted earnings per share came in $0.04 above the high end of our guidance range. Below-the-line items contributed roughly $0.02 to the over performance, while the remainder relates to our core business operations.","Within operations, the Retail business over-delivered by about $0.03, due largely to timing factors, while the PBM came in within our expectations. Retail pharmacy margin benefited from several timing items that were anticipated to occur later in this year. Additionally, Retail operating expenses were lower than expected, as certain store-related costs shifted to later in the year.","GAAP diluted EPS was $0.92 per share. So with that, let me provide more detail as I quickly walk down the P&L. On a consolidated basis, revenues in the first quarter increased 3% to more than $44.5 billion. In the PBM segment, net revenues increased 8.5% to $31.2 billion. Given the large amount of net new business, this growth was due to increased claims volumes in the pharmacy network as well as brand inflation and growth in specialty pharmacy. Partially offsetting the sales growth was an approximate 140 basis point increase in our generic dispensing rate to 87%.","PBM adjusted claims increased 9.6% in the quarter. As we discussed during the February call, we improved our methodology for counting pharmacy network claims in order to keep script counts consistent across our operating segments, converting each 90-day claim into three 30-day claims to more appropriately account for the amount of product days supplied. We've been doing this within the Retail Long Term Care segment for several years and now have consistency across the enterprise.","In our Retail Long Term Care business, revenues decreased 3.8% in the quarter to $19.3 billion. This was in line with our expectations and driven primarily by a decline in script volume due to the network changes that we discussed last year.","During the quarter, GDR increased by approximately 180 basis points to 87.5%. We also saw a decline in front store revenues due to a softer customer traffic and our promotional decisions. As Larry mentioned, front store same-store sales were negatively affected by about 175 basis points from the absence of leap day as well as the shift of Easter into the second quarter of this year.","Turning to gross profit, operating expenses, operating profit and the tax rate, the numbers I am citing are on a comparable basis and exclude the items noted on the slides. First, turning to gross margin, we reported 14.8% for the consolidated company in the quarter, a contraction of approximately 85 basis points compared to Q1 of 2016. This was consistent with our expectations and primarily driven by a mix shift, as the lower-margin PBM business is growing faster than the Retail Long Term Care segment. Total enterprise gross profit dollars decreased 2.5%.","Within the PBM segment, gross margin declined approximately 30 basis points versus Q1 of 2016, to 3.5%, while gross profit dollars were relatively flat year-over-year, declining by only about $5 million. The decline in gross margin was primarily due to continued price compression and the changing mix of our business.","Gross margin in the Retail Long Term Care segment was 29.4%, up 35 basis points. This improvement was driven by an increase in GDR as well as improvement in front store margin rate and dollars related to the continued rationalization of our promotional strategies and improved product mix. It was partially offset by continued pressure on reimbursement rates. Gross profit dollars decreased 2.7% in the quarter, mainly due to the loss of prescriptions.","Total operating expenses as a percent of revenues remained relatively flat to Q1 of 2016 at 10.3%, improving 15 basis points. The PBM segment's SG&A rate improved approximately 10 basis points to 1%, thanks to improving efficiencies.","SG&A as a percent of sales in the Retail Long Term Care segment deteriorated approximately 110 basis points to 20.9% as we lost leverage due to decline in net revenues from the loss of prescriptions.","A portion of the increase in operating expense dollars year-over-year relates to the investments we are making in process improvements and technology enhancements as part of our enterprise streamlining initiative. During the quarter, among other projects, we continued to work on new tools and processes designed to improve service and labor productivity in our long-term care facilities.","We closed 60 stores in the first quarter related to our store rationalization efforts and recorded a charge in our Retail Long Term Care segment of $199 million, which primarily represents the present value of the non-cancelable lease obligations for those stores. However, the charge was excluded from our comparable numbers that I just mentioned. We expect to see some benefit from the closing of these stores in 2017, which was anticipated in our guidance. As the majority of the 70 planned store closures have now occurred, we only expect minimal store closure costs during the remainder of this year.","Within the Corporate segment, expenses were up approximately $14 million to $226 million, in line with our expectations.","So as a result, operating margin for the total enterprise declined approximately 70 basis points in the quarter to 4.5%. Operating margin in the PBM declined approximately 20 basis points to 2.5%, while operating margin at Retail declined approximately 80 basis points to 8.4% on our adjusted basis.","Operating profit in the PBM was relatively flat year-over-year, meeting the low end of expectations, driven by continued price compression. Operating profit in the Retail Long Term Care segment declined 11.9%, again on our adjusted basis. This exceeded our expectation, with the outperformance delivered by the timing items I discussed earlier.","Going below the line on the consolidated income statement, net interest expense in the quarter decreased approximately $31 million from last year, as expected, to $252 million, due primarily to paying down debt in the prior year and an at lower average interest rate on a debt that remains outstanding.","Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 37.7%. This was better than expected, due to our estimates on the discrete tax benefit from the adoption of a new share-based payment accounting guidance, which was described at Analyst Day and is disclosed in the 10-Q, which we will file later today. This accounting change will continue to impact the tax rate going forward and will fluctuate, perhaps significantly, based on the changes in our stock price.","Our weighted-average share count was just over 1 billion shares, reflecting the first receipt of shares from the ASRs.","So with that, now let me update you on our guidance. I'll focus on the highlights, but you can find the additional details in the slide presentation we posted on our website earlier this morning. I'll start with EPS. While the year is off to a very solid start, it's still early and we continue to expect 2017 to be a rebuilding year. With that in mind, we are confirming our 2017 adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $5.77 to $5.93 and GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations in the range of $5.02 to $5.18. You can find a reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted EPS in our press release and on the Investor Relations portion of our website. Top line growth expectations have not changed, and the details are provided in our slides.","Moving to operating profit, with one quarter behind us, we are narrowing the Retail Long Term Care segment's range. Retail operating profit is now expected to be down 7.75% to 9.5%, while consolidated operating profit is expected to be down 3% to 5.25%, narrowing the top end by 75 basis points in the Retail segment and 50 basis points for the enterprise. There are no changes in our expectations for the PBM and the Corporate segments.","I should note here that we have retrospectively adopted a new accounting pronouncement and reclassed a small portion of our net benefit cost from operating expenses to other expenses, which has the effect of increasing operating profit in all periods by an immaterial amount. You can find the details of this adoption in our 10-Q that's filed later today.","Now, let me provide guidance for the second quarter, which excludes certain non-GAAP items described in our slides. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.29 to $1.33 per share in the quarter, reflecting a decline of 2.5% to up 1% versus Q2 of 2016, a sequential improvement. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.15 to $1.19 per share.","Keep in mind there are several timing factors that affect the cadence of profit delivery throughout this year. The introduction and timing of break-open generics, the timing of profitability in our Medicare Part D business and the timing of benefits from our enterprise streamlining initiatives are all factors expected to have the greatest impact on cadence. And while we delivered a strong quarter versus our own expectations, the cadence of profit growth is still expected to be more back half-weighted.","Within the Retail Long Term Care segment, we expect revenues to be down 2.5% to 4.25% versus the second quarter of last year, due, in large part, to the restricted network changes discussed previously. Adjusted script comps are expected to decrease in the range of 0.5% to 1.5%, while we expect total same-store sales to be down 3% to 4.75%.","The Easter shift into Q2 is expected to have a positive impact on front store comp growth of approximately 75 basis points.","In the PBM, we expect second quarter revenue growth of between 9% and 10.75%, driven by continued strong growth in volumes and specialty. Consolidated revenues are expected to grow 3.25% to 5%.","We expect Retail Long Term Care operating profit to decrease 10.25% to 13.25% and PBM operating profit to increase 2.5% to 5.5% in the second quarter. Consolidated operating profit is expected to decline 6.5% to 9.5%.","Now before closing, I've one piece of news today. Nancy Christal plans to retire later this summer, right about the time of her 22nd year anniversary with the company. We launched an internal and external search. And today, I'm extremely pleased to announce that Mike McGuire will be appointed Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.","I'm sure many of you already know Mike very well. Currently VP of Investor Relations, Mike has been with the company for more than 20 years, working closely with Nancy for the past 15 years in areas of increasing responsibility. He has also had experience in strategic planning and capital management. His financial experience, his industry knowledge and deep understanding of our company made him an outstanding candidate to replace Nancy upon her retirement.","So before turning it back over to Larry, let me just state that we remain confident in our full year outlook and our ability to return to sustainable, healthy earnings growth. And we continue to demonstrate our ability to generate substantial free cash flow. We have a proven track record of success in meeting long-term growth targets, generating significant free cash and optimizing capital allocation to drive shareholder value.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to Larry.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Okay. Thanks, Dave. And you may recall back in November, we outlined a four-point plan to return to healthy growth, and I think today you heard us describe examples of the progress that's being made in each of those areas.","And we're certainly focused on leveraging our enterprise capabilities and CVS Pharmacy's compelling value proposition to partner more broadly with other PBMs and health plans. Second, we're focusing on driving growth through new PBM product introductions that capitalize on the benefits inherent in our unique integrated model. Third, to continue to be a low-cost provider, we're working on a multi-year enterprise streamlining initiative that'll generate cumulative savings of $3 billion by 2021. And finally, we continue to be very thoughtful with respect to using our strong cash generation capabilities to return value to our shareholders.","Before we go to the questions, I do want to personally thank Nancy for the terrific job she has done for many years now and congratulate her on her pending retirement, and also congratulate Mike McGuire on his well-deserved promotion.","So with that, let's go ahead and open up the lines for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Thank you very much. And we'll get to our first question on the line from Michael Cherny with UBS. Please go right ahead.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Good morning, Michael.","Michael Cherny - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning and thank you for all the detail so far. I know it's a little early to give exact details on the selling season, but given the volatility seen across the PBM market, could you talk about just also qualitatively how this selling season discussions have changed early on, what people care about in terms of whether it's transparency or network performance, restricted network, I guess, some of the other trends that versus previous years may be different, particularly given a lot of the noise across the market and that question, which I think you did a good job answering, of why the PBM continues to deliver value?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah, Mike. It's Larry. I'll start and I think Jon'll jump in as well. Again, acknowledging that we just had our Client Forum last week, we had a great opportunity to meet with a very, very diverse group of our clients. I would say the dialogue hasn't changed dramatically from what we've seen the last couple of years. I think there continues to be a focus on cost. And obviously, we've got a great story to tell there in terms of the ways that we can deliver value.","And, at the same time, your question on transparency, obviously, that had gotten increased dialogue. I would say that clients want the flexibility of plan designs to meet their diverse needs. When it shakes out, I think that we'll continue to see steady movement in adoption of some of the products and services that you've heard us talk about many times.","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","And Mike, this is Jon. So obviously, cost is very important, but it's not the most important. And the environment remains competitive but rational, so not really a change over the last several years. Clients, something very important to them is the service we provide to them as a client, but also the service we provide to their members. And that's a reason you can actually lose a client if you're not delivering good service. And our service levels are at an all-time high.","And thirdly, they're more focused today, than I would say they were several years ago, around this ability to manage overall health care costs. And when we introduced our Transform Care diabetes program, that's really all about managing overall health care cost for diabetics. The response we got was very positive around this program.","We also introduced a value-based network, which is going to be a skinnier network, but the network will be expected to perform around certain clinical outcomes around adherence, which clients know lower overall health care costs.","So a lot of receptivity and focus around helping them manage their overall health care costs, not just their pharmacy benefit, which I think five years ago, was their primary focus. So this has been a gradual shift in the market over the last several years. And candidly, our assets and how we go-to-market and our ability to reach the consumer and change their behavior and lower overall health care costs, has had a lot to do with our success in the marketplace, and we continue to be very successful.","Michael Cherny - UBS Securities LLC","Great, thanks so much and congrats again to Nancy and Mike on your new roles; Nancy, your retirement.","Nancy R. Christal - CVS Health Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you very much. We'll get to our next question on the line from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Go right ahead with your question.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes, good morning and congrats on the quarter. Nancy, really enjoyed working with you, so best wishes for the retirement, and, Mike, congratulations for the new role. I have a follow-up question on the selling season. So first of all, Larry, you highlighted HTA in the prepared remarks. What is the key difference between HTA and other coalition businesses that you service?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Well, Ricky I think that with HTA, as we've talked, you've got several Fortune 100 companies, so you've got pretty sophisticated purchasers of health care in there. I would say that, in some respects, short-term, there's probably not a big difference between what HTA is focused on and what are other coalitions are focus on. I think that their short-term goal is to make sure that they're getting unit price right, like all buyers, okay. I think longer term, I think there's going to be a bigger focus in terms of how HTA can lower overall health care costs. And I think that we're in a great position to play a major role in providing solutions by leveraging our integrated assets to improve patient care. It really picks up on what Jon was just talking about. So I see it as a short-term, long-term opportunity.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And Aetna, on their call this morning, talked about the fact that they're trying to look for ways to work closer with you. So how do you view the relationship with Aetna? What are the ways that you can work closer together? And with that respect also, when do you expect to unload all of the Coventry business? When is that going to be completed?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Well, Ricky, I'll take the first part, and then flip it over to Jon on Coventry. But, Ricky, I think we have a terrific relationship with Aetna. I think our teams have been working extremely well together, recognizing that for the first few years, the focus was all about integration and how do we do all the, I'll call it, the blocking and tackling work to create a common platform that can service the diverse clients that they have across their network.","I would say for the last few years, now that we've got that in the rearview mirror, the focus has been how can we create value for Aetna, their members, and obviously for us in there. And I think that we've done some terrific things working together. I think as we go forward, you've heard us talk about how the patient of health care is now becoming a consumer of health care. And if I go back to Analyst Day, we had talked about when you look at all different customer touch points that we have with health care in mind, you can describe it as we have the front door to care and, at the same time, we're delivering the last mile of care.","So I think the opportunity is not just in terms of what we can do across our pharmacies, but now you think about Infusion in the home, the role of MinuteClinic, now Long Term Care, I think that there are some exciting opportunities as we think about partnering more broadly. Jon, do you want to cover Coventry?","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And then on Coventry?","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","Yes. So, Ricky, Coventry will be moved by the end of this year. So we've been moving it over the last several years. We're almost complete with that effort.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. We'll get to our next question on the line from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please go right ahead with your question.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And, Nancy, I'm not sure I'm going to survive without you, but picking Mike was an outstanding pick, so I'm excited that he got the job, too. So it's great news.","Nancy R. Christal - CVS Health Corp.","Thanks, Scott.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","I have two questions, and I guess the first one's more short- term oriented. Why the slightly worse outlook for Retail?","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah. This is Dave, Scott. I think what you're seeing here is probably if you look at our guidance range for Retail, it was probably abnormally high. We've now, I'll say, narrowed that range. And I think it was more of us looking at the future and saying, what would it take us to get to the top end of that range, more than I'll say a disappointment from an outlook perspective.","So think about it as narrowing the range and not seeing, at this point in time in the market, a catalyst to get us to the top of that range.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","And, Scott, when Dave's talking about range being higher, he's really referring to the guardrails associated with that range. The width of that was broader than it had been historically, simply because of all the change dynamics going on.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And my second question is more strategic as we think about 2018 and beyond, and I thought it was interesting in the release you said you won't be satisfied until you return to growth. I think, Larry, you said that. I guess my question in 2018, what do you think like the two or three levers are to get you to return to the growth, outside of M&A, like internally in your business, as you think about it as we look at 2018 and 2019, to reinvigorate growth? And then I'll yield. Thanks.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Scott, this is Dave. There's probably not one thing to that. I would say that obviously we have to continue to execute on the plan that Larry articulated around plugging into payors in more meaningful ways to drive value for them, but also move dispensing volume into one of our channels. That'll be key to us as we think about growth over time.","We continue to need to execute from a selling season perspective to gain lives within our PBM business, but importantly convert those lives, again, by selling in our integrated products to, again, drive value for those clients and move share into one of our dispensing channels.","And we're continuing to focus on the cost side as we think about the things that we need to do to be more productive, both in the PBM business and in the Retail business and the Long Term Care business. We're making investments this year that will deliver for us over the next many years significant savings to drive performance.","So all of those collectively need to work together to drive our performance in 2018 and beyond. And don't underestimate the importance of bolt-on acquisitions. Those are part of our targets. We continue to look for ways in which we can supplement our business to drive synergies for our business and expand our scope of services through the enterprise. So I think all of those will be important as we think about 2018.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","That's great. Thanks, guys. Good answer.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Take care.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll get to our next question on the line from Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. Please go right ahead.","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Thank you. And, Nancy, I will definitely miss working with you. I wish you the very best in your retirement. I hope you enjoy it and, Mike, congratulations. But, Larry, let me just follow on to the last question, and as we think about the bolt-on acquisitions and other strategic things that you could do in the marketplace, you talk about managing overall health care costs. I know I've asked this before, but do you think about owning a health plan? Is that something that you think would fit within the core assets of what you're trying to deliver from a health care perspective?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Well Lisa, I think some of this, it does go back to the last couple questions, and if you look over the last couple of years, we have certainly broadened the base of services that we provide. That has enabled us to touch more of the health care spend, creating value for respective stakeholders.","And, as I just mentioned a minute ago, we've been talking about this retailization of health care, where patients are becoming consumers. And we've got some very, very important assets. As that continues to gain traction, when you think about all the different consumer touch points that we have and all the different ways we engage with those consumers, whether it's on the front-end or delivering directly the care. So, listen, we're always looking for additional ways to capitalize on that. And that's the work that we do and we remain open to those thoughts and opportunities as they come up.","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","And as we think about the store, you talked about MinuteClinic Infusion, bringing that to Long Term Care, and I understand the bridge of all of those things. What are some of the other things that you think you could bring into your store to continue to drive the health care offering? I mean, do you think about things like vision or hearing or other services like that?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah, Lisa, I think you'll recall that we've talked about some of the pilots that we currently have underway, okay, with both vision and audiology. I think we're certainly continuing to focus in terms of the role that MinuteClinic plays and how we can broaden the scope of services that we provide, again, with quality as a key attribute.","I think we're pretty excited with the opportunity that's been created with the Veterans Administration. I think that is very unique, recognizing some of the challenges that exist in terms of veterans getting timely access to care. And the pilot program that was kicked off last year in Northern California was successful. And as you may have seen two weeks ago, it's been expanded now to the Arizona market. And I think there's optimism that we can expand it even more broadly across that. So I think, again, it's something that continues to be a focus, and more to come.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Hey, Lisa, this is Dave. I also think probably the biggest opportunity we have in the short term is you think about, I'll say, care management and think about care management from a pharmacy perspective, a patient is in our pharmacy typically several times a month. Certainly, patients with greatest needs are in several times a month. We've built an infrastructure within our pharmacies that come to life through our engagement tools at the counter that enable us to really intervene with that patient and coordinate their care across spectrums of health care, much broader than just pharmacy. And some of our health plans are beginning to tap into that capability, but I think if you look to the future, you could see that expanding pretty dramatically for us to even be more impactful as we think about how that patient manages their total health care.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","And, Lisa, if you just think...","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","And do you envision getting paid for that? I'm sorry. Just before, Larry, before you continue, do you envision getting paid for that service or is this just more of how we get paid is we're going to have more scripts through the CVS store?","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","I think it's a little bit of both, Lisa, but I do think as you think about it, think about if you narrow the network, getting more patients into our channel, we can deliver better outcomes and bend the cost curve even more dramatically. So I think you're going to see a combination of share capture, from that perspective, but also there's probably some revenue stream tied to it as well","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","And Lisa, some of this goes back to the notion, and you've heard us allude to this in the past, that as you think about a future network, pharmacy network, it won't simply be defined by price. It'll be defined by capabilities through a clinical lens, as Dave outlined.","And if you think about, we mentioned Transform Care in our prepared remarks. And the first disease state focuses on diabetes. And you think about the fact that that diabetic patient visits their doctor four times over the course of a year, but they visit the pharmacy more than 30 times. So the opportunity to engage in a differentiated way speaks exactly to what Dave was talking about.","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Okay, great, very helpful. Thank you.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Thanks, Lisa.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll get to our next question on the line from David Larsen with Leerink. Please go right ahead.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Congratulations on a good quarter. Can you talk a bit more about the Transform Care program and your value-based clinical programs? Are you working with the manufacturers and like allowing them to bear some financial risk with some programs? And are you working with other retail chains beyond like the CVS stores to engage in some sort of risk-bearing programs with them? Thanks.","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah, Dave, this is Jon. So Transform Care, as we talked about, is focused on diabetes. We have for other disease states that'll roll out over the next 24 months. And that program starts by moving their members into one of our channels, so either retail or mail. And that way, we get to apply all of the programs that we have, from connected glucometers to coaching by nurses, free MinuteClinic visits. We put guarantees around the trend.","So we will be engaging with pharma around value-based contracts, and diabetes is a good example. We haven't announced those yet, but there are certain drugs in that category, as an example, that may be effective on their own, but sometimes you have to add a second drug. And if you add a second drug, we would get a reduced cost, as an example. So we do believe there's a real opportunity to bring pharma into the fold as we roll-out these programs.","And then, as Larry mentioned, we actually launched at our Client Forum last week, a value-based network for the commercial space. And this will be working with other retailers around other programs beyond diabetes, where they will have certain clinical goals that they'll have to execute on, and their reimbursement will partly be tied to their ability to deliver. And that'll be a smaller network, say, in the 30,000 to 40,000 store range, so those retailers will get more volume into their channels. The clients get an actual unit cost savings because they're moving into a smaller channel, and then they get overall health care-lowering programs based on the clinical results that these stores deliver.","So it is a comprehensive program. Some of it will be focused exclusively in our channels for very high cost, fragile patients, like diabetics. Other programs will be in value-based networks, so it'll be smaller than the broader networks. And we believe this is where the market is going. And based on feedback we had from our clients last week, they are aligned with the direction we're moving in.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","That's great. And then Jon, I think you were recently promoted to the COO role, which I think means that you now have Retail reporting to you as well. Is that true? And then, what are you sort of most interested in doing with regards to the Retail business and the strategy; any general thoughts on how that strategy might evolve, from your perspective? Thanks.","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah, Dave, so, yes, I now do have responsibility for Retail and really all the operating units within CVS Health. And the purpose of this role is to bring innovation to the market faster. That is really going to be my focus. And by having these business units actually work more closely together and more coordinated, we think we'll be able to bring innovation to the market much faster than we previously have.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you very much. And we'll get to our next question on the line from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please go right ahead.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks for the questions, and let me also offer my congratulations to Nancy on the retirement and Mike on the new role. I guess just looking at the decrease in scripts that you guys called out from TRICARE and Prime specifically, sounds like you're saying that it had about a negative $14 million claim impact in the quarter. I'm just curious if you could talk about how that's trending relative to the full year expectations that you guys shared with us back at Analyst Day, if you've seen any changes in the marketplace that were kind of outside of what you had anticipated around those two situations.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah, I don't think we've seen anything dramatically change from our expectations as we think about that. You can't really look at it quarter-by-quarter because you do have some seasonality in there. I do think it's important, if you look at our delivery in Q1 from a script perspective, we were kind of right within the middle of our range. So in totality, our script unit growth has been pretty consistent with our expectation. And if you further fast-forward that through the balance of the year, our expectation for script growth has not changed in any material fashion.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. I guess just a quick follow-up on the Aetna relationship, it does sound like they're putting out there that they are looking to evaluate all options with you. So I guess, in your mind, you touched on this a little bit, what could that look like? And I guess the more important question that I'd have is there anything specific within your current Aetna contract that would restrict you from taking on other large health plans?","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Maybe I'll hit that one first, and then I'll turn it over to Larry. Obviously, today, we service probably a little over 70 health plans today, many of them in a pretty deep relationship. So there's really nothing that would preclude us from driving value with others in the marketplace from a health plan perspective.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah. And, Bob, I think the first question, I think it goes back to the theme that you heard Jon talk about. I talked about it earlier, deeper integration around the clinical opportunities or clinical products, services that can be provided across our breadth of assets. And I think you heard some examples of that today, and I think there is a lot of white space there that we can work together on.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay. Thanks, Larry. Thanks, Dave.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Thanks, Bob.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","See you.","Operator","Thank you very much. And we'll get to our next question on the line from Charles Rhyee with Cowen & Company. Please go right ahead.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions. And congratulations to Mike and good luck with everything, Nancy, good working with you. My question was going back to Transform Care, and just quickly on the diabetes program, can you talk about what has the uptake been, how it's being packaged in the offering in the current selling season and what kind of guarantees are you giving in terms of managing trend? What are the metrics that you're looking at? Thanks.","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah. Charles, this is Jon. So we've got a couple clients that are in pilot now, and we're signing clients up for January 1, 2018. Still early in that process, so we'll have more to say about that later this year, but I would say, again, clients seem very aligned to this concept. And they're thinking about these diabetics very similar to how they're thinking about specialty.","So specialty, most of these clients move those members into our channels because they need a higher level of care. Well, now we're extending that to diabetes and to other disease states. And we're guaranteeing a drug trend and that's client-specific based on their mix and utilization, so we actually have to do a specific underwriting for each of those.","So there's a unit cost benefit to the clients as well as the ability to lower overall health care costs that we think can be a significant savings for them. So we're very bullish on this program and excited to be launching it.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","You talked about providing other services around that in terms of coaching, et cetera, to keep members compliant, adherent to therapy. Can you talk about what kind of technology assets you're using to help drive that as well?","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah. So an example is we'll be giving members a connected glucometer. And as they test their blood sugar each day, it goes up into the cloud and is monitored by our teams. And when we see somebody off track, there's an intervention with them with a nurse to talk about what they need to do to get their blood sugar back under control and back on track.","These coaches will also work with them on things around diet and making sure they're following up and having the right tests around eye tests and foot tests. We'll be able to offer those services as part of this program for free in MinuteClinic.","And so all this information will be collected and monitored. And we think we'll have a very much higher reach rate than you see in a typical disease management program. So all of this is now being implemented in the pilots that we have up, and we think the results are going to be pretty compelling.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Is that a third-party device or is that something self-developed?","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah. We'll be working with a third-party on that.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you very much. And we'll get to our next question on the line from Steven Valiquette of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go right ahead.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thanks. Good morning, Larry and Dave. Let me offer my congrats to Nancy and Mike as well. Hey, Nancy, I think we've spoken for just about all of those 22 years, so I'm clearly doing something wrong if I'm not retiring yet, but that's just...","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Steve, you don't know how she's put up with us for 22 years.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a question on Anthem. I know there's obviously not too much you can really say at this stage in relation to the Anthem RFP, but just at a high level, I think the investment community is assuming that this is an opportunity that would likely be attractive to you. So I'm hoping you can at least confirm that, if that is the case. And then just further, my belief is that you guys would have no capacity issues or conflicts taking on this business, but some investors still seem to keep asking us about whether any of your existing managed care relationships would make it maybe more difficult for you to take on Anthem. So I'm hoping you could maybe just clear the air on that subject a little bit as well. Thanks.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah, Steve, it's Larry, and I think Dave alluded to this earlier that there is nothing that precludes us, either contractually or capability-wise, from adding to our business portfolio. And we've grown our health plan business quite nicely over the last couple of years. And we've now got more than 70 health plan clients that I think that we can work with each one in a very unique and differentiated way to satisfy their goals and objectives. And we have a guiding principle that as we work with them to make them more competitive in the marketplace, as they grow, we grow.","And I think that speaks a lot to the investments that we've made, especially on the PBM side of the business, that we brought on billions of dollars of new business over the last three, four, five years. And our welcome seasons have only gotten better each year as a result of the investments and the capabilities and, quite frankly, the talent that resides within the organization and the learnings that we get from each year that makes next year better. So, listen, we look forward to continuing to grow the business.","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","The other thing I would add is that there's been a lot written about the disruption that happens when you move business, and the industry has evolved a lot over the last four or five years. We now have automation, so a lot of these new clients are implemented in an automated way. And then, our testing platform now employs artificial intelligence, where we crawl through the claims and look for anything that's unusual. And so that has resulted in what I think have been very successful welcome seasons over the last several years. So we're very confident in our ability to implement new business, large and small.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That's great. Thanks.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Thank you very much. We'll get to our next question on the line from Alvin Concepcion from Citi. Please go right ahead.","Alvin Caezar Concepcion - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks for taking my question and, Nancy, Mike, congratulations to you both. It's been a pleasure working with you, Nancy.","Nancy R. Christal - CVS Health Corp.","Thank you, Alvin.","Alvin Caezar Concepcion - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Just a follow-up on that question, just broadly, your strategy on acquiring large books of business on the PBM side, would you ever make exception and pursue a deal as a loss leader or if not at least significantly below your typical EBITDA for script metrics?","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Well, hey, Alvin, this is Dave. As you well know, when we implement a new client, typically, we implement that at very thin margins and then we work to sell in our programs and drive substantial value for that client over the long term. And typically, you see our margins enhanced over that. As I think you know, and we discussed it earlier today, we've been very disciplined in our pricing. We have historically had very high retention rates, but our retention rates haven't been at 100%, indicating that we've been focused on underwriting each client at the appropriate return on investment, looking both to the short term but, more importantly, to the long term in our relationship with that client.","Alvin Caezar Concepcion - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. And just a follow-up about Maintenance Choice 3.0, I'm just wondering if you could talk about progress there and consumer response and impacts you're seeing.","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah, this is Jon. So, again, we introduced Maintenance Choice 3.0 at our Client Forum. The reception was, again, very positive, and you really think about all the ways we can service now a member, and members define convenience in very different ways, from: some people like mail; some people want to go to retail. We now have drive-thrus. We have Curbside. And now, we'll have home delivery within one to two hours. And it's not only for the prescription, but it'll include front store products as well. And so we think that the flexibility, access, and convenience that we will be able to bring to the marketplace with Maintenance Choice 3.0 will, again, make what is a very attractive benefit even that much more attractive.","Alvin Caezar Concepcion - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. We'll get to our next question on the line from Eric Percher with Barclays. Please go right ahead.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. I think an area we haven't focused much on is specialty and the role that specialty is playing in the coming selling season. I know there's been a lot of focus on Specialty Connect. We saw the EMD Serono report out, and a lot of focus there on data integration and managing medical alongside pharmacy. Could you speak to some of the areas where you've invested and what you're focused on within specialty this year?","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah, Eric. So this is Jon again. We have a capability that is fairly unique in the marketplace, and that's NovoLogix, which gives us the ability to manage the specialty spend under the medical benefit, which is, quite frankly, half of the specialty spend. So we're up to now over 60 million members being managed through this capability.","And you combine that with what we're able to do on the pharmacy side of specialty through Specialty Connect, through our disease management program, where our nurses not only manage the member's specialty condition, but all their comorbidities, and we have a reach rate that's 13 times greater than a traditional disease management. So we think we have a comprehensive, complete solution for this marketplace. And it's a very high priority for our clients. And our capabilities and story resonate very well.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Jon, what does that NovoLogix 60 million represent? I imagine that's not a full data set of all medical or can it be?","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah. We can manage all of the specialty under the medical spend. And it's a combination of prior authorization capabilities, repricing with some of the edits that you see on the pharmacy side that medical platforms aren't capable of managing, and also site of care. So it manages moving specialty from higher sites of care to lower cost sites of care","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Eric, it's Larry. One of the things that we heard from the Client Forum last week, with a select group of clients, and it certainly warrants additional follow-up, but I think the lines are blurring more than ever in terms of the component of pharmacy that's going through the medical benefit and the complexities that that's creating for the health plan.","And I think there is an opportunity, to pick up on what Jon was talking about, in terms of creating an even more robust and meaningful solution. That's something that we're going to be talking to those folks more about.","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","And, Eric, the last thing I would add is, as you know, there really hasn't been much control on the medical side because the medical platforms aren't capable of doing that. So this now allows us to begin to manage formularies on the medical side, which we think can bring value to the marketplace and the payors.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Well, thank you for that, and I'll extend my congrats to Nancy and Mike. Thank you.","Nancy R. Christal - CVS Health Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you very much. We'll get to our next question on the line from Mohan Naidu with Oppenheimer & Company. Please go right ahead.","Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks a lot for taking my questions. Maybe, Larry, you commented about engaging patients more actively. Can you talk about the role MinuteClinics can play there and perhaps any opportunities to expand your services in the clinics to maybe increase the foot traffic and also offer more services for patients?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah, Mohan. I think if you go back in probably, I'm going to say, over the last two years, as a result of rolling out the [FATHR], (71:26) we have broadened our scope of services. I think we now have over 30 of the top 50 acute conditions with which we're now seeing patients.","And I think one of the things that I think is probably an even bigger opportunity is we've established these relationships with some leading health institutions. Some of those institutions are getting into care management in a bigger way. And the opportunity to triage patients back and forth, I think, in the form of chronic care management, I think is a big opportunity.","We've talked about some examples of that over the last few months, the VA being one, as an example. So, I think there's more opportunities there. I think as technology continues to move forward, that also may be a conduit for expanding the scope of practice there as well.","Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. Any thoughts on perhaps adding like labs or leases or anything like that clinics?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Yes. We do. As you think about labs, we do some of that today in the form of point-of-care testing. And I think that's an area that we continue to monitor with technology always changing in that space.","Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Larry.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Thanks. All right, we'll take two more questions, please.","Operator","Certainly. And we'll take our next question from the line of Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Please go right ahead.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. Just to follow up on the questions on specialty and piggybacking on your comments earlier about maintaining pricing discipline and trying to think about growth going forward, so as we look at the FEP specialty contract loss that's upcoming in 2018 and what Prime is doing in the market, I mean, how do you look at the competitive dynamics that they bring to market in terms of the risk that they would try to shake it up and win more business? How do we get confidence that this is a one-off rather than a possible trend in terms of pricing and just the competitive nature, specifically on the specialty side or even the PBO side?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Well, Brian, listen, as you look at Prime, obviously, they're a well-respected competitor. And we would describe them as competing effectively for business, particularly in the Blues plans. And I think as you know, FEP has a very important relationship with the Blues plans in which their members exist. And that said, it does remain to be seen how attractive their model will be outside of the Blues plans which, I think as you're probably aware of, make up the vast majority of their membership today.","Listen, we continue to believe that the alignment and the integrated model that we have continues to give us an advantage in the marketplace. And going back to the FEP contract, we retained the clinical elements associated with managing the specialty patients, which I think is evidence of the integration of our model and the value that that brings for clients.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","I appreciate that. And then just a follow-up on the store closings, how much runway do you think you have left in terms of just the number of stores that are out in the market that you could close down or just a cost opportunity, if you're willing to size that?","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah, this is Dave. I think our store base, we've been pretty disciplined over the past decade or so in building out our stores. I don't think we have a big store rationalization effort underway, absent I'll say just trimming what we did this year.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","All right. Got it. Thank you, guys.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Take care.","Operator","Thank you very much. And we'll proceed with our final question on the line from John Heinbockel from Guggenheim. Please go right ahead.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","I'll add my congratulations to Nancy and Mike as well, here at the end. And so, Larry, two things; when you think about how difficult the pharmacy business is for those without scale, and I think you just picked up some pharmacies from Marsh, what's sort of the prognosis, do you think, for doing more of that, whether it's a small player like that or someone bigger, like Target? It would almost seem like that's something that would have to happen over time if some of these retailers are going to preserve economics in that business.","Helena B. Foulkes - CVS Health Corp.","I'll start. This is Helena. We continue to look in the marketplace and see opportunities, to your point, just given the pressure in the business. And I would say historically, we would look at smaller players and think about buying their files or opening up a new CVS. And I'd say a recent change in strategy is probably to be a little bit more aggressive around looking for those opportunities.","But as well, I think I might have mentioned before, we're looking at more buy-and-operate opportunities, where we can go into a marketplace with a small-scale player who serves a great set of customers \u2013 we don't have a CVS nearby, and it allows us to then serve a whole new group of customers, which is not just a retail play but obviously, a PBM opportunity for us to serve these new customers. And for us, ultimately, it's about taking advantage of scale and all these integrated capabilities that we have. So we're thinking very differently, both in terms of how the other players in the industry are reacting to the pressure, but also about building our integrated model as a result.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Do think some of the larger guys are rethinking the need to own that pharmacy relationship, or no? Because I think that's been the hindrance for some of them in getting out of it, right? They want to continue to own that relationship.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah, John, it's Larry. Listen, it's hard to answer that question with a broad brush. I do think that for some of the reasons that you heard Jon talk about in terms of how network constructs evolve with not just price as the variable, but price and clinical capabilities, I do think that that could be the triggering point that gets people to look at things differently because, obviously, a grocer has a different value proposition or a different lens in terms of the role that pharmacy plays. And if all of a sudden, they're on the outside looking in, I think that that may change how they view what's important.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","All right, thanks, John, and let me just take a minute to thank everybody again for your time this morning. And if you have any follow-up questions, Nancy and Mike are available. So thanks, everyone.","Operator","Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

Operating profit increased 15% overall, with the PBM growing about 32% and the retail business growing nearly 9%.","Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the quarter came at $0.97, that\u2019s at the high-end of our guidance and we also generated a substantial amount of free cash, totaling $1.7 billion for the first half of \u201913 and we remain committed to our disciplined approach to capital allocation, continuing to focus on returning significant value to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases.","Now considering our strong operating results to-date and all other factors affecting our outlook for the remainder of the year, we\u2019re narrowing our earnings guidance for 2013 to a range of $3.90 to $3.96. And that\u2019s from our previous range of $3.89 to $4. And while Dave will provide more details around the drivers of our revised guidance during this financial review, I do want to mention that a key driver of lowering the high-end of our guidance range is a higher than forecast weighted average share count.","Now as we announced last week, we\u2019ve reached an agreement in principle with the SEC to resolve its investigation of various Company matters that occurred back in 2009. During the second quarter we engaged in extensive settlement negotiations with the SEC and as a result we suspended our share repurchase activity until we\u2019ve reached the agreement in principal.","Now that it has been reached, we plan to resume our repurchasing efforts this quarter and we still expect to complete the $4 billion in share repurchases that we had planned for this year. So if you do the math with our share repurchase is now back half way then as opposed to recurring ratably throughout the year as we had originally anticipated. This timing shift is estimated to dampen the accretive impact of the share repurchase program for the year by as much as $0.04.","Now despite this timing shift in share repurchases, our updated guidance for \u201913 equates to excellent adjusted EPS year-over-year growth in the range of 13.5% to 15.25%. So we\u2019re still anticipating a very successful 2013.","Now let me provide a brief business update and I will start with the 2014 PBM selling season. Our model continues to resonate well in the marketplace and we\u2019re very pleased with our results to-date. Gross wins for 2014 are $4.4 billion to-date, while net new business stands at $1.7 billion. And that\u2019s despite lower RFP activity this season.","We\u2019ve been successful across all segments and this net new business excludes any impact on our Med D PDP business, which I will come back to in a minute. There are still some modest opportunities remaining for 2014, most of those are on the employer side and work is already underway for the \u201915 selling season. As for renewals, we\u2019ve completed almost 50% and have a retention rate of 97%, so overall again we\u2019re very pleased with our selling season to-date and confident that we continue to be well positioned in the marketplace with our unique products and services.","So I thought I'd just spend a minute touching on what clients have been focused on this selling season, and one area of both employer and health plan client concern is managing their specialty spend across the pharmacy and medical benefits. And as a result, we are seeing interest across our entire suite of specialty capabilities including utilization management programs, specialty guideline management, formulary strategies as well as our site of care and medical claims added in products, and we believe our differentiated approach to specialty is driving lower overall costs while improving health and providing value for both payers and patients.","Our specialty revenues grew 19% year-over-year in the second quarter and that was driven by drug price inflation, utilization, new product launches and new PBM clients. At our continued focus on managing specialty cost per client will help us continue to drive our share of specialty going forward. Now in addition to managing specialty costs, our clients are also focused on the changes resulting from the Affordable Care Act and we continue to believe that Medicaid expansion and individual small group coverage and the public exchanges will be a long-term secured growth trend, resulting in a significant amount of new coverage for people who have previously been uninsured.","Now details around the exchanges including planned participants, planned designs and rates, they continue to emerge and we believe we are very well positioned given our retail footprint along with our existing relationships with health plans and managed Medicaid plans. We've had a lot of dialogue with health plans about collaborating with us on innovative programs that support their overall exchange strategy and these discussions often encompass how they can partner with us across our retail touch points while tapping into our direct-to-consumer marketing expertise to attract and retain members.","We also discussed our medic clinic in support care management and wellness programs for the newly insured and how a plan can maximize the benefits from all of the unique clinical and member engagement programs that we can offer through our CVS pharmacy network, and we believe all of the activity around the exchanges will serve as a catalyst for broader collaboration opportunities with our health plans.","I do want to touch briefly on the PBM streamlining initiative which, as you're aware, launched in late 2010 and is near completion. We are on track to achieve the expected annual savings run rate of 225 million to 275 million in 2014. And as for the consolidation of adjudication platforms, we have now completed 11 waves of migration and we continue to leverage our resource and technology investments to refine our processes and improve efficiencies resulting in moving more clients and limiting potential disruption in each of those successive ways. 85% of our business is scheduled to be on the destination platform by yearend, so overall the streamlining initiative has been very successful.","So let me turn to our Medicare Part D business and just a quick review, we currently serve 6.8 million members in our Medicare Part D business and we do that through the health plans we serve as well as our individual Silver Script PDP including EGWP. Our individual PDP currently serves approximately 3.4 million of our 6.8 million members. Now last week we received the preliminary benchmark results from CMS for 2014 and we're pleased with the outcome. Silver Script was below the benchmark or within the de minimis range in 31 of the 34 regions.","We missed the benchmark only in one small region in which we qualified today where we have about 2,000 lives that will be subject to reassignment to another plan. So aside from any normal attrition, these benchmark results should enable us to retain the vast majority of the auto-assigns we currently serve.","Let me update you on where we stand with respect to the sanction imposed by CMS earlier this year. And as you know, the sanction prevents us from marketing our Silver Script PDP or enrolling new members. And as we've said, our goal has been to complete our remediation efforts so that the sanction would be listed before the annual enrollment period begins for the '14 plan year.","Now given some additional complexity that we uncovered while working to resolve the issues along with our strong commitment to ensuring that we are ready to operate at best-in-class levels, we have revised our plan and expanded the timeline for remediation. And based on our latest estimate, we now expect our remediation efforts will be completed sometime near the end of the year. Once our remediation has been completed, CMS will conduct its review to determine whether the issues have been fixed, are not likely to recur, and when the sanction will be removed.","So what does all that mean? Well given this current timeline, we do not expect that we will be able to participate in the 2014 annual enrollment period when it begins in October. In addition, until the sanction is lifted, we do not expect to receive new auto-assigns from CMS for 2014 in the regions where we qualify. The sanction primarily affects our individual Silver Script PDP which as I mentioned has about 3.4 million lives. It does not affect the Medicare Part D business through the health plans we serve and as a reminder, our EGWPs are also not affected by the sanction since we continue to operate under a limited waiver from CMS that allows us to enroll newly eligible retirees into our existing plans.","So let me put some parameters around the situation. First of all, assuming that sanction is not listed prior to the end of the year, here are a few factors that we can roughly estimate at this point. First, based on the preliminary results of our bid, we do expect to be able to retain the vast majority of our current 2.5 million low income subsidy enrollees. Second, based on the historic competitiveness of our products we do expect to retain a majority of our 900,000 non-low income subsidy chooser lives and these enrollees have previously chosen Silver Script as their PDP.","Third and consistent with a typical Medicare Part D plan, there will be some normal attrition of our enrollees due to death, relocation and other normal member eligibility factors and we estimate this attrition will continue at the rate of roughly 25,000 lives per month. And in January, rates of attrition are generally a bit higher after they have gone through their typical decision processes during the annual enrollment period.","So to put some preliminary numbers around this, again using historical attrition rates we estimate our PDP lives could decrease by about 350,000 lives leaving us with approximately 3.1 million lives in our individual Sliver Script PDP by the end of January '14. So clearly the sanction limits our ability to expand our Med D lives for '14 and we will continue to work diligently to have the sanction lifted as soon as possible in order to be able to enroll new members and participate in the individual age-in process next year in the regions where we have qualified.","Now obviously we take this issue very seriously. We have devoted additional resource to fully meet the needs of this important customer base. And while this does present a challenge for '14 in our Medicare Part D business, it's important to note that we still see significant opportunity to grow our Med D business over the long term and the remediation steps that we are taking will allow us to do just that.","Now moving on to the retail business, we had another very solid quarter. Total same-store sales increased 0.4%, revenue growth was muted by the impact from new generics which had a 670 basis point negative impact on pharmacy comps in the quarter. Pharmacy same-store sales increased 0.8% with pharmacy same-store scripts increasing 1.8% when counting 90-day scripts as one and increasing 5% when counting 90-day supplies as three scripts. We have seen a greater than historical rate of conversion to 90-day from 30-day scripts which is driven by the strong growth in our maintenance choice programs.","Our retention of the scripts gained during the impasse between Walgreens and Express Scripts continues to exceed our expectations. And as you know our goal is to retain at least 60% of the scripts gained during the impasse and given our outperformance to-date, we remain very confident that we will continue to retain at least 60% of the scripts in '13.","As for the front store business, comps decreased 0.4%. It was impacted largely by the shift in the Easter holiday from April of '12 to March of '13 which had a negative impact to front store comps of about 65 basis points. And during the quarter pharmacy traffic was up while the front-store traffic was down, and at the same time average front-store ticket continued to increase.","And I think it's important to note that despite the slight decrease in front-store comps our front-store margins expanded nicely in the quarter and we continue to focus on driving more profitable sales through the target of promotions we offer to extra care cardholders, and we\u2019re focused on increased personalization to accomplish this.","And to gain a bigger share of wallet we have identified customer specific opportunities for increasing frequency of both the shop and the basket size and to drive this conversion we continued to dramatically expand our personalized offers that are delivered at the point of sale and in the second quarter alone we issued more than three billion such offers and we\u2019ve also significantly expanded our personalized offers that we deliver via email.","So extra care provides extraordinary precision due to the scale of customer engagement along with the 15 years of data that has provided us unique insights into customer behavior trends and we continue to use these valuable insights from our extra care program to drive the evolution of how we tailor our stores to better meet local needs. And our latest data shows that we continue to gain market share.","Our front-store market share growth in the second quarter versus a year ago was 71 basis points and 8 basis points and that\u2019s when compared to drug and multi-outlet competitors respectively. As for new stores we opened 47 newer relocated stores, we closed one during the quarter resulting in 22 net new stores in the second quarter and this puts us on pace to achieve our 2% to 3% square footage growth target for the year.","Let me turn briefly to MinuteClinic which once again recorded exceptional revenue growth with sales up 32% versus the same quarter last year. We opened 35 net new places in the quarter and in Q2 with 684 clinics in 25 states in the District of Columbia. Our expansion plans called for the opening of 150 clinics this year and to end \u201813 with just under 800 clinics with around 30% of our expansion this year in new markets.","Our longer term goal is to create a national primary care platform to provide integrated high quality care that is convenient, accessible and affordable and new services will continue to be developed to address the shortage of primary care physicians and to support patients impacted by the epidemic of chronic disease and our positioning further supports that primary care medical home model along with connectivity through electronic health records to numerous health system alliances.","So with that let me turn it over to Dave for the financial review.","David M. Denton","Thank you, Larry and good morning everyone. Today I\u2019ll provide a detailed review of our second quarter results and then I\u2019ll provide guidance for the third quarter and update our full-year 2013 outlook. But first I\u2019d like to highlight how we have been enhancing shareholder value through disciplined capital allocation program. During the second quarter, we paid approximately $276 million in dividends bringing our year-to-date payout to $553 million. Given our continued strong earnings outlook this year we remain on track to achieve our targeted payout ratio of 25% by the end of this year. And as a reminder that is two years ahead of schedule that we laid out back in 2010.","Additionally, we repurchased approximately 6.4 million shares for approximately $355 million in the quarter at an average price of $55.39 per share. And as Larry indicated we ended the quarter with more shares outstanding than we had planned because of our decision to suspend share repurchases until we were more fully certain of the outcome of our negotiations with the FEC. And despite our slower pace in the second quarter we still expect to complete $4 billion of share repurchases in \u201913 consistent with our original plan and note that the guidance we're providing today assumes the $4 billion of share purchases will be completed this year.","So between dividends and share repurchases, we have returned more than $1.3 billion to our shareholders through just the first half of this year and we continue to expect to return approximately $5 billion for the full-year. We have generated approximately $1.7 billion of free cash in the first two quarters of \u201913 and improving our cash generation capabilities by enhancing our working capital management remains an area of focus for us, and we have made excellent progress over the past several years in reducing our cash cycle.","As I pointed out on our last call we have taken nearly two weeks out of our cash cycle over the course of the last 10 quarters. Inventory has seen the greatest amount of improvement but all areas have benefited from our focus on extracting value from our balance sheet and we remain committed to further improvements as we look further into the future.","And as previously highlighted on our last earnings call we noted that we may have some timing issues with respect to CMS payables and receivables that may affect our free cash flow delivered for the year given the issues we experience following our Med D plan consolidation. While we're maintaining our guidance for free cash flow between $4.8 billion and $5.1 billion this year we're still working to offset this headwind through our free cash flow targets and will continue to update you on our progress as we go forward.","Turning to the income statement, adjusted earnings per share from continued operations came in at $0.97 per share at the high end of our guidance. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.91 per share and as we\u2019ve said weighted average share count was higher than planned but the impact of that in the second quarter was negated by a slightly more favorable tax rate and good expense management within the corporate segment.","Now let me quickly walk you through our results. On a consolidated basis, revenues in the second quarter increased 1.7% or approximately $534 million to $31.2 billion. This was near the top of our guidance range. Solid increases in revenues in both the PBM and retail segments were offset only slightly by the increase in inter-segment activity versus primarily driven by the increase in adoption of our Maintenance Choice program.","Within the segments, PBM net revenues increased 2% or approximately $377 million to $18.8 billion. This growth was approximately 55 basis points above the high end of our guidance. The out-performance was driven by higher than anticipated claims volume, primarily from Maintenance Choice and Medicare Part D utilization.","Claims growth year-over-year was driven by new client wins and increased membership within our existing book of business, especially pharmacy was also a key driver. This was largely offset by the significant impact from new generics. The PBMs generic dispensing rate increased nearly 275 basis points versus the same quarter of last year to 81%. Note that the year-over-year increase is down sequentially from last quarters year-over-year increase by about 125 basis points and this is the trend that should continue throughout the year given that fewer generic conversions are expected for the remainder of this year versus last year.","Now revenues in the retail business increased 1.9% in the quarter or approximately $294 million to $16.1 billion. New generic introductions also negatively impacted retail sales with our retail GDR increasing approximately 280 basis points versus the second quarter of \u201912 to 82%. Now offsetting that phenomenon was the growth of our Maintenance Choice program was contributed to sales performance coming in near the higher end of expectations.","Turning to gross margin, we reported 18.7% for the consolidated company in the quarter, an increase of approximately 95 basis points compared to Q2 of \u201912. Within the PBM segment, gross margin increased by approximately 90 basis points versus the same quarter of LY to 5.1% while gross profit dollars increased approximately 24% year-over-year.","This increase year-over-year was primarily driven by increasing in GDR, higher volumes from new clients and new members and better acquisition costs and rebate economics. These positive margin drivers were partially offset by price compression and remediation and operating cost in our Medicare Part D business.","Gross margin in the retail segment was 31% also up about 90 basis points over LY, as with the PBM this improvement driven primarily by the increase in GDR and also by improvement in front-store margins. Additionally gross profit dollars increased 4.8% year-over-year within the retail segment. Expense leverage was also impacted by the growth in GDR while the de-leveraging was optically negative the growth of expense dollars was within normal parameters.","Total operating expenses as a percent of revenues increased approximately 20 basis points from Q2 of \u201912 to 12.4%, while total SG&A dollars grew by just 3.4%. The PBM segments SG&A rate was essentially flat to LY at 1.5%. The benefits from PBM's more efficient cost structure versus the same quarter last year was basically offset by the deleveraging effect of an improved GDR and cost related to remediation efforts within Medicare Part D.","From the retail segment, SG&A as a percent of sales increased to approximately 25 basis points to 21.1%. And as expected, this too is mainly due to a deleveraging effect of the growth in generics. Overall, SG&A expenses grew by 3.2%. Within the corporate segment, expenses were virtually flat year-over-year at $176 million.","Now adding it all up, operating margin for the total enterprise improved to approximately 75 basis points to 6.3%. Operating margin of the PBM improved by approximately 80 basis points to 3.6% while operating margin at retail improved about 60 basis points to 9.9%.","For the quarter, we were comfortably within the high end of our guidance for operating profit growth in both retail and the PBM segment. Retail operating profit increased a very healthy 8.6% while PBM operating profit was once again solid growing at 32%.","Now going below the line of a consolidated income statement, net interest expense in the quarter declined approximately $5 million from last year to $127 million and the debt refinancing we did in the fourth quarter last year was the primary driver of the decrease.","Additionally, our effective tax rate was 39.1% which is slightly better than expected. And as we discussed our weighted average share count was higher than anticipated, about 1.24 billion shares for the quarter.","Now let me update you on our guidance. I'm going to focus on the highlights here but you can find additional details of our guidance within the slide presentation we posted on our website early this morning. As previously stated, we narrowed our EPS range for the full year of '13 to reflect our strong operating results and to incorporate our current plans with timing of share repurchases.","We are taking down the top end of the PBM operating profit forecasted growth to reflect some incremental remediation costs related to our Medicare Part D sanction. However, these costs are expected to be more than offset by the increase in our retail operating profit growth forecast, all of which is reflected in our revised guidance.","All things considered, we've raised the low end of guidance by $0.01 and lowered the high end by $0.04. We currently expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share in 2013 in the range of $3.90 to $3.96 per share reflecting excellent year-over-year growth of 13.5% to 15.25% after removing the impact related to the early extinguishment of debt in 2012.","GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $3.65 to $3.71 per share. We've narrowed our top line outlook and now expect consolidated net revenue growth of 2% to 3%. This guidance reflects the solid performance across the enterprise year-to-date driven by better volumes as well as inflation.","We've raised the PBM segment's revenue guidance to 2% to 3% growth while narrowing retail's expected revenue growth to 2.25% to 3.25%. We expect total comp stores same-store sales of 1% to 2%. We are maintaining our prior guidance for script comps of 1.5% to 2.5%.","Now we are also introducing a new guidance metric, adjusted script comps, adjusting 90-day fills for the 30-day equivalents. Given the high rate of conversions from 30-day fills to 90-days fills, we believe this is a better indication of pharmacy performance and we expect adjusted script comps to be in the range of 4% to 5%.","As I said, guidance for operating profit growth in our retail segment has been raised while we have brought down the high end of the range for the PBM segment. We now expect retail operating profit to increase 9% to 10% year-over-year and PBM operating profit to increase 11% to 13%.","We now expect net interest expense between $500 million and $510 million, a slight increase over our prior guidance. We are increasing our weighted average share count forecast to 1.23 billion shares up from 1.22 billion. And as I said previously, our free cash flow guidance for the year remains in the range of $4.8 billion to $5.1 billion.","In the third quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1 to $1.03 per share reflecting growth of 17% to 21% versus the same period of LY. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operation is expected to be in the range of $0.94 to $0.97 in the third quarter.","Within the retail segment, we expect revenues to increase 4% to 5.5% versus the third quarter of last year. The revenue increase will be driven by solid volume growth while we expect a sharp decline and a dampening effect from new generic introductions.","We expect same-store sales of 3% to 4.25%. Script comps are expected to increase in the range of 1.25% to 2.25% while adjusted script comps are forecasted to be 3% and 3.75% to 4.75%. Within the PBM, we expect revenue growth between 4.5% and 5.5% driven by volume growth and inflation and also benefiting from the decline in the effective new generics.","Operating profit in the retail segment is expected to grow 7.5% to 9% in third quarter while operating profit in the PBM segment is expected to grow 19% to 23%. So again, we expect another very solid quarter.","And before I turn it back over to Larry, I want to touch on the quarterly flow of profits in the back half of '13 and particularly within the PBM. If you take the full year and third quarter guidance that I've just laid out and plug that into your models, you might note that our implied Q4 operating profit growth in the PBM is anemic. Here are few points you should keep in mind that should help you better understand why Q4 is somewhat atypical this year.","First, we've consistently stated the positive impact of new generics in 2013 will be front half loaded given the timing of break open generics in 2012 and the resulting lap affect into the first half of '13. We'll be lapping the impact of the substantial amount of break open generics, so the comparison year-over-years are tough.","Second, the timing of Medicare Part D profits in '13 is turning out to be different than 2012 due to a number of factors. These include the impact of a sanction, changes in earned rebates in the mix of the business across our choice versus basic products. And as a result of these factors, we are seeing a shift to profitability this year from Q4 which has historically been our most profitable Med D quarter into Q3.","So while the year and even the back half of this year remains very profitable, the comparison year-over-year in the third and fourth quarters are not expected to be typical. And I hope this helps put in context the full profits in both Q3 as well as Q4.","So in summary, the second quarter was a very strong quarter and we continue to expect strong earnings growth for the year. And I want to assure you that we remain committed to utilizing our substantial cash generation capabilities to deliver shareholder value.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Larry.","Larry J. Merlo","Okay, thanks Dave. Again, we're very pleased with our strong operating performance this quarter along with our strong outlook for the 2013 year. And despite the near-term challenges in our Med D operations, we do remain excited about the long-term opportunity for the growth in the Medicare business.","So with that, let's open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","So, Larry, two things I wanted to touch on, the first is the health personalization effort. Where do you guys stand with that in terms of being fully functional? And then what are you seeing with regard to redemption of your offers and vendor support for that program? And then finally, do you think that has a greater impact will have a greater impact on top line or gross margin?","Larry J. Merlo","Yeah, John let me take the second half of your question and then I will ask Mark to come back to your first points. And John, I think consistent as we have talked many times, and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we\u2019ve continued to use ExtraCare to create value for customers and to gain a bigger share of wallet. And we\u2019re always experimenting and working to find that appropriate balance in terms of driving profitable sales and so there is a sales margin equation there and we continue to finance our strategy with the goal of we\u2019re not going to chase empty sales out in the marketplace.","I will say in response to your second question that I think that the way we use ExtraCare benefits margin as much as sales, because you\u2019re not going to target the cherry pickers in terms of your ExtraCare offering. So I think that over time, the supplier community has grown to appreciate the value that ExtraCare brings them in terms of their ability to target specific customers based on whatever the product is and whoever they define as the user for their products. So, they find ExtraCare as a very effective tool versus some of the other tools that are available in the marketplace, like the free standing, coupon inserts. And as a result I think that we\u2019ve been able to demonstrate to them a higher return on their investment as a result of higher redemption rate. So, I will let Mark talk a little bit about where we\u2019re at this personalization and some things we\u2019ve coming online later this year.","Mark Cosby","Thanks, Larry. One of our founding truths really within the retail world is personalization and most of our initiatives are geared around bringing that to life. The foundation of that is ExtraCare as Larry talked about earlier, we do have the biggest program by a long shot, but issuing cards really is the easiest part. The tough part is behavior change and that\u2019s where the 15 years of history that we have in place has really helped us with improving the productivity of the program over time. We know it works, we know it doesn\u2019t work and that helps us improve the sales and profits over time. I think the other thing you all know, we do track our ExtraCare program religiously versus our competition in all of our customer satisfaction scores from a loyalty perspective are higher.","With that said, we\u2019re not resting on our laurels. Earlier this year we did rollout pharmacy and health rewards program, 3 million folks now enrolled in the program. It\u2019s very distinct from what you find out in the open market. It\u2019s an opt-in program where we can motivate our highest value customers. Its individual based versus household based. So it\u2019s powerful for encouraging adherence and retention and all of our customers can participate in the program regardless of the payment structure.","The biggest thing that we do earlier this year around personalization is a program we talked conversion. Its customer specific offers with two big goals in mind. They\u2019re what we call conversion offers, which encourage customers to shop broadly across the store. So, if they shop on a couple of categories, we try to work on them across the entire store and then we have it called share of wallet offers where we encourage our customers to spend more on the categories that they already shopping it. And every customer receives both of these types of offers. This program is new this year and has been very successful for us.","Also doing a lot to try and improve how we deliver the offers, our email program is up 2x more it was, at this point last year. We also rolled out earlier this year a big program against our ExtraCare center, which is what our bloggers call, our Magic Coupon Machine. We\u2019ve a lot of programs in place that have led to a 40% improvement in the usage of that program and it is one of our biggest conversion drivers because the coupons come out in advance of the transaction, not after the transaction, leading to a 15 times increase in redemption versus a standard coupon.","And then later this year, probably the biggest thing we\u2019ve coming out is what we\u2019re calling our personalized circular, which will take our traditional mass circular approach and do a circular for each individual customer and we will deliver that mechanism both online and via mobile application. So tremendous amount happening in the personalization front, it is one of our foundation principles and we\u2019ll continue to take it to the next level.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","Okay.","Larry J. Merlo","And John, just in terms of your other question around what do we think around redemption. We are seeing redemption on a per customer basis, up year-over-year.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","Okay. Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Thanks very much and good morning everyone.","Larry J. Merlo","Good morning, Lisa.","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","I just had some questions around the selling season. Larry or if Jon is there, can you just talk about your expectations for 2014, your ability to sell Maintenance Choice 1.0, 2.0? And I think Larry you\u2019ve talked about specialties specifically in the quarter. Can you talk about where you\u2019re on penetration for specialty and where you see the opportunity as we move into 2014?","Jonathan C. Roberts","Yeah. So, Lisa as we look at the selling season, and if you disaggregate the overall healthcare spent, that a payer see, so they disaggregate inpatient spending, outpatient spending, pharmacy spending \u2013 pharmacy is now one of largest categories of cost and those is a high priority for payers. When you look at pharmacy, specialty is an increasing focus and it is now one of the top priorities that we\u2019re \u2013 and we\u2019re seeing trends of around 20% and in some cases it\u2019s higher.","So our capabilities in specialty are resonating extremely well, with both our existing clients as well as prospective clients and have led to some of our success of selling season. So we\u2019ve capabilities to manage the specialty spend not only in the pharmacy benefit, but also in the medical benefit and as you\u2019re aware about half of the specialty spend is covered in the pharmacy benefit and the other half is covered in the medical benefit. In our new integrated specialty model also has appeal similar to Maintenance Choice and we rolled out across all of our CVS stores, beginning early next year.","So you combine these capabilities with all of our integrated capabilities such as Maintenance Choice Pharmacy and MinuteClinic, payers are seeing the value of our integrated model. So specifically with Maintenance Choice we\u2019re at about 16.5 million members. We introduced Maintenance Choice 2.0 this year. We see a runway to grow that to 30 million members. So, we\u2019re very excited about that. When we look at our penetration in specialty, when you look at our employer book of business, we have most of their specialty spend. We are looking to expand our reach into the medical side that today we see as mostly unmanaged. When you look at our health plan space, they have multiple providers and we think with our capabilities we can get them to reduce the number of providers they have and grow our shares. So, we\u2019re very excited about both of those products and all of our capabilities or we\u2019ve had a lot to do with our success on the selling season and also in retention of our existing clients.","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","So Jon, when we think about the 2014 selling season in specialty, are you doing anything around the formulary? I know you\u2019ve been successful on the formulary side for just regular chemical compounds, but what are you seeing on the specialty side? Are you trying to see whether you can have multiple manufacturers competing against each other for a class and therefore that\u2019s something that you can bring to the table? I mean, clearly prices keep going up on specialty, but what are some of the things that you\u2019ve won business on that you\u2019re a little bit differentiated in the marketplace. It sounds like one of the things has been able to pick up the prescription at a CVS store, but what are some of the other things?","Larry J. Merlo","Yeah Lisa, I think as it relates to formulary and specialty, we have begun that process. If you look at category like growth hormone, we have brought a formulary process that exits in the traditional spend to specialty in that regard and I think the opportunities there will continue to grow over time as more products enter the marketplace that do not have clinical differentiation.","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Can that drive the profit \u2013 is that a profit drive over the next couple of years? I mean, clearly it\u2019s a saving driver for your customer, but is it also a profit driver for CVS?","Larry J. Merlo","Yeah, I think it\u2019s \u2013 I mean as you know Lisa the client gets a disproportionate share of those rebates and \u2013 but well that\u2019s the case and that definitely a cost savings for the client. There is enhanced profitability for the business as well.","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Larry J. Merlo","Thanks, Lisa.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research. Please proceed.","Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research","Hey guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I really wanted to delve into the free cash flow, if I could for a little bit, we\u2019re kind of behind this year Dave, and I was wondering if you can maybe walk me first to how we get to about 5 billion, maybe there's some timing issues there? The second question is with the CMS issues and other things, it sounds like maybe we won't get there and I guess my question around that is that's just a timing issue? Will that money show up eventually or is it more of a permanent factor? And then the third thing on cash flow is if CMS and the way things are going with that and kind of hurting cash flow a little bit, does that have impacts as we look into '14?","David M. Denton","Okay. Thanks. Great question. Just a couple things. First and foremost, as you looked kind of year-over-year through the first half of this year compared to last year, if you recall last year, the timing of payments for CMS happened right on the quarter end kind of in advance of the next quarter. So there was \u2013 last year for the first half, free cash flow was somewhat inflated compared to a normal trend. So you have kind of tough comparisons from that standpoint. So that's just a flip between first half, second half. So that's no big deal, if you will. Keep in mind as we think about free cash flow yield for this year will not change our guidance of 4.8 to 5.1. And there's kind of two items that are kind of in play here. The first is from a CMS payment cycle is a bit longer for closed plans and upon the first of this year, we consolidated our plans at the beginning of this year and the result of that is one of our historical plan is considered closed. So this is just simply a timing issue. As we think about that receivable probably flowing not into '13 but probably into the first half of '14. The second item is due to our service challenges in the first of the quarter where we wanted to insure that all members had adequate access to pharmacy despite some of the system issues that we were experiencing. So to ensure that that access happened with all of our members, some additional utilization took place or issues putting pressure on our cash flow delivery. Having said all that, most of that is a timing issue and we're working hard to make sure that we get within our guidance range this year. So I hope that puts that in context, Scott.","Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research","Yeah, and it even sounds like it doesn't have real much impact \u2013 I mean timing issues aside, '14 is really not impacted by these same issues or is that\u2026?","David M. Denton","That is correct, Scott.","Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research","Okay, so that's perfect. That would be great and I really appreciate the clarity there. And then the second question I had was for Mark. It seems like we have lots of flow into or traffic that's going into these pharmacies likely to pick up again next year with how you guys are positioned with the Affordable Care Act. So I guess what I'm looking for and I think if I was going to say that the front end was a little weaker than we anticipated, how do you harness all that traffic into maybe above \u2013 not same, profits are good but getting those people to utilize the front end and maybe drive incremental profit as we look to '14? And then I'll yield. Thank you.","Mark Cosby","Scott, I mean I think the answer around that is consistent with what you've heard us talk about in the past. As we introduce new customers to CVS pharmacy and if that point of introduction comes from the pharmacy first, we have a unique opportunity to introduce them to the other products and services available across the entire store. So getting them enrolled in extra care, okay, a prime example of that and I think that that kind of becomes the pathway to engaging those customers in a differentiated way that allows us to harness some front store impact.","Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research","Thanks everybody, appreciate it.","Larry J. Merlo","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Zack Sopcak - Morgan Stanley","Hi. Good morning. Thanks. This is Zack for Ricky and thanks for the color. I wanted to ask another follow-up question on the front store. The negative for traffic in the quarter, I was just curious, is this a trend that you see continuing? And was this in line with your expectations given that you were expecting to trade for some bigger basket size? And also some color around your market share on the front store for the quarter?","David M. Denton","Yes, Zack, in terms of customer traffic it was pretty much in line with what we expected recognizing that there was a calendar shift with Easter that negatively impacted traffic. And I think as both Mark and myself had mentioned earlier, we are certainly mindful of how we manage that balance between driving traffic and managing promotional spend with those sales and margin in mind. And we look to bring I'll say a surgeon's knife so to speak in terms of finding that right balance. So, we continue to see a very cautious consumer out there and we don't see that changing throughout the balance of this year.","Zack Sopcak - Morgan Stanley","Okay, great. Thank you. And on a completely separate topic, there have been some rumors about the quarter of you guys being tied up and being interested in a European partner without, I guess, addressing those specific rumors. Could you just refresh us after having expanded a little bit in Brazil what your thoughts are on global and particularly in the European market?","Larry J. Merlo","Yeah, Zack, we're not \u2013 I mean as you know we have a policy of not commenting on rumors on the marketplace, but as we've discussed in the past around our international strategy, it was not a question of \u2013 it was more of a question of when and where. And as you know with this share we acquired an operating retail pharmacy chain in Brazil and we're six months into that and we're very pleased with how that's going in terms of the learnings that we're getting and the opportunities that we see to bring synergies with our U.S. operations and we're opening some stores this year. We'll accelerate our openings next year. And so far so good and we will use those learnings to further our agenda internationally where it makes economic sense. And again as we've talked in the past, we will approach that with financial visibility.","Zack Sopcak - Morgan Stanley","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly from Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse","Hi. Good morning. Nice quarter. Larry, could I just \u2013 I want to just clarify what you said about the Med D business and the impact for next year. It seems like the mass should be about 350,000 lives year-over-year that you would be down on. Is that correct, I guess first, to make sure that's right? And then as we think about the impact, should we be thinking about average revenue probably just under $1,000 per member per year and maybe a mid single digit type unit margin on that business?","Larry J. Merlo","I'll take the first part and probably the second part, maybe Dave will jump in here as well. But your takeaway in terms of the lives impact was right, in terms of we're expecting a year-over-year compression in the range of 350,000 lives for the reasons that we had mentioned. And we do not disclose the revenue or profit per life in the Med D business for competitive reasons. I would also again back to the earlier comments that the 350,000 life adjustment represents about 10% of our overall individual Silver Script PDP lives and right around 5% of our total in Med D lives.","Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse","Okay.","David M. Denton","This is Dave. I just want to clarify just one point is that what we had said is that as you roll forward from where we are today to, I'll say, January 14 that's our estimate of 350,000 lives coming out at that point.","Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse","Okay, perfect. And Larry just a similar follow-up on the idea of generic procurement and the opportunities available for things like partnerships. Could you just give us an update on how you're thinking about the opportunity out there for CVS in this area? Obviously you don't want your competitors to see a lot of opportunity and just to get your updated thoughts on this area and the potential for you to generate savings at some point going forward is there?","Larry J. Merlo","Yeah, Ed, I think as everyone's aware, we've renewed our wholesaler agreements with Cardinal and McKesson a few months ago and, and we\u2019re very pleased with the results of that, and we believe that the relationship that we have with both of those wholesalers, first of all they both do a great job and we believe that, that makes the most sense for us from both an economic as well as an efficient distribution network. Now we are certainly constantly evaluating opportunities on the market place, and if we thought that there were further opportunities for us to enhance our efficiency from both a cost as well as a distribution network point of view we certainly wouldn\u2019t hesitate to pursue those opportunities. And so I think that\u2019s something that we\u2019re watching closely, and we will continue to evaluate.","Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse","Great. Thank you.","David M. Denton","Thanks, Ed.","Larry J. Merlo","Thank, Ed.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dane Leone from Macquarie. Please proceed.","Dane Leone - Macquarie Research","Hi, thank you for taking the questions. So, maybe I\u2019ll ask the topical question of Medicare PDP a different way, and I appreciate that over the past year or two you\u2019ve focused your strategy over to overall EBITDA growth versus EBITDA prescript growth and with the PDP headwind going into 2014 and thinking about the optionality you have with the balance sheet, could you just update your strategy of what you see in the areas of organic versus inorganic EBITDA growth as consolidation rolls through the entire industry, but in the context of the plan and obviously a disappointment with CMS? Thank you.","David M. Denton","This is Dave, I guess first and foremost let me just point out that we -- from using our capital structure we\u2019ve been very disciplined and in the program that we have in place to kind of drive value for our shareholders. First, kind of in three areas, one increasing our dividend but probably more importantly in this aspect investing back in our business that we see good line of sight from a return on investment perspective and we\u2019ll use our balance sheet to do that. Further more our cash flow yield in generation is pretty substantial, so we\u2019ll continue to use that to drive our share repurchase program that will continue to work to enhance shareholder value. So, we\u2019ll -- and if you keep in mind we said very clearly that our adjusted debt to EBITDA target were 2.7 times, we\u2019re a little better than that at this point in time which gives us some additional flexibility as we think about using our balance sheet to drive value for our shareholders and we\u2019ll continue to do that both as you just heard through this year but certainly into next year as well.","Dane Leone - Macquarie Research","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard, Cleveland Research. Please proceed.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research","Good morning. Curious on the PBM growth outlook as you think about an even frame where you think we are in terms of generic benefits to profitability in the PBM relative to sure penetration of 90 day and the efforts that you\u2019re making with the formulary. I am curious how you would mix all that together and think about the growth curve of PBM profits over the next 12, 24, 36 months?","David M. Denton","Well, Eric this is Dave. I don\u2019t know if I can get you really specific here, but I think in general as we\u2019ve talked about there is a few things that are driving kind of growth in our business over time. Clearly our ability to garner lives and share in the PBM space has been pretty important to us, and as you\u2019ve even seen this year is very successful selling season as we continue to get more lives into the PBM is pretty important to us. But the question then is, how do we make sure those lives; we increase our share of dispensing across both of our channels of distribution, both within the PBM but also in the retail segment. And clearly generics while the -- over time we are in the -- I can\u2019t say the peak of the generic introductions, as we look forward there\u2019s still plenty of run, we\u2019re on for newer generic introductions over the next three to five years, despite it being somewhat a slower pace than what it has been over the last year and half or so. So, all those components that we put in place are things that we look to drive value for our clients and for our members, but also by profits for ourselves.","Larry J. Merlo","Yeah, and Eric its Larry. Just on the generic piece that Dave mentioned as we keep in mind we got $15 billion on average over the next three years $15 billion worth of branded product coming off patent. And then just one additional point, you mentioned the formulary and while that\u2019s got in a lot of discussion and with tension over the last couple of years, what we refer to as our template formulary it has today about 50% penetration with clients. So, we continue to see opportunity for further adoption especially as clients will be looking for additional ways to reduce costs and then we talked about specialty earlier as a key growth driver as well.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research","Great, and then if I could just circle back on the front end growth with was a little slower, just wondering if you could characterize why that business is slower I appreciate the focus on profitability, but if you would frame what's different in terms of the growth rate in the front end being a little bit slower.","Larry J. Merlo","Well, Eric I don\u2019t know that there is anything new from what we\u2019ve talked about in the past, but I think that we\u2019re continuing to see cautious consumers. I think as you look across some of the external data available in the second quarter whether it's IMS or some of the other data, it did show some consumer spending slow down in the quarter. So, I think it has to do as much about that as anything else.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Larry J. Merlo","Thanks Eric.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Ransom from Raymond James. Please proceed.","John Ransom \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi, I just wanted to get into the weeds a little bit with specialty, a couple of questions, one is are you distributing more and more of your specialty drugs out of your retail locations, or is it still primarily a mail order business, do you see advantages to doing it more retail. And then secondly I am curious about oncology because it's direct-to-physician drug it flows on the medical benefit, and I just wondered if there is any emerging strategies that might to attain that [beast] just given all the drugs in the pipeline. Thanks.","Jonathan C. Roberts","Yeah, hi John this is John, so specialty primarily is distributed by or specialty pharmacies via mail order. There is some specialty revenue that flows through retail. I talked earlier about our integrated specialty strategy which is really providing access for members across all 7,400 CVS retail locations but leveraging our clinical, our billing and our fulfillment capabilities on the backend. So, we will be rolling that model out next year and in a pilot that we\u2019ve done what we\u2019ve seen is that about half of the patients like to have their specialty script mail to their home and about half of the patients like to pick up their specialty script at their local CVS pharmacy. So, we believe we\u2019re going to be able to grow specialty fulfillment in retail, but we\u2019re not going to have to actually house the inventory in the retail stores because we want to deleveraging our back in and then we\u2019re also going to leverage our billing and our clinical capabilities.","As far as oncology you\u2019re right, that\u2019s a buy-and-bill that is done by the oncologist in their office. I would say that, it's not well managed today and the incentives are aligned for physicians to actually utilize the higher cost oncology medications. So there are solutions that are in the market place that we have and others have where we look to realign the incentives for physicians and incentivize them to utilize the most cost effective combination of oncology drugs that, that patient needs. So that, I am not sure in the near future you will see a movement away from that buy-and-bill model, but I do think there is an opportunity to more effectively manage it.","John Ransom \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","I guess, my other question, are you seeing, I mean I guess, potentially by \u201915 or \u201916 we could be back into a pretty high top-line drug trend, are clients focused on those and practically speaking I mean, how much can you really help them take say a 9% drug trend and turn it into a 7% drug trend or something or what do you see as specialty comes to be the lion\u2019s share of the growth and spend?","Jonathan C. Roberts","Yeah, John so when you think of drug trend you think of there\u2019s inflation, there\u2019s utilization, and then there is mix changes because of the new drug introduction, so we\u2019re actually seeing trends today around 20%, so it clearly is becoming a very, very high priority for our client. And we have solutions that can help them manage it, its utilization solutions, its formulary solutions, it's consolidating where they purchased their specialty products through our channels that provides them better economics. So we believe there are a lot of solutions that take a higher level of sophistication than what we see in the commercial space, but we've made significant investments and we believe we have best-in-class capabilities to enable our clients to more effectively manage this spend. So we're very bullish in this space and believe that not only will it continue to grow but that our tools will distinguish us in the marketplace and allow us to grow disproportionally.","John Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thank you.","Larry J. Merlo","Thanks, John.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Frank Morgan from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets","Good morning. Dave you mentioned the tail off and the operating profit in the PBM segment in the fourth quarter. That was a good explanation there, but I'm curious I think the offset mentioned there would be a ramp up in the operating profits on the retail that would offset that. Could you talk just conceptually about what you expect to see specifically on the retail side in the fourth quarter? Thanks.","David M. Denton","Good question. I think as we continue to work from a retail perspective, we continue to see very solid volume growth both was particularly within the pharmacy segment. As you think about where we started this year and our expectation for script retention within the pharmacy business, that continues to hold steady and we continue to drive performance there. Also from a front store perspective we have been very diligent on managing, I'll say volume and margin, so as we pointed out during the call, our front store margin continues to progress nicely. We continue to obviously balance, if you will, the top line front store growth outlook with our expectations for margin. So we continue to be more efficient across most of our outlook around the country. I would say that one thing that's important to think about our business and we've talked about this in the past is we can continue to progress from a financial perspective very nicely with fairly modest, I'll say, 1% comp growth in the front of our business. That consistency is probably more important than driving our market growth, if you will. I hope that helps, Frank.","Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Willoughby, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","Robert Willoughby - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a clarification. Does the 1.7 billion in new PBM business, does that include any adjustment for the Medicare losses that you mentioned? And then just secondarily, maybe Jon, can you speak anecdotally to what you found here, what incremental work do you need to do for that CMS sanction to be lifted? I wonder why this might not have been identified at your first pass at this.","Larry J. Merlo","Yeah, Bob, it's Larry. In terms of the business that we called out on both a gross and net basis that does not include the Medicare Part D business, okay. And in terms of the second question, as we went and conducted our own audit, okay, of the success of the remediation efforts, we did uncover some additional elements that need to be completed that insure that we have our systems and processes working at best-in-class levels. And that's what we need to continue and to finish up on the remediation. So, it's that straightforward.","Robert Willoughby - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thank you.","Larry J. Merlo","Okay. We'll take two more questions please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Magee from SunTrust. Please proceed.","David Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Hi. Good morning. Two questions. First has to do with what you're seeing with the cost of consumer that you referenced earlier. Are you seeing that situation getting any better at all as the year progresses and are you seeing any differences with regard to geography or demographics in that regard? And then my second question has to do with generic benefits being more muted in the second half of this year. At what point next year do you expect that to swing positive again in terms of comparisons? Thank you.","Larry J. Merlo","Well, why don't I start with the generics a little bit? As you said, really what's happening here as you look back in really last year, the back half of last year, those break open generics accelerated, so you saw that comp itself into the first half of this year. So now we're facing pretty tough comparison in the back half. I think as we think about moving forward, there's still plenty of opportunities for break open generics over the next several years, the timing of which quite frankly is probably a little too early to give you kind of a sense of specifically how '14 will shape up from that perspective kind of year-over-year. But rest assured if you look ahead to the next two to five years, generic introductions are still pretty robust despite the fact that we're in a peak at this point in time. From a consumer perspective, maybe I'll ask Mark to comment on that a bit.","Mark Cosby","Yeah, so we are seeing some divergence of results based on where our stores are and most notable between lower income, higher income areas where we see the most difference. And it's most noticeable in those areas between \u2013 mostly on the front versus the pharmacy which tends to be more flat. So we are doing some things in those lower income area to try to help the value perception and we'll begin lowering those out in the second half of this year.","David Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay, great. Thank you.","Larry J. Merlo","Okay, last question.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Meredith Adler from Barclays. Please proceed.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I'd just like \u2013 two questions. First is, you talk about losing the 350,000 lives. The remediation costs seem like they were noticeable in so far this year. Do you expect that cost to continue at the same level or to be higher in the second half and are you likely to be any cost next year as well?","David M. Denton","Meredith, this is Dave. We haven't broken out those costs specifically. I'll just say that all those costs are baked into our outlook for '13 and I think we're pretty confident that we have our hands around the cost spend for that. But I guess as we cycle into '14, it's probably just a little too early at this point in time to give you some clarity around that specifically at this point. But clearly as we said our expectation is to have the remediation effort complete, if you will, kind of nearly into the year so that would say that most of those costs would not continue.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital","Okay. And then I have a question about reimbursement for generics. I was recently talking to Walgreens and I know that they have chosen to sign slightly different contracts with payers in order to spread out the benefit from generics. And so instead of being very, very high in the front and then dropping very sharply at some point, there were kind of spreading it out. I think you guys have always said that the best profit comes when you have three suppliers, but have you looked at all about smoothing out the benefit from generics in terms of gross margin?","Larry J. Merlo","Meredith, this is Larry. We have \u2013 I think there's been a lot of dialogue around the use of, I'll call it market basket or capped generic effective rates over the last 12, 18 months and from a CVS pharmacy perspective, we started using those a few years back. And from our perspective not much has changed. And I think that we continue to think about the cadence of generic reimbursement very consistent with how we [cross manage] in the past and how you mentioned it. And I think it's important to note that despite the dialogue around these things, this does create more predictability from a forecasting and a budgeting point of view. It does not alleviate the fact that there continues to be ongoing reimbursement pressure across the business.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital","I guess I'm still not clear. Did you say that you haven't made any changes at all, you still sort of have this pattern of dropping at a certain point?","Larry J. Merlo","Yeah. Meredith, I'm saying that \u2013 what's been talked about in the marketplace we started doing several years ago.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital","I see, okay.","Larry J. Merlo","So from our perspective, we haven't seen a change.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital","Got it, okay. And then my final question, I think, is for Jon. There was a question before about managing the oncology spend and doctors [buy and build]. You had a program that you were working on that had to do with getting doctors to call a certain pathways and generally keeping their reimbursement at the same, but encouraging them to use the lowest cost oncology treatment. I was wondering if \u2013 you did mention it today and I\u2019m wondering if that test is still there, and whether you feel like you\u2019re getting traction with physician is without getting a bit of pushback from them in terms of that program?","Jonathan C. Roberts","Yeah Meredith, so we still have that program. It\u2019s out in the marketplace. I would say that the payers are probably a little more reluctant to take on oncology and they\u2019re focused on other areas that are less sensitive. But we still believe that the oncology space needs a solution and we think the solution and the approach that we\u2019re taking is the most prudent approach and delivers savings without creating patient and physician disruption. So we\u2019re still committed to that program.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital","And when you say the payers are attacking other things, are you talking about mostly the pharmacy benefit or they also looking at other areas funded under the medical benefit?","Jonathan C. Roberts","Yes, they\u2019re looking at both.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital","Both?","Jonathan C. Roberts","So formulary and utilization programs across both pharmacy and medical benefits and they\u2019re coming to ask and asking us to take our capabilities that we\u2019ve demonstrated on the pharmacy side of the specialty spend and extend that into the medical spend. So, again it\u2019s a capability that we\u2019ve that we think not only make sure that the right drug gets utilized, but the billing is appropriate medical claims, systems don\u2019t have good edit \u2013 editing capabilities on them, so we provide that editing capability and make sure that the appropriate charges are paid. So, lot of interest in the space. Again, half the spend is on the medical side and you\u2019re seeing specialty grow faster than any other part of the pharmacy business.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital","Great. Thank you very much. I appreciate the help.","Larry J. Merlo","Okay. Thanks, Meredith and let me just thank everyone for their time this morning and your interest in CVS Caremark and if there are any further questions which you have, you can reach out to Nancy Christal.

Please go ahead, madam.","Nancy R. Christal - CVS Health Corp.","Thank you, Nelson. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I'm here this morning with Larry Merlo, President and CEO; and Dave Denton, Executive Vice President and CFO. Jon Roberts, President of CVS Caremark; and Helena Foulkes, President of CVS Pharmacy are also with us today, and will participate in the question-and-answer session following our prepared remarks.","During the Q&A, please limit yourself to no more than one question with a quick follow-up, so we can provide more people with the chance to ask their question. Please note that we posted a slide presentation on our website before this call. It summarizes the information in our prepared remarks, as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance. Later this afternoon, we'll be filing our Form 10-K and it will also be available on our website.","During today's presentation, we'll make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws. By their nature, all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements for a number of reasons as described in our SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section and Cautionary Statement disclosures in those filings.","During this call, we'll use some non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company's performance. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find the reconciliations of these non-GAAP items to comparable GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of our website. And, as always, today's call is being simulcast on our website and it will be archived there, following the call, for one year.","And now, I'll turn this over to Larry Merlo.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Well, thanks, Nancy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. The solid fourth quarter results we posted today nicely wrap up our 2016 year. And for the full year, consolidated net revenue increased 15.8%, with operating profit growing 8.3% and adjusted earnings per share increasing 13.2% with strong results across the enterprise. And the growth rates I'm citing are on a comparable basis and you can find the non-GAAP adjustments on the slides we posted on our website.","Now, as expected, enterprise growth in the fourth quarter was solid with consolidated net revenues increasing 11.7%, operating profit increasing 4.6%, and adjusted EPS increasing 11.8% to $1.71, a penny above the high-end of our guidance. In the fourth quarter, operating profit in the Retail\/Long Term Care segment was in line with expectations and operating profit in the PBM segment was ahead of expectations.","We generated approximately $1.5 billion of free cash during the quarter and $8.1 billion for the full year, above the high-end of our guidance range. And we'll continue to be thoughtful and discipline with respect to using our strong cash generation capabilities to return value to shareholders.","For 2017, we are confirming the EPS and cash flow guidance we provided at our Analyst Day in December, and Dave will review the guidance details in his remarks.","Now, before turning to the business update, I want to touch on a few areas of investor interest. And let me start on the topic of DIR within the Medicare Part D program, so we can correct some false and misleading statements in the marketplace which suggested that DIR performance network-based fees represent a material risk to our company; a statement that could not be further from the truth.","So here's what you need to know about DIR. First, DIR includes any rebates, any discounts or other price concessions that are unknown at the point-of-sale; and DIR, ultimately, is utilized to reduce the net cost of the Med D program.","The second point; DIR performance network fees charged to pharmacies are allowed under CMS regulations. They're fully passed through from the PBM to their clients. They are fully disclosed as part of the annual bid process. And, again, are ultimately used and reflected to help lower member premiums. As a matter of fact, member premiums over a five-year period have increased at a CAGR of just 1.7%. So you can see the positive impact this is having on controlling costs.","The third point, and for the reasons just mentioned, CVS Caremark does not keep or profit from performance network-based DIR. And as a reminder to everyone, both CVS Pharmacy and CVS Specialty participate in the same performance network programs being called into question.","The fourth point, network pharmacy providers are proactively informed of, and educated on, program details including their forecasted financial impact in advance of program implementation.","And the fifth and final point, any suggestion that Part D plans favor high-priced drugs to drive people through the benefit and into catastrophic coverage faster is erroneous, and the data proves that.","In fact, the percentage of our beneficiaries reaching the coverage gap and ultimately catastrophic coverage has decreased over the past several years and is a relatively small percentage of our overall population.","Now, we don't think DIR is likely to go away given its effectiveness in helping to lower premiums. But hypothetically, if it were to go away, there would be a level playing field, we would remain quite competitive, and we would not expect any material impact on our business. So I hope this clears up the gross misunderstandings surrounding DIR with the simple statements of fact.","So with that, let me move on to the topic of the potential repeal and replacement of the ACA. We believe it's important to provide affordable coverage for all Americans, which both Democrats and Republicans have acknowledged. However, at this point, it's extremely difficult for us to comment on the possible scenarios that may play out in the coming months. And that said, CVS Health can pivot to address policy changes, help reduce healthcare costs, and bring meaningful solutions to the marketplace.","I also want to address the ongoing rhetoric around drug pricing. And whether it's new launches at elevated price points or increasing prices of older drugs, those contributing to a sense that government interventions are necessary and any suggestion that PBMs are causing drug prices to rise is simply erroneous. We are the solution and not the problem. And that's why both public and private payers continue to count on PBMs as indispensable partners that help to manage their drug trend.","And numerous evaluations from the FTC, or the Congressional Budget Office and other government agencies have consistently concluded that PBMs operate in a highly efficient market and drive real savings to the healthcare economy. And our CVS Caremark solutions have helped reduce crime client costs from an unmanaged gross trend of 11.8% to a managed trend of 3.3%; and those results are for the first three quarters of 2016.","In addition, a recent industry study showed that every dollar invested in PBM services returned $6 in savings for clients and members. So the value of PBMs is quantitatively pretty clear.","And one additional topic that we've received a lot of questions about centers on the potential impact of corporate tax reform. As you know, we are at the highest end of corporate tax payers given our domestic profile, with an effective tax rate around 39%. And the details of tax reform certainly will matter, and today, while there's a lot of discussion, nothing has been reduced to writing. But suffice to say that a fairer tax code that includes a meaningful reduction in the effective corporate tax rate would allow CVS to unlock even greater economic opportunities.","So we certainly look forward to continuing to engage in the dialogue around all of these issues that may impact our industry, our business, and the clients and customers that we serve.","So let me turn now to the business update, and I'll start with the 2017 PBM selling season. Our gross and net client wins are slightly higher that at Analyst Day with gross wins totaling nearly $7.9 billion, net new business around 4.4 billion and a client retention rate of around 97%. And these numbers exclude enrollment results from our SilverScript PDP, which I'll touch on shortly.","In addition, I'm pleased to say that we have had an outstanding welcome season, continuing our record of strong implementations over the last few years. We processed significant more transactions during this year's welcome season, and client satisfaction showed continued improvement across all business lines reaching record performance levels.","And while we remain committed to improving and advancing every day, we continue to believe the investments we made in quality, automation and customer focus are delivering measurable value to our clients year after year.","Looking ahead, we have about 23 billion up for renewal in 2018, which is comparable with prior years from a percent of business perspective. As for new business, it's pretty early to gauge the full extent of RFP activities in the 2018 selling season. And our strong service history, our size and scale, and our unique suite of capabilities gives us the tools we need to be successful in retaining business and winning in the marketplace as opportunities arise.","Now, as we've discussed many times, top of mind for our clients continues to be managing their rapidly growing specialty trend. And we offer a comprehensive set of solutions and continue to see solid growth in specialty. And specialty revenues increased 12% in the fourth quarter, continuing to outpace the market.","Our Medicare Part D business, SilverScript, wrapped up another successful annual enrollment period and retained its position as the number one PDP spots. We began the 2017 plan year with more than 5.5 million captive PDP lives and that includes EGWPs, and that's up about 10% from January of the prior year.","When adding the Med D lives we manage for our health plan clients, the non-captive lives, the total rises to 12.3 million Med D lies under management. And you can find a reconciliation of the Med D lives in the posted slides.","Now, moving on to the fourth quarter results and the Retail\/ Long Term Care business, same-store prescription volumes increased 2%. That's on a 30-day equivalent basis. Total same-store sales decreased 0.7%, with pharmacy same-store sales up 0.2%.","Our pharmacy comps were negatively impacted by about 380 basis points due to recent generic introductions. And they were also negatively impacted by the decision to restrict CVS out of the TRICARE network. And as we said on our last call, that network changes communicated in early October with a December 1 effective date. And we saw these scripts begin to migrate out of our stores during the fourth quarter and in line with our expectations.","Let me touch briefly on the CVS pharmacies within the Target stores. And now that the integration is behind us, we're seeing improving script performance versus prior quarters; and this is being driven by the strength of our patient care programs and Maintenance Choice.","The Target pharmacies have also exhibited a solid operational foundation providing high levels of service to our patients. So we're making good progress since completing the integration activities and moving in the right direction.","In our Long Term Care pharmacy business, we continue to target the significant growth opportunities we see in the Assisted and Independent Living markets. And we're focused on creating better solutions that meet the need of senior living communities and their residents.","And we're taking advantage of all of our enterprise assets, including CVS Pharmacy, our infusion properties and MinuteClinic. And we launched some new programs in these settings during 2016, we're piloting others in early 2017 and we'll have more on these programs in the coming quarters.","Before turning to the front store, let me highlight our recent announcement on generic epinephrine. Given the urgent need in the marketplace for a less expensive epinephrine auto-injector for patients with life-threatening allergies, we partnered with Impax to purchase their product at a price lower than similar brand or authorized generic products. And we now have available at all CVS Pharmacy locations the authorized generic for Adrenaclick at a cash price of about $110, a price that's 80% lower than that of the brand competition in the market. And this move is consistent with the fact that increasing competition within therapeutic drug classes is a way to reduce the cost of prescription drugs, and we're using our capabilities and our scale to do just that.","Turning to the front store business, comps decreased 2.9% as a result of softer customer traffic, combined with our continued focus on increasing personalization and rationalizing our promotional strategies. At the same time, front store gross margin once again improved in the quarter versus last year.","And keep in mind that our front store business accounts for about 11% of our enterprise revenues, and these personalization efforts are allowing us to invest our promotional spend in a differentiated way producing margin flow-through. In fact, we have started to further reduce mass promotion in 2017 to better serve our loyal customers and continue driving profitable front store sales.","We continue to focus on growing our beauty, healthcare and personal care businesses, and recognizing the growing presence in the digital market, we've been focused on enhancing our online capabilities to create an integrated health and pharmacy experience that only CVS can provide.","CVS Curbside is now live in about 4,000 CVS Pharmacy stores and it provides a fast, seamless shopping experience with customers ordering products on their mobile devices and then picking them up at a CVS store without getting out of the car.","We also introduced CVS Pay which allows customers to pick up prescriptions, use ExtraCare, pay for front store items, all with one scan of their CVS app. And this year, we plan to enhance our online shopping tool and further integrate personalization into digital platforms to increase engagement with health and beauty shoppers.","We also continue to roll out store resets to improve our health and beauty leadership. Our focus is on scaling our healthy food selection and optimizing our key categories in the health quadrant and elevating our beauty offerings while improving shopability.","And finally, Store Brands remain an area of strength and significant opportunity. Our Store Brands represented 23.7% of front store sales in the quarter and that's up about 160 basis points from the same quarter a year ago.","Now, before turning it over to Dave for the financial review, I want to again acknowledge the near-term headwinds in the retail business this year given the unexpected network changes we highlighted late last year. And as previously outlined, we have a plan in place to return to more robust levels of earnings growth. And let me quickly summarize this four-point plan in response to the near-term market dynamics.","First, we'll leverage our enterprise capabilities and CVS Pharmacy's compelling value proposition to partner more broadly with other PBMs and health plans to deliver the greatest overall healthcare value.","And our partnership with Optum, which starts with a 90-day solution, is a great example and we look forward to discussing other long-term opportunities to bring together complementary capabilities that provide greater convenience and value for our clients and customers. We've begun to offer a menu of services to other PBMs and health plans as well, including exclusive capabilities such as MinuteClinic services, infusion and Long Term Care capabilities as a component of the CVS pharmacy value proposition.","Second, we'll continue to innovate to bring new integrated PBM products to market that capitalize on the benefits inherent in our unique integrated model, while meeting the ongoing needs of our clients and members.","Third, as we discussed on Analyst Day, we've begun work on a new multi-year enterprise streamlining initiative. And through these efforts, we expect to achieve nearly $3 billion in cumulative savings by 2021.","And fourth, we have significant cash generation capabilities that provide us with a variety of ways to grow and return value to shareholders. And we remain confident that we can achieve solid operating profit growth across the enterprise in the years ahead. And our substantial cash flow affords us opportunities to bolster that growth, either through strategic acquisitions to supplement our existing asset base or through value-enhancing share repurchases.","So with that, let me turn it over to Dave for the financial review.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll provide a detailed review of our 2016 fourth quarter results, and I'll briefly touch upon our 2017 guidance, which again remains materially unchanged from what we outlined back in December.","First, I'll start with a summary of last year's capital allocation program. Maximizing shareholder value continues to be a major focus of CVS Health. And the key areas we focus on to do this are: driving productive long-term growth, generating significant levels of free cash flow, and remaining disciplined in our approach to capital allocation.","In summary, for the year of 2016, we delivered adjusted earnings per share growth on a comparable basis of more than 13%, generated more than $8 billion in free cash, and returned very significant $6.3 billion to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. And I think this clearly demonstrates how we've continued to use our strong free cash flow to drive shareholder value.","So with that, let's walk through some of the details. We continue to drive steady state improvement in our dividend payout ratio. Recall back in 2010 that our payout ratio was approximately 14%. We finished 2016 with a payout ratio of 34.6%, more than double 2010's level and 450 basis points higher than 2015. Keep in mind that this ratio is artificially high as it includes the integration cost related to both Omnicare and Target, as well as other items described in our non-GAAP reconciliation on our website.","So there's still room for growth. We paid approximately $1.8 billion in dividends in 2016 and $456 million in the fourth quarter alone. Our earnings outlook this year, combined with the 18% increase in the dividend we announced at Analyst Day, keeps us well on track to achieve our targeted payout ratio of 35% by 2018.","Along with a significant increase in our dividend, we've continued to repurchase our shares. For all of 2016, we repurchased approximately 48 million shares for about $4.5 billion, averaging $96.78 per share. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 6.1 million shares for $461 million, averaging $75.20 per share.","At the end of 2016, we had $18.2 billion left in authorizations for share buybacks, and we continue to expect to repurchase $5 billion this year. Our expectation is that we will return more than $7 billion to our shareholders in 2017 through a combination of both dividends and share repurchases.","And given the dislocation of our stock price, recently, we entered into two accelerated share repurchase transactions totaling $3.6 billion and we've repurchased 36.1 million shares at a price of $80.34 per share in January. This represents 80% of the total value of the transaction, which will close by the third quarter.","We generated $1.5 billion of free cash in the fourth quarter. And all of 2016, we generated approximately $8.1 billion of free cash, which exceeded the high-end of our guidance by about $1 billion. The outperformance was primarily driven by the timing of PBM cash receipts and payables. And keep in mind that some amount of this beat is timing within Medicare Part D as we will end 2016 in a payables position with CMS, and we will need to settle this obligation in 2017.","At the same time, we improved our cash cycle by nearly 3.5 days, driven by improved inventory and payables management. And we remain committed to further improvements in working capital as we look forward.","For the year, our gross capital expenditures were approximately $2.2 billion; about $145 million lower than last year. This was due to our expected reduction in store openings as we integrated the Target pharmacies. With $230 million and sale-leaseback proceeds, our net CapEx for the year was approximately $2 billion.","As for the income statement, adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.71 per share, one penny above the high-end of our guidance range, up 11.8% over LY. This is on a comparable basis, and the reconciliation of the adjusted earnings per share from GAAP can be found in our press release, as well as on the Investor Relations portion of our website. GAAP diluted EPS was $1.59 per share. On an adjusted basis, results within the PBM were slightly above expectations, while Retail\/Long Term Care was in line with our expectations.","So with that, let me provide you some more details as I quickly walk down the P&L. On a consolidated basis, revenues in the fourth quarter increased 11.7% to nearly $46 billion. In the PBM segment, net revenues increased 17.9% to $31.3 billion. As we've seen all year, this growth was attributable to increased volume and pharmacy network claims, as well as growth in specialty pharmacy.","While very strong, this top line growth was slightly below our guidance range, primarily driven due to lower inflation and drug mix versus our expectations. Partially offsetting the sales growth was an approximate 170 basis point increase in our generic dispensing rate to 85.4%. PBM adjusted claims grew by 19.9% in the quarter. And we finished the year with 1.39 billion adjusted claims, at the top end of our expectations.","I want to mention that for 2017 we're changing our methodology for counting pharmacy network claims in order to keep script counts consistent across our operating segments. Going forward, 90-day prescriptions filled within our pharmacy networks will be adjusted to a 30-day equivalent basis, just as we've been doing within the Retail\/Long Term Care segment for several years.","This change will also make us more comparable to one of our competitors, who recently made a similar change. The supporting schedules posted to our website this morning provide the historical adjusted script counts. So with the change to methodology, our PBM adjusted claims grew 24.6% in the fourth quarter.","In our Retail\/Long Term Care business, revenue increased 4.7% in the quarter to $20.8 billion. This was in line with our expectations and driven primarily by strong pharmacy same-store sales script growth, partially offset by decline in front store same-store sales. During the quarter, GDR increased by approximately 120 basis points to 85.2%.","Turning to the gross margin, excluding acquisition-related integration costs recorded within the Retail\/Long Term Care segment, we reported 16.6% for the consolidated company in the quarter, a contraction of approximately 115 basis points compared to Q4 2015. This was consistent with our expectations and primarily driven by a mix shift as the lower margin PBM is growing faster than the Retail segment.","Within the Retail segment, gross margin declined approximately 40 basis points versus Q4 of 2015, to 5.2%, while gross profit dollars increased 9.6% year-over-year. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to increases in volumes, the improvement in GDR, and favorable rebate and purchasing economics. Partially offsetting these drivers was the impact of continued price compression.","We outperformed versus our expectations due to lower utilization within the Medicare D PDP, as well as more efficient expense management within cost of sales. The decline in gross margin rate in the PBM was primarily due to continued price compression and the timing of Med D margins, partially offset by improved cost of sales management.","Gross margin in the Retail\/Long Term Care segment was 29.8%, down 40 basis points from last year, excluding acquisition-related integration cost. This decline was primarily driven by continued pressure on reimbursement rates. Partially offsetting this was the increase in GDR and the strong front store margin improvement, aided by the continued rationalization of our promotional strategies and improved product mix. Gross profit dollars increased 3.4% in the quarter.","Turning to operating expenses, operating profit and the tax rate, the numbers I am citing on a comparable basis also exclude the items noted on the slides. Total operating expenses, as a percent of revenues, notably improved from Q4 2015 to 10%. The PBM segment SG&A rate improved approximately 25 basis points to 1.1%; thanks to improving efficiencies. SG&A, as a percent of sales, in the Retail segment remained relatively flat to LY at 19.5%.","Within the Corporate segment, expenses were up approximately $20 million to $236 million, above our expectation. This was primarily driven by higher severance associated with our continued focus on cost improvements.","Operating margin for the total enterprise declined approximately 45 basis points in the quarter to 6.6%. Operating margin in the PBM declined approximately 20 basis points to 4.2%, while operating margin at Retail declined approximately 40 basis points to 10.3% on an adjusted basis.","For the quarter, operating profit growth in the PBM was above expectations for the reasons I provided earlier, while Retail\/Long Term Care was in line with our expectations. The PBM increased a solid 13.3%, and Retail\/Long Term Care grew 0.8%, again, on an adjusted basis.","Going below the line on the consolidated income statement, net interest expense in the quarter decreased approximately $34 million from last year to $242 million, due primarily to paying down debt and a lower average interest rate on the debt that remains outstanding.","Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 38.5%, and our weighted-average share count was 1.1 billion shares. For the year, our effective tax rate was 38.6%. The tax rate was lower than expected for the quarter and the year due to certain permanent items that were recognized during the fourth quarter.","So with that, let me now touch on our 2017 guidance. I'll remind you that 2017 is expected to be a rebuilding year of sorts, but our goals remain clear and we fully intend to get back to healthy levels of growth going forward. I'll focus on the highlights of our guidance here, but you could find all the details in the slide presentation that we posted on our website earlier this morning.","In 2017, we continue to expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share in the range of $5.77 to $5.93, and GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations in the range of $5.02 to $5.18. Note that the growth rates have been adjusted slightly to reflect the actual Q4 2016 jump-off point, which you can see on our slides.","Let me point out that we are now including an estimate of $35 million of Omnicare-related integration costs in the GAAP guidance. Recall that we have been excluding those costs when we provided guidance last year, given our inability to reasonably forecast their magnitude and their timing. But with the integration winding down and the small amount of expected costs in 2017, we can now reasonably estimate these costs. As you can see in the non-GAAP reconciliation, these costs were expected to be offset by minor changes in other non-GAAP adjustments resulting in no change to our GAAP guidance.","We have reduced our top line growth expectations in both the Retail\/Long Term Care and the Pharmacy services segments, while at the same time maintaining our dollar estimates for operating profit within each segment. Both segments are being impacted by lower inflation than what we had originally forecasted. Additionally, we're reducing script growth expectations at Retail to account for some softness that we're seeing in our business.","As a result, we now expect revenues to be down 1.75% to 3.25% in the Retail\/Long Term Care segment, with same store sales down 2.75% to 4.25% and same-store scripts between down 0.25% to up 0.75%.","Top line growth of 7.5% to 9.5 is now expected in the PBM, while claims growth remains unchanged except for the change in methodology that I laid out before. Under the new methodology, we now expect adjusted claims of $1.76 billion to $1.78 billion. We expect consolidated net revenue growth of 2.5% to 4.25%.","As I mentioned earlier, our expectations for operating profit generated in 2017 remains unchanged. After updating the baseline for Q4, we continue to expect Retail\/Long Term Care operating profit to decline by 7% to 9.5%, and now expect PBM growth of 5.75% to 8.75%. This results in a decline of 2.5% to 5.25% in the consolidated operating profit.","Now, moving on to the first quarter guidance, we're making similar adjustments to the top line expectations to account for the same factors. We expect a decline of revenues in the Retail\/Long Term Care segment of between 3.25% and 5%, with same-store sales down 4.25% to 6% and same-store scripts down 1% to 2%. We now expect PBM revenues to grow 6.25% to 8%, and consolidated net revenues to grow 1% to 2.75%.","As you may recall, we highlighted several timing factors at Analyst Day that affect the cadence of profit delivery throughout this year, which is expected to be significantly back half weighted. With that in mind, in the first quarter we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.07 to $1.13 per share, a decline of 4.75% to 9.75%. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $0.82 to $0.88 per share.","Additionally, our free cash flow guidance for the year remains in the range of $6 billion to $6.4 billion. I'm very pleased with the company's continued ability to generate significant cash flow, which will continue to play an important role in driving shareholder value over the longer term.","And so, with that, I'll now turn it back over to Larry.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Okay. Well, thanks, Dave. And we remain confident that we are well-positioned as the healthcare market continues to evolve. We continue to have the most extensive suite of integrated enterprise assets, and on a stand-alone basis each one would be market-leading. What really sets them apart lies in our ability in a large way through technology to integrate pharmacy care from the payer to the provider and ultimately to the patient. And these capabilities help us to deliver on our goal of driving more affordable, more accessible, and more effective care.","So with that, let's go ahead and open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much, and thank you for all the color. Larry, how do we solve for this problem of the perception that PBMs are part of the problem and not the solution? Is there a way to provide more transparency, maybe as an industry is there a way to provide more transparency on Medicare Part D?","I appreciate, clearly, everything that you had to say today, but I think that the rhetoric discontinues because of that lack of transparency. So any comments that you have around that, number one. And number two, as this discussion is going on in D.C., are you and the other PBMs part of this discussion?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Well, Lisa, it's a great question. And, first of all, I think it is important that the story be told in a succinct and factual way, starting with the key policymakers and decision-makers, and that starts in D.C. And we've certainly been having those discussions in an effort to separate fact from fiction.","And I think for the reasons that I alluded to in my prepared remarks there, we need to deal with this issue today. But the PBM industry has dealt with this issue in the past and has gone through a series of reviews, as I alluded to earlier, whether it was through the FTC, through Congressional Budget Office, other governmental agencies that have quantified not just the role that PBMs play, but the value that PBMs bring to the healthcare economy.","And so, it is important that we start there. And at the same time, listen, we're having an awful lot of discussions with our clients. And as we talk about transparency with them, I do believe that they understand the role that we bring for them. And I think that in this environment where benefit plan designs continue to evolve and change, I think we're doing more to share with them what we see as best practices across the industry, especially as you think about the growth of consumer-directed health plans and what it means to provide the value of those rebates or discounts at the point of sale and what it means to have a preventive drug list, where there's zero out of pocket expense for their members. I just use those as two examples.","So, Lisa, I don't think there's a single answer to that other than \u2013 which I think is where you were going \u2013 it really needs to be a surround-sound dialogue with a variety of constituents.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And, Jon, since he's in the room, I mean as we move through the early parts of the selling season, are people asking for different things? I mean, we clearly just heard what Larry talked about, high-deductible health plans, having more visibility. Do you hear from your clients that they have the transparency that they want and, therefore, this is more of an outside type of event where the rest of us sitting here on the outside don't have the level of transparency we'd like, but your customers are happy and they feel like they're getting what they need out of their PBM and, therefore, over time this will solve for itself? I think that this is really just the biggest issue right now as we think about the PBM industry going forward.","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","I mean, Lisa, listen, those are all good points. I think at the end of the day our clients hire us to manage their pharmacy benefit. And the trend that we've seen through the first three quarters of the year is 3.3%. We'll be looking at our final number for 2016 in a couple weeks, and we think that number could potentially come down a little bit. So they're very happy with the cost of their overall benefit relative to the price increases they're seeing in the market with branded prescriptions.","Secondly, on the transparency issue, our clients do have audit rights with rebate contracts, network contracts. They have the level of transparency they need while protecting our ability to negotiate and ensure that they get the best economics that we can in the marketplace. So I think part of the challenge is just the complexity of the pricing model in pharmacy. There's no easy answer for that, but we're continuing to work on it.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Lisa, it's Larry again. I think when I hear you ask that question, you think about the rhetoric from those who are perhaps selling the drugs from those who are buying the drugs. And when you hear that, it gives me pause in terms of taking a step back and really asking the question, why are we in this position to begin with. And you look back and you think about just the sheer number of branded products that have come off patent over the last four, five years. We've got nearly $100 billion of branded drugs that have lost patent protection. Obviously, that's created somewhat of a headwind for the pharmaceutical industry.","You've got new products that have entered the market that to some degree I describe as me-too products that are entering the market at inflated price points with no incremental effectiveness over the existing therapies. So why should sponsors of care pay for a higher price of those drugs, especially when many of those drugs are the ones that we're seeing advertised on TV, okay, countless times; and there's a cost to that. So I think when you start connecting the dots in terms of why the rhetoric now, what has changed in the marketplace that is driving this, it starts to bring some of that dialogue to the discussion.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Larry, just last thing. I know Nancy wants to kick me off the call, but if it were to change, we go from gross to net, some model changes. Do you think that this has a substantial impact on your model, or is there still value to what you bring from a PBM perspective? And I'll stop there.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Lisa, I'll start, then I think Jon will want to jump in. But I think as we've talked many times, as we underwrite the business we underwrite it to an overall level of profitability, and there are many, many things \u2013 as we talked at Analyst Day, PBM tools that are utilized that create value for clients. So the answer to that would be no. There's many, many other things that we do that create value for our clients and their members.","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","And, Lisa, the other thing I would add is, if branded products were to move from a gross to net, I think it would look more like the generic market where you would get discounts on the buy side. And we think we're in a great position to negotiate favorable economics and continue to deliver value to our clients. So that doesn't worry me at all.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you so much.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Thanks, Lisa.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim securities. Please proceed.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","So, Larry, on the topic of partnering more broadly, how broad might you be thinking? And then, maybe talk about the dialogues you're having today in massaging the tension, right, between being partners and competitors at the same time. And does that limit where you think you can take this?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah, John. Let me start, then Helena will jump in. But, John, listen, when you look at the industry broadly, I do think that for many stakeholders across the supply chain the lines are blurry in terms of being competitors and at the same time being partners. And I think that everybody is kind of learning their way around that.","There are many examples of that out in the marketplace. We shared some of those, beyond the example that you're alluding to, in terms of our CVS Pharmacy business. But you look at our Med D business where we have SilverScript and at the same time we're managing the Med D benefit for about 40 of our health plan clients. And we can show that while we're competing and at the same time partnering, the health plan growth for our clients has been faster than the market.","So I think it's a great example of how we can create a win-win situation. And so, the answer to your question in terms of how broadly, quite frankly, it's with all the PBMs that we do business with.","And I'll flip it over to Helena to talk in a little more detail about those conversations.","Helena B. Foulkes - CVS Health Corp.","Right. So we started talking about this with you at Analyst Day, and I think that we're making nice progress. And really the change in strategy is we used to go to PBMs and health plans simply as a retailer essentially talking about rate. And now what we're really doing is broadening the conversation and bringing to those conversations the idea of marrying the other assets within the CVS Health suite, so we could bring to them capabilities, for example, like MinuteClinic, like Omnicare.","And so, it's starting to really change the dialogue from being a rate-only conversation to one where we can bring even more value. And we're having those conversations, as Larry said, both with all the PBMs that we do business with. And as we said to you at Analyst Day, 65% of the prescriptions that we fill are with other PBMs, so those are very important partners to us, along with health plan partners where we see great upside and potential. So it's very early in the game, but I'm encouraged by the kind of conversations we're having.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","And then lastly, so you talked about a little bit of softness in \u2013 I think more particularly in the retail script business, and it may be a little bit beyond the network exits. If that's true, sort of a way to parse out where that might be coming from. And I guess that that would be in addition to \u2013 I assume you're getting some flu benefit \u2013 it would be apart from that, correct?","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah. John, it's Dave. I think flu is probably on the early stages here from a trend perspective, so I haven't really seen much of that compared to where we were last year. I would say that if you look at the network changes, they're tracking very consistent with what our expectations were. I think we are seeing some soft script volume as we entered this year. I do believe that there was probably some utilization that probably flowed a bit into December at the expense of January, just as patients thought about where they were in their days of supply. But there's no one specific issue that's driving it at this point.","Helena B. Foulkes - CVS Health Corp.","And I would just jump in on flu, essentially it hasn't been a really strong flu season. And in particular what we're mostly seeing is over-the-counter increases in the cold category, for example, but not so much flowing through to the script side.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore. Please proceed.","Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC","Good morning, guys.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Good morning, Ross.","Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC","What more do you think can be done on the consumer side to start to educate the average individual with respect to the value-add and with respect to sort of a better visibility to what actually they're paying for on the drug price perspective? Because, obviously, one of the key issues is at the counter you're obviously not seeing the full rebate. And we saw that in the EpiPen situation as well, where that causes quite a bit of furor. I mean, what do you think you can do maybe to help on the consumer side educate a bit more about the value-add and about what the true cost is, given your toolkit?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah, Ross. Listen, it's a great question, and I think some of it goes back to the earlier point that I made that what can we do, how can we work with our clients on the PBM side in terms of best practices around plan design. Obviously, there's a completely different story for that consumer at the pharmacy counter if the rebate value is flowing through at the point-of-sale versus back to the client and the client reflecting that rebate value in some way, but it kind of gets diluted across the overall plan design benefit. And I think we obviously see that as a best practice amongst some other things that we can talk about there.","And listen, I think some of the \u2013 you brought up epinephrine, and I think what we were able to do with Impax is a great example of what can happen when we can introduce more competition within a therapeutic class even though it may not be an A\/B rated generic. And yes, it does require an intervention with their physician oftentimes. But I do believe that the medical community is becoming more sensitized to price being a variable around the quality and continuity of care. And by the way, we play that role at retail. And by the way, the PBM plays that role as well in the development of formularies.","So, Ross, I think it's a complicated answer or question. It's an important question, and I think it'll continue to evolve. We're already doing things and we're working hard to do more in that regard.","Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC","And maybe just on a longer term strategy perspective, many years ago now Caremarket and CVS got together and that was kind of a transformational transaction, really quite favorable obviously to the equity. And you gained a ton of share. I mean, as you think about \u2013 obviously you talk about some of your strength in PBM relationships, but just more broadly across the healthcare system, the number of different places you can touch and different relationships you can have. How would you say the dialogue is with other healthcare leaders, or the types of things, maybe not specifically, but in general the organization is thinking about in terms of how you can utilization this massive breadth you have and the delivery system and have a greater impact not only on the consumer, but on obviously your equity?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Well, Ross, listen, it's another great question. And I think I'll probably take us back a minute to Analyst Day where we showed all of the different I'll say assets that we operate. And the common denominator across those assets lies in the fact that we're delivering that last mile of care to the patient. And by the way, it doesn't matter where you're at in the health care supply chain. That becomes kind of the important conduit at the end of the day.","So I think there is a growing awareness and a growing understanding of the role that that can play, especially as there are more demands on changing consumer behavior, okay? Quite frankly, it kind of goes back to your first question.","So I think it's that. And it comes back to the other question that was asked that we've got to figure this out recognizing that the folks that we're having these discussions with oftentimes are competitors as well. So I think it starts with a recognition and an acknowledgment that in cracking the code around this, we can find the sweet spot and still be competitors, but at the same time be partners. And I think we have some success stories. We're looking forward to growing that list of success stories with those objectives in mind.","Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC","Great. Thanks, Larry.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Thanks, Ross.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny with UBS. Please proceed.","Michael Cherny - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning, guys, and thank you for all the details as well. I want to get back to Lisa's question a bit in terms of thinking about the PBM selling season. Over the last few years you've seen evolution of the competition across the market, you've seen various mergers, you've seen some moving pieces in terms of alignment from a business model perspective.","As you go into the selling season, as you pitch your capabilities to the health plan community, to the employer community, what's changed in terms of what resonates from a historical perspective when you are out and selling against some solutions that essentially have not been proven yet to fully work in the market, to fully deliver the same types of savings that you guys have done historically?","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","Michael, this is Jon. The PBM industry has been very dynamic. There's been a lot of consolidation really across the last 10 years and it's just continued to evolve.","I think is I'm out speaking to either health plan or employers, I talk about the fact that they have three very different models to choose from, and we talk about the different models and then spend a lot of time talking about our capabilities, which is it's all about getting the best unit cost, which is one thing that is important to them, but then all the things we can do to lower overall healthcare costs because of our ability to touch and influence the consumer.","And our ability to have more points of access through things like Specialty Connect, MinuteClinic, Maintenance Choice 3.0, where we're going to be able to deliver both prescriptions and front store products to someone's home. And I think the ability to do that has won the day. If you look over the last three years, we've brought on $31 billion in new business. And so, I think the story we've been telling is becoming more important is people or clients are very interested in managing their overall healthcare costs. So I think we're going to continue with our model to continue to have success in the marketplace, and the market is voting with their selections.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","And, Michael, it's Larry. I think the only point that I would add, and again it brings us back to the Analyst Day, but you may recall Alan Lotvin showed some examples of how using the pharmacy data, okay, we can provide a similar level of integration as one may be thinking about integrating medical and pharmacy benefits. And there's a lot of information and diagnostic information that can be ascertained simply doing a deeper dive in terms of the pharmacy information that we have. So we're looking to expand those capabilities, again, for the reasons that Jon acknowledged.","Michael Cherny - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks, guys. I know you have a lot, so I'll keep it at one.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","All right. Thanks, Michael.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So it seemed pretty positive that you grew the Medicare Part D captive membership by over 10% for 2017. And I guess my question is, without really going into any specific numbers, I think some investors are just wondering whether the margin profile of the SilverScript Part D business for 2017 will be about the same as what we saw in 2016? Or maybe just in general, I mean, what are the general margin trends for your Part D business over a two, three, four-year period? And people just want to get a better flavor for that. Thanks.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah. Steve, this is Dave. I think as we look at our Medicare Part D product, one, it's a very \u2013 a successful product in the marketplace and we've done quite well there. I think from a margin perspective and our expectation, I would say that it's a probably a similar profile as we cycle into 2017 versus what we saw in 2016. This is a competitive market. You rebid this process and re-create a product every single year. So that's part of the dynamics of this market. And that's why, one, we bid successfully because we have a very nice competitive product, but also the fact that we're working really hard to reduce cost in this area. And our product is very efficient at doing that.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. I'll keep it at one question as well. Thanks.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Great. See you soon. Take care.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks for the questions. Just to go back to the updated guidance, it does look like you guys are tweaking down some of the segment level assumptions. And I know you touched on this in piecemeal throughout the prepared remarks, but could you maybe just go back and share with us what specifically changed from Analyst Day through today that would have you dialing back some of the assumptions around revenue for the retail and then revenue and profit growth for the PBM?","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah. Just be real clear, Bob, it's Dave, is that keep in mind we did not adjust operating profit guidance at all. The dollars remain the same. We just trued it up from a growth perspective based on our results in Q4. So profit remains unchanged and our expectation for profit remains unchanged.","I think what you're seeing from a revenue perspective, the vast majority of our revenue adjustments, as we cycle into next year or into 2017, is all about inflation. While we're seeing the same number of inflationary events, the magnitude of that inflation event, each one of them, has been slightly softer than what we planned.","And I think this has been a topic where there's been a lot of dialogue in the marketplace about inflation, the worry of inflation. If inflation goes away, our profits would be hampered. And what you're seeing here is inflation is exactly dampening and our profits are remaining unchanged. So I think it's the proof point a bit about maybe taking that worry off the table a bit.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah. And, Bob, it's Larry. Listen, I guess, I just want to emphasize Dave's comments, okay? Because I think what we have seen over the last several weeks is more pharmaceutical companies coming out with, I'll call it, their version of the social contract, if you will. And, as Dave mentioned, typically you see pricing activity occur in January; and we've seen similar levels of activity, but at a lower rate.","So that's where it's coming from. And as Dave pointed out, I think the fact that we're not changing our profit guidance and objectives reflects the comments that we made last year as this question was coming up that modest changes in inflation really have no impact on the profitability of the enterprise business.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","No. That's all actually a really fair point. And I guess just to sneak one more in, because, Larry, you went to a lot of detail on the DIR fees and I think that was very helpful given how topical it is for investors right now. But I guess the question that I'd have is, why do you think there has been such a recent misperception and angst from the customer side as it relates to these fees? I don't think anything that you laid out in those slides obviously would be unfair or untrue, but yet there seems to be a lot of angst coming out of the customers' side of those who receive those fees.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah, Bob. Listen, I think it's a great question. And I think as we outlined in the prepared remarks that through the PBM lens we're working across the network to provide transparency across the pharmacy providers and providing education.","And by the way, when all this rhetoric began, we went back and we took a look at, if you looked at the overall reimbursement rates year-over-year, from 2016 to 2015, okay, in an environment where we've talked about pharmacy margins being under a lot of reimbursement pressures, there are many, many pharmacies to include some specialty pharmacies, in the SilverScript network that their reimbursement rates in 2016 were more favorable than what they were in 2015, largely as the result of the performance network fees and the performance that they demonstrated around that. So I'm a little puzzled as to why all the rhetoric other than the fact that some people didn't get it right.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Willoughby with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, Dave, just a quick one. You did mention some upside to the cash flow for the year. Was there any timing issues around that, i.e., any pull through from 2017? And just maybe for Larry on front end, obviously, I see the tradeoff between store traffic and basket size and profitability, but at some point doesn't that front end number have to grow or is just not something we can really count on going forward with the model?","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah. Hey, Bob. On the cash flow, certainly from a 2016 yield perspective we did quite well at delivering over $8 billion of free cash. Some of that is timing as we've built a payables position with CMS. We will settle that up in 2017. So that's why you see the year-over-year decline from 2016 into 2017 is partially due to that.","I will say that I'm very proud of the team as we continue to improve our working capital terms. Part of that is our focus on inventory and receivable and payables management, but quite honestly part of that is the power of the PBM, as the PBM grows. The PBM's a very efficient working capital enterprise, and you're seeing the effect of that play out from a free cash flow perspective both in 2016 and in 2017.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Go ahead. Bob, I'll flip your second question over to Helena.","Helena B. Foulkes - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah. I think, Bob, we feel like we've probably been on, I'd call it, the leading edge of looking at our mix of mass spend versus targeted spend and probably more aggressive than the rest of the marketplace on pulling back on unprofitable promotion and really focused on driving profitable growth.","So I do think that as we cycle through that, the good news is we continue to grow share and win in health and beauty, which is the lion's share of our focus. And where we've pulled back and seen more of an impact on comps has been in mostly the edibles and general merchandise businesses where we've been less focused and where we really don't have as much of a point of differentiation. A lot of those sales historically have been promotional.","So that's the constant balance. It's a balancing act we're always looking for, but wholeheartedly agree in the long run we do see this as a growth business. We stated at Analyst Day we'll continue in 2017 to pull back more on mass promotions. We continue to see profit potential there, but at the same time we're ramping up our targeted capabilities with ExtraCare. And those things will evolve over the next couple of years.","The only thing I would point out as well, just as you cycle into the first quarter and look for our performance, I did want you to know that we're cycling two things for Q1 in 2017 that will make the comparison more difficult. In 2016, we had Leap Day, which we won't have in 2017. And we also have an Easter shift out of Q1 and into Q2. And if you add those two things together, just those things will adjust our growth in Q1 of this year by negative 185 basis points. So that's front store only in terms of just wanted to calibrate that for you as you look forward to Q1.","Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Larsen with Leerink. Please proceed.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Do you have a program similar to like Express Scripts SafeGuardRx program where you can guarantee trend in certain therapeutic classes and you work with manufacturers to perhaps share in risk? Thanks.","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah. So, David, this is Jon. So we do have price protection in 90% of our pharma contracts. So as manufacturers raise their prices over a pre-negotiated threshold, that value goes back to our clients in the form of a rebate. We will have certain guarantees in therapeutic classes. I talked about diabetes at Analyst Day. So we're very targeted where we're using that. And I think at the end of the day our clients will evaluate us based on how their overall costs are being managed. And I think our trend, once we wrap up the year, will be received very well by both our clients and stand up well with our peers.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","And, David, it's Larry. We also have some programs -- we've talked about these in the past -- on indication-based pricing which is a version of that. To some degree, that's largely in specialty. We're working with pharma in a different way, okay, based more on outcomes with the patient.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay, great. And then, just one more quick one. If DIR fees went back to the same level they were at last year, would that have any impact on your P&L or would that all pass through to CMS?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Passed through.","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","All those are passed through to CMS. They're all \u2013 it's all \u2013 think about it as part of our cost of goods sold as we price that insurance product. And so, that's how it's underwritten.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Percher with Barclays. Please proceed.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. So what I have left is with respect to the selling season, and I know it's early in the stages. But as we think about the share gains that you've had from managed care or healthcare plans over the last two years, have we reached a point where the low-hanging fruit has been plucked and it becomes harder to generate the same type of market share gains? Or do you think that opportunity remains where it has been and maybe will add to that the opportunity in Part D? Do you see that expanding at the same type of levels?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Eric, It's Larry. I'll start, and then I think Jon will jump in. I think to a large degree those opportunities are more time-driven based on the current or existing contract, and it's going to end up tying back to the RFP process. And I would say that there continues to \u2013 we've talked a lot over the last year about insourcing, outsourcing and the fact that we continue to believe that we bring a lot of value to that equation, and that there is \u2013 makes a lot of sense.","I think when the health plan mergers were being bantered about, there was some growing concern around that. And it looks like those are now in the rearview mirror. So we still continue to believe that we can bring value for smaller regional players. And, listen, we have a great relationship with Aetna, and we look forward to continuing to be a key partner with them and helping them to grow.","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","Hey, Eric. The only other thing I would add is, I don't view the health plan market as the low-hanging fruit is gone and it's going to be more challenging to win health plans moving forward. Quite frankly, the biggest barrier to health plans moving historically has been the level of effort and the disruption in those moves. And what we've been able to do with automation and processes around moving health plans has really demonstrated we can do it in a near seamless way.","As an example, I was with two CEOs of health plans that we won this year within 10 days of welcome season of 1\/1, when they had just transitioned to us. And they were just thankful and appreciative of the great job that we did in welcome season. So as I look forward, our capabilities and how we can help health plans manage their overall costs with all of our integrated assets and our ability to move them in a non-disruptive way I think becomes a compelling value proposition.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you for that. And a quick one for Dave. The ASR; can you tell us what the timing is in terms of impact at when it was put into place versus at close?","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","It was put into place early in January. It should settle by the third quarter.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","It'll settle in the third quarter. And is there an initial amount versus total amount at the end that we (1:12:25)?","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah. I'll encourage you to take a look at our filings later today. You can see it in our K.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Thanks, Eric. Next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I have some follow-ups here. First, on the implied scripts for the year. Can you remind us what are you assuming for the cadence of losing DoD in Prime? And once you normalize for these two contracts, what would be the implied script growth for 1Q that you're factoring into the guidance? And then, I have a couple of more follow-ups.","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah. Well, at the end of the day there's a little more than 40 million prescriptions that are cycling out of our business. So TRICARE began on really December 1 for the most part, so maybe some bleed before that, and Prime begins on January 1. So thinking about it, almost pretty equally spread throughout the year for the most part, Ricky. So it's really 40 million scripts on our base from a volume perspective.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So what would that mean on a normalized businesses? Does this mean that kind of like on a normalized basis there's around 2% to 3% script growth for the rest of the business?","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah. I haven't looked at it that way, Ricky. So I don't have that number right on the top of my head, but it's something that's easily calculated if you take that 40 million scripts, pro rate them over each of the quarters, you can kind of figure out where we'd be.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So that's where we're getting to, which is a little less than what you've done in the last couple of years, at 5%? So is that kind of like a function of just some additional losses that were not as publicized, or is it more kind of like slowdown of the market?","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","No. That's not the case, Ricky. I think what you're seeing is a couple things. One, and I think probably the biggest, over the last couple of years we've seen a pretty big expansion of state Medicaid programs. So that was kind of fueling scripts into the marketplace, and so you're probably seeing a little bit less than that as we cycle into 2017.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That is helpful. And then, one question on the impact from pricing on margin. So just to clarify, because when we hear kind of like what other companies in the channel are saying, they're saying that January price increases came in line. So are you basically making the assumption that we're not going to see that second price increase, that historically it's happened later in the year and that's where the impact is? That's first.","And second of all, SG&A savings that you are seeing that help offset some of that are sustainable going forward. Should we use this SG&A level as a new run rate?","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Well, Ricky, a couple of things just on \u2013 I would say that everybody probably had their own forecast and expectation for price increases; and what we specified today is based on our forecast for 2017. Inflation's coming in a little lighter than we expected. It's really twofold. Partly is that what we've seen, pricing increases early in the year or late last year was a little less than what we thought. And also, we do anticipate that trend to continue throughout the year as we think about price increases later in the year as well.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","And, Ricky, if you look at the 40 million prescriptions on our base at retail, it's about a 3.5% impact, if you will. 350 basis points, from a script perspective.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, great. And then, just last thing on the selling season. Last couple of years 75% of the new business that you brought on was health plan, which is in line with your strategy. When you look at the RFP pipeline for the 2017-2018 selling season, what's the mix that's coming up for renewal for the market, not for your book? Is it comparable in terms of the opportunity on health plan versus what we've seen in prior years?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Ricky, it's still pretty early around that. And keep in mind that health plans typically start a little earlier. So, quite frankly, some of the stuff that's starting to come in right now is really for January of 2019 because of their cycle. So as we've done in prior years, we'll have more to say on this on the first quarter call. We'll have a better idea of certainly the RFP activity consistent with prior years.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Thanks, Ricky.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alvin Concepcion with Citi. Please proceed.","Alvin Caezar Concepcion - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you for squeezing me in. How would you characterize the savings you experienced for Red Oak versus what you would've expected by now? It sounds like it's still very much helping your profits in light of the revenue pressure. So what inning would you say you are in, in achieving the savings targets through that venture?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah, Alvin. Listen, I think we're all very pleased with not just standing up Red Oak, but the value that it's bringing to the supply chain. And I think as we've talked previously, the incremental year-over-year benefit obviously has slowed because we've got it up and running, but I think the Red Oak team continues to look for ways in which we can make the supply chain more efficient. And we're still looking and exploring those opportunities. So I think we're all very pleased with where we are today and where we're going with it.","Alvin Caezar Concepcion - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. And a quick follow-up. How would you describe the competitive pricing environment during the quarter and so far in the year, both on the retail and PBM side? Is it still pretty rational?","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Yeah. I would say, Alvin, we haven't seen any material change and it' a competitive, but rational market as you just acknowledged.","Alvin Caezar Concepcion - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you very much","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Okay. Thanks. So, Nelson, we'll take one more question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. And I guess, Larry and Jon, this is a kind of a quick follow-up on the last one, which is, as it relates to the PBM selling season are you seeing anything that you would consider disruptive from any of the larger players, whether it's kind of a pricing or sales model, or offering? And then, my quick follow-up will be for Dave, just any guidance on interest expense in 2017?","Jonathan C. Roberts - CVS Health Corp.","George, this is Jon. As far as anything new or disruptive for the selling season, it's pretty consistent with what we saw over the last couple of years. So nothing really new to report.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","And, George, I think in our deck that we posted on the website, it should have our interest expense guidance for the year. And I'll pull it up real quickly for you here. (1:20:04). Do you see it? It's a billion...","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, yeah. I'm still flipping through, but I can pull that up. I'll let you guys get off. Thank you.","David M. Denton - CVS Health Corp.","Over $1 billion, George.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good deal. Thank you.","Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.","Okay. So with that, I know it's been a long call, but hopefully we've provided a lot of information for you today and in light of some of the, I'll call them, current events in the marketplace. And we appreciate everyone's time. And as always, Nancy and Mike are available for any follow-ups you might have.

Jon Roberts, President of CVS Caremark; and Helena Foulkes, President of CVS Pharmacy are also with us today and will participate in the question-and-answer session following our prepared remarks. During the Q&A, please limit yourself to no more than one question with a quick follow-up, so we can provide more people with a chance to ask their questions.","I have one announcement this morning. Our Annual Analyst Day has been scheduled for Thursday, December 15 in New York City. You\u2019ll have the opportunity to hear from several members of our senior management team, who\u2019ll provide a comprehensive update on our strategies for driving long-term growth. We plan to email invitations with more specific details at the end of the summer, but please save the date. Again, that\u2019s Thursday, December 15.","This morning, we posted a slide presentation on our website, just before this call. The slides summarize the information in our prepared remarks as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance. Later this afternoon, we\u2019ll be filing our Form 10-Q, and it will also be available on our website at that time.","In addition, note that during today\u2019s presentation, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws. By their nature, all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements for a number of reasons as described in our SEC filings, including the risk factors section and cautionary statement disclosures in those filings.","During this call, we\u2019ll use some non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company\u2019s performance, including free cash flow and adjusted EPS. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find the reconciliations of these non-GAAP items to comparable GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of our website. And, as always, today\u2019s call is being simulcast on our website and it will be archived there, following the call, for one year.","Now, I\u2019ll turn this over to Larry Merlo.","Larry J. Merlo","Okay. Thanks, Nancy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. And I\u2019m pleased to have the opportunity to discuss the strong second quarter results we posted today. Adjusted earnings per share increased 8.3% to $1.32. That\u2019s $0.01 above the high end of our guidance. And excluding acquisition-related costs in both years, operating profit increased 6.5% enterprise-wide, with operating profit in the Retail\/Long Term Care segment in line with our expectations, and operating profit in the PBM exceeding expectations. We generated more than $1.1 billion of free cash during the quarter, more than $2.9 billion year-to-date and, as Dave will describe, we are raising our free cash flow target by $1 billion for the year.","Now, given our outperformance this quarter and solid results year-to-date, we are raising and narrowing our adjusted EPS guidance range. Excluding the costs associated with the debt tender and acquisition-related costs, we currently expect to achieve adjusted EPS for 2016 of $5.81 to $5.89, reflecting year-over-year growth of 12.5% to 14.25% and that compares to our previous range of $5.73 to $5.88. And Dave will discuss this guidance in more detail during his financial review.","Now, let me turn to the business update, and I\u2019ll start with the PBM. The marketplace has been active. And I\u2019m pleased to report that with our differentiated value proposition, we see 2017 shaping up to be another successful selling season. We currently have gross wins of approximately $7.4 billion and net new business of approximately $4.6 billion. These new business numbers do not include any impact from our individual Med D PDP. I\u2019ll touch on that shortly. And I\u2019d also note that only about 7% of the gross wins relate to the previously-discussed transition of the Coventry commercial business, which was acquired by Aetna back in 2013.","To-date, we\u2019ve completed about 75% of our client renewals for 2017. That\u2019s a bit ahead of where we were at the same time last year, and our retention rate is currently at 97.5%. Importantly, we have continued to win in the marketplace while maintaining our pricing discipline.","Now, a lot has been said and written about the competitive dynamics of this selling season. And facts and realities can easily be lost or overlooked amidst the attention being paid to a few client shifts. So let me remind you of the things that have not changed in the competitive landscape, along with our ongoing strategic advantages.","As you look at our key points of differentiation, we see consumer-directed healthcare gaining traction and points of access are critical. And our more than 9,600 pharmacies give patients immediate access to advice as they take on more responsibility for their healthcare decisions.","And the data has shown the undeniable benefit of the face-to-face interactions for better adherence, reducing healthcare costs and improving health outcomes. And we have multiple patient touch points through our unique suite of assets, not just our retail pharmacies, but also mail, specialty, infusion, MinuteClinic and now, long-term care. At the same time, we\u2019re the only company with the ability to impact not only patients, but also payors and providers with our innovative channel-agnostic solutions. Maintenance Choice continues to be a truly integrated program delivering financial, convenience and clinical benefits to clients and members. It\u2019s not just about price. It\u2019s about enabling clinical programs that require deep integration of data. And our Health Engagement Engine serves as that enabler, so that products like Maintenance Choice cannot easily be replicated through a partnership or an alliance.","Additionally, we have the broadest capabilities to holistically manage specialty, which continues to be a key area of focus for clients. We continue to outperform in this area, with specialty revenues increasing 22.9% in the second quarter. Clients continue to expect proactive, innovative, real-time solutions to manage their drug trend. And the Insights tool that we demoed at our last Analyst Day is unmatched and it delivers those real-time solutions for our clients. Furthermore, our scale and innovative purchasing strategies are unsurpassed, and they continue to drive meaningful value for our clients.","So in summary, those are just some of the factors that have differentiated us in the past and continue to drive our success this selling season. And we\u2019re certainly not sitting still as we continue to find new and innovative ways to drive value for patients, payors and providers.","I also want to note that we continue to offer our clients cutting-edge solutions to formulary management as we believe it is one of the most effective ways to manage rising drug costs while ensuring access to clinically-appropriate care. And our 2017 formulary management strategy continues to address emerging cost drivers with new market-leading enhancements, which we have just announced to our clients effective this coming January.","And given the growing number of supplemental indications for many drugs, we will be creating opportunities for additional client and member savings through an indication-based formulary. And on a quarterly basis, products with significant cost inflation that have readily available, clinically-appropriate and more cost-effective alternatives may be evaluated and potentially removed from the formulary.","So effective January 1, 2017, we expect to remove 35 products from our standard formulary, including 10 hyperinflationary products, as I just described. These formulary changes affect less than 1.5% of plan members, while helping to reduce costs for clients and their members. In fact, from 2012 through 2017, this rigorous approach to formulary management will help generate total savings of more than $9 billion for our clients without disrupting member care. And you can find an overview of our strategy, along with the 2017 formulary details, on the Investor Relations portion of our website.","Now, while it\u2019s too early to discuss the 2018 selling season, many of you have asked about the timing of the next FEP contract renewal. So let me clarify that the FEP Specialty business has a Request for Information in the marketplace for January 2018. However, the FEP Retail and Mail Order businesses, comprising more than 70% of our total FEP revenues of about $9 billion, have been extended until January 2019.","Now, before turning to retail, let me touch briefly on our Med D PDP SilverScript. We currently have about 4.1 million captive lives in our individual PDP, about 1.2 million captive EGWP lives and we serve another 6.4 million lives through our health plan clients. So in total, we currently serve approximately 11.8 million Med D beneficiaries.","Late last week, we received the preliminary benchmark results from CMS for 2017. And I\u2019m pleased to report that SilverScript qualified in 32 of the 34 regions. These strong benchmark results should enable us to retain the vast majority of the auto-assignees we currently serve, along with the ability to track new lives. And we\u2019re very pleased with these results.","Now, moving on to second quarter results in the Retail\/Long Term Care business, total same-store sales increased 2.1%, with Pharmacy same-store sales up 3.9%. This was negatively impacted by about 355 basis points due to recent generic introductions. Pharmacy same-store prescription volumes increased 3.5%; that\u2019s on a 30-day equivalent basis, continuing to outperform overall market growth. Our retail pharmacy market share, again, on a 30-day equivalent basis, was 23.9%. And that\u2019s up about 230 basis points versus the same quarter a year ago, driven by the inclusion of the Target pharmacies, as well as underlying share growth.","Now, I\u2019m pleased to report that the Target integration has been completed ahead of schedule. We converted all 1,667 Target pharmacies, 79 clinics, to CVS systems, programs and interior branding. And this was one of our most smoothest integrations-ever, despite the complexity of the store-within-a-store format, and we certainly appreciate the strong communication and collaboration with our Target partners.","So with CVS systems and branding now in place, we\u2019re ramping up our patient care programs, along with our marketing and member engagement campaigns that are expected to increase awareness and utilization of CVS at Target.","Our Long Term Care Pharmacy business through Omnicare continues to perform well and in line with our expectations. Our integration efforts are progressing as planned, and we remain on track to complete the vast majority of the integration activities by year-end.","Now, in addition to those integration activities, we\u2019re working with our Long Term Care clients to address the currently unmet needs of their residents, all with the goal of improving patient care and driving operational efficiencies. In Q1, we introduced the use of CVS pharmacies to speed the delivery of first fills and emergency needs to the facilities. This program continues to grow, and we now fill nearly half of all emergency scripts using a CVS pharmacy.","In Q2, we began piloting our transition of care program to enable us to better serve patients as they transition across different care settings. And we also continue to pilot our integrative service offerings to the Assisted and Independent Living communities, offering residents enhanced prescription delivery options based on their preference and acuity level. So while there\u2019s still much work to do, we remain excited about our ability to enhance patient care in these settings.","Now, turning to the front store business, comps decreased 2.5%, or 1.7% after adjusting for the negative impact of the shift of Easter from April last year to March of this year. We saw softer customer traffic, which was partially offset by a notable increase in basket size. And, at the same time, we saw notable front store margin gains in the quarter.","Now, some of the traffic decline was expected as we continued to optimize our promotional spend for our lower-value, promotionally-oriented customers. In contrast, we saw front store spend and margin increase with our most valuable customers. And through our personalization efforts, we continue to deliver a value-based offering derived from longitudinal shopping habits, while increasing engagement through app and email capabilities.","Now, keep in mind that our front store business accounts for about 11% of enterprise revenues, and these personalization efforts are allowing us to invest our promotional spend in a very differentiated way, producing a margin flow-through. And we\u2019ll talk more about these efforts at our Analyst Day.","Now, we\u2019ve also been focused on a mix shift towards our higher-margin health, beauty and store brand categories. We continue to roll out store resets to improve our Health and Beauty leadership. And following last year\u2019s health and beauty enhancements across thousands of stores, we continue to scale our healthy food selection, optimize our key categories in the Health quadrant and elevate our beauty offerings, while improving shopability.","Store brands are another area of significant opportunity. Our Store Brands represented 21.8% of front store sales in the quarter, and that\u2019s up about 85 basis points from the same quarter last year, as we continue on our trajectory to a goal of 25%.","Turning to store openings, in the second quarter, we opened 22 new stores, relocated nine others, closed 10, resulting in 12 net new stores. And we expect to open up about 100 net new stores for the full year.","As for MinuteClinic, we currently operate 1,136 clinics across 33 states, plus the District of Columbia. And, as I noted earlier, the Target conversion was completed. And our nurse-practitioner providers are adjusting well to the MinuteClinic scope of services and Epic EHR.","Now, including Target, MinuteClinic revenues increased 15.2% versus the same quarter last year, despite the mild and late allergy season. The hold my place in line on-line queuing tool that was launched nationally in March continued to gain momentum in Q2. And by the end of the quarter, the use of the tool had increased to 13% of all MinuteClinic visits. So customer feedback is extremely positive, and further enhancements are underway to improve the customer experience.","So with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Dave for the financial review.","David M. Denton","Thank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. Today, I\u2019ll provide a detailed review of our second quarter results, followed with an update on our improved guidance. And, as I typically do, I\u2019ll start first with a summary of the progress we\u2019ve made in enhancing shareholder value through our strong capital allocation program.","During the quarter, we paid $459 million in dividends. Our dividend payout ratio currently stands at 35.5%, but that is artificially high due to the loss on the debt extinguishment we incurred in the second quarter as well as the ongoing integration costs associated with our recent acquisitions.","On a more comparable basis, our payout ratio stands at 31.1%, and we remain well on track to achieve our target of 35% by 2018. In addition, we have continued to repurchase shares. During the second quarter, we repurchased 18.5 million shares for approximately $1.9 billion, or $102.32 per share. And we have now essentially completed our planned $4 billion in repurchases for 2016.","As I said at our Analyst Day, we expected share repurchases to be front half-loaded, and it very much played out that way. So between dividends and share repurchases, we returned approximately $2.4 billion to shareholders during this quarter and nearly $4.9 billion year-to-date. We continue to expect to return more than $5 billion to our shareholders in 2016 through both a combination of dividends and share repurchases.","As Larry mentioned, we generated more than $1.1 billion of free cash in the second quarter, and we have produced more than $2.9 billion year-to-date. We are increasing our full-year free cash flow guidance to a range of $6.3 billion to $6.6 billion from the prior range of $5.3 billion to $5.6 billion. This primarily reflects timing in our Medicare Part D SilverScript\u2019s business, as well as overall improvements in the core.","Basically, healthier members and lower utilization than what we assume when we submitted our bids, are leading to changes in the timing of our cash flows as we expect to continue to be in a payable position with CMS at the end of this year.","Now, turning to our debt, in order to take advantage of the current favorable interest rate environment, during the second quarter, we issued $3.5 billion in debt, refinancing approximately $3.1 billion of outstanding debt through a tender offer transaction. As a result, we booked a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $542 million during the quarter. Furthermore, last month, we retired an additional $1.1 billion by calling certain debt and, as a result of that, we recorded a $102 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt during the third quarter. Together, these actions provide an ongoing benefit in terms of lower interest expense going forward. The benefit to 2016 is expected to be in the neighborhood of $50 million.","Turning to the income statement, adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.32 per share, $0.01 above the high end of our guidance range and up 8.3% over LY. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.86 per share. The Retail\/Long Term Care segment delivered solid earnings within our expectations, while the PBM segment posted profit growth above the high end of our expectations. The outperformance in the quarter was primarily driven by better purchasing economics in the PBM.","So with that, let me quickly walk down the P&L. On a consolidated basis, revenues in the second quarter increased 17.6% to $43.7 billion. In the PBM segment, net revenues increased 20.7% to $29.5 billion. This growth is largely attributable to the increased volume of pharmacy network claims resulting from the very successful selling season we had last year. Additionally, and despite a year-over-year decline in Hep C sales, specialty pharmacy growth has been strong, driven, in part, by the Omnicare acquisition and the addition of its ACS book of business. Overall PBM adjusted claims grew 18.7% in the quarter. Partially offsetting the sales growth was a 155 basis point increase in our generic dispensing rate to 85.4%.","While achieving strong growth year-over-year, the PBM\u2019s top line did come in below our expectations. The chief drivers were lower than expected specialty revenues from the continued year-over-year decline in Hep C prescription volume due to lower new patient starts and fewer days of therapy.","In our Retail\/Long Term Care business, revenues increased 16% in the quarter to approximately $20 billion, driven by the addition of Omnicare and the pharmacies within Target, as well as solid pharmacy same-store sales. GDR increased by approximately 110 basis points to 86.1%, partially offsetting this increase.","Turning to gross margin, operating expenses, operating profit and the tax rate, where applicable, the numbers I am citing exclude non-GAAP adjustments in both current and prior periods, which we have reconciled for you on our website. Keep in mind that our guidance for the quarter also excluded those items.","Gross profit dollars for the consolidated company increased a healthy 9.7% versus the same quarter of last year. Consolidated gross margins contracted approximately 115 basis points compared to Q2 of 2015 to 16.1%. Within the PBM segment, gross margin contracted by approximately 45 basis points versus Q2 of 2015 to 4.6%, primarily attributable to the mix of business and continued pricing compression, partially offset by the GDR improvement and favorable purchasing economics.","However, gross profit dollars in the PBM increased 10.2% year-over-year, primarily due to strong claims growth, membership growth in SilverScript, improvements in GDR and favorable purchasing economics. Of course, partially offsetting these drivers was continued price compression in the market.","In the Retail\/Long Term Care segment, gross margin declined approximately 165 basis points to 29.2%. About 40% of the decline in gross margin rate was mix-driven, due to the acquisitions. Lower reimbursement rates also continued to pressure margins. Partially offsetting those pressures were increasing generic dispensing rates as well as increased front store margins as we continue to rationalize our promotional strategies and improve our mix of products sold. Gross profit dollars increased 9.8% year-over-year in the Retail\/Long Term Care segment, largely driven by the addition of Omnicare and Target businesses.","Turning to expenses, we saw strong improvement in total operating expenses as a percentage of revenue from Q2 of 2015 to 10.5%. The PBM segment\u2019s SG&A rate improved about 10 basis points to 1.1%, benefiting from the additional sales leverage from the volume increases.","SG&A as a percent of sales in the Retail\/Long Term Care segment improved significantly by approximately 85 basis points to 20.3%. This, too, was driven by leverage from revenue growth as well as the addition of the Omnicare business, which carries a lower SG&A rate relative to sales.","Within the Corporate segment, expenses were up approximately $25 million to $220 million, slightly better than our expectations. Consistent with our expectations, operating margin for the total enterprise decreased approximately 60 basis points in the quarter to 5.6%. Operating margin in the","PBM decreased approximately 35 basis points to 3.5%, while operating margin at Retail\/Long Term Care decreased approximately 80 basis points to 8.9%.","For the quarter, operating profit growth in the operating segments and at the enterprise level was in line with or better than expectations, with the PBM increasing 10.5%, Retail\/Long Term Care growing at 6.2%, and consolidated operating profit growing at 6.5%. Consolidated EBITDA was up 9.8% over LY to $3 billion.","Going below-the-line on the consolidated income statement, net interest expense in the quarter increased approximately $150 million from last year to $280 million, due primarily to the debt issued in the third quarter of 2015 to fund the acquisitions we made last year.","Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 39.3%, and our weighted-average share count was 1.1 billion shares.","So with that, now let me update you on our guidance. I\u2019ll focus on the highlights. You can find the additional details of our guidance on the slide presentation that we posted on our website earlier this morning. As Larry said, we are narrowing and raising our 2016 adjusted earnings per share range to $5.81 to $5.89 from a prior range of $5.73 to $5.88, which reflects strong year-over-year growth of 12.5% to 14.25%. We have raised the midpoint by $0.045, reflecting the positive impact of the interest benefit derived from the debt extinguishment as well as our outperformance in the second quarter.","With respect to GAAP diluted EPS, in addition to narrowing the range and layering the benefits from interest and the second quarter outperformance, we are revising our full-year guidance to also reflect a couple of additional items. One is the integration costs that we saw in the second quarter, which we explicitly excluded from our guidance on the last earnings call. These costs totaled approximately $81 million pre-tax. The other is the losses on the early extinguishment of debt that we completed in both the second quarter and now, the third quarter. Those losses totaled $644 million pre-tax. So we now expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.92 to $5 per share. Keep in mind that our GAAP guidance for future periods continues to exclude the impact of acquisition-related integration costs, and we will update for those costs that we incur as the year progresses.","Before I continue, let me remind you that the following guidance excludes all acquisition-related integration costs. In the PBM segment, we are decreasing revenue guidance to a range of 21% to 22%, reducing the midpoint by 100 basis points. This decrease takes into account lower than anticipated volume of Hep C, as well as an associated reduction in days of therapy. At the same time, we are raising the midpoint of the PBM\u2019s operating profit guidance range by about 2.5 percentage points to account for the outperformance in the second quarter, as well as continued expectations for better purchasing economics over the course of the remainder of the year. This results in a new range of 13.5% to 15.5%.","In the Retail\/Long Term Care segment, we are narrowing guidance for revenue growth by taking the top end of the range down by 50 basis points. The reduction in the high end mainly reflects our performance in the second quarter, as well as slightly weaker front store sales trends as we continue to execute on our targeted promotional strategies. We now expect Retail\/Long Term Care revenue growth of 13% to 13.75%, and total comps of 1.75% to 2.5%, while continuing to expect script comps of 3.5% to 4.5%.","Despite the revenue change, we remain confident in our prior operating profit expectations, given the immaterial impact the changes I noted are expected to have on profitability. We are narrowing the range to take into account our performance in the second quarter. So we now expect Retail\/Long Term Care operating profit growth of 6.75% to 8%.","Consolidated net revenue growth is now expected to be 17% to 17.75%. Intercompany revenue eliminations are now expected to be approximately 11.6% of segment revenues. And we expect higher intercompany profit eliminations. And, as I said before, we are increasing our free cash flow guidance for the year by $1 billion to a range of $6.3 billion to $6.6 billion.","Now, let me provide guidance for the third quarter which, again, excludes all acquisition-related integration costs. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.55 to $1.58 per share in the third quarter, reflecting growth of 21% to 23.75% versus Q3 of 2015. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.38 to $1.41 per share in the third quarter, which includes a $102 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt that we completed in July.","At the risk of sounding a little bit like a broken record, I want to take a moment to remind you of several timing factors we have been highlighting since Analyst Day that affect the cadence of profit delivery throughout the year. The introduction and timing of break-open generics, the timing of profitability in our Medicare Part D business, the timing of the benefits from our strategies to drive profitability in the front end, the timing of share repurchases and certain tax benefits were all factors expected to impact the cadence. And while we have delivered two strong quarters slightly above our own expectations, the cadence of profit growth is still expected to be very much back half-weighted. Our EPS guidance for the third quarter is very much in line with what we said at Analyst day. All things considered, we see a ramp up in growth in Q3, and we still expect a strong back half to the year.","As we\u2019ve seen in years past, the timing of Medicare Part D profits in the third quarter remains difficult to forecast, since this is the time period where the risk sharing corridor is usually least effective at providing risk sharing protection. Thus, changes in any current estimates, such as utilization, significantly impacts our timing of profits between the third and fourth quarters. This forecasting challenge is compounded by the significant growth in this business. We\u2019ve made our best estimates and included those in our guidance, but keep in mind that there could be a shift of margin between the third and fourth quarters.","Additionally, the tax benefits I\u2019ve mentioned are forecast to occur in the fourth quarter. If those come earlier, that will obviously benefit the third quarter at the expense of the fourth. We\u2019ll update everyone the final timing of these, again when we report our results.","So, within the Retail\/Long Term Care segment, we expect revenues to increase 11.5% to 13% versus the third quarter of LY, driven, in large part, by the addition of the acquired businesses; although, sequentially, you\u2019ll note a step-down, due to the mid-August anniversary of the closing of the Omnicare acquisition.","Adjusted script comps are expected to increase in the range of 3% to 4%, while we expect total same-store sales to be up 1% to up 2.25%. In the PBM, we expect third quarter revenue growth of between 21.25% to 22.5%, driven by continued strong growth in volumes, Medicare Part C and non-Hep C specialty. Consolidated revenues are expected to grow 16.5% to 17.75%. We expect a sequential increase in operating profit growth due to the impact of the timing of this year\u2019s generic introductions. Notably, Crestor, Glivec, Glumetza are all breaking open in this quarter. As a result, we expect Retail operating profit to increase 10% to 12% and PBM operating profit to increase 20.25% to 24.25% in the third quarter. Consolidated operating profit is expected to grow 14.75% to 17.5%.","So in summary, we\u2019ve posted strong growth year-to-date. Our 2016 outlook is strong across the enterprise. And we expect to generate very significant free cash this year. We remain committed to using this cash to drive returns for our shareholders through value-enhancing investments, dividends and share repurchases.","And with that, I will now turn it back over to Larry.","Larry J. Merlo","Okay. Thanks, Dave, and just let me wrap up and then we\u2019ll open it up for Q&A. But obviously, we\u2019re pleased with our second quarter results, confident in our full-year outlook, and we\u2019ve made good progress on integrating our recent acquisitions. The PBM selling season has been very successful, confirming again that our distinctive channel-agnostic solutions resonate strongly in the market. And we remain focused on continuing to provide innovative solutions that enhance access and lower healthcare costs, while, at the same time, improve health outcomes.","So let\u2019s go ahead and open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operation Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Nathan Rich","Good morning. This is Nathan Rich on for Bob this morning. Just wanted to start on your comments on the selling season, appreciate all the detail that you gave and definitely nice to see a strong new wins number. I was just wondering if you could talk about the mix of new business that you\u2019ve won; how it looks, you know, for health plan versus employer. And is there anything unique this year with regards to profitability, both from a pricing perspective but also kind of considering the uptake of the suite of programs that you have to offer?","Larry Merlo","Yeah, Nathan. It\u2019s Larry. I\u2019ll start and then ask Jon to comment as well. But of the business wins, about 75% of the business wins are in the health plan segment; again, recognizing the value that we can bring our health plan clients. I think the themes that you\u2019ve heard us talk about in the past have continued this year in terms of big focus on specialty. And I\u2019ll flip it over to Jon to talk more about our integrated programs.","Jon Roberts","Yeah. So, Nathan, I would describe the selling season as pretty typical. The number of RPs are comparable. And we\u2019ve been at a consistent level of performance in the selling seasons over the last several years.","If you look at the plan designs, which, obviously, drives profitability, clients continue to be focused on the tools to help them manage their pharmacy spend. And their top priority, as we\u2019ve talked about many times, is specialty pharmacy. And we see both health plans and employers adopt our utilization management programs. We\u2019re seeing even stronger movement into exclusive specialty and a higher utilization of our specialty formularies.","And clients across our, again, both health plans and employers, are becoming even more aggressive with all of our formulary strategies. So Larry talked about our standard formulary option that we offer clients. Good uptake to that, but we even have more aggressive formularies, advanced control and value formularies, that we continue to see increased interest in. And then our integrated programs, like Maintenance Choice, Specialty Connect and Pharmacy advisor, are becoming even more important as people not only look at the unit cost in pharmacy, but also how pharmacy can help reduce overall healthcare costs, so strong adoption of those programs as well. And so I think it\u2019s been, as I look at this new business mix in wins and profitability, I think it\u2019s pretty consistent with what we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years.","Nathan Rich","reat. Appreciate the detail. And then, if I could just move over to the Retail\/LTC segment, question on gross margins. It seems like for several quarters now, you\u2019ve seen some nice improvement in the front end margin and you kind of highlighted the changes to the promotional cadence and some mix impact. Could you help us frame the opportunity for front end margins, just around the changes that you have made to promotions? And then any comments on what impact this has had on the top line, as we think about maybe the trade-off that you\u2019re making between top line and margin performance on the front end?","Larry Merlo","Yeah, Nathan, it\u2019s Larry again. And I think as you heard us comment on in the prepared remarks and prior to today\u2019s call, the ability to utilize our ExtraCare data, okay, to really understand our customers at a micro level, is what\u2019s providing us the opportunity to do what we talked about earlier around this personalization effort and acknowledging that we can derive value in different ways. And there\u2019s an awful lot of trial and error that goes on there. And I would say that we\u2019re still learning from that. I mentioned earlier that Helena will talk more about that at Analyst Day in terms of the learnings that we\u2019ve gotten and where we go from here.","So I guess to sum it up, we\u2019re certainly not done. Okay? We still think that we have capabilities beyond where we\u2019re at today. But as I mentioned, you have to take a surgical approach, okay, so that we\u2019re preserving the value of our best customers, okay, and enhancing their experience.","Dave Denton","And just to be clear, Nathan, it\u2019s Dave here. Despite the fact of giving up, I\u2019ll say, a little bit of top line from a front store sales perspective, the flow-through to the business is accretive.","Nathan Rich","Okay, great, makes sense. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Lisa Gill","Great. Thank you and good morning. I had two questions on the PBM. So the first question would be, Larry or Jon, can you maybe talk about where you\u2019re taking business from? We\u2019ve now heard from Optum as well as Express Scripts. It sounds like everyone\u2019s having pretty good retention years, but, clearly, with $7.4 billion of gross wins, you\u2019re taking business from somewhere. Is it some of the smaller players? Are we seeing any incremental carve-out activity? How do we think about the competitive market right now and where that business is coming from?","Larry Merlo","Go ahead, Jon.","Jon Roberts","Lisa, this is Jon. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any one competitor we\u2019re taking business from. I think it\u2019s across the spectrum, both large players and the small players. So I think it\u2019s a very balanced selling season. And, obviously, we continue to be very successful and our message continues to resonate. And, by the way, even on the renewals, when you look at how we\u2019re doing from a renewal perspective, again, very consistent performance relative to the last several years. So I know there\u2019s been a lot in the press about a few contract moves, but when you step back and look at overall retention work, we\u2019re very pleased.","Lisa Gill","Okay, great. And then, I guess my follow-up would just be around cash flow, Dave. I mean, obviously, great cash flow in the quarter, great cash flow update for this year; how do we think about that on an ongoing basis? Is there some things in there that are one-time in nature? And would you think about doing an accelerated share repurchase with this incremental cash? How do we think about the deployment of it?","Dave Denton","Yeah. Lisa, a little bit of the cash flow, I\u2019d say probably 75% of the increased guidance, is probably just - think about that more as timing, as you think about us being in a payable position to the Federal government at the end of the year. That will flip on us in 2017. So think about that as just moving into 2016 from 2017. I would say the balance is just general improved performance across our business, in both PBM and Retail.","As it comes to capital allocation, as you know, we will continue to focus on what\u2019s the best use of our cash to drive value for our shareholders. And we will continue to think about that, and we\u2019ll certainly come back to everyone as we think about how to use that cash over time.","Lisa Gill","Okay, great. Thank you.","Larry Merlo","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Charles Rhyee","Great. Thanks. I want to get back to specialty a bit and when you talk about the 22% growth that you saw so far, can you talk about sort of the mix within that? What categories are you seeing this year that are going to be a bit concerning for your clients, as well as sort of the mix between utilization versus pricing?","Jon Roberts","Yeah. Charles, this is Jon. I mean, we\u2019re seeing continued growth across all categories, so autoimmune, multiple sclerosis and oncology are examples. Hepatitis C, as Larry and Dave mentioned, we\u2019re really seeing a less utilization there. And then, as you look at the specialty category and what\u2019s driving the growth, you have price increase is really driving the majority of the growth. You have pretty strong utilization, north of 3%, more than you see in traditional pharmacy. And then you have new drugs coming into the market that also drive year-over-year growth.","So, again, it\u2019s specialty growing faster than - it\u2019s the fastest growing part of the pharmacy benefit. It\u2019s our clients\u2019 highest priorities, and we have solutions for them that can actually help manage that, not only under the pharmacy benefit but also under the medical benefit.","Charles Rhyee","And just for a clarification, can you remind us what percent of the Caremark, the PBM client business, is served by the specialty pharmacy? So basically how much do you cover of the existing client base versus how much of the specialty business is outside the CVS base? Thanks.","Larry Merlo","Yes. Charles, it\u2019s right around 60%.","Charles Rhyee","Okay, great. Thank you.","Larry Merlo","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Ross Muken","Good morning. And obviously, you\u2019ve given us a ton of color so far on the success you\u2019ve had, but a lot has been made, at least in the investment community, about sort of a debate on the merits of whether your model, which has been so successful for so many years, will continue to be successful in the changing competitive landscape and, ultimately, what\u2019s happening with managed care. As you think about the outcome as it stands right now in terms of selling season wins and the feedback, Jon, you\u2019ve gotten, and as you continue to evolve the strategy, I guess, where do you think some of us were wrong in terms of the assumptions? Or what are folks not focusing on where you continue to kind of push the needle and evolve the model and push share where maybe folks aren\u2019t seeing it? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense for where you feel like the messaging has been most off from our side of things or the perception, at least, versus kind of the reality of clearly what you\u2019re seeing in the market.","Larry Merlo","Yeah. Ross, it\u2019s Larry. And first of all, let me just say United Optum, obviously, they\u2019re a highly respected company and their well-publicized wins this selling season demonstrate that they can successfully compete for business in the PBM space. At the same time, back to your question, if you ask why we\u2019ve been successful and why we expect to continue to be successful, we continue to see this retailization of healthcare. And you see more people in consumer-directed health plans. You see more care being chosen individually, when you think about some of the government-sponsored care with Medicare. And that points to the value associated with multiple consumer touch points. And I touched on those in our prepared remarks that, yeah, there\u2019s 9,600 retail consumer touch points. We\u2019ve got 80% of the U.S. population that lives within a couple miles of one of our stores, along with MinuteClinic assets and specialty and mail and infusion and now, long-term care. And we have created a true level of integration across these different assets.","And, Ross, you remember years ago, we were talking about the Consumer Engagement Engine, which we now refer to as the Health Engagement Engine. And it\u2019s a piece of technology that connects the dots with these various capabilities, so that it\u2019s not just about collecting data. It\u2019s about how we use that data to affect an outcome. So you combine that with the ability to touch the consumer in multiple different ways, and we think that that is our value proposition that will increase in importance and that has allowed us to bring products in the marketplace that can impact patients, payors and providers.","Ross Muken","That\u2019s helpful, Larry. And maybe just in general, it seems like again, another very successful season on health plan side. Obviously, you had that as well last year. Can you just remind us what that means in terms of profit ramp and how we should think about the business won last year and how that\u2019s trended profit-wise, or is expected to over the course of this year into next and that whole dynamic?","Dave Denton","Yeah. Ross, this is Dave. I\u2019ll start off here. As you know, the health plan business is a little different than the employer business, whereas in the employer business, typically a benefit manager can make a decision for their population immediately and those programs can be implemented pretty rapidly. In the health plan business, even despite a health plan, let\u2019s say, Chief Medical Officer wanting to adopt one of our programs, they need to in turn, go and sell that through their book of business or, in some cases in the Medicare book of business, the ramp-up of share is just a little slower.","So think about us starting off at pretty thin margins and that ramping up over time. And the cadence of that is probably a little slower than the employer book of business.","Dave Denton","And, Ross, I guess if we look at 2016 health plan clients that we won, we\u2019re now talking to them about programs that they can implement in 2017. And they have four lines of business that, quite frankly, you have to think about very differently. So in Medicare, they can\u2019t just simply narrow the network. They can have a preferred network. In Medicaid, we see, very aggressively, clients narrowing their network. With their fully insured book of business, they have to work through the Department of Insurance and they historically have opted for consumer choice broad networks. We do see that changing.","And for the self-insured, that\u2019s no different than our employer clients. So it\u2019s really arming them with programs and incentives to sell that into their employer book of business. So it does move slower, as Dave said, but we\u2019re confident it will move. And we\u2019re confident we can grow share.","Ross Muken","Great. And thanks.","Larry Merlo","Thanks, Ross.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alvin Concepcion with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Alvin Concepcion","Thank you and thanks for taking my question. I think you mentioned the retention rate in PBM was 97.5%. So I\u2019m wondering, would you happen to know what it was last year at this time?","Larry Merlo","Well, Alvin, the year ended up at 97.2%, okay, for last year\u2019s selling season. And, as we mentioned, we have about 75% of the renewal is done, so we\u2019re in the homestretch there. I don\u2019t know what the retention rate was at this time last year. It probably wouldn\u2019t be that far off with where we are.","Jon Roberts","Right. And I mean, it\u2019s pretty similar to the selling season, right? The large players have made their decisions and now it\u2019s down to the midmarket and the small players. So I would say it\u2019s pretty comparable to where we were last year.","Alvin Concepcion","Great. Thank you for that color. And a question on retail, with things like ScriptSync and Curbside, you talked about it a bit last quarter. And maybe it\u2019s still early, but how should we think about retail comps longer-term, in particular, the front end? I\u2019m wondering if this would pressure your front end comps further or if you see basket sort of offsetting the potential less traffic.","Larry Merlo","No, Alvin. I don\u2019t see those aspects pressuring front end comps. I think it\u2019s important to emphasize that some of what we\u2019re experiencing is planned, as we think about our front store business and the segmentation or personalization strategies as we had talked earlier.","Helena Foulkes","Yeah. I would say, too, Alvin, we\u2019ve said all along, we\u2019re focused on driving profitable growth. And so when you look at where we\u2019re very pleased in our core Health and Beauty businesses, that\u2019s where we want to win. That\u2019s where our most valuable customers expect us to be unique and that\u2019s going very well. And then, we\u2019re pulling back in general merchandise and edibles businesses, which tend to be very promotional, and reinvesting those dollars in our best customers, so I think you\u2019ll continue to see us do that.","Alvin Concepcion","Thank you very much.","Larry Merlo","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Ricky Goldwasser","Good morning and congrats on a very good quarter and thank you for all the details. Question I have here is on Maintenance Choice. Obviously, it\u2019s been proven to be very effective tool to gain market share. Under a scenario that you lose a Maintenance Choice client, how much of the share do you expect to keep?","Larry Merlo","Well, Ricky, we have had an extremely high retention rate of those Maintenance Choice clients, so there\u2019s really not a good proxy there, okay, to answer that question. In the few cases where that\u2019s happened, CVS continues to be in the provider network, and we\u2019ve retained a large percent of that business.","Ricky Goldwasser","Okay. And then, when we think about the quarterly result, obviously, you highlight in the press release and the prepared comments that there\u2019s contribution from Omnicare and Target. Can you quantify for us what percent of the operating income growth per segment was from acquisitions versus organic?","Dave Denton","Yeah. Ricky, it\u2019s Dave. We haven\u2019t broken than out. Quite honestly, the integration of those businesses are pretty complete now, so actually having them broken out is a little bit more difficult than you might imagine. But they\u2019re part of our forecast for this year and our forecast is very much in line from a quarter perspective.","Ricky Goldwasser","Okay. And just one last follow-up on the selling season, obviously, last year, you had about 80% of the business came from managed care. When you think about the mix of business, I know that in response to an earlier question, you said that it\u2019s similar to last couple of years, but it seems that every year was a bit unique. So what percent of the net new business, or maybe I should say what percent of gross wins, are from managed care versus commercial book of business?","Larry Merlo","Yeah. Ricky, it\u2019s around 75%. And if you look at the mix of business within the PBM excluding Med D, the makeup of that business is now 60% health plan, 40% employer.","Ricky Goldwasser","Okay. Thank you.","Larry Merlo","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your question.","John Heinbockel","Sure. So, Larry or Helena, what can you tell us about those most valuable customers? I don\u2019t know how you define them, but when you think about importance to the business, either percent of sales or transactions, demographics and where you see, when you think about your share of wallet with them, where are the biggest opportunities; just curious, some color on those customers?","Helena Foulkes","Sure. We look at it a lot of different ways, but I would say at the most simple level, the top 30% of our customers drive about 75% of our sales and profit. And we are meaningful to them, but we still have significant upside in terms of share of wallet opportunities for them. So what we\u2019ve really been focused on is the personalization strategy that Larry talked about. And essentially, investing in those customers, because we can see from the data where we have upside with them. And we segment them either from a value perspective sometimes or we look at them in terms of their shopping behavior.","So we might look at beauty enthusiasts who, for example, tend to be less promotionally-oriented and are very focused on new items and what\u2019s hot and relevant for them. And that might be different than food and family loyalists, who are looking for different kinds of offers and strategies. So for us, it\u2019s all about getting at the very micro level and giving them targeted offers that matter for them. And we can track those customers over time, and we\u2019re very focused and pleased with the fact that we continue to grow sales and profitability among those best customers.","Larry Merlo","And, John, it\u2019s Larry. If I could emphasize one point, I think you\u2019re hearing a theme emerge. And it\u2019s not a new theme, but whether we\u2019re talking about your point on the front store or some of the things that have come up earlier with some of the questions about the pharmacy, there is a tremendous amount of data out there, okay? And it\u2019s one thing to collect the data. It\u2019s another thing in terms of how do you use the data to create an outcome or a behavioral change. And that\u2019s where we\u2019ve made significant investments in our business, whether it\u2019s ExtraCare or whether it\u2019s the capabilities back in the pharmacy, that is allowing us to do things in a very differentiated way that we think that is giving us an advantage in the marketplace.","John Heinbockel","And that would obviously, I assume there\u2019s some customers that are truly unprofitable. I mean, how do you think about weaning yourself off of those and then balancing that with, obviously, there\u2019s the direct profit, but there\u2019s also overhead and other costs that they might cover.","Helena Foulkes","Right. Yeah.","John Heinbockel","Right? So, that\u2019s...","Helena Foulkes","Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.","John Heinbockel","So that\u2019s an interesting balance, right?","Helena Foulkes","That\u2019s the delicate balance that does not just make this a math exercise. We certainly know, if you look at our bottom two deciles of customers, where there\u2019s potential. And that\u2019s what you saw us doing the last couple of quarters, is pulling back our promotional spend, but weaning those customers off of it. We certainly want to continue to keep their business, and reinvesting that in other segments where we can see more profit upside. But that\u2019s exactly the balance we\u2019re looking at.","And we said before, the role of the front store is different in our company than other companies. It represents 11% of our total enterprise sales, but it also is the front door to how people start to use us as a pharmacy. So as we look at those customers, we\u2019re looking not just at their front door sales and profitability, but we also know which of those customers are our pharmacy customers and that\u2019s an important part of the decision-making process as well.","John Heinbockel","And then, just one last one for Jon, do you think, at this point, competing solely on the basis of price, or largely on the basis of price, is not something your account base is particularly interested in; they\u2019ve kind of moved off of that to capabilities?","Larry Merlo","John, as we\u2019ve said many times, price has been important. It will continue to be important. We\u2019ve talked about the fact that price is ticket to the game.","Q - John Heinbockel Yeah.","Larry Merlo","And listen, when you look across the PBM business, we\u2019re talking a lot about retention rates. We never want to lose a client. At the same time, we don\u2019t forecast or expect to have 100% retention. And you can look across the landscape and you can see clients who, every contract renewal they migrate to another PBM. Okay? So there are going to be clients out there that have different priorities. And we think that with our differentiated offering, we can appeal to the broadest set of those clients.","John Heinbockel","Thank you.","Jon Roberts","And just to add to that, Jon, while we have to continue to be competitive on price, it\u2019s really our differentiated model and our ability to interact with a consumer and impact their behavior and lower overall healthcare costs. That\u2019s what\u2019s resonating in the market. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re continuing to win.","John Heinbockel","Okay. Thank you.","Larry Merlo","Thanks, John.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Percher with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Eric Percher","Thank you. As we spoke with benefit managers yesterday, I think that there was some interest in the indication-based formulary and cost - or inflation efforts, but what really caught their eye was your aggressiveness relative to biosimilars, particularly as compared to the one competitor whose formulary we\u2019ve seen. Could you speak a little bit about what this represents in terms of your strategy on biosimilars? It seems like a material statement, and also, how you think about the ability to serve and drive adoption of biosimilars, both as a PBM and as a retailer?","Larry Merlo","Well, Eric, it\u2019s Larry. I\u2019ll start and then flip it over to Jon. But as you\u2019ve heard us talk in the past, okay, while biosimilars are just beginning to enter the market and their impact will be will be nominal or minimal, okay, in the near-term, we believe that they will grow in importance. And they will behave more like brands than generics, which create opportunities within the formulary management area. So that\u2019s how we\u2019ve thought about it at a very high level. I\u2019ll flip it over to Jon to talk more specifics.","Jon Roberts","Yeah. And then, Eric, maybe I\u2019ll step back and talk about the three dimensions to our formulary strategy for this year, because it\u2019s a little bit different than what we\u2019ve done in years\u2019 past. And it does include these biosimilars, or in the case [ph] of a sidebar, (65:00) it\u2019s a follow-on biologic, but I would think of it as a biosimilar.","So first, we\u2019ve got our normal therapeutic review that we started back in 2012. And that\u2019s all about making sure we have cost-effective medications for our clients and their members. And we\u2019ve been able to deliver the $9 billion in savings that Larry talked about. And over the last several years, we\u2019ve been able to negotiate price protection into those contracts. So if a manufacturer raises a price over a predetermined threshold, that comes back to our client in the form of a rebate and lowers their price.","What we introduced this year is indication-based formularies. So think about Hepatitis C that has six different genotypes. The genotypes are different. So we will have different formulary options based on the genotype or, in the case of autoimmune, you have the same drugs that treat psoriasis and RA. We may have a different preferred product for psoriasis than we do for rheumatoid arthritis.","And the third dynamic is really hyperinflation. And we looked at drugs that had a three-year cumulative WACC increase of greater than 200%. And we\u2019ve taken on 10 of those drugs this year. And our goal is either we\u2019re not going to cover them, or we\u2019re going to get the economics back to prior to these WACC increases that they took.","And for biosimilars, I think it\u2019s just part of that theme. How can we get the lowest, most cost-effective drugs for our clients to provide as a benefit to their members? And we think biosimilars will be an opportunity. Now, when you look at biosimilars, most of the pipeline is filled with biosimilars under the medical benefit, with the exception with Humira, but we\u2019ll continue to look to make decisions that are in the best interests of our clients and their members.","Eric Percher","Very good. Thank you.","Larry Merlo","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","George Hill","Good morning, guys. And thanks for taking the question. Jon, we saw the preliminary Med D bid rates come out last week, and it looks like Med D providers\u2019ll be down 2%-ish as it relates to total revenue. And I guess as we think about as the company goes to market and contracts in providing the benefit for 2017, if you think about where you get the cost savings to kind of continue to drive those price declines, do you feel like more of them are coming on the pharmacy network side or are more of them coming on, what I\u2019ll call, the manufacturer side, either through formulary actions or through rebates?","Larry Merlo","Sure. It\u2019s Larry. I\u2019ll start and then David or Jon, or both, will jump in here, but, George, I would say it\u2019s really the surround sound, okay, that is contributing to that. It\u2019s not just about the procurement side of things or the network side of things. And I do think that Med D is a great example of competition prevailing in the marketplace, okay, to drive down overall costs. And as you look today at the cost of the Med D program against what it was projected a decade ago, it\u2019s a fraction of that.","Jon Roberts","And the only thing I would add is, I think that\u2019s right. It\u2019s pretty balanced. You know, we continue to get value to have a very competitive product in the market really across all those dimensions. I think the only thing I would add is that I think our expertise and how we\u2019ve been able to help [ph] service reps and our clients is really how you design your plan, how the formulary that supports that plan, what\u2019s your network strategy, all of those need to work together to provide a synergy that gives you a competitive product in the marketplace. And that\u2019s really the expertise that we\u2019ve built over the years that allows us to continue to be successful.","George Hill","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, just maybe a quick housekeeping question, for the net new wins for the PBM for next year, does that or does that not include the bid balance of the Coventry business rolling on?","Larry Merlo","No, George, it does. I think in our prepared remarks, I mentioned that less than 7%, you know, of the gross wins are made up of the Coventry business.","George Hill","Sorry. I missed that section. Thanks for the color, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed.","Scott Mushkin","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First up is just, and I know we touched on it a little bit for the 2016 and upselling, Jon, and you did a good job of the four different buckets upselling your unique offerings into the healthcare plans, but I just wanted to get any update. I think you guys said you were about 23% penetrated processing scripts, I think it was at year-end maybe. I think I got that right. Any update on that number? And where we\u2019re going as far as like Maintenance Choice and processing the scripts from healthcare plans?","Larry Merlo","Yeah, Scott, it\u2019s Larry.","Scott Mushkin"," [ph] In your own assets, okay?","Larry Merlo","Yeah, well, I think, as Jon mentioned earlier, you know, we have seen the ramp begin in terms of the clients that came online, you know, in January 2016. At our Analyst Day, we\u2019ll provide more insight and quantify exactly where that sits as we\u2019re able to ramp up through the year.","Scott Mushkin","Would you say, Larry, you\u2019re pleased with how things are going or any thoughts? I know you talked a little bit last quarter about, you know, it\u2019s slow, but kind of methodical. Any updates on kind of how you\u2019re thinking about it?","Larry Merlo","No, Scott, I think we\u2019re pleased, you know, with where we\u2019re at and, you know, recognizing that as you\u2019ve heard us talk about, this is a marathon. It\u2019s not a sprint, okay? And we\u2019re pleased with the progress that we\u2019re making. And again, for the reasons that we mentioned earlier, okay, we think that the assets and capabilities that we bring will grow in importance, recognizing the direction that healthcare is headed.","Scott Mushkin","Perfect. And then, just a little bit for Dave, you know, the guidance, I think, Dave, you said incorporated a better second quarter and also interest savings. It does seem like the underlying business is performing better than expected just maybe so far in the first couple quarters. Do you think that can actually continue into the back half? And how should we think about that I guess, particularly on the PBM side?","Dave Denton","Well, I do think, obviously, the business has performed well, I\u2019d say kind of in both segments, both Q1 and Q2. Obviously, we are driving benefit from, I\u2019ll say, below-the-line as we think about refinancing our debt. But, again, you saw us raise operating performance expectations within the PBM segment for the balance of this year, and I continue to think that we\u2019re well-positioned as we think about delivery for Q3 and Q4.","Scott Mushkin","All right. And I just wanted to sneak one last one in for Helena. Just on your best customers, Helena, where do you think you\u2019re priced compared to mass and online, and then I\u2019ll yield. Thanks, guys, for taking my questions.","Helena Foulkes","Yeah. Sure. So we look at our price, the net price to customers, as you think about all of the promotions, ExtraCare rewards and targeted offers we give them, and we think that\u2019s sort of how the consumer views it. And we think we\u2019re within striking range, essentially, of those competitors when you look at all those offers for our best customers.","Scott Mushkin","Perfect. Thanks.","Larry Merlo","Thanks, Scott. Next question?","Operator","Is from the line of Mark Wiltamuth with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Wiltamuth","Hi. Congrats on the PBM selling season news. Pleased to see that. But also wanted to ask a little bit about what\u2019s the next step here at Target? The integration has gone well. At this point, can you tell if the stores that have CVS density around them, are those Target stores doing better? And do you plan to add more CVS stores around the existing Targets?","Larry Merlo","Well, Mark, I\u2019ll start and then flip it over to Helena. But listen, and I\u2019m sure you know this, so just as a reminder, any acquisition, especially on the retail side, you have to do the things you must do before you can do the things you like to do. So I think we\u2019re all really pleased with the work of the team to be able to convert almost 1,700 pharmacies in what amounted to a six-month period. And it was a terrific job by all. And we got tremendous support from our partners at Target. So we\u2019ve completed those activities within the last 30 days. So now, we get to move to the things that we really like to do. And I\u2019ll flip it over to Helena to talk about that.","Helena Foulkes","Right. So, as you can imagine, with all of that conversion, there is always - we\u2019ve done a lot of acquisitions. You do have a fair level of disruption. And, as Larry said, the Target folks have been great in working with us through all that. But we were very pleased. The service scores coming out of those stores are tremendous. The leadership alignment is fantastic. We\u2019re on track to achieve our targeted EBIT for those pharmacies.","And now, we\u2019re really focused on ramping up our patient care programs. As we looked at this opportunity, there were really three big areas where we saw opportunity, and those are beginning now. First is the core clinical programs that we\u2019ve always used at CVS. We call them our patient care programs, things like adherence outreach and other ways that we can drive clinical outcomes, which drives scripts. The second is around all the member engagement efforts that we\u2019ve got going on. And these are essentially targeted at our members through the PBM who now have opportunities to fill prescriptions at Target. And so, we\u2019re letting them know about that, inviting them into those Target pharmacies to experience the new offering, as well as some targeted marketing that we\u2019ve been doing in conjunction with Target. Most of that\u2019s been digital. It\u2019s also been radio. And that is really just kicking off now as well.","So all those things, together, give us a high level of confidence that with all of these unique programs, as well as our brand recognition, our clinical capabilities and these digital tools that we\u2019ve introduced, that we\u2019ll be able to increase script volumes in these locations.","Mark Wiltamuth","And my question about your existing footprint where you have CVS stores around an existing Target, are those Targets performing better than the others?","Helena Foulkes","I would say the only thing we would really say is, probably noteworthy in terms of performance is those markets where CVS had very little presence, like a Denver or a Portland, Oregon, those Target pharmacies are probably performing the best, because, as you think about it, that\u2019s where our model of allowing Maintenance Choice members to now fill at a CVS pharmacy inside a Target really is unique. They don\u2019t have a CVS nearby. So that\u2019s probably the one difference we\u2019ve seen so far in performance.","Dave Denton","Yeah, Mark, this is Dave. I think what\u2019s important, too, as you think about that combination is the overlap between the Target pharmacies and the CVS pharmacies was pretty minimal. So I think there\u2019s not a lot of those situations where we\u2019re head-to-head, number one. That\u2019s why it was a good match, from that perspective. And number two is that we share customers. Many of our customers shop the Target channel and many of the Target customers shop the CVS channel. And right now, what we\u2019ve done is given those customers options. So I think at the end of the day, it\u2019s going to be enhancing to our overall market share, not just switching from one box to another.","Larry Merlo","And, Mark, I\u2019ll just kind of wrap it up by saying it\u2019s a hard question to answer, at this point, for the reasons that Helena mentioned. We\u2019re just beginning the broad-based marketing programs. And there is a tremendous opportunity to increase the level of awareness of CVS at Target, and all that work has just begun.","Mark Wiltamuth","Okay. Thank you very much.","Larry Merlo","So before we take the next question, we just want to go back and add a little color to the question that came up earlier on the Coventry business.","Dave Denton","Yeah, so this is Dave. George Hill, you asked a question about Coventry about, again, for the 1\/1\/2017 selling season, about 7% of our gross wins is related to the migration of the Coventry business onto the Caremark platform. There is an additional piece of Coventry commercial business that does migrate on to CVS on 1\/1 of 2018.","Larry Merlo","Okay. So next question?","Operator","Is from the line of Steven Valiquette with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Steve Valiquette","Okay. Thanks. Good morning, guys, congrats on these results. I guess, just for us, really probably another question on this PBM. It does seem that 2016 is a unique year, where your PBM revenue growth is really almost double your operating profit growth. And that\u2019s partially because of the mix of wins you had for this year. I think what everybody is trying to figure out on this call, kind of big picture, without you giving any guidance is can we generally assume that PBM revenue and EBIT growth will hopefully be a little bit more in line with each other for 2017 than what we\u2019re seeing in 2016 or should we still generally assume a large spread there next year? Thanks.","Dave Denton","Steve, this is Dave. I would say if you go back and look at our long term targets, which is probably the best way to think about this, and you look at those targets, you\u2019ve seen us give expectations that the top line is going to grow faster than the bottom line as we capture share, as specialty continues to grow, as we continue to invest in our business and do bolt-on acquisitions. I would say that that long term forecast remains intact today, from as you think about the top line growing more rapidly than the bottom line. And so I would expect that to occur.","Steve Valiquette","Okay. Also, since 2016 was kind of a record year for the wins you took on this year, does that $13 billion to $15 billion of business become more profitable and higher margin in 2017 than the 2016 contribution, just generally speaking?","Dave Denton","Generally speaking, that\u2019s essentially how this business typically operates. As we\u2019ve always said, is the health plan business, they\u2019re a little slower to kind of adopt our programs and to sell those programs in. It depends upon the complexion of the health plan business. Some might be more Med D-weighted versus commercial. So the cadence of that ramp does vary, but it\u2019s typically a bit slower than the employer book of business.","Steve Valiquette","Okay. And then, finally, just real quick, the FEP mail and retail extension, the January 2019, I kind of missed your comments on that. So is that an early renewal and extension, so that there would be some different pricing on that for next year? Or is that just nothing changes on the pricing front? That was just your disclosure that that\u2019s still intact through January of 2019, just wanted to get the extra color on that. Thanks.","Jon Roberts","Yeah. So, Steve, they had an option to extend the contract and the economics were already built into that deal, and they chose to extend. So it wasn\u2019t a new financial arrangement. It was an extension of the existing deal we had offered them.","Steve Valiquette","Okay, perfect. Okay, all right, great. Thanks.","Larry Merlo","Okay. We\u2019ll take two more questions, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mohan Naidu with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.","Mohan Naidu","Thank you very much for squeezing me in. Larry, maybe given the success you\u2019re seeing with the Target pharmacies [ph] and TNX (81:58), is there any appetite to do more of such partnerships?","Larry Merlo","Yeah. It\u2019s a great question. And we\u2019re certainly open to that. I think that as you look at how pharmacy is evolving, and the importance of investments in technology to not just satisfy the regulatory priorities that are associated with pharmacy, but how pharmacy becomes an important part of the solution of driving down healthcare costs and serves as something more than just a dispenser of prescriptions, I think that as that increases in importance, I think that there may be more opportunities that present themselves. And we\u2019re certainly interested in those.","Mohan Naidu","All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of David Larsen with Leerink. Please proceed with your question.","Dave Larsen","Hey, congratulations on an excellent quarter. Can you talk about the impact of generic deflation and the performance of Red Oak? How is that progressing relative to expectations? Thanks.","Dave Denton","Dave, Dave Denton here. Obviously, we\u2019re very pleased with the progression of Red Oak. Both us and Cardinal continue to see value from that joint venture. I would say that, as we\u2019ve talked about this in the past, both inflation and deflation across our business has not really been that impactful. So I don\u2019t think that the change in those levels of pricing within generics has been a major impact on us. It certainly has not been material, both this year and in prior years. So it\u2019s progressing very much as planned this year. And we\u2019ll probably have more to update as far as generic introductions as we get to Analyst Day in December.","Dave Larsen","Okay. And then, in December, will you provide a new sort of five-year guidance range for these different metrics?","Dave Denton","We always update kind of our performance, both from a current period perspective and an ongoing perspective. So we\u2019ll certain hit on key topics and the outlook for those key topics over the course of the next several years in December.","Dave Larsen","Great. Thanks.","Larry J. Merlo","Okay, everyone. Thanks for your ongoing interest in CVS. And if there are any follow-up questions, you can contact Nancy Christal. Thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines."]}}
