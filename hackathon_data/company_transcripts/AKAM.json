My name is Derek, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Natalie Temple, Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Natalie Temple","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Akamai's Investor Conference call to discuss our first quarter 2012 financial results. Speaking today will be Paul Sagan, Akamai's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Benson, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.","Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on April 25, 2012. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances.","As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the News & Events portion of the Investor Relations section of our website.","Now let me turn the call over to Paul.","Paul L. Sagan","Thanks, Natalie, and thank you all for joining us today. Quite simply, Q1 was a great quarter where we exceeded our expectations in almost every area, and I couldn't be more pleased with the results. And that strong Q1 performance really built on our record revenue achievement in the fourth quarter. We posted total revenue of $319 million in Q1, up 16% from the same period last year. And organic growth on the top line accelerated year-over-year for the second straight quarter. We generated normalized EPS at $0.41, up 8% from Q1 of last year. We had another strong quarter of cash flow generation, with $93 million of cash from operations in the quarter.","And we are pleased to announce that our board has authorized another extension of our share repurchase program, this time for $150 million. I'll be back in a few minutes with some additional thoughts on our business, and I'll have some comments about the planned transition we announced today to eventually name a successor to me as President and CEO. But first, let me turn the call over to Jim for more about our very strong first quarter results. Jim?","James Benson","Thank you, Paul. As I walk you through our very strong Q1 financial results in detail, I'll provide you with the consolidated numbers that include roughly one month of the Cotendo acquisition, which closed in early March. And where appropriate, I'll also provide you with Akamai's results from Q1 excluding Cotendo. ","Revenue came in above our guidance range at $319 million, up 16% year-over-year, with solid growth across the business. Cotendo accounted for less than $2 million in revenue for the quarter. Excluding the impact of Cotendo, revenue was up 50% year-over-year and down just 2% sequentially. ","In Media & Entertainment, we saw strong traffic growth year-over-year, building off of the acceleration we saw in Q4 and exceeding our expectations. As a result, Media & Entertainment revenue grew by 14% over Q1 of last year and was down 2% sequentially.","Commerce was our fastest growing vertical in Q1, increasing 21% over the first quarter of last year. As expected, revenue declined 7% sequentially due to normal seasonality. ","Revenue from our enterprise vertical grew 17% year-over-year and 3% sequentially, as applications continue to shift to the cloud and we saw increased demand for optimization, performance and security solutions. We also saw revenue growth accelerate again in the high-tech vertical, which grew 15% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. This acceleration was due to the timing of several large software download releases and continued traction among Software-as-a-Service, or SaaS customers, who continue to migrate to our cloud infrastructure solutions. ","Finally, Public Sector revenue grew 9% year-over-year and 7% sequentially.","Across all of our verticals, cloud infrastructure solutions made up 57% of our total revenue. During the first quarter, international sales represented 28% of total revenue, consistent with the prior quarter. International revenue grew 10% year-over-year and was flat sequentially in Q1. Foreign exchange had a negative impact on revenue of about $1 million on both a year-over-year and a sequential basis. Excluding the impact of currency, international revenue grew 11% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. ","All geographies outside of North America, with the exception of Japan, saw a very strong growth. Revenue from North America grew 18% year-over-year and was down 2% sequentially, driven by normal seasonality. Resellers represented 21% of total revenue, up one point from the prior quarter. Our cash gross margin for the quarter was 79%, flat with the prior quarter and down one point from the same period last year. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 68% for the quarter, consistent with both Q4 and the first quarter of last year. This is a little bit better than our GAAP gross margin guidance for the quarter, primarily due to lower depreciation expense from network buildout that moved from Q1 to Q2.","GAAP operating expenses were $145 million in the first quarter. These GAAP numbers include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation and acquisition-related charges. Excluding these charges, our operating expenses for the quarter were $111 million, up $2 million from Q4, slightly above our guidance range due exclusively to expenses associated with our acquisitions of Cotendo and Blaze. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $143 million. That's up 10% from the same period last year and down 3% from Q4 levels. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 45%, down 2 points from the same period last year and 1 point from the prior quarter. ","For the first quarter, total depreciation and amortization was $46 million. These charges include $36 million of network-related depreciation, $5 million of G&A depreciation and $5 million of amortization of intangible assets. Net interest income for the quarter was about $2 million. ","Moving on to earnings. GAAP net income for the quarter was $43 million or $0.24 of earnings per diluted share. As a reminder, our GAAP net income includes several noncash or nonrecurring items, including $23 million of stock-based compensation, including amortization of capitalized equity-based compensation, $5 million from amortization of acquired intangible assets and $4 million of acquisition-related costs.","We are including GAAP taxes in our normalized earnings and the GAAP tax charge was $30 million based on an estimated full year GAAP tax rate of about 41%. This tax rate is slightly higher for the year than the 38% to 39% we estimated at the start of the year due primarily to the tax impact associated with the Cotendo and Blaze acquisitions. ","Based on this full year tax rate, our normalized net income for the first quarter was $75 million. That translates to $0.41 per diluted share on a normalized basis, up $0.03 from Q1 of last year and down $0.04 from Q4 levels. This was above our guidance range coming into the quarter, as the increased revenue growth and higher margins drove a strong bottom line result. Our weighted average diluted share count for the first quarter was 182 million shares. ","Now let me review some balance sheet items. Cash generation continued to be strong. Cash from operations for the quarter was $93 million. At the end of Q1, we had just under $1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on the balance sheet, net of recent acquisitions. Capital expenditures, excluding equity compensation, were $43 million, below our forecast at the beginning of the year due to the timing of investments that have shifted out of the first quarter. This number includes both investments in the network, as well as capitalized software development.","During the quarter, we spent about $8 million in share repurchases, buying back 223,000 shares at an average price of $35.45. As Paul mentioned, our board has authorized a $150 million extension of our share repurchase program beginning in May and extending over the following 12 months. As with our existing program, we intend to fund it out of our strong cash generation with a primary goal of offsetting dilution from ongoing equity grants. Finally, days sales outstanding for the quarter was 61 days.","Q1 was a great start to the year. We saw an acceleration of traffic volumes for the second straight quarter in Media, and as a result, we've seen solid revenue growth in our Media business. We also continued to record healthy signings for our cloud infrastructure solutions as customers have moved more of their business transactions online and adopted cloud computing models. ","Looking forward, we see significant opportunities across all of our verticals, and we are making important investments to capture these opportunities. Our recent acquisitions are great examples of how we've used the strength of our balance sheet to invest for future growth. We expect these acquisitions to be roughly neutral to our earnings over the next 4 quarters, but near term, our expenses will slightly exceed revenues from the acquired companies until we absorb and scale these acquisitions within Akamai.","We will be integrating these acquisitions into our core businesses, and going forward, we will not be reporting them separately. ","Looking forward to Q2, we expect revenue in the range of $322 million to $330 million. This guidance includes a full quarter of Cotendo revenue. As a reminder, Cotendo's revenue run rate exiting Q1 was a little under $2 million per month. The midpoint of our revenue guidance translates into 18% year-over-year revenue growth, accelerating again from Q1 levels. At current spot rates, foreign exchange should be roughly neutral on a sequential basis and a $4 million negative impact on a year-to-year basis. ","We expect gross margins to come down about 1 to 2 points sequentially, supporting the increase in traffic levels and given that some planned investments in the network moved into Q2. We expect Q2 operating expenses to increase by about $11 million from the prior quarter, as we absorb the Cotendo and Blaze acquisitions and as we continue to invest organically in go-to-market and R&D staffing.","As a result, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins to be about 41% to 42%. This is below our long-term model due to investments we're making now that we expect will drive significant growth going forward. At this level of revenue, we expect to see fully taxed normalized EPS of $0.36 to $0.38 for the quarter. At the midpoint of this range, this represents 7% year-over-year growth. This EPS guidance includes a tax charge of $22 million to $27 million based on a full year GAAP tax rate in the range of 40% to 41% and also reflects a fully diluted share count of 184 million shares.","On CapEx, we expect to spend around $65 million to $70 million in the quarter, excluding equity compensation. This reflects our desire to stay ahead of the growth that we expect on the network and the impact of some investments that moved from Q1 to Q2. ","For the full year, we expect CapEx will be at the high end of our model of 13% to 16% of revenue. Overall, we are extremely pleased with the performance of the business in Q1 and the momentum we have coming into Q2. ","Now let me turn the call back over to Paul. Paul?","Paul L. Sagan","Thanks, Jim. This is an exciting time for our business around the globe. Since the start of the year, I've literally been around the world, visiting with clients, prospects and employees in at least 10 countries and 20 cities on Akamai business. And everywhere I went, I was impressed by the energy of our teams, the opportunities in our various markets, the passion our customers have for their businesses and the trust they place on Akamai to help them achieve their goal. From San Francisco to Singapore, the promise of cloud computing, mobility and online media and the threat to web security were constant topics of conversation with customers and prospects alike. They are counting on us to provide solutions to address their business challenges in these 4 critical areas. We're meeting their needs with a commitment to innovation and rapid introduction of new services, including a plan to roll out new product and other significant enhancement in every part of our portfolio this year.","One area above all seems to open every discussion these days, the myriad of security threats to online businesses. CIOs are beginning to recognize that they need new defenses to protect their enterprises. And to address this pressing need, we introduced Kona Site Defender in February. This new service deployed across the distributive Akamai Intelligent Platform combined our technology for mitigating distributed denial of service attack with our web application firewall capability to filter out other malicious activity. We've heard time and again from our customers that their businesses need a security solution that doesn't degrade performance even as a defense against an attack before it\u2019s in full swing. Kona Site Defender was created with these customer requirements in mind. And based on early market traction, it's clear that our approach has resonated with clients. ","Already, we're providing our new security solutions to more than 200 Akamai customers, including 17 members of the Fortune 100 and 34 of the world's top Internet retailers. And we've also developed new services for customers that are deploying cloud applications. Last month, we launched our Terra Alta solutions to help our customers better optimize and accelerate business applications in new ways with greater flexibility and higher performance. ","In addition, as part of our Terra enterprise solution suite, we launched the Riverbed Steelhead Cloud Accelerator service powered by the Akamai Intelligent Platform. Together, we're providing companies with a seamless way to add accelerated public cloud services to their private cloud infrastructures, effectively creating better performing applications that they used to host themselves, but now want to access from third-party cloud providers. ","That's not always easy over the Internet and it's even more difficult in a mobile environment. This is why we're also focused on improving the performance of mobile applications for customer serving this growing market. Today, Akamai is already optimizing the delivery of more than 2 million page views from mobile sites every minute, and we're taking mobile optimization to the next level with our recently launched Aqua Mobile Accelerator. Now this solution brings together a variety of Akamai capabilities, such as smart data retransmission for oversubscribed mobile networks. And the ability to identify mobile devices and automatically redirect users to sites optimized for them. We believe Aqua Mobile Accelerator provides the fastest, most consistent, mobile user experience, and already major online retailers and international hotel chains have signed up for this service. ","These and other new products we've already announced or plan to announce throughout the year are the direct result of investments that we've made in cloud and mobile computing solutions and enhanced web security. ","We were also very pleased to see the accelerated traffic and revenue growth we experienced in Media in the first quarter. While we still believe a significant inflection point for Media traffic growth driven by more premium content shifting online is still ahead of us, the Q1 volumes were encouraging and ahead of our expectations. ","We're also noticing another trend with online video that's driving more traffic. Big sporting events in Q1 like the NFL championship game and the NCAA Men's Basketball Championships demonstrated how the growth of online media is tied to the growth of online social applications. More and more, we're seeing that while users are watching events or programs on television, they're simultaneously enhancing their viewing experience by interacting with multimedia content, friends and other fans online. And our customers depend on Akamai's ability to deliver high-quality video online and related realtime applications to capitalize on these new viewing trends.","Also as consumers demand for rich online media grows, our network partners are looking for smarter ways to manage the traffic that goes with that growing usage. And some of you know Akamai has been building and managing custom content delivery networks for many years. And we've taken what we've learned to develop a new product line we call AURA Network Solutions. Announced in Q1, these capabilities are designed to provide both fixed line and mobile network operators with better ways to monetize traffic on their networks and reduce cost. ","Of course, not all of our innovations will come from organic investments, and we've very pleased to have completed the 2 strategic acquisitions in the first quarter. With Cotendo and Blaze, Akamai gained innovative technology, talented people and clients. We've already begun incorporating their efforts into what we're developing to improve the performance of cloud-based applications, mobile computing, web security and the delivery of rich media content over the Internet. ","As I saw in my world tour in Q1, these are the main topics on the minds of our customers around the globe, which makes me confident that Akamai has never been more relevant or better positioned to grow and continue to succeed. ","Now before we take your questions, a few comments from me on our second news release this afternoon, our announcement that I intend to transition out of my current role as President and CEO by the end of next year. I want to be very clear, there is no back story to this announcement. Simply, as I approach my 15th year, helping to lead this great company, I believed it was appropriate to ask my fellow board members to begin the CEO succession process for Akamai. In 1.5 decades here and almost 8 years as CEO, I have accomplished far more professionally than I ever imagined. I've been honored to work with an incredible team to build one of the most successful tech companies of the Internet era and a firm with so much potential to the future. ","At the same time, it seems to me the best time to look for a great successor for the top job is when a company is doing well and growing rapidly as Akamai has been. Starting a search now means the board and I can take the time we need to find the right person to elevate the company to the next level and achieve the $5 billion revenue goal I set for us by the end of this decade. Today's announcement allows us to run a transparent process to find the best candidate to help guide Akamai's future. But let there be no question. I intend to vigorously lead the company until my successor has been named and a full transition is completed. And we have a great management team here, with an average tenure of over 8 years each at Akamai. This team is committed to remaining focused on executing against our strategic plan and making the CEO transition a complete success when the time comes. ","In the meantime, we know we all have a lot of work to do and we're looking forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. ","Now, Jim and I will take your questions. Operator, the first question, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from the line of Mark Mahaney from Citi.","Mark S. Mahaney - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Two quick questions. One on the Media segment, that 2 quarters in a row of acceleration, I'll just ask the hard question, which is I would almost have thought there would have been greater acceleration given the comp and given that you renegotiated or negotiated those media deals last year, so any color on that? And then in international markets where I think you've singled out Japan as weak, were there anything interesting to note in terms of the other geographies? And do you have any read into how long it might take Japan to get back to normalized growth?","Paul L. Sagan","Well, let me do them in reverse order on international since I did go around the world and stopped -- not everywhere, but quite a few places, and I would say we're seeing good trends for us, but that doesn't mean that the economies are fixed and we all know that the headlines from certainly from Europe and places like Japan. I think we benefit because IT budgets are large, and even if they don't grow as fast or even shrink, sometimes people are shifting their investments to the cloud and to the Internet. And so they come to us for help for better, faster, cheaper way to get their businesses moving online and we benefit. Certainly, saw a great opportunity across Asia when I was there and some pockets of strength in Europe as well, despite some of the strong economic winds in the other direction. As for Japan, I am not an economist, so I can't say what even -- I think your word was regular growth is going forward. I can say that on the IT side, those companies are -- many companies I met with there -- could be multinational, are serious about mining opportunities outside of Japan to look for growth because of just the characteristics of the economy there. Online media there is pretty strong and we think there's a lot of opportunity. There are still \u2013- it just hasn't turned around as well as other economies did coming out of '08, '09 and, obviously, the double whammy that hit there environmentally is the main reason behind that. As for media volumes, it's not relevant to the issues of a year ago. It's really a question of how much is going online and then we try to get our share of that, and I think what we're seeing is more content and more usage moving online and that's an extremely strong trend. And it was strong in the fall and that's continued over the winter and accelerated some more, which is great. I think that there is more coming long term, but we'll take what we're seeing now as a real positive.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of David Hilal from FBR.","David M. Hilal - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Paul, could you please -- let's talk about Riverbed and the Steelhead partnership. Can you help quantify what you think the revenue opportunity is for Akamai this year? And could you also remind us of what the go-to-market strategy is with Riverbed?","Paul L. Sagan","So the go-to-market strategy is primarily, they're selling motion which is a channel-based model because it's really an augment to someone who's using their solution behind the firewall and now want to access private from going from private to public cloud capability, so say something like Office 360 or Google Docs or something across the public Internet. So we're using that selling motion. And there's -- then the customer is adding this as a service on top of the capability. They have -- and there's a revenue share between the 2 of us. So we're really supporting their channel. And we had a very strong set of beta tests in the winter, announced general availability just in the last quarter, so it's too soon to quantify and we're certainly not going to put any public sale targets out there. But again, remember we have a recurring revenue services model so it ramps up. It's not a one quarter phenomenon, and so I would not describe it as a material opportunity this year and we never did.","David M. Hilal - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then maybe one follow-up. High-tech was strong. It sounds like there's some specific software product downloads, which begs the question with Windows 8 later this year. Is that another opportunity where maybe you have some strength in that sector?","Paul L. Sagan","Well, I think that's been a strong sector because we've seen the increase in some of the downloads, but also the overall shift to a SaaS model is driving a lot of business in that category. I don't want to speculate on a single release for one company. That would be theirs to speculate on in terms of volumes and we're happy to serve, but we're not going to get ahead of anything they would want to say.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Michael Turits from Raymond James.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Very, very strong quarter obviously on that, but one thing, anything else, Paul, you can say about why you had -- why now have you see trends in terms of the acceleration of volumes? You weren't sure about how much of the trend that was. Obviously, 2 points makes the trend. But anything more you can elaborate on in terms of how strong you see that trended and why, and then I have a question on margins?","Paul L. Sagan","Well, I'll take the first one and maybe Jim will take the second one. I think if there was just more and more content going online and continuing some over-the-top growth, some sporting growth, fair amount of live, fair amount of DoD and just more and more rich media and higher and higher bandwidth and bit rates. Also the combination of being able to deliver with the Akamai HD Network any content they'll need to buy [ph], I think people are saying I can put this out there and it can go to the big screen, it can go to the PC, it can go to the smartphone, it can go to the tablet and it's creating new forms of demand and driving the nice increases in volumes that we've now seen for half a year. Those don't seem to be onetime trends, so they're not single event. So I take that as really a positive. But whether they continue to accelerate or just to stay at the stronger clip, that's always a little hard to guesstimate, and I'll turn it over to Jim if you had a margin follow-up.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Sure. I think that you kind of [ph] said 41% to 42% EBITDA margins. You've got the gross margins down for next quarter. Can you see -- obviously, it's important to make these investments. Anything you can tell us about how those should trend over the following several quarters, the back half of the year because it would be great to see some leverage off that, and any help you can give us there, it would be great.","James Benson","Okay. Just to refresh folks on my comments. So certainly, one of the drivers of the EBITDA going down Q1 to Q2 is the impact of absorbing both the Blaze and the Cotendo acquisitions. So that's a fairly large piece of the kind of OpEx growth from Q1 to Q2. On the gross margin side, we talked about the fact that there were some investments in the network that kind of pushed from Q1 to Q2, which is -- so that's a good news story on the traffic side. So we're certainly seeing and encouraged with the traffic acceleration that we're seeing and we always want to make sure we're building out in advance of that. So I mean that kind is at least an explanation for why in the short term it goes down. Your question about when can we expect to see them kind of go -- we do expect that we can get back into the long term model range we provided of 45% to 47% EBITDA. But I would say, it's going to be probably several quarters before we get back to that range.","Paul L. Sagan","Yes, and I think we've seen this pattern as we've done acquisitions before, which is we get the synergies out of them and that's why over the course of the year they're neutral. But obviously upfront, there's more cost and then you get to the synergies you want to see. I don't want to lash them upfront and not get all the quality. It takes a little while to integrate the networks and get the savings that we've seen in the past from this kind of integration, and I expect us to see from this one as well.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question is coming from the line of Jen Swanson from Morgan Stanley.","Jennifer A. Swanson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to touch on the Cotendo acquisition a little bit. I think when we've asked about it in the past, you said wait until it closes, before you talk about where it fits into the broader portfolio at Akamai. And now it's closed, can you give us a little color there on how it fits in? And then since I'm limited to one question only, append to my second question on it. For the $2 million contribution that you saw this quarter for about a month's revenue, is it reasonable to think about that $2 million as a run rate, a monthly run rate for the business going forward? I know we're not going to break it out separately, but is there any reason not to think about $2 million as kind of -- per month as a baseline revenue run rate for the Cotendo business?","Paul L. Sagan","Yes, I'd say it was just below that number. The reason we're not going to break it out is we're migrating those customers on to our platform. They'll move to our services. We'll integrate the network and then there's no way to track it individually, and so that's really the way we've handled these acquisitions every time we've done one. We've moved that group into our site division around site performance. We've integrated the employees into their various functional areas, so network, engineering, sales, et cetera given everybody an assignment, pretty close to day one, if not on day one, every employee knew where they stood. We're integrating both their California and their Israel offices into the company. Very excited to have the new office for us in Israel. It's a geography we didn't have a presence before and it was a place we wanted one, especially for R&D and now gives us the -- I think the critical mass to have a foothold to do that. We're going to take their -- the best of some of their engineering and product features and build them into our site capabilities so that they'll be integrated into one set of services. We won\u2019t say to the customers, do you want that one or this one. It will be off of one platform that will probably take for some of the things up to one year to finish, maybe take a little bit longer to migrate all of the customers, but not to get most of the cost synergies that we need out of the network migration.","Operator","Your next question is coming from Gray Powell from Wells Fargo.","Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So if I just do some very rough math, it looks like the typical Cotendo customer is doing about $5,000 in revenue per month. And just given that the typical Akamai customer does closer to $25,000 to $30,000 per month, what kind of opportunity do you see to upsell customers on additional products and how should we think about potential to ramp the Cotendo base?","James Benson","So I think using your math as just an example, this is the experience that we've had doing acquisitions in the past of finding a company with good technology and a good set of customers but with a small portfolio. And then going into that base and upselling them to we hope our average over time. That's been our experience. That would be our goal here, whether we get them all there or not, we'll have to see. But one opportunity is simply to go to them with a much broader portfolio and say, how about this, this and this, which would make your online business operate better in a one-stop shop and that's exactly the model that we'll try to run this time in the plan that we have in place.","Operator","Your next question is coming from Colby Synesael from Cowen and Company.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Just wanted to follow up on the second quarter guidance. You mentioned OpEx, I think, would be up about $11 million. We've talked about having with the margins of 41% to 42%. And a lot of that being driven by, I guess, Cotendo and Blaze. Is there any of that sequential increase that's onetime as it relates to the integration that theoretically then by the time we get to the third quarter will be gone, and as a result of that we should be assuming a margin higher than the 41% to 42% at least in the back half of the year? I know you've talked about getting back to the long-term target of 45% to 47% over the next several quarters, but I'm curious if we're going to see it around the 41%, 42% for an extended period or we should see an immediate impact or benefit starting as early as the third quarter?","Paul L. Sagan","I think that we have this pattern even without acquisitions. A very, very high EBITDA on Q4, lower in Q1 and Q2, so you're seeing that just slightly exacerbated by the acquisitions coming at exactly the same time. We're not backing off of our long-term model. Take any line across there, we think we'll get back to them.","James Benson","Yes. And I guess, I'll comment maybe more specifically on your question around maybe the out quarters. So certainly, we're absorbing these companies for a full quarter in Q2. There isn't much in the way of onetime expenses that we're going to incur in Q2, so really, to Paul's point, what drives the scale is once you integrate these companies, once we're able to then leverage their customer platform, upsell within their customer set, you're going to see the revenue grow. And when revenue grows from that activity, you'll start to see EBITDA scale. So it's going to be several quarters before you see it kind of get back to the range that we talked about in our long-term model, but we have high confidence that we'll be able to do that.","Operator","Your next question is coming from Mike Olson from Piper Jaffray.","Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just for the security initiatives, who do you feel you're kind of competing most with? Is it in-house technology? Is it offerings from existing traditional Internet security companies or is it just the ability to kind of convince customers of the ROI of your security tools? And then the other question is just customer count at the end of Q1, if you could give that, and did you say what cloud infrastructure revenue was as a percent of overall revenue?","Paul L. Sagan","Yes. So Jim can recap the second question in a second. On the security, I think this is an expanding wallet. Most CIOs say, I\u2019m cutting my budget, except security, which is pretty much unlimited right now if you've got an answer because this has become a board room enterprise risk question. It doesn't mean that people will just buy anything, but they are really concerned, and I think for a good reason, around security. And so conversations are really about if you believe in a security in-depth model, then we thought locking down the desktop, we thought about locking down the data center and now you got to lock down the network at large. And what Akamai's ability to do cloud-based security does is lock down that broader world and really provide a new layer. So I think it's really a new opportunity, new conversation.","James Benson","Okay. And one of the things we talked about in the past is that customer count is really not the most relevant statistic that we want to be talking about going forward. So we certainly inherit some very healthy customers from Cotendo, but that's just not something we're going to disclose on a quarterly basis.","Paul L. Sagan","And the percentage on cloud versus...","James Benson","The percentage of our business for cloud infrastructure solutions for the quarter was 57%.","Paul L. Sagan","The rest was content delivery.","James Benson","That's right.","Operator","Your next question is coming from Ed Maguire from CLSA.","Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could update us on any -- your thoughts on the existing partnerships that Cotendo had, had with Juniper, Citrix and AT&T and how that might impact your plans, technology and investment going forward?","Paul L. Sagan","Well, we're excited about those, because they're all companies with whom we've had relationships. We'll try to build on them. You need to remember they were relatively small companies. So any of those partnerships, by and large, is still adding a small piece to a small business. But we're exploring those now that the deal is closed. Those were, obviously, not conversations we could have had as a 3-way conversation until very recently. It just wouldn't have been an appropriate way to go about it. Now we're being able to engage, and we're optimistic that we can find real opportunity because we can bring a great deal more capacity, engineering, product and portfolio to those companies, whether they're interested in remarketing some of the things we do or co-developing new offers. I think it will take some time to bear fruit as it does with any new partnership. And even for Cotendo, they were relatively new partnerships because this is relatively young company, but we're engaged in discussions with those and other partners and we'll sort them out appropriately.","Operator","Your next question is coming from Phil Winslow from Credit Suisse.","Daniel Morrison - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is actually Dan Morrison for Phil. Could you guys provide some color in terms of bandwidth and co-location costs and then how those have been trending and what your expectations are going forward? And then could you also comment on how dilutive the 2 acquisitions are to your key -- to EPS guidance?","James Benson","So I'll cover -- so specifically on, I think as we've talked about in the past, certainly on the bandwidth side, we continue to see bandwidth costs go down and so that has continued to be the case. Relative to bandwidth costs quarter-to-quarter, certainly, if traffic is going to grow, you're going to see bandwidth costs grow. On the co-lo front, really what we've talked about in the co-lo front is that as you build out more on your network, the co-lo costs depend upon where you actually put the co-lo -- what actual networks you're having that co-lo -- that deployment reside within and so certainly the cost depends upon -- if you're in an international network, you're probably going to have a little bit higher cost than not. But in general, we've not seen a substantive change in bandwidth or co-lo costs and I would say that...","Paul L. Sagan","I would say we see bandwidth continuing to go down. It's the same.","James Benson","Well, bandwidth is going to -- co-lo is stable and it depends upon the markets that we're in. And some markets, actually, co-location expenses go down. Other markets, co-location expenses are going up.","Paul L. Sagan","And in terms of being dilutive in the quarter, roughly $0.01, I guess.","James Benson","Roughly. But certainly, as I said, the expectation is over the next 4 quarters that these acquisitions are neutral to EPS.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wonder if you could just talk a little bit about the competition for the Media & Entertainment space. There's been lots of talk about the carriers\u2019 strategy there. Did you see them at all in the quarter? And what do you think is going to happen as the year unfolds?","Paul L. Sagan","Really saw no significant change at all. And I think the environment will stay pretty similar. We believe we're the go-to place that customers look to for this kind of delivery because we are across so many networks in all geographies, and a single network solution is not what our customers need to deliver high-quality, rich media or applications to any device, to any user anywhere. And so I know there's been a lot of speculation, but it really hasn't had a market impact. And I don't think that it's going to because I don't think it's the right answer for the way customers measure performance.","Operator","Your next question is coming from Richard Fetyko from Janney Capital.","Richard Fetyko - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Curious on your views of the volume based business. It really picked up in terms of year-over-year growth rate in the first quarter and it bounces around in a pretty wide range over the course of time. And I guess some of that depends on the timing of certain contract renewals and so I was just wondering in the long term what do you think that the net revenue growth in this business can be when you consider some pricing declines and the volume trend?","Paul L. Sagan","Just to give you my perspective, it's not really a function of contract renewal that affects pricing more than demand in volume, which continue to grow. And most of the changes in the volume growth and how fast it's been growing is really had to do with the help of the media market, how fast content owners, producers, copyright holders had moved their businesses online and made more and more content available that people want to consume on the Internet, over the top or on a range of new devices. And so frankly, it's more exogenous factors. And I think what we're seeing is somewhat healthier economy in a lot of parts of the world. Certainly, a healthier media landscape, especially for video, not so much for print as we know, but that doesn't affect us. The video piece is more essential. And just a growth of both, it's combination of video and social combining to drive higher volumes and longer use cases rather than people watching short attention span theater, they\u2019re watching longer content and staying online longer at higher quality, especially on tablets and bigger screens, and that's driving the increase in volumes that we've seen in the last half year or so, Richard.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Tim Horan from Oppenheimer.","Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","In the past, we have seen volume growth accelerate like this. How long does it usually last? I know it's tough to gauge, but you've seen a couple of these cycles. And then, do you think revenue growth for the core Media business will be impacted by pricing at all or if the volume growth kind of keeps going at what you're seeing here that we could -- should continue to see this kind of revenue growth?","Paul L. Sagan","So I think I won\u2019t to take a stab at your first question and I'll just remind you probably what your stuff always says, which is past performance is no indicator or promise for the future, meaning there are different things that have driven these cycles in the past. Health of the economy, content coming online, broadband inflections. Way too complicated, I think, to generalize that to the future and make a prediction. I think what we're seeing is better and better broadband, more people connected, these mobile devices and tablets driving new use cases that weren't there a year ago and content providers running to that as a new monetization opportunity and then coming to us for the answer to deliver. And really interested in the Akamai HD Network, our universal streaming capabilities, to say give us the high-quality file and we will then deliver it to the right device on the right network with the right bit rate and the right quality with minimal re-buffering in realtime. And that's what resonates with our customers and then they are concerned about their ability to monetize. So clearly, a healthier video ad market helps, healthier economy helps, higher subscription take-up by end users helps -- all of these things we're seeing and they drive growth. Right now, those fundamentals are all in place, so I'm optimistic they'll continue to drive this market. But I don't think you can look to years past and say, how do I use that to predict the length an inflection point.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Ben Rose from Battle Road Research.","Ben Z. Rose - Battle Road Research Ltd.","And a question for you on the volume part of the business, asked a little bit differently. From a competitive pricing standpoint, what kind of behavior are you seeing from the principal competitors there by way of discounting or any acts of desperation at this point?","Paul L. Sagan","We've seen a pretty stable environment for years. I don't think acts of desperation is how I've ever described it, so maybe that's your characterization or someone else's. No, I think that we see us always been in a competitive environment for our services. I assume we'll continue to be in one. Our goal is to continue to drive up volumes and take cost out of the business and help our customers do more online. When we do, they're very happy and they keep signing up for more. That's our goal. We continue to drive quality up, flexibility and capability, especially around the Akamai HD Network, and our ability to do universal streaming of video to any device, anywhere, anytime. If we do that, I think we win in the market and that's been our path and that's our strategy and it seems to be working for us. I think it will continue to. Others will have to compete on their own terms and we're happy to see them in the market.","Operator","Your next question is from Aaron Schwartz from Jefferies.","Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I understand the impact you talked about on the gross margins with some things shifting from Q1 to Q2 and the acquisition dilution. But if we look at a lot of the new products in the acquisitions, it seems like they're a little bit more on the cloud infrastructure side or software side. So if you get through some of these nearer-term adjustments, would you expect gross margins to stabilize or start to move higher?","Paul L. Sagan","Sure. To be very clear, we said we'll get back to our long-term model. You\u2019re seeing partly the annual cycle of margins going down off of Q4 into the first half of the year, that's normal, then they're exacerbated by doing 2 acquisitions in Q1 and those expenses. We absolutely believe we'll get back to our target margins and hit our targets for the year. You're just seeing a little bit of compression in Q2 because those things all come together at one time.","Operator","Your next question is from Jeff Van Rhee from Craig-Hallum.","Jeffrey Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions, Paul, on -- in terms of the -- you've got a pretty wide range of new product here, so help us prioritize here what do you think has the largest revenue potential or likelihood of revenue contribution over the coming year? And then second on the tax rate, we've seen a couple upward revisions, can you give us a sense of sort of some intermediate outlook on gives and takes there?","Paul L. Sagan","Sure, I'll handle the first part. I'm very excited about security, very excited about mobile acceleration, very excited about what we have coming in site performance and, frankly, very excited about Media because as the volumes continue to grow, we think we have the best solution in the Akamai HD Network to service our customers. Again remember, all of them are services, so they layer on and grow on top of each other, so they don't take off or stop in a week. They build over time and then we get the great benefit of their referring revenue model, which we love. So I'm excited about all 4 of those, and now I think you're a little bit like saying, which child do you like best. I like all 4 of those. I think they're great opportunities for us. Jim covered the tax impact, but I'll have him repeat that if you missed it.","James Benson","Right. So we guided for the quarter for Q1 38% to 39% for the tax rate. It came in a little bit under 41%. And that was exclusively driven by \u2013 certainly when we provided guidance, but we did not provide guidance including the impact of acquisitions. And as a result of the Blaze and Cotendo acquisitions, there were some tax impacts. I won't get into the tax accounting with you, but there were some tax impacts as a result of absorbing them into Akamai that have an impact on the tax rate. As far as what's the tax rate going to be doing kind of longer term, I think you can expect -- one of the things we talked about in the past is there's a lot of variables that affect the tax rate. How much business you do international is probably the biggest driver. So as we drive more and more of our business in our business mix internationally, you can expect that the tax rate will come down over time. It's a matter of the rate and pace. The good news is, for Q1 we had tremendous growth in the U.S. So I think it's very strong. Certainly, we had strong growth in international and our expectation is over time that the mix of business in international grows beyond the current levels.","Operator","Your next question is coming from Donna Jaegers from D.A. Davidson.","Donna Jaegers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","On Cotendo, can you tell us which vertical you're going to throw the revenues into?","Paul L. Sagan","Well, it's all cloud infrastructure. They had no video or media capability at all.","Donna Jaegers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","So all enterprise then?","James Benson","No. Donna, they're actually in all of the verticals.","Paul L. Sagan","I'm sorry, you meant vertical, I thought you meant which of our 2 categories, yes.","James Benson","So to Paul's point, they're all cloud infrastructure solutions, but the verticals that they sell into are pretty much all of the verticals.","Paul L. Sagan","By industry.","James Benson","By industry.","Operator","Your next question is from Rob Sanderson, ABR Investment.","Rob Sanderson","Can you walk through the trends on the traffic on the network Q4 to Q1? We know the drivers that we saw pick up in the fourth quarter. I think you talked about social media, online and gaming, additional video. Was it really strength across-the-board again in the first quarter or were there categories that sort of lead that?","Paul L. Sagan","The easy answer is yes, it was all of those again.","Operator","Chad Bartley from Pacific Crest.","Chad Bartley - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to follow up on the cloud solutions business and based on kind of the percent of revenue and the metrics you've disclosed, it seems like that grew about 14% in the quarter. That was down from about 20% in Q4. So can you talk a little bit about the trend there and then the slowdown despite the traction that you're seeing with some of the new services? And then if we look out, can you talk about when is the timeframe that we could potentially see an acceleration in that from the new services?","Paul L. Sagan","Sure. So I think the services we'll build on over the next couple of years as they get uptake based on the response we're seeing, I think what you have to remember is Q4 is an amazing compare because of all the commerce stuff that goes into that quarter and the amazing growth that we usually see in Q4, which we saw driving the really strong Q4. You're not going to see that kind of strength in commerce in Q1. It was strong, but you go from the biggest selling quarter to the biggest sales in returns month in January and then people will forget to shop for a little while. So I don't think you could do that compare, Q4 to Q1, and draw too many conclusions. We were pleased to see continued growth. We are pleased to see very strong signing in the quarter in that category and it gives us confidence that, that will continue to be a strong and profitable area for us going forward.","James Benson","And my only other add to that, I mean, you have to remember that the cloud infrastructure solutions tend to a subscription-based model, not a kind of a traffic-based model. And we've made a host of product announcements in Q1 and we expect to make more product announcements throughout the course of the year. And a lot of them, actually they're going to be across the entire portfolio, but you're going to see a lot of them in the cloud infrastructure solutions area. So we certainly expect over time that the cloud infrastructure solutions mix will grow beyond current levels.","Operator","And that's coming from Sameet Sinha from B. Riley.","Sameet Sinha - B. Riley & Co., LLC, Research Division","If you can help us think about these new products, most of them sound incremental, but when you kind of spoke about Cotendo, it seemed like you're basically putting their system into your existing platform. I mean it's -- obviously, they had a competing product, you had a product, how would you sell -- would you sell the 2 separately or do you think you're just going to take the sort of their technology and improve and expand your platform and the product remains the same [indiscernible]?","Paul L. Sagan","No, they have some unique products. I'm not going to make a product announcement on this call, but they had some unique things that we didn't sell. We'll be rolling those out as new features, but on our platform. We don't want to sell them in 2 separate product categories. They'll all be on the Akamai Intelligent Platform, but they will be new products. They'll be branded Akamai. We'll only sell under one corporate brand. So some of their customers who had services that were similar, we'll combine the best of technology from both and hopefully have a better overall product. All of our customers will get the benefit. Where they had unique products, we'll port [ph] them over and then be able to sell them into all of our customers where we weren't selling them before and will be able to take all of the products that we have that didn't match something that Cotendo had and try to move those into their customer base. So it's both a combination of improving products by combining where that makes sense and bringing new product to their customers and vice versa.","Sameet Sinha - B. Riley & Co., LLC, Research Division","Would that help you in increasing pricing of your product or do you think it's just another value-added service that you'll provide to your customers?","Paul L. Sagan","Well, we think it allows us -- we hope to take more wallet share from the IT spend that the customers have by selling them more products and, therefore, raising the average revenue we get overall from a customer by being able to sell them more things. ","Thank you for calling, Sameet. Thank you, all. I think we've gotten to the end of our questions and the end of our hour. We appreciate your interest.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.","Tom Barth - Head-Investor Relations","Thank you, Liz, and good afternoon and thank you for joining Akamai's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2015 earnings call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Benson, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on February 9, 2016. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances.","As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of our website.","And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us. Q4 was another strong quarter for Akamai on both the top and bottom line. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $579 million, up 8% year-over-year and up 11% when adjusted for foreign exchange headwinds. Our revenue overachievement compared to guidance was driven by the continued rapid growth of our security services as well as a strong holiday commerce season.","Non-GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.72 per diluted share, up 3% year-over-year and up 5% when adjusted for currency headwinds. Our better than expected earnings were fueled by higher revenues, improved efficiency and a $0.06 benefit from the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit. We also had very strong cash generation in the fourth quarter with free cash flow of $139 million.","Our fourth quarter results capped off another excellent year for Akamai. In 2015, we generated $2.2 billion in revenue, up 16% in constant currency over an outstanding 2014. As a result, Akamai is now one of only 11 U.S. public Internet software and services companies that has generated over $2 billion in annual revenue.","Our performance in Security Solutions topped $1 billion in revenue in 2015, making this our largest solution category. Contributing to that result were our Cloud Security Solutions, which grew 54% for the year and now have an annual revenue run rate of nearly $300 million. We continued to be very profitable in 2015, generating non-GAAP net income of $454 million or $2.52 per diluted share, up 6% over 2014 in constant currency.","I believe our excellent 2015 financial performance demonstrates that our business is strong, growing, and highly profitable, validating our comprehensive strategy to make the Internet fast, reliable, and secure for our customers.","In support of this strategy, we are laser focused on solving four grand challenges: delivering video over the Internet with unparalleled quality, scale and affordability; providing near instant performance for websites and apps on any device, anywhere; securing websites and data centers from cyber attacks that aim to disrupt their online operations, corrupt their data or steal sensitive information; and scaling enterprise networks to handle growing cloud workloads efficiently and securely.","Security, in particular, is a pervasive concern for customers across all verticals and geographies, and it is a tremendous growth opportunity for Akamai. In addition to world-class protection, our unique cloud-based security solutions offer substantial advantages such as quick implementation without the need for data center hardware, easy deployment across a wide range of web infrastructures and enhanced performance for web applications.","When deploying Akamai's security solutions, there is no need to upgrade or replace hardware to meet ever changing threats. Our cloud security services are designed to enable customers to rapidly deploy a known standard set of security protection across all of their websites, regardless of how or where they are hosted. And unlike traditional approaches to security, which can slow down performance, Akamai's security solutions have been shown to actually improve performance. This means that Akamai's solutions can be used in an always on proactive mode which provides substantially improved security for websites and applications.","Our Cloud Security Solutions are also differentiated by the quality of our security data. With our unique global platform, Akamai is able to gather more than 20 terabytes of security data every day. We process this data using real-time behavioral analysis and machine learning algorithms to continuously improve our level of protection. We are also using this data to provide advanced services such as Client Reputation which we launched late last year and bot manager which we plan to introduce at the upcoming RSA Conference later this month.","As we look forward, we plan to expand our suite of security solutions to also protect enterprise employees from phishing and malware attacks. Our first offering in this area is scheduled to be released later this year, and it will make use of our successful AnswerX recursive DNS platform to block access to malicious sites that propagate malware or aid in the exfiltration of confidential corporate data.","Through partnerships with many of the world's leading carriers, our AnswerX platform is already being used on a daily basis in tens of millions of homes around the world to block access to undesirable content. By leveraging the AnswerX platform to provide security for our enterprise customers, we plan to substantially expand the addressable market for our security solutions. In the long run, we believe that the market for enterprise security solutions in the cloud could exceed our current market for protecting websites and applications.","We are also very excited about the opportunity for growth in our media business. Our Media Delivery Solutions generated nearly $1 billion of revenue in 2015 and with strong profit margins. As we have discussed in the past, the growth rate of our media business and of the company as a whole is influenced by the revenue that we receive from a few very large customers. Over the last few years, our largest two customers, in particular, have comprised about 13% of Akamai's overall revenue. As we look ahead to 2016, we expect these two accounts to still be our largest media customers and that they will contribute about 6% of our overall revenue.","This seven-point change in contribution results from their increased do it yourself or DIY efforts, and it is the main reason we anticipate a lower year-over-year revenue growth rate over the next couple of quarters. It is important to know that the revenue growth from the rest of our customer base remains strong. In addition, we believe that we will exit 2016 with a much more diversified revenue base that will be less subject to future changes in our largest accounts.","More importantly, as more video moves online, I believe that there is the opportunity for substantial future growth in our media business, even in the top few accounts where DIY is currently a factor. When performance matters, even the biggest media companies turn to Akamai. That's because it is very hard to replicate our ability to deliver online media with world-class quality, scale and security at an affordable price point.","Our many advantages over alternative solutions include our unique approach of streaming content through a global network of 200,000 edge servers located close to end users, which allows us to bypass congested middle mile peering points, resulting in a more reliable viewing experience for end users.","Our superior communication and video transport protocols, which are designed to deliver the kind of higher quality picture that is expected by users and broadcasters alike, and our client-side software, which is now installed on over 100 million devices around the world and designed to greatly improve quality scale while also lowering costs.","It is hard to predict how quickly the demand for video services will increase, but as OTT grows, I believe Akamai is in an excellent position to benefit with our ability to deliver broadcast level quality at enormous scale and at an affordable price point.","Before turning the call over to Jim, I'd like to cover one last item. Today, we announced an evolution of our organizational structure designed to help us better serve our customers and further accelerate growth by more tightly aligning our teams that build products with those that work day-to-day with our world-class customers. We've made great strides diversifying our product portfolio in recent years, delivering record sales and profitability. And as we close out another excellent year, I believe that our Media and Web Performance and Security businesses are now at the scale where a transition to this type of customer and solution-centric organization makes sense. This change will become effective in Q2, does not involve layoffs, and will not be disruptive for our customers. Indeed, I am looking forward to Akamai becoming even more responsive to our customers' needs and bringing innovative solutions to market at an even faster pace.","In summary, I see a very bright and exciting future for Akamai. Our rapidly growing security business has a rich collection of new products in the pipeline. We are well positioned to benefit from the potential of very large volumes of video traffic moving online. We are well ahead of the field when it comes to improving websites and application performance, especially for mobile devices. And we are just beginning to tap into an enterprise security and networking market that could someday be larger than the current market for our web services.","This is why, in addition to the three-year $1 billion share repurchase program recently authorized by our board of directors, I plan to enter into a personal 10b5-1 plan to purchase $10 million worth of Akamai stock over the next six months.","I will now turn the call over to Jim to review our Q4 financial results and to provide the outlook for Q1. Jim?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon everyone. As Tom outlined, Akamai had a strong fourth quarter. Q4 revenue came in above the high end of our guidance range at $579 million, up 8% year-over-year or up 11% if you adjust for foreign exchange headwinds. Revenue from our Performance and Security Solutions was $286 million in the quarter, up 16% year-over-year or up 19% on a constant currency basis and was the sole driver of our revenue overachievement. Our web performance business benefited from a stronger than expected online holiday season, and we continued to see strong growth and demand for our cloud security offerings across all three geographies.","Fourth quarter revenue for our Cloud Security Solutions was $73 million, up 46% year-over-year or up 50% on a constant currency basis. Exiting 2015, our security business now has an annualized revenue run rate of nearly $300 million.","Turning now to our Media Delivery Solutions, revenue was $247 million in the quarter, down 2% year-over-year or up 1% on a constant currency basis and in line with our expectations. As I mentioned in our last earnings call, the moderation in media revenue growth rates was driven by the impact of DIY efforts in our largest two media accounts. However, the rest of our media business grew over 10% compared to a very strong Q4 of 2014.","Finally, revenue from our Services and Support Solutions was $46 million in the quarter, up 18% year-over-year or up 21% on a constant currency basis. We continue to see strong new customer attachments rates for our higher end, enterprise class professional services globally.","Turning now to our geographies, sales in our international markets represented 28% of total revenue in Q4, up one point from the prior quarter. International revenue was $163 million in the quarter, up 17% year-over-year or up 27% on a constant currency basis. The stronger dollar continued to weigh on growth rates and had a negative impact on revenue of nearly $14 million on a year-over-year basis and $1 million on a sequential basis. On a constant currency basis, we continued to see solid growth in both our Asia-Pacific and EMEA markets.","Revenue from our U.S. market was $416 million, up 5% year-over-year. Our two largest media accounts reside in the U.S. and heavily weighed on the U.S. market's results. Outside of these two accounts, revenue growth was solid across the rest of the U.S. business. And finally, revenue through channel partners represented 27% of total revenue in Q4.","Moving on to costs, cash gross margin was 77%, consistent with Q3, down 2 points from the same period last year and in line with our guidance. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 67%, consistent with the prior quarter, down 3 points from the same period last year, and about a point higher than our guidance due to the revenue overachievement.","GAAP operating expenses were $263 million in the fourth quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related charges, and other non-recurring items. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $211 million, up $7 million from Q3 levels and at the higher end of our guidance. We continue to balance investments in the business with a near-term moderation in revenue growth rates.","Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $238 million, up $16 million from Q3 levels, and up $6 million from the same period last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 41%, up 1 point from Q3 levels, down 2 points from the same period last year, and at the high end of our guidance.","GAAP depreciation and amortization expenses were $80 million in the fourth quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation associated with stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, and amortization of capitalized interest expense. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP depreciation was $70 million, up $5 million from Q3 levels, and slightly above our guidance. Non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter was $168 million, up $11 million from Q3, and down $7 million from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 29%, consistent with Q3 levels, and down 4 points from the same period last year, and a point higher than our guidance.","Moving on to the other income and expense items, interest income for the fourth quarter was about $3 million, consistent with Q3 levels. Non-cash interest expense related to our convertible debt was roughly $5 million. As a reminder, this non-cash expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results.","Moving on to earnings, GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $88 million, or $0.49 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $129 million, or $0.72 of earnings per diluted share, $0.08 above the high end of our guidance range. Our better-than-expected earnings were fueled by higher revenues, improved efficiency, and a $0.06 benefit from the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. federal R&D tax credit in December, which was not included in our guidance. Without the benefit of the R&D tax credit, we generated non-GAAP earnings of $0.66 per diluted share, $0.02 above the high end of our guidance range.","For the quarter, total taxes included in our GAAP earnings were $32 million, based on an effective tax rate of 27%. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $42 million, based on an effective tax rate of 24% and coming in about 6 points lower than our guidance range, again, due to the R&D tax credit. Finally, our weighted average diluted share count for the fourth quarter was 180 million shares, consistent with Q3 levels and in line with our guidance.","Now I'll review some balance sheet items. Days sales outstanding for the fourth quarter was 59 days, consistent with Q3 levels. Capital expenditures in Q4, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $89 million, and slightly above our guidance for the quarter. As a reminder, this CapEx number also includes capitalized software development activities. Cash flow generation continued to be strong. Free cash flow was $139 million in the fourth quarter, or 24% of revenue.","Our balance sheet also remains very strong, with roughly $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at the end of the quarter. If you factor in our convertible debt, our net cash is approximately $800 million. During the quarter, we spent $100 million on share repurchases, buying back roughly 1.7 million shares. For the year, we spent $300 million, buying back 4.5 million shares. As Tom mentioned, we are pleased to announce that our board has authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program running from now until the end of 2018. As we've discussed in the past, our overall aim is to deploy our capital to achieve favorable returns for our investors in a manner that we believe is in the best long-term interest of the company and our shareholders.","Given our strong balance sheet and cash generation, this new authorization is intended to continue our multi-year capital allocation plan to offset dilution from our equity compensation plans and to provide us with the flexibility to opportunistically return more cash to shareholders depending upon business and market conditions.","In summary, we are pleased with how the business performed in Q4 and throughout 2015, and we remain confident in the long-term prospects of growth for the company. Looking ahead to Q1, as a result of the lower volume from our top two accounts and normal Q4 to Q1 seasonality patterns, we are expecting Q1 revenue in the range of $554 million to $570 million. At the midpoint of this range, revenue growth would be 8%, adjusted for foreign exchange movements over a very strong first quarter last year.","At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact on Q1 revenue of $1 million sequentially and $5 million compared to Q1 of last year. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of 77% and GAAP gross margins of 65% to 66%. Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $201 million to $206 million.","As I mentioned earlier, we have purposefully slowed down the rate and pace of head count additions and discretionary spending to align with our near-term top line growth expectations. But, we are continuing to make prudent investments in the business that we believe are necessary to support sustained long-term growth and scale.","Factoring in all these items I just mentioned, we anticipate Q1 EBITDA margins of 40% to 41%. And as I have been messaging in prior calls, we will strive to operate the company in the 40% to 41% EBITDA range for the foreseeable future. But as a reminder, maintaining EBITDA margins at 40% to 41% will be heavily dependent on several factors including revenue, volumes, possible M&A and spending on platform capacity in anticipation of greater demand for our over-the-top video delivery services.","Moving on to depreciation, we expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be $71 million to $73 million. Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margins of 28% for Q1. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q1 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.61 to $0.64. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $46 million to $48 million, based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of 29.5%. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of 178 million shares.","On CapEx, we expect to spend approximately $85 million to $95 million in the quarter, excluding equity compensation. Of course, we will continue to balance network investment against future revenue opportunity and continued network efficiency initiatives.","In closing, we accomplished a great deal in 2015 and remain confident in our ability to execute on our plans for the long term. We look forward to having an opportunity to go into more details with you about the business and future trends in the industry at our upcoming Investor Summit in Boston on March 7.","Thank you, and Tom and I would like to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Michael Bowen with Pacific Crest. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities","Okay, thank you very much. I appreciate you taking the question. So, I guess if you guys could maybe go over a little bit with us with regard to the two customers going from 13% down to 6%. Could you maybe characterize for us how that lines up with perhaps the way you were thinking about those revenue levels maybe a quarter or two ago? And maybe another way to think about it is if that revenue is getting cut in half, where do you see that revenue being made up at this point? And can you talk about perhaps some of the relative strength between media performance and also the Cloud Security business in that regard? Thanks.","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. So just to be clear that the \u2013 the 13% reference is on average what we've received from these top two customers. So it wasn't exactly the percentage of business that we had in the fourth quarter. So this has been gliding down slowly for the company. And as we said that we expect next year it'll be roughly 6%, it could be a little bit more than that, could be a little bit less than that, depending upon how we see traffic volumes. But we're very, very pleased with the performance, in general, of our Media business, that our Media business outside these two customers grew 10% is very, very healthy. I would say that these customers have been doing DIY for a while, and they do serve a fair amount of their traffic themselves, so depending up traffic volumes for their businesses, we'll serve more or less traffic. But I'd say this is kind of, in general, aligned with our expectations. That, I think, in particular what's going to fill this up, I think you're going to go through a period where as their revenues glide down to roughly 6% of our total revenues for the company, one, we're much more diversified in our portfolio from a customer perspective because there isn't \u2013 customers three and four and below that are not even nearly close to the size of these customers, and these customers combined are only going to represent 6%.","So the revenue concentration is significantly less. There's significant opportunity for growth, as I mentioned, in the Media business, that the Media business is very healthy in aggregate. We believe that more and more content is going to move online, video content in particular, that will fuel growth. We \u2013 our Security business grew 54% in 2015 and that it was only a few years ago \u2013 four years ago that business was just a few million dollars. So to go from a few million dollars four years ago to a business now that has an annualized run rate of $300 million is a huge opportunity for growth in security. And there's an opportunity for growth in other aspects of the business as well. So I think those are the many pillars of growth that we think will fuel the company; media, security, web performance and some of the new emerging areas that Tom outlined.","Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities","And then maybe as a quick follow-up, if I may. When we had you on the road, Jim, you talked a lot about some of the contract renegotiations with some of your large customers. Typically contract renegotiations have a negative connotation to them, but to the contrary, you were speaking very positively with regard to some of those endeavors. Can you share with us a little bit how those efforts are going, to the extent you can? Thanks.","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I mean, we always go through contract renewals with customers every quarter. I think what you're referring to is, obviously, each customer is unique and the way you structure contracts with customers depends upon the circumstances for that customer. And so I'd say there's nothing unique other than making sure that the contract structure is in the best interest of Akamai and the customer. And so we make sure that we do that. Sometimes that means structuring contracts differently than the way they're currently structured, but I don't think there's anything notable to talk about for any particular customer. Every customer is unique and I think we try to come up with a solution for each customer when we work with them to make sure it's something that works for them and for Akamai.","Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities","Maybe just a very quick follow-up. In the context of new competition coming into the space, do you still feel like Akamai has sufficient leverage in these renegotiations of the contracts so that these renegotiations will be overall favorable in the pricing construct of those contracts?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Are you talking about for the customers \u2013 the top two customers, or just in general?","Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities","Well, I guess the answer would be yes. To both.","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I mean \u2013 again, I'm not going to get into any specific customer renewal situation. I would say that \u2013 yeah, I think you certainly know that we are by far the largest provider and the best provider of content delivery services kind of globally. And so in that regard, I think we have a lot of leverage with our customers. But we try to make sure that when we negotiate with our customers, we're negotiating something that works for them and works for Akamai. And so I think that's going to be the case. I think we'll continue to have good leverage and I think we try to make sure it's a win-win for both of us.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you. All right, Michael, thank you. Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks, guys. Could you give us a little bit more color on the cloud \u2013 sorry, the Performance and Security business? This is one of the strongest quarters I think you've had. Is the sales productivity improving? Is the integration with enterprise (29:43) internal basis is improving, or any other color would be helpful, guys.","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And I can start with that, maybe Tom can offer any color if he wants. But, yeah, we had a very, very good quarter in Performance and Security. Grew 19%, but it grew 19% in Q3 as well, so we've been growing the Performance and Security business in the high teens all year. So again, very solid performance. And, as I mentioned, we had very, very good performance in the fourth quarter; one, we saw an acceleration in our Cloud Security offerings \u2013 in Solutions, so those grew 54% year-over-year. We had a very strong online holiday season in the commerce space, so we had a good performance in web performance as well. So, again, I think that that category has certainly been the fastest grower for the company and it certainly, as Tom mentioned, the largest category for the company now. So I think there's a lot of room for growth in that category.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, the strong performance we saw in Q4 is all around our existing solutions, Kona Site Defender and Prolexic, our flagship offerings, and I think what's really exciting is when you look at the roadmap of new solutions coming out, and then later this year as we enter the enterprise security space that that creates the potential to really continue the very strong growth of security solutions well into the future.","Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Hey, good afternoon. Along those same lines, is the upside there in security that is coming from faster uptake of security within existing customer base or is it faster ramp of kind of selling your security offerings to non-Akamai customers?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's both. We have a large customer base that can really benefit from our security solutions, and security is also a great lead offer into certain verticals that may not have already bought our acceleration services. So both, I would say, are doing well.","Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay. And then could you describe on the media side why or why not your other media customers outside of those top two customers would be able to do similar DIY build-outs and kind of less than how Akamai fits into their future media delivery needs? In other words, why would that happen or not happen outside of these major two customers?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think there's only a very small handful of customers that can even really think about doing it. We've been competing against DIY now for 15 years and through that time, there's only a handful that have gone there. Generally, we compete successfully and in my opinion, probably doesn't even make sense for them to be doing it. And ultimately I think that they discover that as Akamai continues to improve its capabilities that we'll do a better job at a lower price point. So I don't think this is something that goes broader than the few customers who do it today, and even there, I'm optimistic about our future in those accounts.","Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Milunovich with UBS. Your line is now open.","Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you very much. Following up on that question, could you talk about the timing that you expect at this point with OTT, and is there a risk that OTT will be dominated by a handful, as you put it, of customers so you get sort of an oligopoly effect? So even if it doesn't spread much beyond the current customers doing DIY, that if there's three to five that do it, that's basically a lot of the market and hurts your media growth over time.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, the timing is really hard to predict, first, when the various offers will come out, and then how popular they will be. So that's just \u2013 it's hard to know. Our goal and job is to be out in front of it so that we're ready. And, as you know, last year we did purchase some CapEx in advance of what we thought would be a real strong influx of OTT. That didn't take place the way we thought. I think over-the-top will be dominated by a relatively small number of major entities; broadcasters, carriers, media giants. I think we have great relationships with pretty much all of those folks and we're in a very good position to benefit as OTT increases. And, of course, OTT is a situation where people are really paying for it. The quality needs to be really good and that's a situation where the big folks really tend to turn to Akamai.","Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC","Do you still believe in the 17% compound growth rate to $5 billion in 2020? Is that still a reasonable goal?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","You know, we've achieved that over the last three years. We are still working hard to get to $5 billion by 2020. Obviously, our projected growth rates for early this year are less than that. That makes it harder to reach the goal, and of course, the foreign currency situation with the strengthening dollar slows us down. But \u2013 so we're working hard to get there. Is it possible it'd be a year or two late? Of course. But we are striving to get to $5 billion, and I am confident that we can do that.","Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, thanks. Hi, guys. Wanted to start with \u2013 I'm a little confused. Last quarter, the commentary around the top customers was focused around the top three customers. And the qualitative commentary was that customer number two and customer number three were of similar size. Now you're saying it's top two, and number one and number two are a far cry from where number three is. What happened to customer number three to have the commentary change?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So I think that in Q4, what was going on was the growth was impacted in Q4 by the top three customers. Customer number three does a very, very modest amount of DIY, and so that was a different kind of dynamic that was going on with customer number three. We had gone through previously a contract renewal with them, so it was less a DIY play and certainly only a one quarter phenomenon. Not going to persist into 2016, and if we conveyed that customer two and three were of the same size, then my apologies because that's certainly not the case. Customers one and two are certainly much larger than customers two and three. Customers two and three just to give you -","Unknown Speaker","Three and four.","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","\u2013 between 2% and 3%, and below that, no customer is more than 1%. So our concentration is actually fairly limited, just to give you a little bit more color on that.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, and based on the trends that you're seeing within those top two customers, I understand you're only giving guidance for the March quarter, but I think a lot of us are trying to think about the model and the shape of the seasonality and the impacts from these trends. Would you expect the growth rate to trough second quarter or third quarter? Is there any visibility around that?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, we don't specifically guide. You're right. We're only guiding for the quarter, but we did try to provide some helpful information for you without giving you a specific guide. And specifically what Tom talked about is we expect that we're going to see growth moderation for the next couple quarters. And I'll leave it to you to understand what you think a couple quarters is.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then, last question. Under the new structure, I'm kind of curious \u2013 I think it makes sense in terms of the efficiency on the go to market, but when you think about the development and the management of the infrastructure, what's different here versus other enterprise software is you have that shared infrastructure of the Akamai network. How are you going to manage the prioritization of upgrades as well as modifications to the Akamai network that you may have a little bit of a tug of war between what the Media side wants to do versus Performance and Security?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, great question. Our platform organization, which includes development, deployment of resources and so forth, is not changing during the reorganization. We have already figured out how to handle the problem you suggest where the Media division needs to update some software for video delivery, the Security team wants to make a new product and get that out there. And it's all riding on the same platform. So we have already had, on the development side, a partition of those resources into business units with product teams. And so that won't change. We figured out how to do that management, and that will continue on the same way. The difference here, with this next step in our organizational evolution, is that we're aligning our go-to-market resources directly with the product and development resources in these areas. And the platform organization stays the same.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI","Great, thanks for taking the questions. I guess I'd like to ask a little bit about what's going on around sort of the cloud side. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that scaling enterprise networks to handle growing cloud workloads was something that was one of your big goals. And I know that you recently initiated a partnership with Microsoft. And I'm just wondering if you could take us up to speed on what's going on with that relationship and sort of what we might look for in the future around this? Thanks.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, the partnership with Microsoft has several components. I think you're referring to the part with Azure, where if you have applications running on Azure, you'll be able to check the box, and deploy Akamai whole site delivery for whatever you're doing with Azure. And I think that's a great step forward for us. Microsoft will also be reselling our services. Now when I talk about the grand challenges, the beginning, there I'm talking more about a business that we're just beginning to get into, and that is focused on the enterprise network. How an enterprise communicates with employees and branch offices. How you manage enterprise security to protect employees from phishing attacks or a malware that gets in and steals corporate e-mails and then exfiltrates that data. We're not really doing that yet today, but that's where we are headed. We had our first really toe in the water there in partnerships with Riverbed and Cisco. And we've recently announced partnerships with a couple of major European carriers, Orange and T-Systems, but there's going to be a lot of focus as we move forward on developing capabilities for the enterprise network, and that's different than what we do today for websites and applications, which tend to be more enterprise out as opposed to enterprise employees.","Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI","That makes sense. Let me ask one follow-up if I may. Just based in terms of our research, even as workloads are making a way into those cloud platforms, people are initially being willing to go there through the public Internet. Obviously that has a lot of issues, and two of them are security and performance, both of which Akamai can address. In your opinion, do you think sort of the driver for folks to come to Akamai and work with you on these cloud applications will be the security side or will it be the performance side? Thanks.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Both. As you care about performance and you care about security, you're absolutely right in what you said. And I think that drives our business forward.","Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI","Thank you for taking the questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, thanks. Yeah, hi Tom, Jim. Solid results here. Good news on the buyback. I have a question for both of you. The first question would be for Tom. Would be \u2013 the Summer Olympics, the U.S. Election, and some of these other major events on the planet, would these help to meaningfully ramp over the top video traffic volumes in your media business or would the impact be more incremental? And then also help us understand in terms of any forward visibility you're getting. Are any of your media customers looking to sign up contracts, capacity agreements, et cetera, to deliver any of these Internet events at scale to the Akamai global platform? Thanks.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure, we carry most all the major events in most all the major countries in the world. We do derive revenue from those events. Even years, you have more of those events and they tend to be better years for our media business. And perhaps more fundamentally, those events, particularly things like the Olympics, there tends to be changes in the ecosystem. Fancier TVs, this Olympics will have a lot of 4K involved. And so new technologies get demonstrated. And that tends to have a more long-lasting effect. For example, if a lot of folks went and bought 4K TVs, such that they liked it, got used to it, but then a lot of the content that's more day-to-day going forward, you can imagine using that kind of capability, and that creates a lot more traffic and more business for Akamai. So I think there is a more modest, short-term impact. And yes, we do go get, make sure we have capacity and sign up deals for all these events. That is good for the media business. But sometimes you also get a little longer lasting effect afterwards.","Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Excellent. A quick follow-on for Jim would be what steps you might be taking to systematically improve free cash flow generation? I've been speaking with quite a few clients recently. They see around a 6% cash flow yield in the stock. How would you benchmark free cash flow generation versus your software Internet peers? Thanks.","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I think it's obviously every company is a little bit different and unique. Certainly from a free cash flow, we generate a substantial free cash flow. We've been in kind of the mid-to-high teens from a free cash flow perspective that some years it's going to be a little bit lower than that if we invest more in network CapEx to build out a network, which is hopefully going to be for revenue that we expect in the future. But I think generally speaking, the kind of the model that we've outlined is a model that is kind of low 40s EBITDA. CapEx in the 16% to 18% range. And then you can calculate obviously the free cash flow from that.","And I think relative to certainly our peer group in the CDN industry, no one's even close to our financial model. And then relative to others that are in the software and services industry, again all companies are a little bit differently, but I think we fare reasonably well for companies that need to do build-out of their network like we do, so I think that we have a very, very strong business model as a company.","Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks to both of you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great, thanks. The organizational split that you announced, does that put the company in better position to formally split into two legal entities if it so chose? And do you foresee a situation where that actually might make sense? And then, as part of that question, if you're now kind of aligning the parts of the cost structure leading to each of those two buckets, although I appreciate the comments you made about the platform staying as one, will you be in a position to better see visibility on what EBITDA is for each of those two businesses and do you foresee potentially breaking that out for us as well? Thanks.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let me take the first question. We have absolutely no intention of splitting the company. And it wouldn't make sense to do that. And though the key point there of course is the platform, which is common and which is a huge advantage for us, both in terms of the economics and the performance and also the scale. Our security solutions, our acceleration solutions, and our video delivery solutions all ride on the same platform. Our media customers buy all of those from us. So there's no intention to split up the company. And I'll let Jim talk about EBITDA and reporting.","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, so I think you know, Colby, that we try to provide you guys some color annually anyway around what the EBITDA profile is of our Media business, our Performance and Security business, and our Service and Support business. So I think we already provided that to you that as far as now splitting these up, as Tom mentioned, really what we're doing, remember, is we're taking kind of the product management, product marketing, product development engineering, and kind of sales and marketing side. But that's not the entire company. It's a very, very large kind of organization and platform, and there's other organizations as well.","So we will continue to provide annually a view for you around what these divisions look like and I'll probably \u2013 while it remains to be seen, we'll have to see at the upcoming investor summit what exactly we share in this construct that we're not moving into this model until Q2, so it's probably a little premature to provide visibility, but I already do provide visibility around EBITDA in the current business construct, and this really isn't fundamentally different than that other than what we're doing is we're integrating the product teams with the go-to-market teams into one team. We think it's going to drive better kind of customer-centric solutions and kind of faster response timing for customers. So I think in that regard, it's more \u2013 the goal of it is really to improve execution. It's not necessarily to kind of change the way we're reporting the business.","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. And if I can just get one quick follow-up then. Obviously, the stock, like the broader market, has been under pressure of late. Can you see yourself pulling forward some of your stock buyback similar to, I guess, the announcement that Tom himself is going to be investing in the stock over the next six months to offset the stock comp, which is your goal? Thanks.","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, so, that's why I mentioned it in my prepared remarks, that certainly the primary goal of our buyback program is to offset dilution from equity grant. So that will continue to be the primary goal of the program. But the way the program is set up is that we will opportunistically buy back more, depending upon where the stock price trades and depending upon business and market conditions. So you can expect that if the stock price is trading low relative to kind of general market that we will end up buying back more shares. But it's an opportunistic program and I'd say that's the secondary benefit of the program, it's not the primary benefit of the program.","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of James Breen with William Blair. Your line is now open.","James D. Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking the question. Tom or Jim, I was just wondering if you could give us a little color around the international portion of the business and I think last quarter you had a pretty good growth rate outside the U.S. And then maybe just your thoughts on as you look at some of these larger customers doing it themselves, do you think there's a greater or less potential for that to happen outside the U.S. given some of the geographic challenges? Thanks.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'll start with the last question. We don't see really do it yourself outside the U.S. It's really only in literally a handful of giant U.S. media companies. So it's really not an issue there. In fact, it probably gets even harder outside the U.S. to try to attempt that. Our international business, our EMEA business and APJ business are growing at very strong clips. Of course, that's where we get the most impact from the strengthened dollar. So you don't see the percentage of our overall revenue growing as fast as it would otherwise.","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, our international business grew 27%, so it's growing in the mid-20%s. So we're very, very pleased with the performance in both the European markets and our Asian markets.","James D. Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jack Kilgallen - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, this is Jack Kilgallen, filling in for Heather. Thanks for taking the question. The first one you made the comment that excluding those top two customers, the rest of the Media segment grew 10%. I was just wondering, A, if you could give a little bit of color on how that metric has been trending, and B, if you could also give some color on like the price volume dynamics that underlie that 10%?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I think as we shared before, the Media business tends to have variability based on traffic volumes and pushing traffic and price points. And so I'd say we had a huge Q4 of 2014. We had a record number of gaming releases, software download releases. So the fact that we grew 10% over that, we were very, very pleased. There are some quarters where it does grow more than that, but that's when you have notably more gaming releases and notably more software downloads, but I say it is a very, very good quarter for Q4 outside of those two customers. And what was your second question?","Jack Kilgallen - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Pricing.","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Oh, pricing. The pricing dynamic that we said with Media for some time is, it remains a very competitive market, which means you have to offer competitive price points. But the rate and pace of pricing, so pricing declines do happen. They happen annually. We track them, track them religiously and kind of the rate and pace of pricing declines has been very consistent over the last several years.","Jack Kilgallen - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, and then if I could just get one more. You talked about cloud security, but the ad performance and acceleration business, they grew 11% constant currency this quarter, which was in line with the last quarter. Is there any reason if that were to accelerate on a year-over-year basis, I guess what would be the drivers there? I know the lower growth rate, I know you'd cited that the security products were getting a lot of sales force's attention. Is there anything else you are seeing there maybe in terms of competition that you can shed some light on?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, we were very, very pleased with \u2013 like as I mentioned, we had a very good online commerce season. Seasonally, you have a good online commerce season, the web acceleration business will do well. And we had a good online commerce season, which is why it grew 11%. That business admittedly in years past has grown faster than that. That business has the potential to accelerate and grow faster, but because it's a subscription-oriented business, effectively deals you book this year tend to be revenue next year.","And so I don't think you are going to expect kind of a significant reacceleration in that business any time soon. I do think there is significant opportunity. I think that there's work being done by the engineering teams to increase the pace of innovation and start to offer adjacent products and also improve the existing products. So I think there is a lot of potential on that business, but that business has been growing in kind of the low-double digits. It has been decelerating slightly. It is true that when you have an offering like security that's been growing at 50%, was relatively new for the sales force. It's gotten significant mind share. We've gotten significant traction. It has taken a little bit of way from the web performance business, but I think there is still good opportunity for that business to grow, and I think it's up to us to execute now.","Jack Kilgallen - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys, good evening, couple of questions on Media also. First of all, on 1Q, it seems that way based on what you guided in terms of modeling, but are we back to what we think of as normal quarter-over-quarter seasonality in the Media business after a flattish 4Q? So should I think of a normal kind of couple of percent down?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Michael, I don't know what normal is at times in the media business (55:23).","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Well, just statistically similar to the prior years' discount (55:24), what I mean.","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, the Media business declined last year kind of Q4 to Q1 sequentially, so we're certainly \u2013 we're implying from this guide that it's going to sequentially decline this year. There have been years past, though, that Q4 to Q1 the media business has grown, so that's why I said \u2013 I can't say that there's more seasonality patterns in the non-media businesses than there are in the media businesses where those businesses do tend to show sequential declines, I'm talking about organically, largely because of the online commerce season that I mentioned that you don't have that in the first quarter. But I'd say for Media, what you saw in the guide is that as we mentioned, these top two accounts are going to weigh on growth rates kind of here in the near term. But I'd say outside of those two customers, if there is something that's normal, it's going to behave more like it did last year.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Right, but in other words, do we still have an out-sized sequential impact from those two, or is that kind of getting normal patterns off of 4Q that where we took the big hit?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, I mean we're going to see a step down in volumes in these top two accounts as well from Q4 to Q1. Are they going to be just the same magnitude that they were from Q3 to Q4? We'll see, but you will see a similar step down in revenue volumes from Q4 to Q1 in these large accounts.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then the next question, and I know it's hard to look out, but how do you think about if you're going from 13% of revs to 6% of revs roughly for those two top two into 2016, what's your sense of confidence relative to the longer term? Do you feel like they're stabilized or should we think about those as declining businesses for you long term, those top two?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I would view this as probably stabilizing, hard to really predict into 2017. I think there's plenty of potential for actually upside there, especially if there's real progress in video over the top with these customers. So I would say there's more upside than downside. And the very worst possible case, it's only 6% of revenue. And so we are very diversified, and I like that position because now you have some giants that at only a total of 6% of revenue could really grow from there and help reaccelerate the business going forward.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Thanks Tom, thanks Jim.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gray Powell with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for taking the questions. So your server count really spiked in 2015, and I'm guessing that is anticipation of future traffic growth at some point this year. How should we think about those investments going forward? And then what kind of visibility do you have on initiatives that could drive traffic growth higher at some point in 2016?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I mean I'll take the server count. I mean obviously, we look at network CapEx. And as you can imagine, we're doing deployments in the U.S., outside the U.S. And as we talked about in 2015, we did begin to forward bill for what we thought was going to be the potential of an over-the-top offering. And so you could think of it as that the network \u2013 you have to build the network out three months to six months in advance, and so we built that out. It's fair to say we haven't monetized that here in the near term, and you'll grow into that here in 2016. We spent a little bit more as a percent of revenue in 2015 than we normally do. We normally spend kind of, call it, 8%, 8.5% of revenue on network CapEx, and we spent about 10% of revenue on network CapEx, but that's above our model. We think the model is more in the kind of 8%, 8.5% range and we'll probably be back at those levels in 2016.","And as Tom mentioned around what's going to reaccelerate Media, I think we talked about what those things are. I think there is significant opportunity for growth in Media outside of these two accounts. We do believe one catalyst for growth in the media business is as more and more premium content moves online, it's poised to push a lot more traffic online, and we believe that we're in a good position to benefit from that when that happens.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, in terms of the visibility question, I think we probably have as good visibility as it's possible to have. And that said \u2013 but it's hard to predict the future. And there's I think things that happen or don't happen that are even beyond the industry to really know for sure. We got caught a little bit last year with that. We and a lot of other folks had very good reason to believe that there was going to be the good possibility of a large influx in OTT traffic. That did not take place. So generally, I'd say our visibility is very good. We are very well connected with all of the major players, but it's not perfect.","Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. That's helpful. And then I just want to make sure I have something correct from a modeling perspective. You may have already touched on this already. How much of the impact from your top two customers going from 13% of revenue to 6% is actually hitting in Q1? Is it all hitting in Q1 or does it phase in over the next two or three quarters?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, as we mentioned, 13% is kind of, call it, what is average over the last few years. It's been coming down, so in Q4 it was not at \u2013 it was lower than 13%. And as Tom mentioned that we think that you're going to see it come down probably through the middle part of 2016, and then we'll have to see, our expectation is that we think it may stabilize from there.","Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg McDowell with JMP Securities. Your line is now open.","Rishi Jaluria - JMP Securities LLC","Hi, this is Rishi Jaluria, dialing in for Greg McDowell. Thank you for taking my questions. So first, you discussed your strong e-commerce season that you had over the holiday season, and I believe it was IBM that said that almost 60% of Internet shopping came from mobile devices. Just wondering what sort of impact have you seen from this shift of Internet traffic to mobile devices?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, we saw very similar statistics. I think our statistics were just a little bit less. That could be with our customer mix. We do carry almost all the major commerce sites on our platform, but mobile is certainly increasing its penetration. We're putting a lot of effort into improving mobile performance. Mobile performance is more challenged obviously than desktop performance, especially if you are using a cellular network. There is a lot of interest in our commerce customers and our customer base as a whole in mobile site performance and mobile app performance.","Rishi Jaluria - JMP Securities LLC","Got it. Got it. Okay. And then you've seen some impressive growth from your cloud security business. There aren't really many cloud security players out there with $300 million in annual revenue. Just as you have gone to this sort of scale and you continue to grow at this relatively high clip, do you anticipate that you are going to start running into bigger competitors, especially as they kind of take notice of this big growing business?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think there's a lot of folks interested in the security business. There's giant security companies that license software or sell you hardware. We come at it from really a different approach where we have built a fantastic platform that we can use in a multi-tenant way to provide excellent security with excellent performance in a very easy-to-consume manner. And there the big folks don't know how to do that. We have got a great head start there and we've got 15 years of experience operating in that kind of platform. So there are just lots of customers for us to go and sign up, and it's up to us to execute there. A plenty of competition all around, but in cloud security, we have a very good value proposition.","Rishi Jaluria - JMP Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And then last question, I'll jump off. But I see your investor summit's next month. We're excited to be there. Just in terms of giving us an idea of what to expect out of it, do you think it's going to be like it's been in the past years, or given this reorganization that you will be doing in Q2, should we maybe be expecting a couple of new things out of it?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think you'll find it to be similar to past years. So I don't think you see any fundamental differences.","Rishi Jaluria - JMP Securities LLC","Okay, great.","Tom Barth - Head-Investor Relations","There'll be a free lunch.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Free lunch.","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","Rishi Jaluria - JMP Securities LLC","Fantastic. I'll be there. Thank you so much, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Excellent. Thank you guys for squeezing me in. I just wanted to revisit the realignment of the business. Just to get a sort of clear understanding of the directionality of sort of why you're putting the change into place. And maybe it'd be helpful if you can walk us through a couple of examples of the type of stuff you're expecting to be able to do with the new alignment that you couldn't do with the old alignment to help us understand as to the reason why.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think whenever you bring the customer closer to the developer, you get a better result. You make better products. You make them faster. Innovation gets in the customer's hands faster. You're more efficient. And that's what we're trying to accomplish here. We are getting the folks that work day-to-day with customers lined up right next to the developers that make the products for them. As you could imagine, there's a very high correlation between the revenue we get from media customers and the revenue we get from our media products. And on the other side of the house, a very strong correlation from between the revenue we get from, say, banks and commerce sites as customers and the revenue we get from our application acceleration and web security products. So by bringing those teams together, I think we will be more responsive to our customers and more efficient overall, and I think it helps us accelerate growth.","Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And there's no cost saving angle or sort of consolidation of functionality, it's just creating different lines of communication amongst the various components of the businesses.","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's right. I think you want to view this as cost neutral. We weren't doing this in terms of absolutely saving dollars. We're not doing a big layoff here. But I do expect us to be a lot more efficient and I do expect that to help us ultimately on the bottom line for the company.","Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And is there any execution risk involved in terms of people have sort of different \u2013 like, do account coverages change at all or the way you address the customers change at all?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, and that's important. We put a lot of effort into that as we planned this realignment. I think we have less than 0.5% of our customers that will have any change in their account team. I think 96% of the reps still have exactly the same territory. And that's probably more than you might even see in a typical year. So there's not really any disruption on the customer side, it's just that those teams will have their management changed now side-by-side with the developer management change and so I think you'll see us be more effective as a result.","Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. So this can almost be thought as more strategic in nature than sort of feet on the ground in nature.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Correct.","Tom Barth - Head-Investor Relations","Operator, we have time for one more. We're running a little bit long. So let's take one more question, please.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Will Power with Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.","Will V. Power - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. So I recognize it sounds like the pressure at your top two customers is you think principally due to do-it-yourself efforts. But I wonder if you could comment on what you are seeing more broadly in the media delivery business competitively from the likes of Amazon, Level 3, EdgeCast and the private players out there, et cetera. Any sense of share loss or any sense of changing dynamics on that front that may be pressuring the business?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, not really. We've got dozens of competitors in the media space. We always have, we always will. There is so much potential in that space that you're going to have a lot of competitors. I think we compete very effectively. I'm not aware of any significant share loss there. I think the only fundamental shift there really has been with the big carriers, and basically I'd say the shift has been more towards standardizing on Akamai. I think you look back four years or five years ago, most of the world's major carriers had some kind of DIY effort to build their own CDN to compete with Akamai. Maybe they bought a lot of equipment from one of the big box manufacturers, and today most of the world's major carriers are pretty much standardizing on Akamai.","Obviously, Verizon an exception there having purchased EdgeCast, we compete with that. I've said Verizon is still a very large reseller for Akamai. Level 3 of course competes, always has. But the list is not long in terms of the carriers. The cloud providers, some of them partner with us, some of them have competing services, but we're not seeing erosion due to competition. We got two large customers that are built off more on their own internal effort. We have not lost business to competitors there. So I think we're in a very good position on the competitive front.","Will V. Power - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Tom Barth - Head-Investor Relations","Thank you, Tom. Thank you, everyone, and thank you. In closing, as Jim mentioned, we hope to see you at either live or via webcast through the Akamai platform at our 2016 Investor Summit to be held here on March 7 in Boston. In addition, we will be presenting at a number of investor conferences in both February and March. And details of these can be found on the Investor Relations section of akamai.com.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.","Tom Barth - Head-Investor Relations","Thank you, and good afternoon for joining \u2013 thank you for joining us on Akamai's first quarter 2016 earnings conference call.","Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Benson, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer. But before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on April 26, 2016. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances.","As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of our website.","And with that, let me please turn the call over to Tom.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us. Q1 was a very solid quarter for Akamai and both the top and bottom lines. Revenue in the first quarter was $568 million, up 8% year-over-year, and up 9% when adjusted for foreign exchange headwinds. Excluding the contribution from our two largest customers, revenue in the first quarter was up 15% over Q1 of 2015. Our strong revenue achievement was driven by the continued robust demand for our security services, which grew 47% in constant currency over the first quarter of last year, as well as solid performance across all of our major product lines and geographies.","Non-GAAP EPS for the first quarter was $0.66 per diluted share, up 8% year-over-year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range due to our strong revenue achievement and our continued focus on efficiency across the company. Our solid performance in Q1 has gotten us off to an excellent start for the year. I was particularly pleased to see our continued strong execution during the time when we were realigning the company.","As a result of the realignment, we now have three major divisions; Media, Lab and Enterprise and Carrier. Each division has its own resources for development, product management, marketing and sales. For example, the Media Division is developing products focused on video and software delivery, and they manage our customers and prospects in the media, software, social networking, and gaming verticals. The Web Division is responsible for developing our web security and application acceleration products. And they manage customers and prospects in verticals such as e-commerce, financial services, software-as-a-service, and the public sector. The Enterprise and Carrier Division is responsible for developing products for enterprise and carrier networks and enterprise security. And they manage our carrier relationships. Going forward, we will report the revenue for each division in terms of the revenue derived from customers in that division. For continuity purposes, we will also continue to provide the product-based view of revenue that we have historically reported. Jim will provide all of this data for Q1 shortly.","But first, I would like to mention some of the recent highlights from the Media and Web Divisions. It's been an exciting start to the year for the Media Division, with record-breaking online audiences for major events such as the Super Bowl and March Madness. 4 million viewers watched the Super Bowl online this year, up from 2.5 million in 2015. The average bit rate was up 30% to 4.5 megabits per second in 2016, and the average viewing time was up 20% to over 100 minutes.","We also delivered a major golf tournament in the new 4K format a few weeks ago. This was the first time that a major U.S. sporting event has been delivered in 4K online. The quality levels were extraordinary. Using our Octoshape Client technology, we delivered an average bit rate of 13 megabits per second, with a rebuffering rate of less than 1%, showing once again Akamai's ability to deliver broadcast quality content reliably and securely.","The excellent end user experience that we are providing with our advanced video delivery capabilities was a major topic of discussion at the recent National Association of Broadcasters, or NAB Show. That's because the ability to deliver high-quality video at scale is critical to the enablement of over-the-top, or OTT, services. A common theme in my conversations with many of the world's leading broadcasters and media companies at the show was that they greatly value our ability to provide such high quality and scale, and to do so with a very high level of reliability.","It is very difficult to replicate our ability to deliver online media with world-class quality, scale, and security. That's because of our unique approach of streaming content through a global network of more than 200,000 edge servers located close to end users, which allows us to bypass congested middle mile peering points, resulting in a more reliable viewing experience for end users. Our superior communication and video transport protocols, which are designed to deliver the kind of higher-quality picture that is desired by viewers and broadcasters alike.","Our client side software, which is now installed on over 100 million devices around the world, and designed to greatly improve quality and scale, while also lowering cost. And our new 24\/7 Broadcast Operations Control Center, or BOCC, capability for end to end monitoring of quality and fast resolution of performance issues. I'm pleased to report that our BOCC is already receiving national accolades for the level of service that it can provide to our broadcast customers.","At NAB, the BOCC was selected as TV Technology's Best of Show for its design, features, cost efficiency and performance. The BOCC also won Streaming Media's Best of NAB 2016, one of only six awards the publication presented from among the 1,600-plus exhibitors at the show. Of course, it's hard to predict how fast the OTT market will grow, but we believe that we are very well-positioned to benefit from the increasing demand for high-quality video online.","There are also some exciting developments to report from our Web Division. Most notably, our new Bot Manager service became generally available earlier this month. Bot Manager identifies over 1,200 (7:53) types of bots, and enables our customers to customize their response to request based on the bot type. For example, one of our government customers recently deployed Bot Manager to thwart malicious entities that were checking on the validity of stolen account names and passwords. Using Bot Manager, they were able to automatically report passwords as being invalid, when we detected that a bot was making the request instead of a human, thereby preventing the fraudulent use of stolen identities.","I'm also pleased to report that we now have over 1,000 Ion customers. As you may recall, we launched Ion a little over three years ago, and it has since become the leading solution for accelerating websites and applications online. Ion is particularly well-suited for accelerating mobile apps and content being delivered to mobile devices. This is important because the mobile environment is often much slower than the desktop environment. Users expect mobile devices to be fast, and over half of all transactions on the Akamai platform now come from mobile devices.","Before turning the call over to Jim, I would like to emphasize that although we have a new divisional structure, Akamai's goal remains the same as it has always been: to make the Internet fast, reliable and secure. And we are still laser-focused on solving four grand challenges for our customers: delivering video over the Internet with unparalleled quality, scale, and affordability; providing near instant performance for websites and apps on any device anywhere; securing websites and data centers from cyber-attacks that aim to disrupt their online operations, corrupt their data, or steal sensitive information; and scaling enterprise networks to handle growing cloud workloads efficiently and securely.","We believe that we will continue to benefit from strong secular tailwinds such as the increasing amount of video being consumed online, the rapid proliferation of mobile devices, the growing need for cloud-based security solutions and the continued migration of enterprise applications to the cloud. And we are continuing to invest in the growth of the business. I believe that our new divisional structure will enable us to be even more responsive to our customers' needs and to bring new capabilities to market at an even faster pace than before.","In summary, Akamai is off to a strong start in 2016, and I'm very excited about the substantial opportunities for growth that lie ahead.","I will now turn the call over to Jim to review our Q1 financial results and to provide the outlook for Q2. Jim?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Tom and good afternoon, everyone. As Tom outlined and as we previewed at the investor summit in March, we are now managing the business in our new division structure. In an effort to make this transition as clear and transparent as possible, in addition to providing our results through this new division lens, we will continue to provide you with our financial results by the solution categories we have historically shared.","Looking to top-line performance, Akamai had a strong first quarter and is off to a good start in 2016. Q1 revenue came in near the high end of our guidance range at $568 million, up 8% year-over-year or up 9% if you adjust for foreign exchange headwinds, and growth outside of our top two customers continued to be strong, up 15% in constant currency.","Turning to our solution categories, revenue from our Performance and Security Solutions was $316 million in the quarter, up 16% year-over-year or up 17% on a constant currency basis. Within this solution category, we saw solid growth across the major product lines and we continued to see significant growth and demand for our Cloud Security offerings. First quarter revenue for our Cloud Security Solutions was $81 million, up 46% year-over-year or up 47% on a constant currency basis. We are pleased with how well our unique and differentiated Cloud Security capabilities are being adopted by our customers and being recognized in the marketplace. Our Bot Manager offering is a latest example of how we are innovating to expand our security portfolio to meet strong customer demand.","Turning now to our Media Delivery Solutions, revenue was $206 million in the quarter, down 4% year-over-year and in line with our expectations. As we have previously mentioned, Media revenues continue to be impacted by DIY efforts in two of our largest Media customers; however, the rest of our Media business grew over 11% compared to a very strong Q1 of 2015. Finally, revenue from our Services and Support Solutions was $46 million in the quarter, up 16% year-over-year. We continue to see strong new customer attachment rates for our higher-end enterprise class professional services globally.","Turning now to our new division view, as we shared in our last call, we are now managing the company in a new division structure which integrates the development, product management, marketing and sales teams into three divisions to focus on the company's Media, Web, and Enterprise and Carrier products and customers. This new customer alliance structure is designed to create tighter alignment and integration between customer requirements and product innovation while increasing the ease of leveraging Akamai's services and is intended to help us better serve our customers and accelerate growth.","Under this new division construct, revenue from our Media Division was $292 million in the quarter, down 1% year-over-year or flat on a constant currency basis. The Media Division is impacted by the continued DIY efforts of our two largest customers, Media customers that I mentioned earlier. Revenue growth for the Media Division customers outside of the top two was a healthy 11%.","Revenue from the Web Division was $264 million, up 18% year-over-year. We have continued to see solid growth in this customer base with particularly strong security growth of 51% year-over-year in constant currency. Lastly, revenue from the emerging Enterprise and Carrier Division was $12 million in the quarter, up 45% year-over-year.","To be helpful, as we migrate to this new division reporting lens, we will continue to report the former solution category view through the balance of 2016. And even though our security revenue will now be embedded within each of the three division's revenue results, we will continue to break out total security revenue separately. You will find all these revenue results detailed in today's press release and on our investor relations website.","Moving on to our geographies. Sales in our international markets represented 30% of total revenue in Q1, up two points from Q4. International revenue was $170 million in the quarter, up 24% year-over-year or up 27% in constant currency. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact on revenue of $4 million on a year-over-year basis and was roughly neutral on a sequential basis.","We continue to see very strong growth in our Asia Pacific geography. Revenue from our U.S. market was $397 million, up 2% year-over-year. As we have shared with you previously, our two largest Media customers reside in the U.S. and continued to weigh heavily on domestic revenues. Outside of these two customers, revenue growth was solid across the rest of the business.","Moving on to costs, cash gross margin was 77% consistent with Q4 levels, down one point from the same period last year, and in line with our guidance. GAAP gross margin which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation was 66%, down one point from the prior quarter, down two points from the same period last year, and in line with our guidance. GAAP operating expenses were $259 million in the first quarter. These GAAP results include items such as depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, acquisition related charges and other non-recurring items.","Of particular note in the quarter, we recorded $7 million in non-recurring restructuring charges for severance and impairments related to the organization realignment. Excluding these items, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $201 million, down $9 million from Q4 levels and at the low end of our guidance. As always, we will strive to balance investments in the business to align with the expected near-term moderation in revenue growth rates.","Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $234 million, down $4 million from Q4 levels from the seasonal revenue declines Q4 to Q1, and up $11 million from the same period last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 41% consistent with Q4 levels, down one point from the same period last year and in line with our guidance.","GAAP depreciation and amortization expenses were $81 million in the first quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation associated with stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, and amortization of capitalized interest expense. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP depreciation was $70 million consistent with Q4 levels and slightly below our guidance due to the timing of network deployments.","Non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $164 million, down $4 million from Q4 and up $1 million from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 29%, consistent with Q4 levels and down two points from the same period last year, and one point higher than our guidance given the strong revenue attainment and cost efficiencies mentioned earlier.","Moving on to the other income and expense items, interest income for the first quarter was $3 million, consistent with Q4 levels. Non-cash interest expense related to our convertible debt was roughly $5 million. As a reminder, this non-cash expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results.","Moving on to earnings, GAAP net income for the first quarter was $75 million or $0.42 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $118 million or $0.66 of earnings per diluted share, $0.02 above the high end of our guidance range. Our better than expected earnings were fueled by higher revenues and continued efficiencies in the business.","For the quarter, total taxes were included in our GAAP earnings were $38 million based on an effective tax rate of 33.5%. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $49 million, based on an effective tax rate of 29.4% and in line with our guidance. Finally, our weighted average diluted share count for the first quarter was 178 million shares, down 2 million shares from Q4 levels from our opportunistic increase in share-buyback activity and in line with our guidance.","Now I'll review some balance sheet items. Days sales outstanding for the first quarter was 60 days, up one day from Q4 levels. Capital expenditures in Q1, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $85 million and at the low end of our guidance for the quarter. As a reminder, this CapEx number also includes capitalized software development activities.","Cash flow generation continued to be strong. Free cash flow was $108 million in the first quarter or 19% of revenue, a very strong result considering Q1 is our seasonally lowest free cash flow quarter. Our balance sheet also remains very strong with roughly $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at the end of the quarter. If you factor in our convertible debt, our net cash is approximately $800 million.","During the quarter, we spent $109 million on share repurchases, buying back roughly 2.2 million shares. As we mentioned in our last earnings call, the board authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program through the end of 2018. We have approximately $960 million remaining on that authorization. And as we have discussed in the past, our overall aim is to deploy our capital to achieve favorable returns for our investors in a manner that we believe is in the best long-term interest of the company and our shareholders.","Given our strong balance sheet and cash generation, this new authorization is intended to continue our multi-year capital allocation plan to offset dilution from equity compensation plans and to provide us with the flexibility to opportunistically return more cash to shareholders depending upon business and market conditions.","In summary, we are pleased with how the business performed in Q1 and we remain confident in the long-term prospects of profitable growth for the company. Looking ahead, we are projecting revenue from our top two customers to decline in Q2 and possibly the second half of the year. As such, we are expecting slightly less sequential growth in the second quarter than we have historically seen. We expect Q2 revenues in the range of $566 million to $582 million. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a positive impact on Q2 revenue of roughly $3 million sequentially and less than $1 million compared to Q2 of last year. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of roughly 76% and GAAP gross margins of 65%. Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $206 million to $211 million.","As I have mentioned on the past couple of calls, we have purposefully slowed down the rate and pace of head count additions and discretionary spending to align with our near-term top-line growth expectations, but we are continuing to make prudent investments in the business that we believe are necessary to support sustained long-term growth and scale.","Factoring in all these items I just mentioned, we anticipate Q2 EBITDA margins of 40%. And as I continue to message, we will strive to operate the company in the 40% to 41% EBITDA range for the foreseeable future. Of course, our ability to maintain EBITDA margins in this range will be heavily dependent on several factors, including revenue volumes, possible M&A, and spending on platform capacity in anticipation of greater demand for our over-the-top video delivery services.","Moving on to depreciation, we expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be $73 million to $75 million. Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margins of 27% for Q2. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.62 to $0.65. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $46 million to $48 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of 29.5%. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of 176 million shares.","On CapEx, we expect to spend approximately $90 million to $98 million in the quarter, excluding equity compensation. As always, we will strive to balance network investment against future revenue opportunity and continued network efficiency initiatives.","In closing, Q1 was a solid start to 2016, and we remain confident in our strategy and our ability to execute on our long-term plans.","Thank you. And Tom and I would like to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. You talk about the growth in the Media segment of about 11% ex the two largest contributors. Could you talk about the trend in that growth ex those two largest contributors and how we should think about the sustainability of that growth? Is that a reasonable way to think about that segment ex the two large players going forwards? Thank you.","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good question, Mark. That \u2013 actually that growth rate is consistent with the growth rates that we saw in Q4. We have kind of been in the double-digit range for a while. Sometimes it will be a little bit higher than that. As we shared in the past that sometimes growth rates in the Media business are affected by large software releases, a gaming release, or things of that nature. But I think generally speaking, we expect that we can probably operate in the low-double digits for the Media Delivery outside of those top two customers.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rob Sanderson with MKM Partners. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Rob J. Sanderson - MKM Partners LLC","Thank you. Couple of \u2013 one for Jim and one for Tom. Tom, a question on cost reduction, many years of high growth and traffic volumes along with price breaks that you have been passing along, but how much has the company been able to cost reduce traffic delivery over the years? Is there a way we could sort of compare cost per bit today to, say, five years ago? And I would think the past is something like Moore's Law, but is there any way you can attempt to quantify that? And how does \u2013 do you think this compares to some of the generic CDN or some of the do-it-yourself efforts that you have seen over this timeframe?","And then a quick one for Jim. Free cash flow \u2013 will Q1 be the seasonal low again this year as in the past or is there something unusual seasonally this Q1 for cash generation?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. To the first question, we've put a lot of effort in R&D to reduce our internal cost per bit, to deliver more bits per second per CPU, more bits per second per square foot of colo, per kilowatt of power. And then we pass on those savings to our customers. So I think as you look over time, every year we're able to offer significant cost reductions on a per bit basis to our customers.","So over five years, the savings are really quite substantial. We are very competitive when it comes to pricing for large-traffic customers, and I think we are very competitive with not only the other CDNs out there, but also the do-it-yourself effort that some of our largest customers have tried to engage in. And you see this where some of our large customers have had do-it-yourself efforts in the past, and then after a few years discover that, wow, Akamai is a lot more effective at it, and charges them less than their internal efforts cost them. And so then our traffic grows again, even though they've got do-it-yourself efforts.","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, on the question on free cash flow, as you know, free cash flow really depends upon a couple things. One, we're not a inventory-centric company, so other than profitability, collections tends to be \u2013 receivable collections tends to be the kind of driver from quarter-to-quarter, if you see upticks or downticks. Also CapEx happens to have variability from quarter-to-quarter. But I would expect that \u2013 this will probably still remain our seasonally lowest quarter, but it all depends upon capital expenditures. And as I said earlier that if we see demand that we need to do more network deployment, we'll do that. So, I don't want to signal something and then later on if we may be a little bit lower than that \u2013 that it really depends upon CapEx investments. But I'd say based on our current line of sight, it probably will be the lowest seasonal quarter this year as well.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, hi. Yeah, hi, Tom, Jim. Question is on your Security business. We get this question from clients a lot, saying would the law of large numbers start impacting the Security business, because it's primarily selling into DDoS, and web application security versus the broader security opportunity. I'd like to hear your thoughts there. Thanks.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I'm not sure what you mean by the law of large numbers, but the attacks are certainly growing in size and sophistication to the point now where any of the traditional defenses simply don't work. You can't defend yourself by buying boxes and putting them in your data center. You can't even defend yourself by buying a clean pipe from a carrier simply because of the scale of the attacks. And that's why Akamai has been uniquely able to defend a lot of the world's major enterprises against the largest attacks out there.","In addition, we're able to defend against the attacks that try to deface or corrupt a website, change the content in a way to embarrass the website owner, and also to \u2013 we can defend against the attacks where you try to steal data from the web application, like a credit card, or information about a transaction. Going forward with our Enterprise and Carrier Division, we are developing products that will protect enterprise employees, for example, from phishing, malware kinds of attacks, or enterprise data exfiltration attacks. So it's a \u2013 I think a very exciting future potential for us in security.","Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","A quick follow on, Tom. Is corporate video \u2013 you know, we all in big companies have these all-hands meetings, town-hall meetings where tremendous video volumes get generated in corporate networks, which is quite expensive. Would Akamai have a play there in kind of better managing or making corporate video and enterprises more efficient? Thanks.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, absolutely, and in fact we have a product today through the Octoshape acquisition that supports corporate videos to off-load their private network, or their corporate network, and so it gives a very high-quality experience, very secure without flooding the branch office network.","Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. Two questions if I may. The first one, I just have a point of clarification on guidance. I just want \u2013 I thought I heard you say that you thought that the top two customers could further decline in the back half of the year. I think the previous expectation was that they would trough at around 6% or \u2013 6% or greater in the second quarter. And I just wanted to clarify what I thought you might have said during your comments on guidance. And then I have a follow-up question.","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, so on the guidance that \u2013 I'd say we're probably appropriately being cautious, to be frank that the \u2013 we have good visibilities within the quarter for these top two customers. I would say the visibility beyond the quarter is less, and so what we're trying to do is be cautious in what we're telling you that we certainly expect from Q1 to Q2, as we told you last time, that revenue volumes would decline for these top two customers. And I think what we're saying is that we're not 100% sure on the back half of the year, so we're being a little cautious in our projections that it could decline further. There are things that could stabilize it. There are things beyond that depending upon different features and capabilities for these two customers that could cause it to grow as well, but I'd say what we're trying to provide you is a level of cautiousness. And that's the way we're looking at it internally.","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","I guess to some degree that implies that these customers are on some form of month-to-month or short-term contract that they have the ability to turn on and turn off service quarter-to-quarter. Is that a fair interpretation?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, it's not. These customers are on long-term contracts, but these contracts are structured in a way that volumes can ebb and flow from period to period. There are kind of minimums that they need to hit, but the volumes can certainly fluctuate to a point. But these customers are on long-term contracts. They are not on month-to-month contracts.","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, great. And then just my follow-up question, I think you had been looking for a head of sales for your Web Division, and I wondered if there's been any update on that? Thanks.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","We are in the process of a search there. So, no update.","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, guys. Maybe just following up on the Media side, taking the top two customers. Curious about the visibility, you've often talked about talking with the customers around timing of software updates and different items that might move the needle in terms of volume. How would you say your visibility in the rest of the customer base looks at this point of the year as compared to last year?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think honestly it's similar to our top two customers as well. Our visibility within the quarter is certainly a lot better than our visibility for the remainder of the year. There're certainly things that we know that are going to occur. Things like the Olympics, things like presidential debates and things of that nature that will cause volumes. And there are certainly staged rollouts of software releases and things of that nature, but I'd say we have very, very good visibility within a three-month window. It just lessens in the back half and that's not just for the top two customers. In general, that's just the nature of the Media business.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI","Great. I'm going to try to sneak in two questions too. First, I was just wondering if you'd give us a little bit more color on international. It's obviously been growing very well and it's becoming a much more meaningful piece of your business.","You know, it's harder to have visibility into the competitive landscape drivers, et cetera, as we look into the some of the international markets, and I was hoping you might spend a second talking about that. And then I'm curious, because we've been doing a lot of work on Internet of Things. And the more I look at it, particularly around connected car, driverless car, things that require performance sensitive information to make their way into the network, the Internet of Things is looking more and more like a DDoS attack from my seat. And I'm just wondering about your perspective for the role of Akamai and world of Internet of Things? Thanks.","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Let me start, Tom (sic) [Jonathan] (36:46) with obviously your comment on international growth. Our international growth, you're right, has been very strong. We grew 27% in constant currency in Q4. It's growing particularly well in our Asia Pacific geography. So we've seen very, very strong growth across our Asia Pacific markets. And as you know that when we began investing in incrementing the sales force, we were investing more in our sales resources outside the U.S. than actually in the U.S. And as we told you in the past that it takes time for a rep to ramp to productivity. And so I think you're starting to see the benefit of the investments that we've made. And so we're very pleased with that.","From a competitor landscape perspective that there's still kind of broad global competitors, that you know who they are and then there are local competitors in different markets. But I'd say that we have fared very well and I think there's a significant opportunity to continue to grow internationally faster than actually in the U.S.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And to the IoT question, the proliferation of devices and the Internet of Things represents really a great opportunity for Akamai. You know in particular, you mentioned connecting cars. We have great relationships with the world's major automotive companies. They are obviously very interested in having fast and reliable communication with their cars and the devices and they are very worried about security, as you can imagine. Not only denial of service, but application layer attacks where somebody might try to gain control of the car, corrupt information on the car, and that's a wonderful opportunity for our security services.","Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI","Great. Thank you for taking the questions.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of James Breen with William Blair. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","James D. Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking the question. Can you just talk about the capital intensity overall, and your team spent a lot of capital in 2015 in anticipation of some of the OTT build-outs. And how that's sort of flowing through the cost structure now and how that would impact spending in the future? Thanks.","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. So on CapEx, you're right that we were above our long-term model in last year, in 2015. We signaled that, that we were about 19% of revenue. It was all driven by incremental network CapEx. You certainly saw for the quarter, that I think $85 million was about 15% of revenue. So I think we're certainly going to be dialing CapEx down in alignment with what we're seeing here, but I expect we'll be back to our long-term model of 16% to 18%. Again, we signaled that if we see demand in the back half of the year that requires us to do more build-out, we'll do that but I expect we should be in the 16% to 18% range with network CapEx, which is the component that has the most variability, dialing back from roughly 10% of revenues last year to probably in the 8% range this year.","James D. Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Michael Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Hey, good afternoon. I know you typically suggest that no one major event has an impact on revenue, but isn't there likely to be some degree of favorable impact from the Olympics in Q3, just given the favorable time zone and just increased consumption of these types of events online?","And then secondly, you talked a bit about competition earlier. There's been increasing chatter in recent weeks on competitive threats from Google and other players in the space. Can you just give us your take on what we're seeing there and if anything's changing in your view? Thanks.","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. I'll take the first one and then Tom can comment on the competitor landscape, but yeah, I think we definitely said historically that there isn't any one event that is a significant needle-mover on revenue in a quarter. We've never said that we don't garner revenues from those events. And certainly events that last over multiple days, generate more revenues than events that last for a day or a few hours. So you will definitely see revenue volumes as a result of the Olympics in our results, so you will see that. But again, it's not going to be a significant needle-mover over \u2013 I would say very, very large software updates tend to be more of a needle-mover than an event like that.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. In terms of competition, I don't see any real change in the landscape there. You're right. And you mentioned there's been chatter about Google and so forth, but that's I think what it is. The Google service is designed to provide delivery for applications that are on their compute and storage infrastructure. In that regard, they're completing with AWS and Azure, for example. And we really don't see real impact from that. As you know, we have dozens of competitors and always have. And we differentiate ourselves based on our level of performance.","So if you want your applications to be faster, whether you're on Google, Azure or AWS, you would use Akamai to accelerate those applications. If you want your applications to be secure, wherever you have them hosted, you'd use Akamai Kona Site Defender and our Prolexic Routed capabilities and that will protect you from DDoS attacks and application layer attacks. And if you want your video and media delivered with very high quality, whether you're using any of those cloud services to store the content or not, again you'd use Akamai to do that delivery for you, to get the high-quality video experience. So no fundamental change in the competitive landscape at all.","Michael Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Sitikantha Panigrahi - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to dig into your enterprise security business, the Enterprise Division now, around $12 million revenue, almost double. And you talked about Bot Manager. So first question is what sort of feedback have you got on Bot Manager? That's pretty interesting product. But also, what's your plan to expand this business? Are you planning to acquire more of this kind of tuck-in acquisition or are you planning to build in-house products?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. So first let me make it clear that Bot Manager is part of our web security business. And that's in the Web Division. That product is built by the Web Division. And the customer feedback there has been outstanding. The capability to identify the bot type and then tailor the response based on the bot type is really unique out there, and of high value to our customers. We have some customers that see half of their requests are actually from bots, and there's many different types of bots. Some are friendly, some are very much not friendly, and there's those that are in between. So I would say the initial customer reaction is very strong. That is a Web Division product.","Now, for our enterprise security products, we don't have any in the marketplace yet. Our first product will be based on recursive DNS. That is the capability that we do have in the market through our carrier partners for home use, and we will be bringing to market for enterprise use later this year. And that's designed to protect an enterprise from malware, from phishing attacks, and from data exfiltration attacks.","Now, in terms of our strategy, I think you'll see us do a lot of development organically and you'll also see us continue to make acquisitions. And as you know, recently we made acquisitions with Xerocole and Bloxx, and they are in the enterprise security space. And also we've done organic development, taking the Xerocole capability for carriers and now in the process of bringing a product to market for enterprise security.","Sitikantha Panigrahi - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks for the color. Just a quick housekeeping question. How much was the DSD revenue that you moved from Media to Performance and Security this quarter?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I want to recall, it's like $109 million. We shared that at our IR summit. It's actually available on the investor relations...","Sitikantha Panigrahi - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah, but do you have anything for this Q1? How much was that?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. It's embedded in our overall results, so you can generally divide it by four. That's, roughly speaking, what the quarterly average is.","Sitikantha Panigrahi - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Kelleher with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Mark D. Kelleher - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to look at the over-the-top opportunity. It's been a couple of months since your analyst day. We're a couple months further in the year. Can you give us an update on what you're seeing there? I would kind of imply from your guidance on your top two customers that maybe that's still kind of in limbo. But just wondered if you could give us an update on what you're seeing there. Thanks.","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. The guidance from the top two customers really isn't related to OTT capabilities. I think, in general, there's a lot of interest in the over-the-top space. It was exciting to deliver the first major sporting event in the U.S. in 4K. And that business is growing nicely for us. I don't know of any particular fundamental change in the landscape that would cause a huge overnight increase in traffic, but I expect to have steady and substantial growth over time with over-the-top.","Mark D. Kelleher - D.A. Davidson & Co.","So, the top two customers are unrelated to your expectations in OTT? Just to be clear on that.","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Currently, yes.","Mark D. Kelleher - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Bowen with Pacific Crest. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities","Okay. Thanks for taking the question. I'm sorry, I got to beat this dead horse one more time, but I'm getting questions over the transom here. So, the 6% for the two DIY customers at the end of Q2, was that a 6% exit rate, or an average for the first half? And then, therefore, are you talking about potential decline from an average 6% or an exit rate 6%?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, 6% is \u2013 we shared that in Q4 that what we had said was that these two customers combined used to be about 13% of our revenues, and they have been declining. And we said that we expected that they'd probably decline to about 6% of our revenues. Now obviously, a percentage implies that you know what your other businesses are going to do. So, to some extent, there is a little bit of variability in 6%, whether it's 6%, whether it's 5%, whether it's 7%. But we expect that the revenue volumes will decline in Q2. And based on this guidance that we provided at the midpoint, that is roughly 6% of their revenues in the quarter.","Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities","Okay. In the second quarter?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's correct.","Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities","Okay. And then the back half could be, conservatively, a little lighter than that?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's right.","Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities","Okay. Very clear. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. Jim, also, can you comment on how you said that you would be limiting investments at this point? It does seem like the OpEx guide is pretty light even with EBITDA margins where they are.","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I mean, we continue to make the appropriate investments in the business that we think are necessary. But, Tom and I are managing the company prudently. And we think that we want to manage a company kind of in the low 40%s EBITDA range, which means that we're scaling back investments. We're not scaling back investments that would jeopardize future growth and scale for the company, but, yeah, we are scaling back the level of investments, relative to what we were doing in kind of prior years, and you can expect that we'll continue to do that. But, again, we're still making very targeted investments. We're making targeted investments in areas to help scale the network. We're making targeted investments in areas of R&D and things of that nature. So, we are still making investments in the business, but we're just making them at a slower pace.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. And to be clear, we are growing head count and growing the business. It's just not at the rapid pace that you saw over the last few years. So, there's still plenty of growth at Akamai, in the investments.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","I guess, the reason for asking is, it seems, especially with everything you did in NAB just having finished and the BOCC product having rolled out. It seems as if there's a lot that can be done in terms of end-to-end value creation for broadcast. Areas you've dabbled in, I guess, well within, had some participation in the past, whether it's in ingestion, transcoding, digital rights management, content management areas of the broadcast supply chain. And wondering whether or not that's important to invest there now, and if you're ramping that up at all.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Now, we are continuing to make investments. That is one area that's very important for us. And we believe there is a very large future in over-the-top video. And so it makes perfect sense to invest in those areas, and we continue to do so. For example, the BOCC is an area that we talked about. Also, obviously, investing in web security, obviously investing in enterprise and carrier products, particularly enterprise products for networking and security. And you will continue to see the investment and growth there.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks a lot, Tom. Thanks, Jim.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you. I had a couple questions as well. I guess the first one is, I was wondering, you mentioned software downloads as a big driver. And I'm just wondering, I mean, we saw some of the very large software download last September get about three-quarters smaller than they were in the past. And there seems to be a big focus on people reducing file sizes, there's been a lot of improvements in encoding. I'm just wondering how you think about those initiatives, and how that might impact traffic volume that you might see going forward versus when the files were much larger in the past? And then I had a follow-up question.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I think certainly for traffic, the software downloads come in varying sizes. You're right, that in some cases, they're smaller for the reasons that you outlined. In some cases, they happen more frequently. So they're smaller, but happen more frequently. And it's not just software updates that are drivers of traffic volumes, video delivery is a driver of traffic volume, social media is a driver of traffic volumes, gaming is a driver of traffic volumes. So, software download activity is kind of but one of several growth drivers on traffic. And you'll see variability in software traffic volumes, based on frequency and size.","And, what was your second question?","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Well, I mean, I guess just to follow-up on that. Encoding was the other thing I mentioned. And Facebook's Head of Network Engineering actually spoke at F8, and mentioned that because of improvements in encoding, they're actually able to reduce the size of their video files now by 20%. So, I guess, that gets the other thing. There's file sizes and software downloads, but there also seems to be improvements in encoding that might be impacting some of the file sizes of video that used to get transferred versus what maybe they were two years ago. So that's one thing that I guess, I wonder if you have a comment on.","And then the other would be, I mean, clearly, everyone has asked about these top two customers, and the trajectory in the back half of the year. I guess, what I'm interested in is, 12 months to 18 months ago, there was concerns over DIY and it was always kind of talked about that you just get a better experience, which you do using Akamai. So, unlikely that these guys would take such bold steps to bring as much in house.","I guess, there're some concern that we get from people that what's to stop the third and fourth largest customers that you have now from embarking down the same path? Are they just so far away from having the level of traffic at the top two that it's just not a viable opportunity for them?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good. Let me take those two questions. The first one is, there's always improvements in video compression technology. And I think the important thing to look at is the increase in bit rate because you need a higher quality picture, combined with the decrease in bit rate because you've got better compression. And you mentioned, a 20% improvement in compression that pales in comparison to the increasing bit rates that we're seeing because people want a higher quality picture.","In fact, if you take the combination of state-of-the-art quality picture combined with state-of-the-art compression, and the CAGR of that net, for years, it was growing but at a slower rate. And now we're seeing it actually accelerate on the accumulative growth rate. So, taking the state-of-the-art compression combined with typical bit rates that people are watching, actually it's growing per minute of video watched, and growing now at a faster rate than it has in the past. And on top of that, you have people watching longer, and more content moving online. And so the net effect is actually much faster growth rate in aggregate traffic being consumed for video online. You can take as an example, the Super Bowl stats that we gave. And we're seeing that kind of growth pretty much across the board in video.","Now to your third question about DIY, and, well, can that go to the third and fourth largest customers. Well, in fact, our third and fourth largest customers have had DIY for over a decade. And in fact, one of them actually sells a CDN service, yet they still use us to deliver their content for their website, and they use us to deliver their videos. And they have a very large website, and a very large video business. And they use us to deliver that, despite the fact that they actually operate a CDN service in half the last decade.","The other provider uses us as well, despite in-house efforts they've run over the years. And in fact, our share of their business has increased during this same period, because they see the quality difference and the cost difference. DIY can seem like a good idea at the time, maybe they can save some money bringing it in-house or they think that, but then after a few years they discover that, oh my goodness, Akamai is doing it with a lot less cost and with a lot better performance. And so, our share has actually increased in the third and fourth largest customers. And there's not too many past, the top four, that actually can even afford to think about doing their own delivery.","So, yeah, we're experiencing some loss to DIY in our top two accounts now. I think the timeframe for when that happens is bounded, as Jim says, the impact it'll have on our business. And then you'll see our cumulative growth rates return to where the norm of the rest of the business is.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ed McGuire with CLSA. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Ed Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. I'm intrigued by the role that your software on 100 million endpoints is playing in your ability to rein in costs across the network. Could you talk about what you are accomplishing with that footprint of software, and whether that is actually having the desired impact of helping you rein in costs of content delivery?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. When it is actively used, it substantially decreases our cost. And we passed a lot of that savings on to our customer that's making use of it. And the usage today depends on the customer. Also, it helps us a lot with quality. In fact, we used it in the broadcast at 4K, which is very high quality levels. It really helps to have the client side software to enable that. So, it makes quality better and decreases cost. And when we use it, it's a substantial decreasing cost.","Ed Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Will Power with Robert Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Will V. Power - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks. Yeah. Just a follow up on some of the guidance commentary. Jim, I think you had alluded to limited second half visibility. And I guess, I just wanted to clarify, is that more limited this year, or is that fairly consistent with what you would normally see at this time of year as you kind of think about the second half?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, it's pretty consistent with what we've told you all along. Our visibility within the quarter was certainly much better than our visibility kind of out beyond that. As I mentioned earlier that we know of specific events, like the Olympics, like a presidential debate. And we know of scheduled activities that customers have for potential gaming releases and things of that nature. But the visibility within a three-month window is certainly much better than beyond that, but it's no different this year than it was historically.","Will V. Power - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then just maybe quickly on the security business, obviously strong growth again. Any way to quantify how important the new Bot product was to that growth, and any other color on kind of the key drivers within that segment?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we haven't really seen revenue from it yet, because we just launched it. But there is substantial customer interest in that capability, and I do expect it to start contributing to our revenues and revenue growth and security going forward. But the 47% year-over-year growth, that's from the products that we've have had before, and Bot Manager and the other products on the roadmap will help sustain that kind of growth rate going forward and help us grow revenues for the security products in the future.","Will V. Power - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sameet Sinha with B. Riley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Sameet Sinha - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Yes. Thank you very much. A couple of questions. In terms of the enterprise business, you just put a senior executive in place as a General Manager there. Your revenue growth is there, but its revenue levels are still pretty small. What are kind of the key success metrics that you've put in place for this business? Obviously, you've been working on it for a couple of years. At least in my opinion, it should have been, probably could have been bigger than what we had thought a couple of years back. So, if you can elaborate on that.","And the second question is, obviously, we're seeing the DIY happening at a couple of customers. What are the applications that are easy to kind of bring in-house? And in that context, can you talk about OTT, and does it have characteristics that make it very difficult to achieve in-house? Thank you.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. On the enterprise business, I think the success metrics would be around the products that we're in the process of bringing to market. So, for enterprise security that would be our recursive DNS service, which will be designed to block malware, phishing attacks and blocking exfiltration of sensitive data from the enterprise. And we'll be launching that product later this year. And so, you would look to see and we'll be looking to see the adoption rate of that capability. We'll also be bringing to market early next year our cloud connected branch product, which is enterprise networking combined with a secure web gateway functionality. And that's designed to make the enterprise network scale in a much better performing way, and in a much more cost-effective manner. And so, we would be looking to see the adoption rates there. I think the potential in both of those areas is very large, but you're right, we're at the very early stages. And we have to see how successful we are with those products in the market next year.","In terms of DIY and the top two accounts, I think you would look at things that are easier to deliver. For example, software, maybe short form VOD, videos on demand, but short form. It's not OTT. And I think as you think about OTT, I don't see that as a DIY kind of thing today. It is much harder to do, particularly in the live and linear format, particularly in the higher quality that you'll want to have when subscribers are actually paying to view the content. That's a whole different game. And there's a lot you have to do. And today Akamai is in a great position to provide that quality.","Just one example being the first broadcast of 4K, but, in general, sustaining very high bit rates, very low re-buffer rates at scale. And that's what you need for OTT delivery. And that's why a lot of the companies that are doing OTT are turning to Akamai to do it.","Sameet Sinha - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Greg Powell with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Priya Parasuraman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. This is actually Priya Parasuraman in for Greg. Just a quick one. Could you talk about the kind of traction you're seeing in the mobile performance solution set? Thank you.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, very strong traction. And we were very pleased to see that we now crossed the 1,000-customer threshold for our Ion product, which, of course, delivers the best possible performance across all your web access, but is really focused on mobile acceleration. So, very strong traction there. And, of course, that's not surprising because as we talked about today, a lot of our customers have over half of their transactions going to mobile devices. It is a particularly challenging area for performance, particularly when a mobile device is using a cellular network, and ironically that's where users expect to get the best performance. And so, I think, that's why so many enterprises are turning to Akamai and buying Ion for their mobile assets.","Priya Parasuraman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Tom Barth - Head-Investor Relations","Okay. This is Tom. I think we have time for one more question, operator.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Van Rhee with Craig-Hallum. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Great. Just made it. One real quick one for you. Sales capacity at the end of the year, how are you thinking about sales capacity additions for 2016?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think we've shared before that when we started investing in a very, very significant way in sales a couple years ago, we were providing kind of ongoing updates around how we were doing. And then, I think what we said is that, it's kind of run rate now in the business. And that it's not noteworthy to be talking about investments of a specific amount in any particular area. You can expect that we'll continue to kind of make investments across all areas of the business, including go-to-market capability.","Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Got it. Okay. Thanks.","Tom Barth - Head-Investor Relations","Well, thank you, Jeff. And thank you everyone for actually a very good set of questions this quarter.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time.","As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would like to turn the conference over to Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Please begin.","Tom Barth - Head-Investor Relations","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. And we appreciate you joining us for Akamai's second quarter 2016 earnings conference call.","Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Benson, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.","Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on July 26, 2016. And Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances.","As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found in the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of our website.","And with that, please let me turn the call over to Tom.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. Q2 was another solid quarter for Akamai, with continued strong growth for our Cloud Security Solutions and excellent performance for both earnings and free cash flow. Revenue in the second quarter was $572 million, up 6% year-over-year. Non-GAAP EPS for Q2 was $0.64 per diluted share, up 12% year-over-year. And free cash flow was $165 million in the second quarter, bringing the total free cash flow for the first half of the year to $273 million, which is more than double the total for the first half of 2015.","As we discussed on past calls, our overall revenue growth rate is unusually low this year, because of the do-it-yourself, or DIY, efforts of two of our largest customers. As these customers deliver more of their content themselves, it has meant less revenue for Akamai. In Q2, these two customers accounted for a little over 5% of our total revenue, down from 12% in Q2 of last year.","I know that some of you have expressed concern about the broader impact of DIY on our business. And so I'd like to take a few minutes now to address the subject. While any company could, in theory, try to build their own CDN, doing so is a very expensive endeavor that I believe is simply not practical for the vast majority of our customers. In addition to the cost, it's also very difficult to build a CDN that has anywhere near the scalability, quality and security provided by Akamai. And so large-scale DIY is generally only attempted by the Internet's largest media and infrastructure companies. For the most part, we've been successful in competing with DIY efforts by offering much better performance, scale, and security at a favorable price point.","There are numerous companies, including some of the world's largest, who have gone through the effort to build their own CDN and then subsequently turned to Akamai because of our superior quality and cost. Several years ago, many of the world's leading carriers had DIY CDNs, whereas today, most of them rely on Akamai for the majority of their CDN needs. Examples include AT&T, Bell Canada, China Telecom, Deutsche Telekom, Korea Telecom, Orange, Rogers, Singtel, Telecom Italia, Telef\u00f3nica, Telstra, T-Systems and T\u00fcrk Telekom.","Overall, I believe that our risk of future revenue loss from DIY is confined to a few of the Internet's largest infrastructure and platform companies. For example, companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Netflix. Most of these companies spend large sums of money on infrastructure and some consider CDN to be a core part of their platform. All are well known to have DIY capabilities and all are Akamai customers.","In aggregate, these six companies accounted for less than 11% of our total revenue in Q2, down from 18% in Q2 of last year. As you know, most of this reduction was from the two customers that we have talked about on past calls. To be clear, I'm not talking about these six companies now, because I think they're going to go away. Quite the contrary. We believe there are substantial opportunities for revenue growth in these companies over the longer term. And to the extent that there are further declines in revenues from these companies in the near term, we expect them to be more moderate than what we have experienced in the past year.","While the near term concern about DIY and our largest few customers is understandable, I think it's important for you to know that the core of our business is large and growing at a very healthy rate. For example, if you exclude the contribution of these six companies, Akamai revenue in Q2 was well over $0.5 billion and growing at a rate of 15% year-over-year. As a result of this core strength and the limited future exposure in our largest accounts, we anticipate that our overall revenue growth rate will begin to reaccelerate as we enter 2017.","Of course, whenever there is a lull in revenue growth, it can put pressure on margins. And while we're always careful with how we spend our OpEx, I want to assure that we will continue to invest in innovation and the development of new products to address the needs of our customers. As we look to the future, we see multiple opportunities for significant growth as more high-quality video moves online, billions more mobile devices enter the market, the number, scale and sophistication of cyber-attacks continues to rise, and as enterprise applications continue to move into the cloud.","We believe that each of these trends provides significant tailwinds for Akamai. For example, in the Media Division, our OTT business has continued to grow at a rapid rate, following the record breaking results of the Super Bowl and March Madness in Q1, Akamai delivered a very successful Euro 2016. In addition to providing very high video quality in countries throughout Europe and North America, we set a new record for Internet traffic for a single sporting event, during the final round match between Portugal and France, demonstrating once again Akamai's ability to deliver live, broadcast-quality content reliably and securely at scale.","Next week, we'll begin delivering the Rio Olympics over the Internet for 50 customers and partners around the world. Our award-winning broadcast operation control center will be used to ensure the utmost in quality for broadcasters, many of whom will be leveraging our accelerated ingest and client technologies as well as our 4K and virtual reality solutions.","Our Web Division also performed well in Q2. We were especially pleased with the continued strong growth of our Cloud Security business. The revenue from our Cloud Security products grew 42% year-over-year and exited Q2 with an annualized run rate of over $360 million. This is a significant accomplishment, given that we started this business only four years ago. And it serves as an example of what we hope to achieve with other new product lines as we continue to invest in innovation to make the Internet fast, reliable, and secure for our customers.","Along these lines, our new Bot Manager solution is off to an excellent start, with many customers already under contract and hundreds more in the pipeline. Bot Manager allows our customers to distinguish bots from real users and also to tailor their response based on the type of bot that is accessing their website. This is especially important in the context of reservation systems and identity theft. The highly differentiated value proposition for this new product has been driving higher price points, which will potentially translate into significant revenue as we grow its market presence over the next few years.","Later this year, we expect to release into beta our first enterprise threat protection product, which is designed to block access to malicious sites that support phishing, propagate malware, or aid in the exfiltration of confidential data. This new enterprise service will be powered by our AnswerX technology, which is already used in over 50 million homes worldwide to protect clients from undesirable Web content.","We're excited about the potential for our new line of enterprise products, which we believe has an even larger long-term market than our existing market for protecting websites and applications. In the area of Web Performance, we're looking forward to the beta release of Ion 3 in September. Ion 3 is focused on improving performance for mobile devices and especially for mobile apps. A variety of new technologies are used to improve performance, including innovative algorithms to predict what content a user is likely to request and then pre-staging much of that content on the user's device. So that when the request is made, the response appears instantly.","We're also excited about the upcoming launch of Image Manager next month. Image Manager automatically optimizes the version of an image that is sent to each user based on the user's device, browser type, and network conditions. As a result, page download times are much faster, especially in congested cellular networks. Early customer feedback on Image Manager has been very positive with one early adopter reporting a 10% increase in conversion rates as a result of the performance improvement.","In summary, I believe that Akamai's business and market position remains strong and I'm excited about the significant opportunities for growth that lie ahead. So much so that I will be extending my personal stock buyback program, which I announced in Q1, to continue at a rate of $1 million per month for the rest of the year.","I will now turn the call over to Jim to review our Q2 financial results and to provide the outlook for Q3. Jim?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I get into the details of our Q2 financial results, given recent investor focus on the impact of DIY among two of our largest customers and concern about the broader impact of DIY on our business, we will now expand our disclosures to include the combined revenue contribution of the six large Internet platform customers that Tom mentioned a few minutes ago.","This additional revenue information is intended to help you ring-fence the potential future exposure of DIY from this class of customers and to better assess the health of our business overall. There's also the potential that these large Internet platform customers continue to grow with us. The revenue contribution of these customers as a group can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.","And now, on to the second quarter financial results. Q2 revenue came in at $572 million, up 6% year-over-year and up 15% if you exclude the six large Internet platform customers that Tom mentioned. Revenue came in slightly below the midpoint of our guidance range, primarily due to less-than-expected media traffic from one of these customers.","Turning to our solution categories, revenue from our Performance and Security Solutions was $327 million in the quarter, up 16% year-over-year. Within the solution category, we saw solid growth across the major product lines, and as Tom mentioned, we continue to see significant growth and demand for our Cloud Security offerings.","Second quarter revenue for our Cloud Security Solutions was $87 million, up 42% year-over-year. Exiting Q2, our Security business now has an annualized revenue run rate of over $360 million. We are pleased with how well our unique and differentiated Cloud Security capabilities are being adopted by our customers. And our recently launched BOT Manager offering is the latest example of how we are innovating to expand our security portfolio to meet strong customer demand.","Turning to our Media Delivery Solutions, revenue was $197 million in the quarter, down 9% year-over-year and slightly less than our expectations, reflecting lower traffic and revenue volume from one of the six large Internet platform customers. Media Delivery revenue outside of the six large Internet platform customers continued to be solid, up 11% year-over-year with particularly strong growth among our over-the-top, or OTT, customers.","Finally, revenue from our Services and Support Solutions was $48 million in the quarter, up 18% year-over-year. We continue to see strong service attachment rates for our higher-end enterprise class professional services, particularly for customers buying our Web Performance and Cloud Security products.","Turning now to our customer division results, and as we shared in our last call, we are now managing the company in a customer division structure that integrates the development, product management, marketing and sales teams into three divisions for focus on the company's Media, Web, and Enterprise and Carrier products and customers. Under this division construct, revenue from our Media Division customers was $288 million in the quarter, down 2% year-over-year, but up a healthy 14%, excluding the impact of the six large Internet platform customers.","Revenue from our Web Division customers was $271 million, up 15% year-over-year. We continue to see solid growth in this customer base, particularly with our Cloud Security offerings. Lastly, revenue from our emerging Enterprise and Carrier Division customers was $12 million in the quarter, up 22% year-over-year.","Moving on to our geographies, sales in our international markets represented 31% of total revenue in Q2, up 1 point from Q1. International revenue was $177 million in the quarter, up 25% year-over-year, or up 24% in constant currency. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a positive impact on revenue of $1 million on a year-over-year basis and $4 million on a sequential basis. We continue to see very strong growth in our Asia Pacific geography.","Second quarter revenue from our U.S. market was $395 million, down 1% year-over-year. The large Internet platform customers are based in the United States and weighed heavily on the U.S. market's results. Outside of these customers, revenue growth was solid across the rest of the business.","Moving on to costs, cash gross margin was 76%, down 1 point from Q1 levels and from the same period last year and in line with our guidance. GAAP gross margin, which includes depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 64%, down 2 points from the prior quarter and down 3 points from the same period last year. GAAP operating expenses were $256 million in the second quarter. These GAAP results include items such as depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related charges and other non-recurring items. Excluding these items, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $202 million, up slightly from Q1 levels and $4 million below the low end of our guidance as we continue to responsively balance investments in the business with the moderations in revenue growth rates.","Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $231 million, down $3 million from Q1 levels and up $17 million from the same period last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 40%, down 1 point from Q1 levels, consistent with the same period last year and in line with our guidance. GAAP depreciation and amortization expenses were $85 million in the second quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation associated with stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of capitalized interest expense. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP depreciation was $74 million, up $4 million from Q1 levels and in line with our guidance.","Non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter was $157 million, down $7 million from Q1 and up $6 million from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 27%, down 1.5 points from Q1 levels, down 1 point from the same period last year, and in line with our guidance.","Moving on to other income and expense items, interest income for the second quarter was roughly $3 million, consistent with Q1 levels. Non-cash interest expense related to our convertible debt was roughly $5 million. As a reminder, this non-cash expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results.","Moving on to earnings, GAAP net income for the second quarter was $74 million or $0.42 of earnings per diluted share, up 14% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $112 million or $0.64 of earnings per diluted share, up 12% year-over-year and near the high-end of our guidance range. For the quarter, total taxes included in our GAAP earnings were $36 million based on an effective tax rate of 33%. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $49 million based on an effective tax rate of 30% and just slightly above our guidance.","Finally, our weighted average diluted share count for the second quarter was 176 million shares, down 1 million shares due to our opportunistic increase in share buyback activity and in line with our guidance.","Now I'll review some balance sheet items. Day sales outstanding for the second quarter was 58 days, down two days from Q1 levels. Capital expenditures in Q2, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $87 million or 15% of revenue, below the low-end of our guidance for the quarter. 15% is also slightly below our long-term model as we continue to monitor traffic levels and invest in network expansion accordingly. As a reminder, this CapEx number also includes capitalized software development activities.","Cash flow generation continued to be very strong in Q2. Free cash flow was $165 million in the second quarter or 29% of revenue and $273 million year-to-date or 24% of revenue. Our balance sheet also remains very healthy, with $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on hand at the end of the quarter. If you factor in our convertible debt, our net cash is approximately $910 million.","During the quarter we spent $91 million on share repurchases, buying back roughly 1.7 million shares. As of Q2 end, we had approximately $870 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. And as we've discussed in the past, our overall aim is to deploy our capital to achieve favorable returns for our investors in a manner that we believe is in the best long-term interest of the company and our shareholders. Given our strong balance sheet and cash generation, our share repurchase authorization is intended to continue our multi-year capital allocation plan to offset dilution from our equity compensation plans and to provide us with the flexibility to opportunistically return more cash to shareholders, depending upon business and market conditions.","Looking ahead to Q3, we are anticipating media traffic and revenue volumes from one of our large Internet platform customers to decline further in the third quarter. And while we see a traffic and revenue volume uptick in Q3 for the Olympics, we expect traffic patterns outside of this event to be consistent with what we have seen historically during the mid-summer months. Specifically, lower traffic volumes as people spend less time on the Internet.","Given these dynamics, we anticipate a further sequential decline in our Media business in Q3, but we remain bullish on the longer-term secular trends for this business going forward. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact on revenue of roughly $1 million sequentially and a positive impact of $2 million compared to Q3 of last year.","Factoring in all of these items I just outlined, we are expecting Q3 revenue in the range of $566 million to $578 million. At the midpoint of this range, year-over-year revenue growth would moderate to 4%. And while we're not providing specific guidance beyond Q3, we do believe revenue growth will reaccelerate entering 2017. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of 76% and GAAP gross margins of 64%, consistent with Q2 levels. Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $206 million to $212 million.","As I have mentioned on the past couple of calls, we have purposefully slowed down the rate and pace of head count addition and discretionary spending to align with our near-term top line growth expectations. However, even with the revenue deceleration we're experiencing, we believe it is important to continue to invest for the future. Most notably in incremental R&D product innovation aimed at fueling long-term growth and scale.","Accordingly, we anticipate our lower revenue volumes in the near term will likely put some pressure on our EBITDA margin profile. We anticipate Q3 EBITDA margins in the range of 39% to 40%. As I have said in the past, one of the factors that could impact our EBITDA margin profile would be revenue volumes, particularly in the Media business. And while I am not providing specific guidance beyond Q3, EBITDA margins may dip into the high 30%s for the near term.","Moving on to depreciation, we expect Q3 non-GAAP depreciation expense to be $76 million to $78 million. Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 26% to 27% for Q3. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q3 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.59 to $0.62. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $44 million to $47 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of 30%. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 175 million shares.","On CapEx, we expect to spend approximately $85 million to $93 million in the quarter, excluding equity compensation. And we anticipate remaining slightly under our long-term model of 16% to 18% of revenue for the year.","In closing, despite some near-term challenges, we remain confident in our ability to reaccelerate growth rates for the business, execute on our long-term strategy, and continue to deliver a compelling financial model for our shareholders.","Thank you, and Tom and I would like to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The first question is from Michael Bowen of Pacific Crest. Your line is open.","Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities","Okay. Thank you very much. One point of clarification, I just wanted to make sure, we're going through it pretty fast there. But with regard to what you said about Media was up 11% in the current quarter, excluding, and I want to say, did you say the big two or the big six? And I've got a follow-up.","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. No, what I said was that Media's up 11% excluding the big six Internet platform companies.","Just to clarify on that, we're trying to provide this as a grouping to be helpful to the investors. We know that there's been concern about the impact of DIY, and so what we've tried to do is ring-fence this customer grouping that people are focused on. And based on some of the reasons that Tom outlined, and if you exclude this grouping that is really the focus of investor concerns around DIY, one, Akamai's business was a $500 million business in the quarter, growing 15% excluding these guys.","So it's a very, very large and growing business. It just so happens that as we're going through a \u2013 for a couple of these six customers, as they serve more of the traffic themselves, we're seeing a moderation in Media growth rates. But, as we said, we expect that going into 2017, that we will see a reacceleration.","Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities","And then maybe if I could just dig a little deeper, if I may. So with regard to the big six, first of all, are all of the big six just in the Media segment? Or do they bleed over into the other segments? And then, given that you had \u2013 I want to say it was 10% and 11% ex the big two for the Media segment, is there any way you can extrapolate for us? Or would you divulge what that is excluding the big two as far as the growth rate?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, yeah, I think what we'd rather do is group the customers as one grouping. So that you can see the growth rates excluding all these large six Internet platform customers. And your first question was whether or not these customers are only purchasing Media products. They're predominantly customers that buy Media products. A couple of them also buy our other solutions, but they're predominantly Media customers.","Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities","Okay. Then last question I'll just squeeze in, and thanks for that color.","Tom Barth - Head-Investor Relations","Mike...","Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities","With regard to \u2013 yes?","Tom Barth - Head-Investor Relations","Why don't we put you back in the queue there. That's four. So...","Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities","Okay. Got it.","Tom Barth - Head-Investor Relations","All right. Thanks.","Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Gray Powell of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thank you very much for taking the questions. So, obviously, gross margins have been under pressure this year. I'm sensing that's merely a function of the lower traffic volumes and the relatively fixed data center and infrastructure components of your cost of goods sold. So as traffic growth starts to improve at some point, should we expect that to offset your excess capacity and gross margins to improve sometime over the next six months to 12 months?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I'm not going to provide guidance beyond the quarter, but I think you're thinking about it the right way that there is a fair amount fixed cost infrastructure that you build out. And obviously, we are still doing some build-out to support things like the Euro event that Tom mentioned, build out to support the Olympics and things of that nature. But I think it's probably worth noting that that's one of the reasons why you're seeing our CapEx levels lower. Our CapEx levels are probably going to be below our long-term model.","Last year our CapEx levels were above our long-term model, because we were doing some build-out for what we thought was going to be an OTT offering. So kind of look at them together that you're going to have some years where you may be a little bit above. If you believe that you're going to be building out your network to support expected traffic growth. We happen to be in a period here where we're growing into the traffic we have and selectively deploying in areas that we don't have capacity.","Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. And then, just one follow-up. In the past when there's been excess capacity, how long has it taken for traffic growth to fill in and for everything to stabilize?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It depends. You know that not all traffic is the same. It depends upon the region. There are certain regions where traffic is growing very, very fast and we need to continue to do more build-out. There are other regions where you potentially have excess capacity and you have to grow into it. So it varies, and it depends upon different events that are going to occur. Again, you can have excess capacity, but you grow into it with an event like the Olympics. So it varies by geography. But we tend to do build-outs, probably, call it, three months to four months in advance. So that's generally one way to think about it, that we'll obviously modulate the network CapEx investments based on what traffic projections we see over the next, call it, three months to six months.","Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Jonathan Schildkraut of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Michael Hart - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. This is Michael Hart on the line for Jonathan. We were wondering if you could perhaps provide a little more color about some of the opportunities you're seeing with partnerships such as the announcement \u2013 your partnership with Microsoft and how Akamai is being integrated into Azure offerings. And then, also, I was wondering if you could provide a little more color on what impact to your Performance and Security revenue the new product offerings you discussed might have later this year, and then, perhaps looking into next year. Thank you.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let me take the first part of that. We're very happy with the new relationship with Azure and Microsoft. Now you can purchase Akamai whole site delivery for your Azure applications by checking the box. And also, Microsoft's field force is reselling Akamai capabilities across the board. So very pleased to see that happen. And, Jim, you want to take the revenue question?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Obviously, for new offerings like this, for the most part these offerings are subscription offerings. So once you have them, you have to sell them into your installed base, and then it takes a while to convert them into revenue. So they're not going to be a meaningful contributor to revenue in 2016.","They certainly will contribute to revenue in 2017, but given the annuity nature of the business and the time to revenue for some of these things, it takes a while. But I think Tom's bigger point for these is, it wasn't that many years ago that we didn't have a security business. We launched a security business and we introduced a product Kona Site Defender. We then acquired Prolexic and we've expanded since then. That business, call it, four-and-a-half years later is now a $360 million business.","I think what Tom's referring to is these are new offerings that we're going to add. And in the case of BOT Manager, it's an offering that has similar ARPUs as some of our other security products. And so we believe it's going to be a very strong contributor to security growth in the near term. And the same is true for the offering that Tom mentioned in the Web Performance family, that these are adjacent \u2013 Ion 3 obviously is an improvement to our existing product, but Image Manager is obviously an extension to the offerings that we already have. So these offerings, I think, are going to help fuel growth in security and help reaccelerate growth in our Web Performance products.","Michael Hart - Evercore Group LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Michael Turits of Raymond James. Your line is open.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. Just some clarification. You said, Jim, I think you said that you'd see reacceleration of growth in 1Q of 2017. Currently, the Street actually had you reaccelerating, obviously, now in 3Q and then further into 4Q. So the simple math, then, is that we're going to see 4% \u2013 no more than 4% again in fourth quarter?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. We're not specifically providing guidance. But you are right that based on those comments that \u2013 and the reason we didn't call for growth acceleration in the fourth quarter is we've been very clear with you guys in the past that the fourth quarter is heavily dependent upon holiday seasonality. And we didn't want to call acceleration in Q4 knowing that it's uncertain what holiday seasonality is going to be. I think our confidence that we will see reacceleration in Q1 is very high.","But I'd say, Q4, it depends upon the holiday season. And if we have a very, very strong holiday season, both on the Media side and on the Web side, yeah, you may see reacceleration in Q4. But I'd say our confidence is very high for entering 2017, and that there's a possibility in the fourth quarter depending upon how the holiday shakes out.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","And then, if I can get a follow-up, Jim. The customer that you said would be reducing its traffic, and I assume you meant dollars, too, in 3Q, is that one in the same \u2013 one of the top two that we were talking about? Because that's what I wondered. If it's not...","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. Yes it is.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","So it is one of the top two. So that it still continues.","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's right. So as we mentioned in the last call that we had signaled that our visibility to traffic and revenue volumes for these, in particular, the top two customers is certainly greater in three months than it is in six months to nine months. And this particular customer's traffic and revenue was a little bit softer in Q2 than what we expected. And we are now projecting that that's going to be the case in the third quarter as well. It is probably important to note we've been in \u2013 we're trying to provide additional information for the sake of helpfulness that \u2013 of the top two customers, one of the top two is pretty much in line with where we thought.","It's just one of them that's a little bit lower \u2013 the traffic volume. That customer tends to introduce a bunch of features on their platform. And it's difficult to predict the adoption rate that they have of their end users. And so traffic came in a little bit lighter than we expected. And we're calling that now for Q3. And while we're not providing guidance beyond Q3 that I'd say that particular customer is a customer that we're going to stay pretty close to as far as where do we think traffic volumes are going to go longer term.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Am I done or do I get another question?","Tom Barth - Head-Investor Relations","Michael, we'll put you in the back end of the queue here.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks, guys.","Tom Barth - Head-Investor Relations","We've got a long list. Thank you, though. Yep.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. This is Sanjit Singh for Keith Weiss. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to revisit your comments on the potential for acceleration in 2017. Is that just a function that the comps are going to be easier? Because some of the catalysts that you have this year in terms of supporting traffic in 2016, you guys mentioned the Euro Cup, we have the Olympics. That doesn't happen next year. So I wanted to parse out the case for acceleration in 2017, given that some of these events are falling off in 2016.","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think you've got part of it. Obviously, we believe that what we're seeing with these large Internet platform customers, the top six that we talked about, and notably, we're really talking about two of the six that we've seen more substantial revenue declines. As Tom mentioned, we see more traffic in revenue pulled off of our platform in the last few quarters. Our expectation going forward is that if we do see declines, the declines will be much more modest than what they've been.","So, yes, there will be a component of it that is an easier comp with these large customers. I think it's also fair to say that while we have marquee events like the Euro Cup, like the Olympics, like a presidential debate, and they do contribute to some level of revenue. As we said in the past, these events by themselves are not huge needle movers on revenue. They just happen to be proof points around what's \u2013 the opportunity is for more and more consumption of content online. And that's really more what they represent than anything else.","So, yes, you're not going to have as big an event period, but you're going to have other traffic activity just in general. There's going to be more video delivery consumed. There will continue to be more consumption of social media, there will continue to be more gaming releases, there will continue to be more software downloads. And all of those will be contributors to our ability to get revenue reaccelerating.","Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","In relation to that, you guys mentioned that OTT is starting to ramp for you guys. Is there any way to frame how much of a contributor the OTT business is having on your underlying growth rate? Maybe that growth rate of \u2013 that 15% ex the top two. How much of a contributor is OTT today to that underlying growth rate?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. It's a difficult thing to size that \u2013 I'd say what we tried to do is \u2013 because we have many customers that tend to do multifunction activities that they serve videos as well as doing other things \u2013 like they actually serve software downloads. But based on the customer grouping that call it our pure play, pure play video delivery over the top customers that \u2013 it's not a huge contributor to revenue in the near term. It just isn't. What we're seeing is steady growth in that customer base in the traffic. Steady growth in revenue.","But you have not seen a step function move to viewing content via those platforms. They are growing steadily. They're growing nicely, but there has not been a catalyst yet to see a huge movement of people cutting the cord and moving online. So I think they'll be a steady grower. But today, the larger contributors to revenue in the Media business are still software download customers, gaming, and social media.","Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is from James Breen of William Blair. Your line is open.","Jim D. Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking the question. In terms of visibility on the large customers that obviously \u2013 it's weighing on the stock the most. How far out can you see with those 10 (sic) [6] (41:12) customers in terms of the predictability of the revenue into the forward quarter? Obviously, the guidance for this quarter \u2013 for the third quarter is lower than what the Street was. How lumpy is that potentially going forward?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. It's six customers, not 10.","Jim D. Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Sorry.","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And I would say, like I've said all along, that our visibility is certainly much better in the three-month window. We do have good relationships with all of these customers. And so you have some visibility about what's going to happen thereafter. But it's certainly less. We certainly know that these customers intend to remain loyal Akamai customers. The question is how much of the traffic do they continue to serve themselves and how much of the traffic do we serve? It also depends upon, for some of these customers, new capabilities that they introduce. There may be newer capabilities that they introduce that their CDN cannot support.","So it's very possible that you see a reacceleration in this customer base. Not all these customers are trending downward. It's notable with two of them, but even one of these two, but depending upon launching new offerings, could be a reacceleration in growth for that customer as well. So it's tough to call. It depends upon decisions that they make in their company around things that they're going to introduce and the capabilities that they have and don't have. So I know it's not the answer that you want. But I think it's \u2013 that's just a fact that our visibility is pretty good near term. Good relationships with these customers for the long term, but the ability to call a specific number in 2017 and beyond is just \u2013 is difficult.","Jim D. Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Is some of this visibility consumer-driven based on consumer usage patterns, so even the companies your customers don't really understand it until the end of the quarter for them?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's funny you say that. Many times these big customers come to us and our ability to project what's happening with traffic is better than theirs, because you're really anticipating what happens to their end users. And sometimes we have better intelligence on that based on historical levels than they do. But there's a bunch of variables that contribute to that, plus it's also capabilities that they introduce and what their CDN can and can't do.","Jim D. Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC","(43:45) previously you talked about the two largest customers being in the 6% of revenue range. Might that be something closer to 4% now while those six customers all be sort of less than 2% of revenue?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So those customers, as Tom mentioned, were a little over 5%, maybe like 5.5% in Q2. As I said in the last call, it's hard to predict a percentage because a percentage is based on what the company does in aggregate. So I do expect that those two customers are certainly, given that one of them we think is going to actually move and serve more of the traffic themselves, I do think they will be less than 5%. A specific number is tough to call, as I said because I don't know what the rest of the business is going to do, but, call it, roughly in that range is probably where they'll be.","Jim D. Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is from Mike Olson of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","All right. Thanks. Sorry, I'll keep beating this horse here. I doubt you want to get too granular. But before it sounded like the primary reduction in revenue from the big six companies was really just from those two largest customers, so are you seeing that decline extend further into the other four of the big six? Are they all declining? Or are some of them actually still growing?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, some of them are growing. As I said before, just to clarify, we grouped these customers for the reasons that Tom outlined. We know there's concern about DIY. We know these customers are well-known to have DIY. And we wanted to make sure that we were helpful to the investor community around ring-fencing, what was concern about what these large customers could do. That's why, we've done that. It doesn't mean that they're all trending in the wrong direction by any means.","And while they all have DIY capability, several of them are increasing their use of Akamai over time. But, as you know, with large customers, large customers go through reprices. Large customers \u2013 there's a lot of things that affect large customers. But I would say that notably two of the six are serving more of the traffic themselves. One of the six in particular. The other ones have been, over the past, very healthy and growing Akamai customers. And so I think that you're going to have in that grouping a mix bag of customers that are growing and customers that may not be growing.","Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Okay. And then you mentioned that EBITDA margins may be somewhat capped and more in the high 30%s for some period of time. Would that be alleviated if we see revenue growth reaccelerate in the first half of 2017? Or is there a reason why that lower EBITDA margin target would extend beyond the end of this year?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. It all depends on revenue volumes. And it all depends upon how much the volumes uptick. The reason I signal that in the near term we may need to operate in the high 30%s is that we're making the right investments in the business. And what we're not going to do is we're not going to constrain investment. We're going to be responsible, of course, to try to manage investments in line with the revenue moderation but we're going to make the investments we believe are right for the long term trajectory of the business. And if it so happens, the revenue volumes are a little bit lower then we could be in the high 30%s for the near term.","But, again, as I said in the past operating at the model that we've outlined, which is the low 40%s, is dependent upon revenue volumes, is dependent upon possible M&A, and is dependent upon network build-outs that we do in particular. So those things are still all the same. We happen to be going through revenue volume that is a little bit less than we had expected. And we're not going to stop making the investments that we think are necessary.","Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is from Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. So I'm going to ask questions similar to what have already been asked, but slightly different. You mentioned that these top six customers represented about 18% of revenues a year ago, now about 11% and the top two, I think, were about 12% a year ago, and now 5%, so both of those the delta's about 7%. So it seems like the remaining four of the big six, if you will, have been growing roughly in line with that of the company, which this quarter was about 6%. So for those other big four, that 6% growth, is that a deceleration over the last few quarters? Or is 6% growth relatively what they've been growing at?","And, I guess, where I'm going here is, if it is a deceleration, which would be my guess, the concern is obviously that's going to go further down. And it goes back to all these questions around visibility. I appreciate that for 2017 you think growth's going to accelerate, but it sounds like it's based more on easy comps and the fact that these two top customers are getting to a point where they can't go that much lower, at least that one in particular. What can you give us in terms of confidence or conviction that these other big four just aren't going to continue to see their own growth slowing? Thanks.","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, we have very good relationships with those customers. Generally, we have pretty good visibility. Obviously one of the six did decelerate a little bit more than we expected this quarter. We're now forecasting that for Q3 as well. We do very valuable services for these large customers. Some of them have had their own do-it-yourself solution for a decade. And we have grown share against it. So I think we did not \u2013 as I said before, we did not introduce these six in any way to concern you that we think there's a problem there.","We did it because we know you're concerned about those kinds of companies. And we wanted to reassure you that the impact they have on our business is small. And in fact, for many of them, there is substantial upside to the business. And I think that the key thing to focus on is that we have outside of that group, there's potential in that group for growth. But outside of that group, we have a $0.5 billion business growing at 15% a year with a very rich product road map that I think will propel growth into the future.","So, again, to reiterate, the fact that we're talking about six is not because we think there's major problems in those six. It's simply to talk about that class of customers. And so you can understand exactly where we're getting our revenues and how we're doing.","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, I guess, my follow-up question then, is regarding some of those big six \u2013 or top six, some of them actually offer their own CDN businesses, particularly the Amazons, the Googles, and the Microsofts, and I appreciate the partnership with Microsoft, in particular. But is there also something (51:11) here that those guys are also not just limiting their business with Akamai, but also potentially becoming increasingly more competitive as well?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, I don't think so. We have competed with those companies' CDNs for a long, long time. In at least one case for probably close to a decade. We compete very successfully even with their in-house business. And that's because we provide a higher level of quality, greater scale, greater reliability, and, of course, security. So this is not a new phenomenon. We've been competing very successfully against these companies' offers for a long time. And I expect that we will continue to compete successfully against them in the future.","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jim Shaughnessy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking our question. This is Jim Shaughnessy on for Mark. Again, just on the top six, is there any way you could give us some context around the size of these top six customers roughly? And maybe the next tier of customers? How much bigger are these customers to you in terms of size versus, say, that next tier? And I have one follow-up. Thanks.","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, as you know, the two that we've been talking about are now a little over 5% of our revenue. And two of the other four are pretty small Akamai customers, but are big Internet entities. And so we did want to talk about that. I think there's upside in those accounts. And then, there's two more that are substantial Akamai customers. Well over 1% of our revenue. So you have four that are pretty large and you have two that are pretty small in terms of their impact on Akamai.","Jim Shaughnessy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks. And then a quick follow-up. In terms of upcoming renewals with any of these top six, have any recently taken place? And are there any upcoming, say, in the next few quarters that we should keep an eye out for? Thanks, guys.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. You want to think about these customers as coming up for renewal every one to two years is very typical. So we have experienced \u2013 some of them have had renewals recently. And we would expect renewals coming up over the next quarter or two. So that's an ongoing process with really all of our customers and these folks as well.","Jim Shaughnessy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Ed Maguire of CLSA. Your line is open.","Ed Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. I was wondering if you could provide a bit more context into the specific types of media traffic where you're seeing the insourcing activity and whether that's coming across all of the top six.","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The insourcing of traffic is mostly around files where quality matters less and then it's easier to do. The extreme example being a background software download. At the other end of the spectrum, you might have live or linear broadcast where somebody's paying to watch it.","And so as you get to the easier end of the spectrum, that's where I would say most of the traffic has moved in-house, software downloads and so forth or some videos where the quality might matter less. On the other side of the house, and as we talked about, our OTT business is growing very well, much faster than the Media business as a whole. And that's because you have \u2013 it's more difficult to do with a high-quality level, especially live and linear. And people are often paying to watch it. And so you really want to have a good experience there.","Ed Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC","Great. And could you comment on just the state of the sales force pipeline productivity rates and in particular, your degree of confidence around the pipeline and growth expectations for the second half of 2016 as it pertains to security and also performance as well? Thanks.","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Right. Customers in the pipeline wouldn't be signed until later in the year. Then, of course, there's the integration and recognition of revenue. So you wouldn't start seeing a revenue stream from anything in the pipeline until next year. That said, the sales force has been productive. Bookings have been very strong. And so we're optimistic about the future growth there. Particularly in Cloud Security, a lot of the customers are now buying products first based on security and then adding performance. It's great to see that adoption of our security offer in the business.","Ed Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks, guys. Just following up on a previous question. It does seem like the big six now are building out a lot more of their own cloud capabilities, and some seem to be bundling in a little bit more CDN. So, Tom, it just seems to be different competition from what we've had in the past. I know Google, their CDN is in beta. Akamai's had their CDN out there for a while. I guess, you're obviously not concerned about competition from them, and a lot of investors are. Can you maybe tell us a little bit more detail why you're not concerned? Then are they really just competing on the Media side? Or do they also have Performance and Security applications out there or capabilities? Thanks.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I'm concerned about all our competitors. That said, we see much more competition from dozens of other companies than generally we would have from the large cloud providers. Our performance is a lot better. We don't really see the competition at all from them with the security product capabilities. It's primarily around delivery. We've been competing against at least one very large cloud company for nearly a decade that is known to bundle in CDN services.","We have a lot of our customers use that company for hosting their website, either it's stored there or with compute, and they use Akamai to accelerate \u2013 to provide the delivery of the video or accelerate the delivery of applications or to secure the content. So I don't see any change in terms of the competition from these large Internet infrastructure companies against Akamai. So no change there.","Now, for their own content, as we've talked about at great length, there's a couple of them that are delivering more of their own content. And that, of course, has had the impact on our overall revenue growth rates this year. But in terms of competing with other third parties, no. No change there in terms of the impact they're having on our business.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","But it does seem like, too, there's been a lot of new startups out there. And are they using some of the cloud infrastructure getting built? Or there just does seem to be a lot more news articles out there. Are you seeing any more competition from these startups?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","There are a lot of startups out there. I think that's always been the case, too. They don't use the cloud providers. What we do see is the attackers, they use the cloud infrastructure. And they can mask where they're coming from to make it harder to defeat them by coming from the big cloud companies. But we see the main competition is from the folks that have been doing it for a decade. And the one big change we've seen in the competitive marketplace has really worked in our favor and that is the major carriers.","As I mentioned, several years ago, most of those major carriers competed actively against Akamai. And now the vast majority of those carriers partner with Akamai and make use of our technology. And that's been the one fundamental shift in the competitive landscape. And when I say competitive, I mean now an entity that's competing with us for third party content. So the major shift in the competitive landscape has been favorable. We've always had a lot of startups. For a long time we've had companies that have competed against us and they would be the majority of the competition. The cloud companies have been out there for, most of them for a long, long time, and no shift there. The only shift that's impacting our revenue is the DIY and a couple of large accounts, but that's not competing for third party content, and I don't expect it to.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Matthew Heinz of Stifel. Your line is open.","Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon. I guess, first off, starting with the OTT opportunity, could you just highlight some of the key factors that you think will drive a more democratized marketplace? I guess, outside of the one or two dominant platforms out there. And where, in terms of product offerings or customer segments, do you see the best traction around OTT going forward?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think there's certainly a set of aggregators and they are growing and also the broadcasters going out directly as well. That is growing. And I think right now you just see all different avenues being explored by the major content owners and broadcasters. And so I don't see right now a single offer, an aggregated offer hitting the marketplace that would take over. I think you'll see a lot of seeds planted and flowers will bloom. And both aggregation and the broadcasters going direct with their content. And we service all of those entities. We're seeing strong OTT growth among the aggregators as well as the broadcasters who are taking some of their content and making it direct.","Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then as a follow-up, can you just highlight your progress on some of the network cost initiatives that I guess have been underway for a while now? But do you expect to continue to see leverage in the colocation line \u2013 expense line? And I see server count picked up a bit again this quarter. So what should we expect going forward in terms of the server count?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, yeah, we're always working on lowering our costs to try and to get more bits per second out of each square foot of colo, out of each kilowatt hour, out of each dollar of CPU. And we have a really great track record there. A lot of initiatives underway and I expect to see continued progress.","As Jim noted, we're in a situation right now where we do have, in some geographies, capacity that's available. And so you see us in a situation where our CapEx for server purchases is a little bit less than our long term model. And as traffic growth reaccelerates \u2013 and if the traffic growth is quite strong outside of the few accounts that we've talked about, that fills up that capacity and that helps, as well. As you've got fixed cost and you have a little bit extra capacity in some markets that hurts the margins and your costs a little bit. But I think we've had good progress there. We will continue to have good progress, plenty of initiatives underway to improve efficiency.","Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much for taking the questions.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. This is (01:03:17) in for Sterling. Thanks for taking my questions. Most of my questions were asked, actually, so maybe just quickly on any impact you might see from Brexit, if you can give us more color on that both on the revenue side and the cost side that will be really helpful. Thanks.","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. There's no real direct impact from Brexit that we see at this point in time. Obviously, there's been currency fluctuations. And so that can change the foreign exchange rates. There can be impact on the equity markets, but I don't see any real impact to our business.","Operator","Thank you. And we have time for one more question. The final question will come from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks for the last question. Yeah, hi, Tom, Jim. Give us color, if you may, on how you plan to fundamentally lower the cost of Media Delivery? I hear that you have some interesting technology from Octoshape, peer-to-peer media delivery. I'd like to better understand. Is this a work-in-progress and could it potentially impact Media business margins over the next few quarters? And I have a quick follow-up.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. We're investing a great deal to substantially lower the cost of Media delivery. And that, in fact, the Octoshape acquisition, that was part of the acquisition thesis. We've been very happy with that acquisition. It also greatly improves performance at the same time. We are in the process of integrating their technology across our platform. And you will see us be delivering more of our content as we go forward from clients and client devices. In some countries, that is happening already. And it does substantially lower our cost and that enables us to pass on lower pricing for our Media customers.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And then, quickly, Tom, on enterprise security, help us understand what is Akamai's sustainable differentiation in enterprise security. We do hear that Cisco, F5 and several of the security pure-plays are quite active in enterprise security, including cloud-based security. So I wanted to understand what would be your differentiation? What different angle would you take in enterprise security? Thanks.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's a great question. And you will see as the market evolves, you have Akamai, which has expertise in the cloud, has tremendous capacity, has great performance capabilities now bringing very strong security technology into our platform. You have, on the other side, companies that have past experience in security as a box that is purchased and deployed in the enterprise's data center. That world is going away. The security technology needs to move into the cloud. And it's very hard to take technology that was dedicated to a single customer and operated by that customer in their data center and now make it in the cloud to try to make it work on a multi-tenant environment, give it sufficient capacity and make it perform well. And on top of all that make it be affordable.","So we have tremendous home field advantage in the cloud compared to the companies that are trying to figure out how to move into the cloud. And I think it's because of this that you see several of the \u2013 some of the well-known box providers now being bought by private equity or looking for ways to evolve the company, because it is hard to take what they have and produce the kind of capabilities that Akamai can now offer in the cloud.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Excellent. This has been very helpful. Thank you.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Tom Barth - Head-Investor Relations","Okay. Thank you, Latoya. And in closing, we'll be presenting at a number of investor conferences and events throughout the remainder of the quarter.

My name is Denise and I'll be the operator for today. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. ","I would now turn the conference over to Mr. Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.","Tom Barth","Thank you, Denise and good afternoon and thank you for joining Akamai's fourth quarter and year-end 2014 earnings conference call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Benson, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer. But before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the Company's view on February 10, 2015. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of our Web site. With that, let me turn the call over to Tom.","Thomson Leighton","Thanks Tom and thank you all for joining us today. Q4 was another excellent quarter for Akamai with record revenue and earnings. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $536 million, up 23% year-over-year and up 25% when adjusted for foreign exchange headwinds. Our strong revenue results continue to be driven by solid performance across all of our geographies and all of our major product lines with very strong growth coming from our security and media products.","Non-GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.70 per diluted share, up 27% year-over-year. Our higher than expected earnings were aided by the end of year reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit. The tax credit had a $0.05 benefit on non-GAAP EPS and was not included in the guidance that we provided you last quarter. ","Our strong fourth quarter results capped off another full year of outstanding financial performance for Akamai. For the full year we grew revenue to nearly $2 billion, up 24% over 2013. We generated non-GAAP net income of $449 million or $2.48 per diluted share, up 23% over 2013 million and we continue to generate strong cash flow with over $658 million of cash from operations.","I'll be back in a few minutes to talk more about the achievements and the progress that we made during 2014 as well as the opportunities that lie ahead. But first let me turn the call over to Jim to review our Q4 and full year financial results in detail and to provide the outlook for Q1. Jim?","James Benson","Thank you, Tom and good afternoon everyone. As Tom outlined Akamai continued to execute well and had a great fourth quarter, closing out yet another very strong fiscal year in 2014. Q4 revenue came in above the high end of our guidance range at $536 million, up 8% sequentially and up 23% year-over-year despite foreign exchange headwinds. Foreign exchange movements during the quarter had a negative impact on revenue of $8 million sequentially and $10 million year-over-year. Adjusted for foreign exchange, Q4 revenues grew 9% sequentially and 25% year-over-year. ","Revenue growth continued to be solid across the entire business. But the overachievement compared to our guidance was driven by exceptionally strong traffic and revenue growth in our Media Delivery solutions. I mentioned in our last call that holiday traffic would play a large role in where we would land relative to our fourth quarter guidance. And we had a tremendous burst in media related traffic in late November and December specifically. ","Media revenue $250 million in the quarter, up 21% year-over-year or up 23% on a constant currency basis. Traffic and revenue growth was solid across all geographies and most of the customer base with particularly strong growth coming from our largest and more strategic software update gaining social media and video delivery customers. ","We are very pleased with the continued strong performance of the media business and remain bullish on the secular trend for this business looking forward. At the same time we recognize that the drivers of this business mainly traffic volumes and price can lead to revenue variability from one quarter to the next, given the timing of customer renewals at lower price points, the nature, timing and size of gaming and software releases as well as the adoption of social media and video platform capabilities.","Turning now to our performance in security solutions, revenue was $240 million in the quarter, up 25% year-over-year or up 27% on a constant currency basis with balanced performance across all of our geographies. Within this solution category, we saw solid growth across all our major product lines, and as Tom mentioned, we continue to see exceptionally strong growth and demand for our cloud security solutions. Finally, revenue from our services and support solutions was $47 million in the quarter, up 28% year-over-year or up 31% on a constant currency basis. We continue to see very strong service attachment rates to our security solutions in particular.","Turning now to our geographies. Revenue growth continued to be strong across all three major theaters. Sales in our international markets represented 26% of total revenue in Q4, down 1 point from the prior quarter. International revenue was $139 million in the quarter, up 16% year-over-year, or up 24% adjusted for foreign exchange. We saw solid growth in both our Asia-Pacific and EMEA markets despite continued macroeconomic headwinds. Revenue from our U.S. market was $397 million, up 26% year-over-year with solid performance across all solution categories, but most notably media. Most of this core [ph] total revenue over achievement compared to our guidance came from the U.S. where our largest software update, gaming, social media and video delivery customers reside. ","And finally, revenue through channel partners represented 25% of total revenue in Q4, consistent with Q3 levels. This revenue mix is also in line with what we saw throughout 2014, driven by traction with our carrier partners in particular, as well as contribution from Prolexic's channel relationships. We expect these positive trends to continue into 2015 as a result of our ongoing investments in the channel business.","Moving on to costs, cash gross margin was 79%, up 1 point from both Q3 and the same period last year and in line with our guidance. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation was 70%, up 2 points from Q3 and up 1 point from the same period last year and slightly above our guidance as we continue to execute well against our platform efficiency initiatives.","GAAP operating expenses were $237 million in the fourth quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges and acquisition related charges. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $193 million up $50 million from Q3 levels, slightly above our guidance primarily due to increased year-end commission and bonus cost associated with higher than expected revenue.","Adjusted-EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $232 million, up $19 million from Q3 levels and up $40 million from the same period last year. Our adjusted-EBITDA margin came in at 43%, consistent with Q3 levels, but down 1 point in the same period last year and coming in at the high-end of our guidance given the strong revenue achievement.","GAAP depreciation and amortization expenses were $68 million in the fourth quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation associated with stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of capitalized interest expense. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP depreciation was $56 million, up $1 million from Q3 levels and in line with guidance.","Non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter was $175 million up $18 million from Q3 and up $27 million from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 33%, up 1 point from Q3 levels and down 1 point from the same period last year and in line with our guidance.","Moving onto the other income and expense items, interest income for the fourth quarter was roughly $2 million, up slightly from Q3 levels. Non-cash interest expense related to our convertible debt was roughly $5 million. As a reminder, this non-cash expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results.","Moving on to earnings. GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $97 million or $0.54 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $127 million or $0.70 of earnings per diluted share and coming in $0.04 above the high-end of our guidance range. As Tom mentioned earlier, the reinstatement of the U.S. Federal R&D tax credit late in December was not included in our guidance and positively impacted non-GAAP net income by $9 million or $0.05 of earnings per diluted share. Excluding this tax benefit, our non-GAAP earnings would have been $0.65 per diluted share, coming in at the higher end of our guidance driven by the strong revenue performance.","For the quarter, total taxes included in our GAAP earnings were $37 million, based on an effective tax rate of 27%. This rate is down 4 points year-over-year primarily related to the R&D tax credit I just mentioned. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $51 million based on an effective tax rate of 28% and coming in about 4 points lower than our guidance range, again due to the R&D tax credit.","Finally, our weighted average diluted share count for the fourth quarter was 181 million shares consistent with Q3 levels and in line with our guidance. With our strong fourth quarter results, we finished the year with nearly $2 billion in revenue, an increase of 24% over 2013 or an increase of 25% when adjusted for foreign exchange. ","Full year cash gross margin was 78% and GAAP gross margin was 69% both up 1 point from the prior year and representing the third straight year of expanding gross margins. Our improvements in this area are a direct result of the ongoing exceptional work by our engineering and network teams to implement a number of hardware and software initiatives to manage our global network more efficiently.","Full year GAAP operating expenses were $863 million. These GAAP numbers include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock based compensation, restructuring charges and acquisition related charges. Excluding these charges full year non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $688 million, or 35% of total revenues up 2 points through 2013 levels. As we discussed throughout 2014, we are committed to investing organically and through M&A to drive innovation and future growth. We added nearly 1200 employees across the Company in 2014, focused primarily in sales and supporting go-to-market capacity, service and customer support staffing, network efficiency scaling, engineering innovation and company infrastructure scaling, and we plan to continue hiring in these areas in 2015. ","Full year adjusted-EBITDA was $853 million, up 22% from 2013 and full year adjusted-EBITDA margin was 43%, down a point from the prior year. Fully GAAP net income was $334 million or $1.84 of earnings per diluted share for 2014. Non-GAAP net income for the year was $449 million, or $2.48 of earnings per diluted share. That\u2019s up 23% from 2013 levels. This number includes full year non-GAAP taxes of $205 million based on a full year non-GAAP tax rate of 31%.","Now I'll review some balance sheet items. Day sales outstanding for the fourth quarter was 56 days down four days from Q3 level and up one day from the same period last year. Capital expenditures in Q1 excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense were $98 million, slightly above the high-end of our guidance for the quarter, primarily due to network build-outs in anticipation of future traffic demand. We plan to continue with this aggressive build-out moving into 2015. As a reminder this CapEx number also includes capitalized software development activities. ","Cash flow generation continued to be strong. Cash from operations was a $196 million in the fourth quarter or 36% of revenue and $658 million for the full year, or 34% of revenue. During the quarter we spent $42 million on share repurchases, buying back roughly 700,000 shares at an average price of just under $60. For the year we spent nearly $270 million, buying back approximately 4.6 million shares at an average price of $58. As of Q4 end we had $434 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization.","Our balance sheet also remains very strong, with roughly $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at the end of the quarter. If you factor in our convertible debt, our net cash is approximately $900 million. As we've discussed in the past we believe the strength of our balance sheet and cash position is an important competitive differentiator that provides us the financial flexibility to make key investments at opportune times. As always, our overall goal is to deploy our capital to achieve favorable return in a manner we believe is in the best long-term interest of the Company and our shareholders.","In summary, we are very pleased with how the business performed in Q4 and throughout 2014. We continue to execute well, delivered strong revenue growth, manage network cost effectively and made the necessary investments in the business that we believe are building a foundation for sustained long-term growth.","Looking ahead to the first quarter and 2015, we expect significant foreign exchange headwinds from the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most currencies. At current spot rates foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact on Q1 revenue of $7 million, compared to Q4 and $50 million compared to Q1 of last year.","In addition the currency headwinds, while we expect another solid media quarter in Q1, we do anticipate a moderation in media growth rates heading into 2015 driven by a few factors. First, as I discussed earlier Q4 revenue growth benefited from exceptionally strong holiday traffic which we expect will abate. Second, in Q1 of 2014 we benefited from several large software and gaming releases as well as the Sochi Olympics, which makes for a more difficult compare this quarter. Lastly, while contract renewals at lower price points occur every quarter, we expect the impact of recent renewals to have a slightly greater impact on media growth rates in the first quarter. That said, it is important to note that the rate of decline in media pricing and renewal time has remained consistent with prior years and that media business is strong, with revenues projected to grow at a very healthy rate in 2015, just not at the record 2014 levels. ","Factoring in these items, we are expecting another strong quarter with Q1 revenue in the range of $517 million to $534 million. This range represents 17% to 21% growth adjusted for foreign exchange movements over a very strong first quarter last year. At these revenue levels we expect cash gross margins of 78% down one point from Q4 levels and GAAP gross margins of 68%. Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be a $189 million to a $193 million, roughly in line with Q4 levels as commission accelerated reset at the beginning of the year offset with continued headcount investments across the business. ","Factoring in all these items I just mentioned, we anticipate Q1 EBITDA margins of 41% to 42%. As I have been messaging in prior calls, looking beyond Q1 we expect to be in the low EBIT -- low 40 EBITDA range, or more precisely in the 40% to 42% EBITDA range as we plan to continue making the necessary investments that we believe will help drive Akamai's future growth and scale.","Moving on to depreciation, we expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be $59 million to $60 million, up from Q4 levels due to increases from both our Q4 and planned Q1 network build-outs and the capitalization of several large software projects. Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 30% to 31% for Q1. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q1 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.60 to $0.63.","This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $50 million to $53 million, based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of 32%. This tax rate is a few points higher than what we saw in the fourth quarter for two reasons. First Q4 included a full year benefit from the U.S federal R&D tax credit that was reinstated for fiscal year 2014. And second, Congress did not approve an extension of the tax credit into 2015. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of roughly 181 million shares.","On CapEx we expect to spend approximately $125 million to $130 million in the quarter, excluding equity compensation. These levels are higher than what we have spent in recent quarters, primarily driven by a continuation of our network investments to support the continued growth of our customers with large, global end user foot prints and an expected increase in a number of complex live events.","In addition, the timing of some facility build-outs required to support our headcount growth also contributes to the uptick in Q1 CapEx. We expect Q1 to be the high watermark for quarterly CapEx spend in 2015 with full year 2015 annual CapEx as a percentage of revenue projected to be roughly consistent with 2014 levels.","In closing, we accomplished a great deal in 2014 and remain confident in our ability to execute on our plans for both the short-term and long-term. We look forward to having an opportunity to go into more details with you about the business and future trends in the industry at our upcoming Investor's Summit in Boston on February 24.","Now let me turn the call back over to Tom. ","Thomson Leighton","Thanks, Jim. By every financial measure, 2014 was an excellent year for Akamai, with robust growth on both top and bottom-lines, strong performance across all our geographies and product lines and solid execution on our business strategy. We believe that our excellent financial results validate the soundness of our strategy and the continued market opportunities for our offerings and we are continuing to focus on the four grand challenges faced by our customers; delivering video over the Internet with unparalleled quality, scale and affordability; providing near instant performance for websites and apps on any device, anywhere; protecting websites and data centers from cyber-attacks that aim to disrupt their online operations, corrupt their data or steal sensitive information; and scaling enterprise networks to efficiently handle new cloud workloads. ","At the Consumer Electronics Show last month I met with several of our major media customers and partners. They told me that they are experiencing rapidly increasing demand for online video and they are turning to Akamai as the leading provider of solutions with high quality and scale. In order to capture the anticipated growth in media traffic, we plan to continue making investments in innovative media, technology and network build-out. ","As you might imagine security is also becoming a primary concern for major media companies, and Akamai is very well positioned to help with our Kona Site Defender and Prolexic Routed Solutions. I am very happy to report that as the first anniversary of the Prolexic acquisition approaches we are well on track to achieving all of the success metrics that we established for the acquisition; including meeting our 2014 revenue targets, extending the Prolexic security operation center capabilities in Fort Lauderdale to centers in Tokyo, Bangalore and Krakow, and retaining key customers and employees. ","Of course security is a top concern for customers across many verticals. As cyber-attacks have continued to increase in scale and sophistication, more and more enterprises are leveraging Akamai's massively distributed platform as an outer layer of defense while preserving site performance and availability. As a result security has continued to be our fastest growing product category. At the end of 2014 nearly 1,700 customers were using our security products with more than 900 having purchased one or both of our flagship Kona Site Defender and Prolexic Routed Solutions.","In addition to cyber-attacks, there are several other factors that make it hard to deliver a fast and reliable web experience. Web sites are richer, heavier and more interactive, which means that they require more time to deliver. Internet peering points and cell powers are becoming more congested, which slows everything down. And more business applications are moving online, which saturates enterprise network capacity.","Akamai built the Ion product line to help address these performance challenges. Ion is equipped with numerous real-time optimizations and is particularly well suited for use with mobile devices. Ion helps our customers expand revenue opportunities with improved performance, increased scalability and reduced infrastructure cost. As a result, 96 of the Internet retailer 100 companies use Akamai to accelerate their Web sites and over one-third have upgraded to Ion since it was launched two years ago.","In October of last year, we expanded the Ion product line with the launch of Ion Standard and Ion Premier. Ion Standard provides industry leading web performance in a fully self-serviceable package to help companies realize value quickly. For customers whose online businesses require even more performance, such as top Internet retailers, Ion Premier offers additional optimizations that can be customized to provide the maximum possible performance benefit. I am proud of what Akamai accomplished in 2014 and I believe that our achievements attest to the sound fundamentals of our strategy and innovative technology. I am very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for Akamai in 2015 and beyond.","Thank you for your time today. Now Jim and I will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question come from Jennifer Lowe with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Jennifer Lowe","Jim, I wanted to drill in the sort of the commentary around the '15 outlook a little bit. And firstly you mentioned that there were some contracts that were coming up for renewal and I would assume marking back down the market rate and that's kind of the normal course of business, but you had a similar impact in '14 when I think your largest media customer came up for renewal right at the beginning of the year and saw a reset there. So I'm just curious to contextualize the impact of the effective pricing declines you set this year versus last year when you also had a big contract that came up and reset? And then sort of secondly, you talked a bit about the expectations around media growth being slower in '15 versus '14. If it is the performance in security business that's been a more stable performer if you take out the Prolexic inorganic benefit. So is there any reason to think that the trajectory around performance should change at all in '15?","James Benson","Sure I'll take your -- so your first question around kind of media that I think it's important to kind of have as a backdrop that we grew the media business in 2014 21%. You're not going to grow the media business 21% every year. So we're coming off a record year for the media business and we're coming off a record quarter, where we grew the media business 23%. So our growth in the media business in 2014 has been exceptional. And so we still expect growth in the media business to be very strong. I mentioned three areas. If not, you kind of highlighted one of them. One is we had a very, very strong burst in November and December for media related traffic. We would expect that to abate just because the holiday season is over. Two, we had several large gaming and software releases last Q1. So it makes for a little bit more of a difficult compare. And the third is, as I said we do have large customers that renew every quarter. They don\u2019t renew linearly. So it's not like a 25% a quarter renew. So there's going to be some quarters that a few more renew than other quarters and that's exactly what is happening this quarter. It's nothing really notable. The pricing changes that we're seeing are in line with what we've seen with historical patterns. So we've not seen an increase or a decrease in the rate of pricing erosion. It just means and really just so that we're clear, I was really signaling more for media growth in Q1, obviously being driven by the reset from a couple more contract reprises than usual, but we still expect very strong growth rates in the media business, just not in the low 20s. And relative to performance and security, you are right that that business, to adjust it for a kind of -- foreign exchange has been growing very consistently and we would expect that business to be relatively stable -- a stable grower going into 2015.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Sterling Auty","In the past spikes in CapEx spending like the investment you're talking about have been a precursor to volume growth. You mentioned that you expect that again. But what I'm curious about is in the context of what you're seeing now, what gives you the visibility and confidence of being able to capture the same percentage of that growth opportunity as you have in the past?","James Benson","Yes, you are right that we have reasonably good visibility from talking to our customers around traffic demand. We certainly have good visibility in the near term, and as we told you before, when we build out CapEx we're building our CapEx really to achieve what we believe is going to be highest possibility of traffic growth that we could get. We want to make sure we're building up the network to take traffic for our customers. That\u2019s effectively what we are doing. If in fact we don\u2019t see the traffic demand materialize, we can always notch CapEx down in future quarters. And so you are right. What we're signaling here is confidence that we believe that it is going to be a nice uptick in traffic going into 2015 even beyond Q1. But if we don\u2019t see that happen obviously we'll ratchet CapEx down later in the year. But that\u2019s not what we're expecting right now. ","Sterling Auty","And then second, in your prepared remarks you mentioned the holiday traffic, holiday media traffic spike a couple of times. I want to make sure that we're clear. What specifically is that media traffic that you are seeing? What\u2019s the source of it that seasonally falls off?","James Benson","So I think we talked in the past that there's basically four big secular trends in the business that have been driving media traffic and revenue growth for the Company. One is been obviously the continued adoption of video delivery through streaming and things of that nature. Two is you're going to -- there's going to be some quarters where you have more software updates than normal, some quarters you're going to have more gaming releases than normal, and certainly social media as a platform has been continuing to grow and innovate over the last several years, and so what you had in Q4 was a four for four that we did well in gaming, we did well in software updates, we did well in social media, we did well in video delivery.","You do tend to see it spike around the holiday. People consume more videos. There tend to be more patches and gaming releases that tend to occur around the holidays and that\u2019s effectively what we saw. So it\u2019s not -- it\u2019s fairly normal to see traffic patterns kind of not be at the same levels going into Q1 and that\u2019s what we're expecting and that\u2019s what we're flagging in our guidance. But again to be clear, we are still expecting strong growth in our media business. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Milunovich with UBS. Please proceed. ","Steve Milunovich ","First, you didn\u2019t indicate the EPS impact in the first quarter from currency. I wonder if you care to talk about that and if you're going to be hedging any more aggressively going forward, and second, could you update us on your sales hiring? It seems like you've been lagging a little bit behind your goals last couple of quarters. Where are we in terms of both hiring and the efficiency of those sales people coming up the curve?","Thomson Leighton","Good question on the earnings impact, that as I mentioned that we're seeing a sequential headwind of about $8 million and about a $50 million headwind year-over-year due to foreign exchange on the top-line. More of our spending is in U.S. dollars. So you can expect that there's going to be a more notable flow through into earnings impact from that revenue drop. So if you do recall it -- call it a roughly 50% flow through on that, maybe a little bit more than that. So you're talking a penny or two pennies in earnings year-on-year.","And relative to sales hiring, actually we had a great quarter for sales hiring. You were right. We were a little bit behind earlier in the year. We caught up a little bit in Q3. We had a strong hiring quarter in Q4 and delivered to kind of a plan that we expected actually a little bit better than we had expected ending the year. And we continue to see good momentum with the efficiency of the sales hiring. And as I mentioned before in other calls that I think what we have found -- this maybe have been an issue when we started to hire, we thought that sales focus would be more concentrated to call it performance and security solutions. And really what we have found is they're selling the entire portfolio, and so some of the performance that we are seeing in media is a result of good execution by the sales team on selling media is well as performance and security. So I'd say we are tracking pretty well and we expect to continue to ramp sales hiring in 2015. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Turits with Raymond James. Please proceed. ","Michael Turits ","Two questions. First, kind of a center competitive question but maybe from the angle that it seems as if the growth rates are consistently slower from all the competitors that report numbers. So any change or just you guys are killing it and that\u2019s it?","Thomson Leighton","We continue to have substantial competition. The competition varies on the product line and -- but we're executing very well. We've made substantial progress in improving our quality, our scalability at an affordable price point, providing excellent security defenses for our customers. And so we've have been very successful. ","Michael Turits ","Okay, and then on the P&L side, you called out security. Any more detail? You got any good customers? Any more granularity there? And then also perhaps on some of the -- maybe we could call them emerging areas that you've highlighted in some of the Analyst Days on the PNS side including carrier and hybrid club.","Thomson Leighton","Certainly the most -- the fastest growing business within Performances and Security is the security business. As I mentioned in our prepared remarks that we actually had pretty solid growth across most of the major product lines in performance in security, but certainly the noteworthy call out at security, it's been -- it was noteworthy last year and it\u2019s been strong all year. I think the addition of the Prolexic capabilities really has enhanced the Company\u2019s portfolio. I will at the Investor Summit, I will breakout each one of the performance and security solution groups a little bit deeper for you, so that you can see how each one of them did for the full year. But I can tell you that certainly securities leading the way, you'll see that it was pretty solid growth across the Board, but certainly is the most noteworthy being security.","And I think the emerging areas, one of the things that we had talked about the announcement certainly of our Cisco partnership in Q3. We were -- we had told you that we didn\u2019t expect any material revenue from the Cisco partnership in 2014, but we've seen a number of proof of concepts. The quality of customers that we're attracting here gives us some optimism that we should see some hopefully -- some further acceleration here in 2015. ","Operator","Our next question comes from James Breen with William Blair. Please proceed. ","James Breen ","Just a couple of questions. One on sort of the currency impact to revenue. You talked about $15 million year-over-year. When you sort of add that to the midpoint of guidance, it implies sort of constant currency growth around 19% for the first quarter. Just thinking about how it trends during the year, since it appears that a lot of currency, the strength in the dollar happened in the back half of \u201914. Should we expect that year-over-year revenue growth which right now is about 16% based on your guidance in the first quarter to sort of tick up throughout the year? And then secondly, just can you update us sort of who is your larger customers in terms of potential revenue? I think your largest customer at the end of last year was around 9% or so. Has that changed?","James Benson","On the FX impact, the way you should think about it, if you look at foreign exchange rates throughout 2014, actually the dollar weakened in the first half of 2014 and then strengthened in the second half. So what you'll see is it will be a headwind on growth rates for probably the first two quarters and then it will be less so in Q3 and Q4. And relative to -- we don\u2019t breakout revenue concentration, we don\u2019t have any 10% revenue customers and I would say while we have some sizable customers, we don\u2019t have any customers that are near 10%.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Sanderson with MKM Partners. Please proceed. ","Rob Sanderson ","You mentioned a third of your e-commerce customers upgraded to Ion. Can you talk through what a typical ARPU looks like on Ion versus DSF? I know that customers are very different, but can you sort of help us think about what kind of incremental revenue opportunity is there? And then second customer count, can you give us an update or a way to think about as cloud and SaaS more mainstream how applicable is the Akamai solution into the hundreds of thousands of mainstream enterprise customers. How does management think about that? How should we think about that?","Thomson Leighton","Okay, so we said that a third of the Internet Retailer 100 had upgraded to Ion, and the ARPU lift is something that we don\u2019t talk about but we have seen lift and of course the service provides much faster performance for Web sites and is particularly tailored for the mobile environment. And we're getting to the point now where close to half of online transactions are on mobile devices. So mobile performance really matters. That's been a big shift over the last few years. A few years ago almost no transactions were on mobile devices. ","We don\u2019t talk about the customer counts in general, but I can tell you we are focused on the 1,000 customers out there and not really on hundreds of thousands of customers. Now that said, we do have channel partners and resellers who do focus on that segment, and so they tend to that calculation of enterprises. In terms of our direct sale where we would count customers, it\u2019s focused on you want to think of as thousands of customers, not hundreds of thousands.","James Benson","Well I think it\u2019s a fair color Tom to your point on channels that we had an exceptional channel quarter and an exceptional channel year. The carrier partnerships that we've announced over the last couple of years are bearing fruit. That\u2019s our fastest growing -- of our channel partners, the carrier partners are our fastest growing, but the indirect channel is growing faster than our direct business. So I think to Tom\u2019s point we're focusing our direct sales force in the right areas for our Enterprise class customers and then that\u2019s not to say that our channel partners are not focused in those areas as well, but they can go a little bit deeper and get broader penetration for the Company.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gray Powell with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Gray Powell","Just a couple if I may. In the past you cited total ARPU for the security business I think in around $7,000 per month with Kona closer to 14,000 per month versus the site acceleration side at 20,000. How should we think about the potential for security if the ARPUs improve and how long do you think it takes for penetration security to match the site acceleration side of your business?","Thomson Leighton","Yes I'll provide the details of the security ARPUs at the Investor Summit. It's a little teaser for you to come. I will tell you that the ARPUs are increasing in Security. As you mentioned that it's -- you have to look at the broad security portfolio. Kona Site Defender and Prolexic have much higher ARPUs than kind of our standard web application firewall and other security offering. So it's been growing and I'll provide the specific numbers at the Investor Summit later this month.","Gray Powell","And then just maybe one follow up if I may, sticking with security. Just how should we think about the product roadmap there? Any tangential areas that look interesting to you?","Thomson Leighton","Yes, we are now in Beta with a client reputation service to identify IP addresses that have behaved with -- had malicious behavior in the past, and to identify the nature of what's sitting behind an IP address. And the customer interest there in the Beta stage has been high. And as we look farther into the future, we're looking at enterprise security. As you know, we have the cloud networking division with its first product being Akamai Connect sold by Cisco, and as we start dealing with enterprise traffic, obviously the building to secure that and protect the enterprise employee becomes a very interesting area to apply our security expertise.","Operator","Our next question come from Sameet Sinha with B. Riley. Please proceed.","Sameet Sinha","A couple of questions. You gave us some data on DSA and the penetration of the IR 500 -- sorry IR 100. Can you talk about the Ion Prime? What sort of penetration -- what sort of go-to-market strategy that has? And also if you could provide equivalent data on the Internet Retailer 500, sort of your level of penetration and what sort of market? Is it the entire 500 or do you think just the top 100 are kind of the key markets for Ion Prime? Then secondly Jim, for every time that you said low 40s EBITDA margin. I would have been a rich man if I got a penny every time. What exactly are you spending on? I can understanding hiring real-estate. Can you give us a little more detail and kind of how we should think about this spending through the year?","Thomson Leighton","Let me take the first question. DSA, Dynamic Site Accelerator was our former flagship acceleration product and then we launched the Ion line a couple of years ago and then last October we launched Ion Standard and Ion Premier. The way to think about Ion Standard is that it's really easy to use, really easy to configure. You can sort of turn it on yourself and so it allows an enterprise to quickly get a lot of their sites and applications going with very strong performance gains.","And Ion Premier is more of a customized capability. So they are the sites that care the most about performance, are willing to put effort into really optimizing that, really tuning it for all the different kinds of devices that are out there, they would want to get Ion Premier. Now if you think about Internet Retailers, they're obviously in the sweet spot for Ion Premier, because it's well known that if your site is faster, you sell a lot more on it and that's why we have such strong adoption of our services in the IR 100. We also have very good adoption in the IR 250 and IR 500. Don\u2019t think we released the statistics there, but commerce as a whole, there's certainly a sweet spot for web performance capabilities.","James Benson","Yes. And on your question on low 40s, I'm only chuckling because you're right. I have signaled that we're going to operate in the low 40s. I will remind you though that what has driven the Company not operating in the low 40s to-date is that we've had significant revenue growth and over achievement beyond our expectation. So the Company grew in constant currency 25% last year. That was certainly higher than what we had planned. We expanded gross margins for the third straight year. That was better than we had expected. So we have been spending in the areas that I outlined, and I talked about sales and supporting go-to-market capacity, I talked about services and support, I talked about kind of investments in network scaling, I talked about investments in R&D and innovation, and we're also making investments in Company infrastructure scaling. So you can expect that we're going to continue to do those things. We're not going to grow every -- I would love to think every year we can grow 25%. Maybe we can. We're not certainly signaling that here with our guidance for Q1. And so what I'm trying to signal to you is that that's the intent of the Company, to manage the Company in the range of 40% to 42% EBITDA. So I don\u2019t want anyone to be surprised if and when that happens.","Operator","Our next question come from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.","Mike Olson","I know International's been a bigger focus over the last few quarters and years, but it hasn\u2019t really grown as a percent of the revenue mix and it seems like maybe that\u2019s been in the category a good problem to have because domestic growth has maybe just bit stronger than expected. But how do you see that tending over the next few quarters and maybe next couple of years? Is that a focus on new sales force hires? Do you kind of feel like you've been maybe leaving business on the table by not having as strong of a sales presence outside the U.S.? Definitely it seems like that could be another lever of growth in the coming years. Thanks. ","Thomson Leighton","Yes, actually you hit the nail on the head that we're pleased with the international growth. It's just that our domestic business grew much faster than we had expected. And our largest customers in the media business in particular tend to reside U.S. And so really we drove and fueled kind of the overachievement in the media growth rates in particular, we had strong growth across the Board but we had particularly strong growth with our large media customers, which tend to sit, more of them -- not all of them but more of them tend to sit in the U.S. So we're very pleased with the international growth. It\u2019s just we had exceptional growth in the Americas.","And you're right, going forward from a sales hiring perspective, actually we have -- roughly 50% of our sales reps are already outside the U.S. So the hiring we've been doing over the last couple of years has been more weighted to international because we believe we are less penetrated outside the U.S. than we are in the U.S. We certainly have opportunities in all markets but we believe there is significantly more Greenfield opportunity outside the U.S. and you're starting to see us get traction for some of the sales force hiring that we've done and plan to do going forward. ","So I would expect that you will see the international revenue as a mix percent grow in the future. It'd be nice to the have the problem we have right now, which is it may not grow because the domestic business grows equally which would be a nice problem to have, but we do expect that probably in the future that the International business mix will be a little bit higher than what we've seen to date.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed. ","Unidentified Analyst ","Hi, guys this is [indiscernible] for Phil. Most of my questions have been answered but I want to focus on our gross margin line. Looking at the 2014 gross margin, it went up from 2013. You talked about some of this network grooming and improving optimization et cetera. So wondering if you could also give us some color on co-location and bandwidth expenses you are seeing there and sort of changes you might expect to see. And how should we think about that going forward in 2015?","Thomson Leighton","I think we've talked about that. We've made good progress on managing bandwidth cost. So bandwidth cost per megabit per second continues to go down. Obviously the total cost for traffic reserve is going down at a greater rate in pace than what we're seeing in pricing erosion. But we've done a good job on optimizing on the co-lo side, we've done a job of optimizing on the bandwidth size and some of it has been hardware initiative, some of it has been software initiatives that our team has driven. We certainly have some buying leverage because we are a huge purchaser of bandwidth, given the amount of traffic that we serve. ","So I think we're very, very pleased with the work that we done on the network side and we expect that we can continue to keep pace with what we've been doing. I'm not calling that -- obviously in this guidance for gross margin expansion but we think we can get gross margin stabilization on the cash gross margin side.","Operator","Our next question comes from Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company. Please proceed.","Colby Synesael ","Great, two questions if I may. First off on CapEx intensity. I think Company\u2019s long-term high-end target is about 16%. I think this year you spent just over 17%. I think the guidance for this year is expected to be roughly flat at 17%. Is it fair to say that the capital intensity of the business is just slightly higher than what you previously anticipated and that that 17% is a good longer-term number for us to be thinking about? And then also on APRU, so the one metric you do provide is servers and certainly if you look at total revenue divided by servers you actually saw revenue per server go up about 7% and 7.5% in 2014 and if we look at our model for last six years, it\u2019s gone down every single year. Can you help talk about what actually happened in 2014 that you think drove revenue on a per server basis? And I guess is that sustainable?","James Benson","So on the CapEx intensity side, so you're right. We landed at 17% for 2014 and I signaled that we're probably going to be at that rate for 2015. I think it\u2019s important to parse our CapEx. Half of that are or call it 8 points of the 17% is network CapEx, which several years ago was roughly 10% of revenue. So we've seen nice scale on network CapEx. I'd say the one area Colby that's probably been a more notable uptake in CapEx is around capitalized software, which I think is a good thing, because as that from an accounting perspective when we invest in R&D resources, when they're working on specific software development work, we capitalize that and that turns into CapEx. And the way to think about that is that\u2019s future product innovation that\u2019s about to be released. That\u2019s probably a little bit higher than what we had expected. I'm not going to signal on this call kind of an adjustment to the long-term model for the Company. We will provide an update at the IR summit where I'll talk about the trends in the business and I'll talk about the kind of the long-term model for the Company then.","And on your revenue per server, yes we don't believe that's a very good metric to be quite frank. I know that maybe in the old days people have looked at that. So I'm not sure looking at revenue per server is a meaningful measure for the Company. We're always doing refreshers of servers on the network. And so I don't think necessarily looking at it just on a server basis is a way of looking at efficiency. I think the way you can look at efficiency is looking at our network CapEx as a percent of revenue. Our network CapEx as a percent of revenue has gone down. It was 10% two or three years ago. It's now 8%. So you're seeing efficiency in our -- the CapEx intensity on the network side as evidenced by a nice steady decline and now a stabilization of network CapEx as a percent of revenue. ","Colby Synesael ","Yes, I was just going to add, obviously you continue to provide servers. So to some degree one might think that there might be some value in that. And I guess the other question is obviously there's been a lot of questions on ARPU this quarter. And based on the fact that you're saying that revenue per server is not a good number, it might be helpful at some point for you guys to potentially provide some more metrics on that if it's at all possible? Thanks.","Operator","Sure. Our next question comes from Jeff Van Rhee with Craig-Hallum. Please proceed. ","Jeff Van Rhee","Two brief ones guys. Just wanted to understand on a sales hiring, the sense of magnitude of what we should expect in '15 in terms of the ads I think you had originally said maybe a 100 for '14. It sounds like you came in just a bit ahead of that. So thoughts, if you can dial in a little bit around '15. And then just one brief one on the new customer versus existing customer mix. Is there tasking or incentives in place in terms of sales and sales leadership that target specifically the new versus existing up sells and how we should think about that?","James Benson","Yes. And so we're not going to specifically guide to an incremental number of sales resources every year. We did that back in -- when we started to ramp the sales force investments. I think you can expect that we'll add a similar number of rep hires every year for what we've done in the last couple of years, and that's anywhere between kind of call it 80 and 100. So you can expect that we'll continue to do that. ","And relative to where they're focused on new versus existing, as you can imagine when we do territory planning, they plan territories with that in mind, around size of customer, Greenfield opportunities. But again I think from a rep perspective that you're going to have some hunters, you're going to have some farmers, you're going to have some hybrid reps. And so I think it's a little bit of a mixed bag based on the territories that we put them in. So there isn't necessarily an incentive for them to sell more on the new customer side versus existing customer. If we can grow the business through existing customers, we're happy to have that happen. If we can grow the business through new customers, we're happy to have that happen. And we think we have a pretty balanced go-to-market approach to do both. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Ed Maguire with CLSA. Please proceed. ","Thomson Leighton","Ed? I think you are on mute. Okay. Denise, we can maybe go back to Ed. Let's take the next one please.","Operator","Sure our next question comes from Will Powell with Robert Baird. Please proceed. ","Will Power","I guess a couple of questions. Maybe first Jim, just to maybe come back to the currency outlook quickly, the EBITDA margin guidance for the year, 40% to 42% any sense for what the FX impact is on that? What that might look like on a constant currency basis. And then the second question, just with all these upcoming streaming video offers on the horizon, of course LinkTV I guess launching, HBO, others coming, maybe any color as to how you think about the emerging or I guess increasing opportunity there generally and any specifics around any of these new particular players that you might be able to make comments around?","James Benson","So yes, I'm glad you brought the FX impact. So interestingly enough that FX impact is about 1 point year-on-year on EBITDA. So FX alone is about a 1 point impact on kind of the company EBITDA if you look at it on a constant currency basis. So it is meaningful for the Company as I mentioned because we have more of our cost in U.S dollars. And relative to kind of -- I think there's a bunch of trends going on in media space. You mentioned a few. There's going to -- there is a bunch of new offerings -- there's going to be more over the top capabilities and that's going to need to be served by some platform. We think that certainly Akamai is one of those platforms that could serve some of those capabilities. We certainly signaled with the CapEx build-out that we're doing on the network side that we're pretty bullish on traffic growth here going into 2015. So you can expect that we're going to hopefully capitalize on some of what continues to be an emerging trend of traffic growth across all the media. You mentioned one -- social media continues to innovate. Streaming continues to be an area that's growing rapidly. There needs to be more and more gaming releases and software updates. So we're pretty optimistic about the media business going forward. ","Thomson Leighton","Yes. As you look father in the future, there is a possibility of a tremendous amount of traffic from video to come online. Today the penetration rates online are very low. When you combine that with the emerging technologies, technologies like 4K, maybe someday 8K, and what that means that for one hour of watching, actually a lot more traffic has to flow to produce the quality. So there is a really tremendous potential for growth, which is why we are so bullish media business and we're are investing for the future. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg McDowell with JMP. Please proceed. ","Rishi Jaluria","This is Rishi Jaluria dialing in for Greg McDowell. Two quick ones if I may. First, in terms of your security offerings with Kona and Prolexic and your success that you pointed to there, are you typically finding yourself gaining new, gaining customers by up selling to existing Akamai customers or are you actually getting new customers that weren\u2019t with Akamai or with Prolexic prior. And then second in terms of the quarter, it sounds like you had a strong quarter in retail and in e-commerce. I just wanted to see if there any -- are there particular verticals that you saw strength or weakness in that you wanted to point to.","Thomson Leighton","On the Security side the good news is we're seeing both strong upsell in our existing base and also new customers, customers that for whatever reason haven\u2019t done business with Akamai before but are in the market for a Security product. We have a very compelling pair of offers, Kona Site Defender and Prolexic Routed. And then that's great because we're seeing several examples where we once we get them on the Akamai platform with security, then we can upsell them with our traditional solutions with application acceleration.","James Benson","Yes, in most of the verticals, certainly the media and entertainment vertical had significant growth given what I talked about. But we saw a good growth in the commerce vertical, we saw good growth across our enterprise verticals. We had pretty growth across almost all of our verticals, probably with the one exception being on the public sector side that we probably haven\u2019t seen as much growth in that vertical, but we didn\u2019t expect see significant growth in that vertical but I think across the Board, with the exception of the public sector we've had pretty strong growth. ","Thomson Leighton","Okay. Thank you Denise. Thank you, everyone. In closing, as Jim mentioned we hope to see you live or via Web cast, via the Akamai platform at our 2015 Investor Summit to be held on February 24th in Boston. In addition we'll be presenting at a number of investor conferences in March. Details of these can be found in the Investor Relations section at akamai.com.

My name is Derrick, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Tom Barth","Thank you, Derrick, and good afternoon, and thank you all for joining Akamai's second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Benson, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer.","But before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual events to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on July 30, 2014. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances.","As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of our website.","With that, let me turn the call over to Tom.","F. Thomson Leighton","Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. Q2 was another excellent quarter for Akamai on both the top and bottom lines. Revenue in the second quarter was a record $476 million, up 26% over Q2 of 2013 and coming in near the high end of our guidance range. We had solid growth in all of our geographies and in all of our major product lines, with especially strong growth for our security and media products.","Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $106 million or $0.58 per diluted share. That's also up 26% over Q2 of 2013. This strong result exceeded the high end of our guidance range due to strong operational execution and a favorable tax rate.","I'll be back in a few minutes to talk more about our achievements in the second quarter. But first, let me turn the call over to Jim to review our financial results in detail and to provide the outlook for Q3. Jim?","James Benson","Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. Akamai had a great second quarter and a very strong first half of the year. As Tom outlined, Q2 revenue came in near the high end of our guidance range at $476 million, up 5% sequentially and up 26% year-over-year with strong growth across the entire business.","Looking at our performance by solution category. Our media delivery solutions revenue was $216 million in the quarter, up 1% sequentially and up 20% year-over-year. As Tom mentioned, we are very pleased with the growth in media coming off a very strong first quarter. Traffic and revenue growth accelerated across most of our customer base, with particularly strong growth coming from our gaming, video and social media customers. Again this quarter, we delivered some high-profile live events, most notably the recent World Cup matches, which set peak traffic records and contributed modestly to the media revenue achievement. More important than the media -- the revenue contributions, however, these live events highlight our unique ability to deliver high-quality live streaming content at very large scale.","Turning to our performance and security solutions. Revenue was $217 million in the quarter, up 10% sequentially and up 30% year-over-year. And for the first time, we had more revenue in a quarter from performance and security solutions than Media Delivery, which speaks to the growing diversification of our revenue base. Within this solution category, we saw solid growth in our web performance solutions. And as Tom mentioned, we saw very strong growth in our cloud security solutions. Net new signings were especially strong for our security offerings, and for Prolexic, in particular, another proof point of early traction with our Prolexic integration and also increased customer demand for our overall cloud security portfolio.","Finally, revenue from our services and support solutions was $42 million in the quarter, up 4% sequentially and up 35% year-over-year. We continue to see solid performance in attaching enterprise-class professional services and customer support to our core business solutions.","Switching now to our geographies. Revenue growth continued to be well-balanced across all our major theaters. Sales in our international markets represented 28% of total revenue in Q2, consistent with both the prior quarter and Q2 of 2013. International revenue grew 3% sequentially and 27% year-over-year, with currency fluctuations having a positive impact on revenue of approximately $1 million on a sequential basis and about $3 million on a year-over-year basis. Excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, international revenue grew 2% sequentially and 24% year-over-year. We continue to see strong growth in our Asia Pacific geography and improved performance in our EMEA markets, primarily driven by strength in our performance and security offerings.","Revenue from our U.S. market grew 6% sequentially and 25% year-over-year with very balanced growth across all solution categories.","And finally, revenue through resellers represented 25% of total revenue in Q2, up 1 point from the prior quarter and up 5 points from the prior year. This increase was due to continued traction with our carrier partners in particular and contributions from Prolexic's strong channel relationships.","Moving onto costs. As expected, our cash gross margin was 78%, consistent with the prior quarter and up 2 points from the same period last year and coming in at the high end of our guidance range. We were very pleased to see the benefits of our ongoing platform efficiency initiatives offset the impact of the Prolexic acquisition.","GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 69%, consistent with the prior quarter and up 2 points from the same period last year. GAAP operating expenses were $214 million in the second quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges and acquisition-related charges. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $166 million, up $15 million from Q1 levels and at the lower end of our expectations, mainly due to planned hiring shifting into the third quarter.","Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $204 million, consistent with Q1 levels and up 23% from the same period last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 43%, down 2 points from Q1 levels and down 1 point from Q2 of last year. This result was at the high end of our guidance range for the quarter, driven by a combination of revenue coming in at the higher end of guidance and slightly lower-than-expected operating expenses, as mentioned earlier. GAAP depreciation and amortization expenses were $59 million in the second quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation associated with stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of capitalized interest expense. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP depreciation was $48 million, up $4 million from Q1 levels and in line with our expectations.","This quarter, we are introducing an additional financial metric: non-GAAP operating income. Non-GAAP operating income is essentially adjusted EBITDA less non-GAAP depreciation expenses. This is an operational measure we review internally and believe is a useful supplemental metric for investors since it captures the depreciation related to our day-to-day operations that the adjusted EBITDA metric does not. And it is also not impacted by taxes, which can move around quarterly for nonoperational reasons. This is also a common metric that many of our peers provide. Non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter was $156 million, down 2% from Q1 levels and up 20% from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 33%, down 2 points from Q1 levels and down 1 point from Q2 of last year.","Moving on to other income and expense items. Interest income for the second quarter was roughly $2 million, consistent with Q1 levels. Noncash interest expense related to our convertible debt was roughly $5 million. As a reminder, this noncash expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results.","Moving on to earnings. GAAP net income for the second quarter was $73 million or $0.40 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $106 million for the quarter or $0.58 of earnings per diluted share, about $0.01 higher than the high end of our guidance range, driven primarily by strong revenue achievement, the hiring shift I highlighted earlier and a slightly favorable tax rate. For the quarter, total taxes included in our GAAP earnings were $36 million, based on a tax rate of 33%. This rate is down 5 points year-over-year primarily due to higher foreign earnings. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $52 million, based on a tax rate of 33% and coming in about 1 point lower than our guidance range, again due to higher foreign earnings.","Finally, our weighted average diluted share count for the second quarter was 181 million shares, down approximately 1 million shares from Q1 levels, primarily due to increased share buyback activity in the first half of the year.","Now I'll review some balance sheet items. Days sales outstanding for the second quarter was 60 days, up 2 days from last quarter and 3 days from Q2 of 2013. Capital expenditures in Q2, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $79 million, considerably below our expectations for the quarter due to the timing of planned network, IT and facility buildouts that shifted from Q2 to Q3. As a reminder, this CapEx number also includes capitalized software development activities. Cash flow generation was strong in the second quarter, with free cash flow of $130 million or 27% of revenue. During the quarter, we spent approximately $71 million on share repurchases, buying back about 1.3 million shares at an average price of just under $55. As of Q2 end, we had $550 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. Our balance sheet also remains very strong with roughly $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at the end of the quarter. If you factor in our convertible debt, our net cash is approximately $800 million. As we've discussed in the past, we believe our strong balance sheet and cash position are important competitive differentiators that provide us the financial flexibility to enable us to make the best investments at the most opportune times. As always, our overall aim is to deploy our capital to achieve favorable returns for our shareholders in a manner we believe is in the best long-term interest of the company and our shareholders.","In summary, we are pleased with how the business performed in Q2 and the first half of the year. We continued to execute well, delivered strong revenue growth, managed network costs effectively and made investments across the business that we believe will build the foundation for sustained, long-term growth.","Looking ahead to Q3, we are expecting another strong quarter with revenue in the range of $484 million to $496 million. This range represents 22% to 25% growth over a very strong third quarter last year. At current spot rates, foreign exchange is expected to be neutral compared to Q2 and a favorable $3 million impact year-over-year. We expect gross margins to remain roughly flat to Q2 levels, with cash gross margins at 78% and GAAP gross margins at 68% to 69%. On the operating expense side, we plan to continue to increase our investment levels in the business. We expect to grow non-GAAP cash operating expenses by $11 million to $15 million on a sequential basis, reflecting our plans to catch up on the hiring shifts from Q2, incremental Q3 hiring and facilities and infrastructure spend to support headcount growth globally. Factoring in the above, we anticipate Q3 EBITDA margins of 41% to 42%, down 1 to 2 points from Q2 levels and consistent with prior messaging of operating the company in the low-40s EBITDA range in the near term. As I have shared in the past, we plan to make the needed investments in the business to drive both scale and growth. And whether we land at the high end or the low end of this EBITDA range will be heavily dependent on revenue performance. As a reminder, the long-term EBITDA model for the company remains at 40% to 45%.","Moving on to depreciation. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be $50 million to $52 million, up slightly from Q2 levels. Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margins of 31% to 32% for Q3. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q3 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.55 to $0.58. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $51 million to $53 million, based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of 34%. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of roughly 181 million shares. On CapEx, we expect to spend approximately $86 million to $91 million in the second quarter -- in the third quarter, excluding equity compensation. These levels are slightly higher than what we've spent in recent quarters, primarily due to the expected shift in investments from Q2 to Q3 I mentioned earlier. As I outlined in last quarter's call, we are investing in several large facility and IT projects to support the planned growth in scale in the business. And we are also investing to stay ahead of the traffic growth we expect to see on the network, excluding expanding the Prolexic network footprint. Taking into account these important investment areas, we expect full year 2014 CapEx, as a percentage of revenue, to be slightly above our long-term model, again consistent with what I shared on prior calls.","In closing, we delivered a strong Q2 and first half of the year, and we expect solid performance through the second half of the year as well. We see promising momentum across the business, and we're making the investment that we believe will drive meaningful and sustained growth for Akamai in 2014 and beyond.","Now let me turn the call back over to Tom.","F. Thomson Leighton","Thanks, Jim. It's great to see Akamai building on our strong start to the year. I believe that our excellent financial results are evidence of the sound fundamentals across our business and the pivotal role that we play in the growth of the Internet. We are continuing to focus on solving 4 grand challenges for our customers: delivering video over the Internet with unparalleled quality, scale and affordability; providing near-instant performance for websites and apps on any device, anywhere; securing websites and data centers from attackers that seek to disrupt their operations, corrupt their content or steal their information; and driving speed and affordability into branch office connectivity for major enterprises.","The complexity and challenges of delivering high-quality video over the Internet at scale are often underestimated, and the problem is getting even more complicated as online video consumption increases, further raising the technical and financial hurdles faced by both content owners and service providers. As a result, some experts have questioned whether the Internet will be able to scale to support the delivery of high-quality video to large audiences in the future. One of Akamai's strategic goals is to enable the Internet to achieve such scale, and our recent success in streaming the 2014 World Cup to a global audience has proved once again that Akamai is capable of overcoming the bottlenecks inherent in the Internet so that millions of viewers can watch high-quality video events over IP. Akamai achieved several milestones during the recent World Cup. We supported our largest audience ever for a single event, delivering nearly 7 terabits per second of traffic to over 5 million concurrent viewers of the semifinal match between Argentina and the Netherlands on July 9. We set a new total Akamai traffic record of 23 terabits per second during the Brazil-Germany game on July 8. And we delivered over 220 petabytes of World Cup traffic for 55 broadcasters in 80 countries, 2.5x the amount of traffic for the Sochi Olympics and 10x the traffic for the 2010 World Cup. More important than the scale of the event was the quality that we delivered. I was especially pleased to see one of our largest customers characterize Akamai's World Cup performance as \"nothing short of perfect.\" And while the traffic numbers sound impressive, we believe that they are only the tip of the iceberg. We estimate that only a few percent of the total viewing audience for the World Cup was watching online at any given time. This means that there is a tremendous potential for future growth as more viewers watch online and at higher bit rates. Akamai's repeated success in streaming live, global events such as the World Cup and the Olympic Games has proven that our unique approach of delivering content from thousands of locations close to end users afford significant advantages over our competitors when it comes to scaling and securing the Internet.","Even though we streamed a record amount of traffic in Q2, this was the first quarter where our performance and security revenue exceeded the revenue from our media business. The 30% year-over-year growth in our performance and security business was fueled in part by the Prolexic acquisition and the significant growth in our overall security portfolio. In Q2, we continued to see substantial increases in both the scale and the sophistication of cyber attacks around the globe. Since the second quarter of 2013, the total number of DDoS attacks we have observed increased by 22%, infrastructure attacks grew by 46%, and the average attack bandwidth expanded by 72%. On a typical day, we are now seeing DDoS attacks in excess of 50 gigabits per second. And earlier this month, we successfully defended a DDoS attack in excess of 320 gigabits per second. By leveraging our massively distributed platform as an outer layer of defense, we have been able to protect enterprises worldwide from such large-scale attacks, which can easily overwhelm traditional defenses. Because of our unique capabilities to defend websites and applications, security has continued to be our fastest-growing product category. At the end of the second quarter, over 1,500 customers were using our security products and over 800 had purchased one or both of our flagship Kona Site Defender and Prolexic Solutions.","Five months after the close, the Prolexic acquisition has continued to gain positive momentum. The initial integration phase involving people, finance and sales processes has been completed. Customer and employee retention were key priorities for this acquisition, and I am very pleased with our early success in these areas. In the second half of 2014, we are focusing our efforts on technology integration, expansion of the Security Operations Center and buildout of additional network capacity. Overall, Prolexic and Akamai are now operating as one cohesive organization, focused on designing and delivering the industry's most comprehensive portfolio of security solutions.","In summary, we have had an excellent first half of the year. Our solid financial performance demonstrates the strength of our business strategy, and we believe that our continued investments in product innovation, sales capacity and platform capabilities are expanding the foundation for our future growth. Thank you for your time today. Now Jim and I will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will be from the line of Heather Bellini, Goldman Sachs.","Unknown Analyst","This is Nicole [ph] in for Heather. I was just wondering about the sales productivity in the quarter. I know there are more tenured reps now, especially in the performance and security business. Could you just give more color on that?","James Benson","Yes, so I -- we continue to ramp well with the sales hiring that we've done. We continue to do well on kind of making the reps productive. I think it's important to -- you commented on performance and security. The reps that we hire sell more than performance and security. They sell the entire portfolio. So we have reps that are also selling media solutions as well. So they're not just selling performance and security, but certainly, there's an emphasis on that part of the portfolio. But I'd say, in general, we track the reps by tenure class, and they're kind of tracking to historical levels.","Unknown Analyst","Great. And in the media business, did you see any changes in the competitive landscape there? Any pricing pressure?","F. Thomson Leighton","I would say that's pretty similar to how it's been for many years. As we've often talked about, there's a lot of competitors. And the very biggest companies also do it themselves, or try to, in some cases. And I anticipate that continuing as we move forward.","Operator","Your next question will be from the line of Michael Turits, Raymond James.","James Wesman","It's James Wesman sitting in for Michael. Jim, just to look at the 3Q revenue guidance for a second. I know you guys did post a fairly seasonal strong Q2. The 3Q guide, though, was a point or 2 below what you guys usually do seasonally in the third quarter. Is that a result of the repricing from your largest customer? Any color around there will be helpful.","James Benson","Yes. I think it's important that actually, it's in line with kind of what we usually see seasonally kind of Q2 to Q3. So it's not kind of below that. But to give you a little bit of color on kind of the guidance range, kind of at the midpoint we're expecting another solid quarter. I think we've mentioned in the past, the summer months from a traffic perspective are lighter than other quarters of the year. So certainly, we are expecting some of that. There are a couple of large software releases that are planned towards the back half of the quarter. And effectively, what we're guiding here is that kind of at the midpoint of the range, those software releases, they happen within the quarter and they're kind of in line with the scale that we expect. On a lower end of the range. Maybe some of those software releases push into Q4. But we're pretty confident with kind of the range that we've outlined. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of perspective on kind of the guide.","James Wesman","And then, just a follow-up for Tom. Tom, just some insight into the security business. I know Verizon and EdgeCast had rolled out Web Application Firewall offering. Are you guys seeing that at all in your bake-offs to customers?","F. Thomson Leighton","Not really, no. We've seen the press there. Our relationship with Verizon continues as it has been with Verizon Enterprise Services. And we don't see a lot of EdgeCast in the marketplace and certainly don't see them in the security area.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Sterling Auty, JPMorgan.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So the investment that you're making in the second half, I want to make sure that I'm clear. How much of the investment is really in the security and performance side versus some of the buildout to support media delivery? And traditionally, you guys have done a good job of kind of building in anticipation of demand. What are the things that you're thinking about specifically that would fill up that capacity investment that you're making?","James Benson","Yes. So I think, in general, the investments that we're making are not just weighted to security. We've been making investments across the portfolio, across security, across our kind of cloud networking products, across our web performance products and media. So the investments have been pretty broad from an R&D perspective and also from a go-to-market perspective. So I just want to make sure that -- and those investments we're expecting to continue into the second half of the year. I think to your point about security, we did comment on the last couple calls that we're building out more network expansion, in particular, to support our Prolexic offerings, and we're expecting to do more of that in the second half of the year. And as we've said before, from a CapEx perspective, on the network side, we continue to build out in support of what we believe is the demand that's there. And we know that we can grow into it with traffic. So, effectively, the way to think about it is we build CapEx to support what is an aggressive traffic outlook because we certainly don't want to be turning customers away. And if in fact the traffic is a little bit lighter than we expect in the quarter, you can always grow into it in the following quarter.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then if memory serves me right, in the first 2 quarters of the year, you had some kind of more one-off-ish items, I think, like contracts for IP performance or some specific things that you were doing. Was there anything in that kind of one-off nature that helped -- I'm sorry, in the first quarter, I think it was -- maybe the fourth quarter, but was there anything here in the June quarter that fell into that kind of bucket?","James Benson","Not really. We had very good and balanced performance across media and pretty much across all of our solution categories. I think probably the one area that maybe tends to be a little bit more lumpy is our custom government projects. And we didn't have as many of them in Q2, but that's probably the only area. I think, outside of that, we had very strong growth across the portfolio.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Colby Synesael, Cowen.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Great. This, I think, is the second quarter where you've noted that you've pushed out hiring. And I'm trying to get a sense of what's behind that. Is it simply you're having a hard time finding these people? Is there something else there? And then when you think about the momentum you're seeing in the business and the guidance that you laid out for 3Q, is it favoring an acceleration in any particular business, whether it's -- if you just break out the way you look at your revenues, the media business versus performance and security. Just trying to get a sense of what that's going to look like between the 2 businesses.","James Benson","Sure. So on the hiring front, I mean, we set some pretty aggressive hiring expectations for ourselves for the year. So it's certainly not a matter of having difficulty hiring people because Akamai is a very attractive company for people to come to. So we're not having an issue whatsoever with attracting talent. We just put together a very aggressive hiring plan. Sometimes, hiring shifts from quarter-to-quarter. We want to make sure, obviously, we're hiring the best people. And so I think that we're quite diligent to make sure that the caliber of people that we're bringing on board are the caliber that we want. Relative to Q3, we're not going to -- I'm not going to guide by business unit. I can tell you that we expect strong growth again across the portfolio. So it isn't weighted to any one area. I'd say you should expect that the growth will be pretty balanced across the portfolio again.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mark Keller, D. A. Davidson.","Mark Kelleher - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","My first one is just a little bit of follow-up to that one. The buildouts shifted as well, was that connected to the hiring?","James Benson","No. It's not really connected. I mean, again, we end up -- you end up having to -- for many of these network deployments, they take 3 to 6 months as far as planning. And sometimes, you have vendors and sometimes the vendors are maybe supposed to ship you goods at the end of a quarter and they slip by maybe a week or 2. So you really -- it's really only notable things like that. And then some of the facility expansion that I mentioned, sometimes in certain states and in certain countries, the buildouts take longer based on kind of just challenges with getting permits and things of that nature. There's nothing noteworthy, other than just things that are kind of normal that tend to move kind of from quarter-to-quarter and month-to-month.","Mark Kelleher - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And on the security side, you mentioned Verizon, you're not seeing them there as a competitor. What do you think the growth rate there is in the DDoS security market? Are you maintaining share? Are you taking share? And what's the competitive environment right there?","F. Thomson Leighton","I would say our solution, now that we're combined with Prolexic, is very compelling. And we're seeing high growth rates and a lot of traction there. There are a lot of competitors. Our approach is different. It's the new way of doing things, in the cloud. And that's very compelling when you have these large attacks where you really can't defend yourself by buying a box and sticking it in your data center and even your carrier really can't effectively defend you against these very large attacks. So we're seeing excellent traction. And over time, I think you're seeing us take share from the traditional way of doing things and add to the overall growth of the market with a new way of doing things. So the business is growing very rapidly.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jennifer Lowe, Morgan Stanley.","Jennifer Swanson Lowe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Maybe even following up a little bit on the last set of questions. About -- I think yesterday there was an announcement out in terms of a partnership you all had entered into with Microsoft around investing in security businesses in Israel. And first time I think I've seen you all working with Microsoft, so it was sort of interesting in that regard. And then, obviously, security is a big focus area as well. Can you talk a little bit about that project specifically? What the opportunities you see there are? And how that sort of came about in concert with Microsoft?","F. Thomson Leighton","Sure. That's an investment in very early stage startups. Of course, Akamai has its roots in the 50k competition at MIT. And Israel is a great place for hiring security talent. It's a great place for startups and security startups. And so that's a really good place for us to partner with Microsoft in investing and supporting early-stage security companies. You hope for a long-term payoff there. We have a large and growing presence in Israel where we base a lot of our security development. So it's a perfect location for us. We have a great partnership with Microsoft, and it just makes a lot of sense all the way around.","Jennifer Swanson Lowe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And then, just shifting gears quickly, one last one for me. As you -- I think in the past you've talked about the potential for acceleration throughout this year as all of the hiring from last year starts to reap productivity and there's a life factor there, but this seems like that this might be the point where we start to see that take hold a little bit. Is that still the expectation as you think about -- and I know the first question got into this a little bit -- but as you see the sales people start to hit the road and start to bring in business, has that trended in line with maybe where you thought that would be 6 months ago? Better or worse? What's sort of the color on that?","James Benson","Yes. And I think, in general, there's a lot of things that obviously affect revenue growth, right? The sales productivity is but one aspect. Obviously, traffic volumes, pricing volumes or pricing impacts. There's a lot of things that affect growth, but we are very pleased with the hiring that we made on sales. We are very pleased with kind of the overall productivity that we're seeing across the business. I'm not going to guide beyond the current quarter. You can obviously see from the Q3 guide that we're guiding to a pretty strong guide again, a continuation of what was strong growth in Q1, strong growth in Q2, expected strong growth in Q3. And certainly, the sales reps that we are hiring are selling into the installed base more of our solutions, as well as selling off the installed base. So, in general, I think -- we track it by cohort class. I can't tell you that every single rep is tracking to our expectations because that would -- that's not true, but you wouldn't have expected that anyway. And I think, in general, the reps by cohort class are tracking pretty well, and I think the expectations that we set earlier, we're still comfortable with that and the investments that we're making and the return that we're going to get.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Sameet Sinha, B. Riley.","Sameet Sinha - B. Riley Caris, Research Division","Couple of questions. Can you tell us what the contribution was from Prolexic during the quarter? And secondly, you mentioned number of security customers at 1,500. This is up from about 1,250 that you had at the end of Q1. Do you think that is the kind of pace that we should be expecting throughout the year? Or is there anything specific that helped you increase the number of customers by that much this quarter?","James Benson","Sure. I think we told you in the -- after the last quarter's earnings, we're not going to break Prolexic out separately. But what I can tell you is what I shared last time is Prolexic's run rate was about $5 million a month. So call it $15 million a quarter, so you have a frame of reference of roughly the size of Prolexic. And relative to the customer ads on the security front, you're right, we were very pleased. This is kind of the first full quarter of having Prolexic and our broader security portfolio. We have not added that many of kind of net new customers in the security portfolio really in -- I don't think ever. So we're quite pleased with that traction, and we expect that the demand for our security portfolio is very strong.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Richard Fetyko, ABR Investment Strategy.","Richard Fetyko - ABR Investment Strategy LLC","Just backing into the organic growth rate in the performance and security solutions segment, excluding Prolexic in the first quarter and the second quarter's estimate. It looks like the organic PSS growth slightly decelerated from perhaps 23% in the first to 20% year-over-year in the third. Just curious if we should see any acceleration in the organic business or if there were any specific reasons why that deceleration happened.","James Benson","Yes. I mean, I think we had an extraordinarily strong performance in security growth rate in Q1. If you take kind of the 30% growth rate, even if you do the math that you just suggested, you're talking about a 20% rough growth rate for Q2. I mentioned that the custom government business was lighter, so projects in Q2 were lighter. That is in the performance and security portfolio. That's one element of the portfolio that tends to be a little bit lumpier based on projects that you have with the federal government. But we were quite pleased with the growth rates that we saw in performance and security. And there are going to be things, quarter-to-quarter, like custom projects. I recall, last Q2 we had a very strong quarter last Q2. We talked about -- we had a very strong custom government quarter last Q2. And we also talked about the fact that we had a very, very large upgrade of our IP accelerator solution with one particularly large customer. So kind of having the wraparound effect of that. But organically, across kind of the performance and security portfolio, we're quite pleased with the growth rates.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ed Maguire, CLSA.","Edward Maguire - CLSA Limited, Research Division","I was wondering if you could comment on the cross-selling success so far with performance and security and the media business. I know you've mentioned the number of common customers between Prolexic and the Kona Security, but was curious as to how that -- the focus on security is progressing more broadly across the customer base.","James Benson","Yes, I mean, I would say -- one proof point is kind of the question I was asked earlier, the kind of the -- call it the net security kind of customers add of over 250, I think tells you that those were sold to the existing installed base. Those were not off the -- most of those were not off the installed base. Most of those were kind of embedded into the installed base. So I think we're doing early signs of traction with Prolexic, we're getting good penetration. I think we're getting decent penetration across the board. I can tell you, though, a lot of room for growth beyond that, that we still have very low penetration rates of kind of security with kind of our broader customer base. So we think this is a huge opportunity to kind of sell more security and sell more of our broader offerings to our customers, as well as off the installed base. So I think there's a lot of opportunity for incremental growth.","Edward Maguire - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Great. And just a pulse check on the wireless, the Aqua Ion. How are -- how is the penetration proceeding among your existing customers?","F. Thomson Leighton","I would say the penetration is small and growing. We see significant uplift in pricing, and there's significant interest, of course, in the product with the situational awareness, the optimization for cellular communication and making the website be really fast for a variety of situations with the end user, a variety of devices and a variety of locations. So Ion is a strong product, financially, with plenty of room for growth. So the overall penetration is still low, as with security, but achieving good success in terms of the upsell and, of course, in terms of the performance capabilities.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of James Breen, William Blair.","James D. Breen - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just one more question on the hiring and then one on the technology side. On the hiring side, you hired, I think, about 100 salespeople last year and you'd hinted that you would hire somewhere around that number this year. Is that part of what you're pushing out or has that been pretty consistent throughout the year? And then, secondly, just on the technology side, as you look at the traffic from the World Cup relative to maybe the Sochi Olympics and the London Olympics. Are you seeing any trends there in terms of moving more towards the wireless side relative to wireline and regionally?","James Benson","So I'll take the hiring kind of question. So I'd say again, we're not going to provide guidance of how many sales hires. We did that last year, I think, because we were trying to make a point that the company was hiring more sales reps last year, I think, than we had in the last 5 years combined. We're going to hire a similar -- roughly similar amount this year, whether it's 100, whether it's 80 remains to be seen. And it's not so much pushing out hiring. I just want to make sure that I'm clear that we're not pushing out hiring from Q2 to Q3. This was hiring that we had aggressive hiring plans for the first half of the year. Some of that hiring has moved into Q3, but it's not like this conscious push to Q3. And from a sales perspective, that I'd say our sales hiring is tracking pretty well.","F. Thomson Leighton","Yes, to the second question. We're seeing across the board a very rapid growth in the penetration of mobile devices. On aggregate, you can think of roughly half of transactions being done with a mobile device now. Now traffic measured by bits is lower, a lower percentage, because when you're doing video and so forth, you'll tend to get lower bit rates to those devices. And most of the wireless device traffic and transactions are on Wi-Fi. So it's not cellular coming out of a tower. Cellular is still a relatively small percentage overall, but also growing.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Gray Powell, Wells Fargo Security.","Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Great. I just had a couple, if I may. So first, I just want to make sure that I'm thinking of Q3 guidance correctly. Specifically, the midpoint of guidance implies $13 million of revenue in Q3, whereas the past 2 years, the guide has been more like 6 or 7 -- I'm sorry, $6 million or $8 million in sequential revenue growth. So I guess, my question is where is the strength coming from? Is it more of the CDN side or performance and security side?","James Benson","Again, I'm not going to provide guidance by business, but I can tell you that our expectation is you're going to see strong growth across the entire portfolio. And I think you correctly outlined it that we're pretty bullish, that's why the guidance is pretty strong here at the midpoint. We're expecting a continuation of kind of strong performance in media, strong performance in performance and security and strong performance in service and support.","Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then just one more, if I may. Can you talk about your partnership with Open DNS on the security side? And how do you feel about the security portfolio today? Do you see an opportunity to add new technologies beyond DDoS and Web Application Firewall? And specifically, can we see Akamai doing something more like cloud-based URL filtering or email security or maybe something else down the road?","F. Thomson Leighton","Yes. We have a rich roadmap ahead in security. The next area for us that you'll start to see products is on client reputation database, where we're looking at a particular client and trying to decide are they a legitimate user or is it an attacker of some kind or some kind of a bot, which might be a friendly bot or an unfriendly bot. And providing that information to our customers as a request comes in so that they can decide do they want to accept the request, alert the request or block the request. Even if the request itself doesn't look malicious, maybe that's because it's a new form of attack that hasn't been seen before. Or maybe it's some kind of a bot that they decide that they don't want to admit to the site. So that's the next product that we're working on and that we hope to have a beta version available later this year. And there's a rich roadmap from there that yes we might well be doing things like URL filtering and preventing man-in-the-middle attacks. I don't know about email filtering, that's not coming up anytime soon, that we get into the email business per se. But I think there'll be a very rich roadmap for security, especially as we do more and more with enterprises and their traffic.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jeff Van Rhee, Craig-Hallum.","Jeffrey Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Several quick ones for you. First, just in terms of renewals. While you have big renewals in any given quarter, any notable renewal patterns we should be thinking about the next few quarters? And then second question, as it relates to the landscape around security, could you just touch on the competitive landscape: when you are competing, just clarify for us who is the toe-to-toe typical if you're in there competing against somebody.","James Benson","So on the renewal front, I'll let take that, I'll let Tom comment on the security landscape. But I think you kind of answered the question yourself, which is that we have large customers that renew every quarter, and we're going to continue to see large customers renew every quarter. There's nothing more notable in that. Obviously, I shared a few quarters ago one specific customer because they were our largest customer, and they were a customer that was pretty darn close to a 10% revenue customer so -- but I think, outside of that customer, it's just standard renewal that happen every quarter and a handful of large customers.","F. Thomson Leighton","In terms of the competitive landscape for the security products, I would say the dominant players out there today where most of the revenue goes are the folks that build devices that you would deploy in your data center. Now the big problem with that as we move forward is that the attacks are so large in many cases that the connectivity at the data center becomes overwhelmed. So even if the device is doing a good job, it never gets a chance really, and then the site is DoS-ed or brought down. Carriers, many of them provide security solutions. Many of them also we sell Akamai. The carriers will try to provide some kind of a clean pipe. And again, you have the capacity challenges. The carrier solutions often are not able to inspect the packets that really limits what they can do. They take a while to be turned on, which can be a problem, they're sort of reactive and slow to react. And they can hurt the performance of the site. So even when they can defend the site, the site is sort of compromised in terms of its ability to do its job performance-wise. I think you're starting to see -- there's a lot of start-ups out there claiming to have various kind of security products. You see the CDNs, some of them trying to have a security offering. I think for the state-of-the-art attacks out there, really, our solution, combined now with Prolexic, provides really something that's special, and that you just can't get other places that really works. And Akamai is a performance company and so we've made sure that when we're defending the site and filtering the traffic, there's not a big performance degradation. The site still is going to work really fast, and it could be on in a proactive manner. We have enormous scale compared to any of the competitors because our servers are inside over 1,200 networks. As we talked about earlier, we'll deliver a World Cup game at 7 terabits a second, and the big attacks out there that overwhelm a lot of the competing services are a tiny fraction of that. So we have tremendous scale to bring to bear to defend websites, and I think that's why you see the business growing so fast with a lot of the marquee brands now turning to Akamai for the next generation of security defenses.","Operator","Your next question will be from the line of Ben Rose, Battle Road.","Ben Z. Rose - Battle Road Research Ltd.","Yes. Question for Tom. Looking out beyond the third quarter, can you provide an update on your ongoing R&D relationship with Cisco and your expectation for the hybrid cloud optimization market?","F. Thomson Leighton","Yes, sure. Now, tomorrow, Cisco is making their new router that has what's called Akamai Connect or Akamai software on board generally available. So that hits the marketplace tomorrow. Obviously, we're very interested to see that product become successful in the market. The beta test results are excellent. The product provides significant offload for the WAN and the branch office connectivity. So it allows that infrastructure to do a lot more and it provides significant speedup for branch office applications, Internet access, the basic kinds of things you want to be doing in the branch office. And so, we're very optimistic. That's a product that will be sold by Cisco in the Cisco channel. We're obviously supporting that as best we can, but that's a Cisco-led effort with Akamai software on board. There is a rich roadmap beyond that first product to do more, and we have a very good relationship with Cisco in R&D and are looking forward to the release tomorrow.","Ben Z. Rose - Battle Road Research Ltd.","Okay, great. And then a question for Jim. I know the company has obviously done a really outstanding job over the last several quarters of wringing out some of the inefficiencies in the network and improving gross margins. Do you think that there's further room, going forward, to achieve the kinds of efficiencies that you've achieved in the last year?","James Benson","I mean -- I think we do it every quarter, we do it every year. You're right. Notably, over the last 3 years, it's been a pretty impressive improvement in gross margins for the company. And I have to kind of really give the credit to our network and media team, they've just done a fantastic job, and you can expect that we're going to continue to have ongoing platform efficiency initiatives that can kind of maintain the level of gross margins that we have. I'm not calling, obviously, in the guidance that it's going to improve, but I think we can maintain the margins at the levels that we're currently at.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Philip Winslow, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Sitikantha Panigrahi - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is Siti Panigrahi for Phil Winslow. So one more question on the gross margin side. Could you give us some color on like what you are seeing in terms of co-location and bandwidth costs? And maybe what you have seen through first half and what do you expect in the second half?","James Benson","Yes. Again, we continue to make progress on driving kind of the bandwidth per kind of megabit per second down. So our bandwidth costs continue to trend down nicely, not on an actual dollar basis, but kind of on a per-bit basis. And the same is true for co-location costs. So we have a whole playbook that is focused on areas that are going to be able to reduce bandwidth costs. Areas that can help us reduce co-location costs, areas that can help us build kind of reduced costs and optimized costs associated with kind of network broader buildout. So you can expect that we're going to continue to kind of initiate all those initiatives, not just this quarter, but the second half of the year and beyond.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Kevin Smithen, Macquarie.","Kevin R. Smithen - Macquarie Research","First of all, nice job with the guidance, especially with the customer repricing and all the investments. Wanted to ask you, as we see more high-def and 4K sporting events and online gaming more pervasive -- online content more pervasive, do you think that we're going to see a new normal in terms of growth rates for the media business over the next couple of years? And how do you sort of think about the trade-off with some of the large media customers between sort of these -- this extra traffic and margins? And do you continue to expect to give volume discounts to those big customers or will you try and diversify the customer base more than, say, 2 to 3 years ago?","F. Thomson Leighton","Obviously, as -- if and when 4K becomes more widespread, that provides dramatic increase in traffic for every hour of video that's watched online. 4K has obviously not penetrated the market yet. We do support it on our platform, but it's not widely adopted. Traffic is growing at a rapid rate. There is the potential over a period of several to many years for several orders of magnitude of growth in the online traffic. Of course, pricing is going to need to come down, and we've talked in the past about the many things we're doing to make video be more affordable online. But on balance, when you multiply the traffic growth rates with the price reductions, we believe that revenues have a lot of room for growth going forward. And we're very bullish about our media business, as I've talked about before. Of course, as customers get larger and push more traffic, they do get traffic discounts, but that's already factored into our estimates as we look forward.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of David Dixon, FBR Capital Markets.","David Michael Dixon - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Yes. So I wondered if, first of all, you could just give us a general sense of the momentum that you're seeing, or to the extent you're seeing momentum in the mobile space, which is a key area of growth for you? And then, secondly, as you were talking about your advantages in the marketplace and you centered in on the scalability of the platform. One of the other things that I think seems to be an advantage is the customer responsiveness relative to the telcos. And in talking to some the major enterprises that we speak who checks the -- they don't really care if it's in the cloud or in their own enterprise, as long as that stack can be evaluated for attacks and analysis. So I wanted to actually ask you a question around the network compute capability and whether you see the need to overhaul or significantly augment that compute capability as you see Google stepping forth and investing very aggressively, very heavily in, perhaps, hundreds of data centers here with that compute capability.","F. Thomson Leighton","Sure. First on the mobile question, as I mentioned before, we're seeing a rapid penetration of mobile devices that if you measure in terms of applications that we would transact, roughly half being on a mobile device. Now the large majority of that is on Wi-Fi so, ultimately, it's going across a landline connection. Still, a small fraction of mobile is over cellular. And also, if you measure not by transactions but by gigabytes delivered, mobile will have a lower penetration because you don't tend to get the really high-def video that takes a lot of traffic going to a mobile device that's -- usually you're going to send that to a much larger screen that's a fixed device. Yes, we do have tremendous advantages and scalability, but also in sophistication and capability of our defenses. Now in terms of the question on network compute, we do offer compute kinds of capabilities in the specific use case of your website and something that needs to be done for the website. So for example, say, you're an automotive site and you want to do a car configurator so that the user can design their car online, well that kind of thing can be supported by Akamai's platform. I don't think you're going to see us go into direct competition with EC2 or with Google in terms of building out gigantic data centers just for compute capabilities -- for generic compute capability. We are focused around making a website and a web app be fast, reliable and secure. And so we will offer capabilities that support that in terms of storage or compute and delivery, not generic compute for the sake of compute.","David Michael Dixon - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","You're not seeing any competition from Google or signs of competition in the area that you're focused at this stage?","F. Thomson Leighton","No. I wouldn't say that we see competition from Google. Google does a lot of delivering of content, of course, and they do a lot of that themselves, but that's not really directly competitive to Akamai. We worry about all of the large guys out there in terms of what their capabilities are, but we don't really see them in the marketplace competing for our business.","Operator","Your next question will be from the line of Chad Bartley, Pacific Crest.","Chad Bartley - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Wanted to go back to the competition topic. As you look out medium to longer term, how much of a threat are networks either launching competitive CDN services or maybe large media companies connecting directly to them? And in terms of the outlook, I mean, based on your previous second half EBITDA margin guidance and your updated Q3 outlook, should we be thinking about Q4 EBITDA margin also in the 41% to 42% range?","F. Thomson Leighton","All right. Let me take the first question on competition. And again, the competition really depends on the product area. It's different for video delivery or media delivery than it is from making a web application be super fast for mobile, and that's different than the competition for security. Now in terms of your specific questions about networks as competitors, I'd say there's been a lot of improvement there over the last few years. For example, AT&T used to be a large competitor for Akamai. And now, they're one of our largest partners. Orange in France, Telefonica in Spain, KT in Korea, Swisscom, Turk Telecom, a lot of the world's leading carriers have switched from a model of competing with us, either by buying CDN capabilities from a vendor or developing it themselves, to using Akamai's technology. So they're part of the Akamai family and they integrate very well with us and resell our products. So I'd say that, yes, there's some carriers out there that compete with us, for sure, but that I would say the trend is more that they are moving to work cooperatively with Akamai. And that's because I think we offer the most compelling solutions when it comes to making a website or an app be fast, reliable and secure. And we can do that at a better cost and a better performance than they've been able to do on their own. It is certainly true that any large media company, to your other -- your point, will be looking at do-it-yourself. I think we've said probably for 15 years now, that do-it-yourself is our largest competitor, and you can certainly find examples of that. That said, a lot of the folks that do that still use us for a lot of their business, and they do that again because we do really a very good job of accelerating their content and defending their websites at a very good price point. And there's some pretty high-profile examples of major media companies that did try to build it themselves, spent years doing it and ultimately gave up and returned to Akamai. So I think do-it-yourself is always going to be a factor in the marketplace for us with the very largest media companies. I don't think direct peering makes sense or you'll actually see that for any but a very small number, maybe a handful of the big media guys. The complexity of trying to manage direct peering with 12 dozens or hundreds or thousands of the ISPs out there is really complicated, and the expense in doing that is quite significant. And so it just doesn't make sense to even be tried for any but a handful of the big media guys. So that really doesn't worry me very much.","James Benson","And on the EBITDA question. I'm not going to provide guidance obviously beyond Q3, but I think I said kind of in my opening comments that we expect to operate in the near term in the low-40s EBITDA. So I think you kind of have what we're expecting to do in Q3 and I think you can expect that we're going to continue to operate kind of in that range, kind of in the near term.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions in queue. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Tom Barth for any closing remarks.","Tom Barth","Okay. We'd just like to thank you again for joining us today on the earnings call.

Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Tom Barth","Thank you, Gigi. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Akamai's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Benson, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.","Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the Company's view on October 29, 2018. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances.","As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of akamai.com.","And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom.","Thomson Leighton","Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. Akamai delivered excellent results in the third quarter. Revenue was $670 million, up 7% over Q3 of last year and up 8% in constant currency, with continued very strong performance for our security products and continued improvement in our Media and Carrier Division. Q3 non-GAAP EPS was $0.94 per diluted share, up 47% year-over-year. This very strong result was driven by our solid revenue growth, the impact of cost reductions made over the past year and a lower tax rate.","EBITDA margins in Q3 improved to 41%, and non-GAAP operating margins improved to 27%. This mark the fourth consecutive quarter of improving margins and we expect further improvements by the end of the year. Looking further ahead, we are now confident that we can achieve non-GAAP operating margins of 30% in 2020, while continuing to invest in innovation and new products to drive our future growth.","In Q3, our security portfolio was again the fastest growing part of our business, with revenue of $169 million, up 39% over Q3 of last year in constant currency. Our security business accounted for 25% of our total Q3 revenue and exited the quarter at a run rate of nearly $700 million per year, making Akamai one of the world's largest cloud security providers.","Our security products received accolades from two leading analyst firms last month. Gartner named Akamai as a leader in its Magic Quadrant for Web application firewalls for the second year in a row. And Forrester named Akamai as a leader in its new wave for Bot Management, giving Akamai\u2019s our highest rating possible for attack response, threat research, reporting and analysis, roadmap and market approach.","In a world where lots of claims are made by competing companies, it's gratifying to receive this level of recognition from the world's leading industry analyst firms. There are several reasons why Akamai is a leader in Cybersecurity. Our track record of innovation and emphasis on R&D combined with smart and accretive acquisitions. Our edge platforms enormous capacity and close proximity to users and devices, the insights in real-time data we gained from protecting so many of the world's leading enterprises, and our team of experts who provide exceptional customer service and support.","Many of our customers have told us that they simply have too much at stake to risk their business on anything less. Most of our security revenue today is based on protecting public-facing websites and applications from denial of service and application-layer attacks. We've also been developing novel products to protect internal enterprise applications. And I am very pleased to report that these new products have been gaining traction.","Bookings in Q3 for our Enterprise Application Access and Enterprise Threat Protector services were up 30% over Q2 and up more than fourfold over Q3 of last year. Our new enterprise security customers include leading companies such as one of the largest banks in the UK, a $10 billion travel company, a $4 billion luxury fashion brand, two of the world's leading consulting firms and a $30 billion media company.","We believe that our new enterprise security offerings are gaining traction because they provide the core capabilities needed for a zero-trust security architecture. It's called zero-trust because enterprises can no longer assume that any device or employee on their internal network is trustworthy, as because employees sometimes click on the wrong link and accidentally import malware, which can then lead to a very costly data breach.","As a result, we've seen growing interest in new architectures that protect internal applications by granting access at the application layer instead of the network layer. This approach avoids exposing corporate networks through a VPN and eliminates the need to manage complex network firewall rules.","As the value of such a disruptive solution becomes apparent to more customers, we expect the adoption of our new enterprise security services to continue their rapid growth. We've also integrated our market leading Kona Site Defender technology into our zero-trust solution.","So that if an employee or internal device is compromised, we can help prevent the infection from spreading to other enterprise applications or from gaining access to sensitive data, and as an added benefit for global companies, we can also integrate our Ion solution to substantially improve the performance of enterprise applications for employees around the world.","Turning to our divisional results for the quarter, Web Division customers generated $357 million in revenue in the third quarter, up 9% in constant currency over Q3 of last year with continued strong traction for our new products such as mPulse, Image Manager and Bot Manager.","We've been seeing positive results by offering bundled solutions to customers that want the ability to leverage multiple Akamai products. Bundles that combine our security and performance products have proven to be especially popular, and they also provide a strong advantage over competitors that have only point solutions or rudimentary security capabilities.","Revenue for our Media and Carrier Division in Q3 was $313 million, up 7% in constant currently over Q3 of last year. Traffic growth remain very strong in our OTT and gaming sectors and was higher than published reports in the Internet as a whole. Growing traffic faster than the Internet as a whole means that we continue to gain share.","In fact to meet the increasing demand from our customers, we added about as much traffic in the past year alone as the total capacity claimed by many of our competitors. As you know, some of these competitors are preparing to go public or trying to be sold. In such circumstances, it's not uncommon for a company to take potshots with the established market leader, which in this case of course is Akamai. This kind of activity has been such a regular occurrence over the last 15 to 20 years that some analysts have referred to these companies as YAAKs, spelled Y-A-A-K, which stands for yet another Akamai killer.","To be clear, we take all our competitors very seriously and we strive to take the high road when it comes to talking about the competition. In that spirit, I want to take a few minutes today to set the record straight on some of the things we understand competitors have been saying about us.","One claim being made by the competition is that they're taking customers away from us. Of course, when you have many thousands of customers and well over $2.5 billion of revenue, there will always be some level of customer churn. But at Akamai, our churn rate is very low. In fact, our total competitive churn over the past year has amounted to a very low single-digit percentage of revenue.","Moreover, our competitive churn rate declined over the past year. And in cases where we have lost customers to a competitor in the past, we found that many subsequently returned to Akamai because of our superior capabilities, such as the $10 billion retailer who came back to Akamai after they experienced Web performance issues and had security concerns with credential stuffing when using our competitors\u2019 services.","Another claim we've heard is that our competition can offer comparable service for less. The reality is that our competitors can't match Akamai when it comes to reliability, performance, and scale. Just considered the way we delivered the recent World Cup tournament, where three of our largest competitors had glaring and well-publicized failures.","Few of our competitors have security capabilities and we believe that none offer the level or breadth of protection provided by Akamai. And we don't rush features to market while making excuses like one competitor did last month when they acknowledge that their web gateway and browser extension needed more time to mature into a secure and reliable platform.","Akamai customers don't want to wait for a secure and reliable platform and they don't have to. As noted by independent research firm IDC, Akamai\u2019s had the strongest and broadest edge security offering for quite some time. To deflect attention away from the immaturity of their platforms, some competitors say that our edge architecture is outdated or that they are centralized data centers are somehow superior.","The reality is that we believe our edge architecture with the 240,000 servers that we positioned in 3,900 locations in more than 1,000 cities across 143 countries delivers vastly superior scale, performance and security. Our competitors simply don't have the scale or the reach to serve customers at the edge the way we do and you just can't do what we do with a few dozen or even a 100 points of presence.","Our reach at the edge is why so many of the world's leading enterprises choose Akamai when it comes to delivering their media, accelerating their applications, and protecting their most important assets. We also believe that the competitive differentiation provided by our unique edge architecture will become even more important in the future as traffic volumes increased by a factor of 10 to 100 or more as billions of devices get connected and the cyber attacks increase in size and sophistication.","The core of the Internet just doesn't have the scale or proximity to end users and devices to keep up with ever increasing demands. The edge of the Internet is where our customers connect with their end users and that is where their digital experiences must be fast, intelligent, and secure. It's gratifying that the analyst community is now embracing the importance of our edge architecture.","Gartner recently published a report titled The Edge Will Eat the Cloud, which predicts that while cloud providers will extend their models closer to the edge, the architecture of the edge will be driven more by technologies that already have physical edge footprints. Akamai pioneered the edge platform, and we've been building upon it for 20 years, giving us a physical edge footprint that we believe is virtually impossible to replicate.","For years, our competitors have been saying this, being at the edge didn't matter. Now, some have started using the word edge in the naming of their solutions. There is an enormous difference between saying you're at the edge and actually being there, and it shows up on the quality and security of your solutions. In our view, no amount of renaming can change the fact that our competitors are bound by the limitations of their centralized models.","Some new entrants claim to have leapfrogged us in terms of their technology. The reality is that Akamai has an excellent track record when it comes to technology, leadership and market transforming innovation. Akamai pioneered edge computing as part of our edge suite service over 15 years-ago. We've extended our edge platform to the client and added the capabilities necessary to support the Internet of Things. And today, we are building a blockchain platform that's designed to perform more than a million transactions a second.","The amount we invest in R&D on an annual basis is more than many of our competitors annual revenue. We have more engineers innovating than most competitors have in total headcount. And we've also made smart acquisitions that we believe have enhanced our offerings and have delivered strong value to our customers and shareholders, including Cyberfend in Bot Management, Nominum in Security, Soha in Enterprise Security, and SOASTA in Performance Management. We have also made it much easier for developers and admins to use our services and to build amazing digital experiences for their customers.","Over 1,000 developers in 24 cities attended our recent DevOps world tour, where we received very favorable feedback for the significant enhancements we've made in our developer experience.","Competitors don't invest as much as we do an innovation. So we've been told that they say our infrastructure is costly and inefficient. The reality is that each business that Akamai runs on the same, Akamai intelligent edge platform, which gives us excellent leverage in terms of cost.","For example, last quarter, we decreased our overall spend on bandwidth and Colo, while delivering significantly more traffic than we did a year-ago. Our advances in software have helped us to reduce the amount we spend on network CapEx to less than 6% of revenue. In Q3 our gross margins were 77%, EBITDA margins were 41% and operating margins were 27%. We challenge any competitor who calls our platform inefficient to show you anything close to our margins and profitability.","Looking across the competitive landscape, I don't see anyone in the marketplace I'd want to trade places with. It's not even close. We're the market leader in Media Delivery, application acceleration, DDoS prevention, Web application protection, and Bot management. But rest assured that we know that we can never be complacent and we will never stand still.","We're committed to providing superior customer value in everything that we do and we intend to continue our great track record of innovative R&D, our success in bringing disruptive technologies to market and to providing our customers with exceptional services and support.","In summary, I'm very pleased with our Q3 results, including the very strong performance in our security business that continued improvement and our Media and Carrier Division, the expansion of our margins for the fourth quarter in a row, and the excellent growth on the bottom line.","I'll now turn it over to Jim to review our financials and guidance to the rest of the year. Jim?","James Benson","Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As Tom outlined, Akamai had another strong quarter, exceeding the high-end of our guidance on revenues, operating margins and earnings and delivering substantial operating margin improvement for the fourth consecutive quarter.","We continue to execute well and demonstrate the leverage in Akamai\u2019s operating model and we have growing competence we both have a path to and can achieve our goal of 30% non-GAAP operating margins in 2020.","Moving to our strong third quarter results, revenue came in above the high-end of our guidance range at $670 million, up 7% year-over-year or 8% in constant currency, and up 10% in constant currency if you exclude the six large Internet Platform Customers. Notably, this is the third straight quarter of double-digit revenue growth when you exclude the Internet platform giants.","Revenue growth with solid across the business, with the primary overachievement compared to guidance driven by an acceleration in growth for our security solutions and higher media traffic volume than we anticipated going into the quarter.","Revenue from Media and Carrier Division customers was $313 million in the third quarter, up 6% year-over-year or 7% in constant currency and up a healthy 12% in constant currency, excluding the large Internet Platform Customers.","Revenue from the Internet Platform Customers was $43 million in the third quarter, roughly consistent with Q2 levels and in line with our expectations. It is important to note the Internet Platform Customers now only represent 6% of total Akamai revenues. The lowest level of such customer concentration in memory and a testament to our continued progress on diversifying our revenue base across customers, solutions, and geographies.","Media Division revenue and traffic outside the Internet giant continue to be strong across the core installed base with particularly robust growth coming from our gaming and video delivery verticals. Our Media and Carrier Division management team remains focused on capturing more traffic share and improving the quality of delivery for the top 250 media customers that account for most of our traffic and revenue.","We continue to be pleased with the revenue acceleration associated with our traffic capture efforts over the past several quarters. In addition to traffic gains in media, we are also very pleased with the continuous security growth in the Media Division. As Tom highlighted in his earlier remarks, security is a key differentiator versus our competition and that is true in the Media Division as well.","Moving now to our Web Division, revenue for this set of customers was $357 million, up 8% year-over-year or 9% in constant currency and consistent with Q2 growth levels. We continued to see a very strong uptake in our new product areas, namely Image Manager, Digital Performance Management, and Bot Manager as well as further strong growth and adoption of our core Kona and Prolexic Cloud Security Solutions.","Turning now to our results for our Cloud Security Solutions, third quarter revenue was $169 million, up 37% year-over-year or 39% in constant currency, and yet another quarter of tremendous revenue growth and customer adoption for our Cloud Security Solutions globally.","We are particularly pleased to see accelerating revenue growth and our security offerings in Q3 from both the Web and Media Division customer base. Entering the fourth quarter, our Cloud Security business now as an annualized revenue run rate of nearly $700 million and represents over a quarter of our total revenues.","We believe security remains a significant growth opportunity for us and we plan to continue to invest in this area with a focus on further enhancing our product portfolio and extending our go-to-market capabilities.","Moving on to our geographies, sales in our international markets represented over 38% of total revenue in Q3, up slightly from Q2 levels. International revenue was $257 million in the third quarter, up 21% year-over-year with 24% in constant currency driven by continued strong growth in our Asia Pacific region and a solid quarter in our EMEA region.","Due to the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact on revenue of $6 million on a sequential basis and $5 million on a year-over-year basis. Finally, revenue from our U.S. market, which $413 million consistent with Q2 levels.","Moving onto costs, cash gross margin was 77%, up slightly from Q2 levels and up over a point from the same period last year. We continue to excel well on our platform efficiency initiatives. For the first time in memory, our bandwidth and co-location expenses on an absolute basis declined year-over-year despite the significant increase in traffic over the same period.","And as we highlighted at our June Analyst Day, we have several ongoing platform efficiency initiatives in place intended to drive further improvements from current levels. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation was 64% roughly consistent with Q2 levels and up slightly from the same period last year.","Non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $244 million, below the low-end of our guidance and down about $4 million from Q2 levels due to continued traction with our operational efficiency efforts. Notably, we are seeing some early progress in our cost transformation actions to better optimize and reduce third-party spend, particularly in IT. We expect additional improvements in this area as well as the other efficiency areas we outlined at our June Analyst Day.","Moving out of profitability, adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $273 million, up $11 million from Q2 levels in a $42 million or 18% from the same period last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in one point above the high-end of our guidance range as 41%, a one point improvement from Q2 levels and four points from the same period last year, with most of the strong achievement coming from the operational efficiency actions taken over the last 12 months. ","Non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter was $181 million, up $11 million from Q2 levels and up $34 million or 23% from the same period last year and growing nearly three times the rate of revenue growth. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 27% up over one point from Q2 levels, and also one point about the high end of our guidance range.","I am very pleased with the four consecutive quarters of margin expansion we have seen as a result of our ongoing efficiency efforts and we believe our continued hard work will drive further operating margin improvements in Q4.","Furthermore, we feel confident we can achieve our 30% non-GAAP operating margin goal in 2020, while continuing to make the required investments to drive both growth and further scale and leverage in the business.","Moving now to CapEx, capital expenditures in Q3, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense for $125 million and in line with our guidance. As we mentioned when we set our guidance in July, Q3 included large facility build-outs in Bangalore and Costa Rica, integral investments in support of our ongoing efficiency efforts to align work to these lower cost centers of excellence. We are also early in the early phases of our new Cambridge headquarter built-out and we expect facility-related spend for that project to increase in Q4 and 2019.","Moving on to earnings. Non-GAAP net income was $158 million or $0.94 of earnings per diluted share and growing 47% over the same period last year and coming in $0.08 above the high end of our guidance range. These strong earnings results were driven by strong topline execution continued operating expense improvement and a lower tax rate.","Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $31 million based on a Q3 effective tax rate of 16.5%, which equates to a year-to-date effective tax rate of roughly 18.5%. This Q3 effective tax rate is 3.5 points lower than our guidance due primarily to our higher mix of foreign earnings and the resulting year-to-date true-up in the quarter.","Moving on to GAAP earnings. GAAP net income for the third quarter was $108 million or $0.64 of earnings per diluted share and growing 73% from the same period last year.","Now, I will review our use of capital. We continue to focus on the importance of returning capital to our shareholders. During the quarter, we spent $440 million on share repurchases, buying back roughly 6 million shares. For the year, we have spent $626 million of our $750 million 2018 authorization, which has resulted in our share count declining from 171 million shares at the beginning of the year to 168 million shares in the third quarter.","We plan to be quite active in repurchasing shares in Q4 and spending at least the remaining $124 million by the end of 2018. Additionally, today we announced that our Board is authorizing new $1.1 billion share repurchase program running from November until the end of 2021.","Going forward, we intend to continue returning to our shareholders a significant percentage of our free cash flow to share repurchases balanced against preserving our flexibility for other strategic opportunities. We believe this approach will allow us to continue driving shareholder value through investing organically in the business, pursuing additional M&A and returning capital to stockholders via sharing purchases. In summary, we are very pleased with our strong execution in Q3 and year-to-date.","Looking to the fourth quarter, we are expecting another strong quarter on the top and bottom lines. As always holiday seasonality plays a large role in determining our financial performance for the fourth quarter, driven by online retail activity for our e-commerce customers and traffic for our large media customers. As a result, the fourth quarter remains the hardest to predict.","In addition, we expect further foreign exchange headwinds in Q4 from the continuing strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which has been notable in the last few weeks in particular. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact on Q4 revenue of over $3 million compared to Q3 levels and an $8 million impact year-over-year.","Taking into account, these foreign exchange headwinds combined with typical holiday seasonality, we are projecting Q4 revenue in the range of $692 million to $709 million. To frame this guidance range, which is slightly wider in Q4 due to seasonal variability, if the online holiday season is exceptionally strong, we would expect to be near the higher end of the revenue range. The online holiday season is not as strong, and we would expect to be towards the lower end of the range.","At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of roughly 78%, up one point from Q3 levels, and GAAP gross margins of 66%, up two points from Q3. Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $254 million to $259 million, up from Q3 levels due primarily to a typical year end incentive compensation expenses. Factoring into cash gross margin and operating expense expectations that I just provided, we anticipate Q4 EBITDA margins of 42%, up one point from Q3 levels.","Moving now to depreciation. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $94 million to $96 million. Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margins of 28% for Q4, up one point from Q3 levels, up four points from Q4 2017 and our fifth consecutive quarter of margin expansion.","And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q4 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.97 to $1.03 per share, and at the midpoint would represent 42% growth from the same period last year. EPS guidance expectations assume an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of roughly 19%. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of 165 million shares.","On CapEx, we expect to spend $120 million to $130 million, excluding equity compensation in the quarter. This is consistent with Q3 levels as the facility build-out of our new Cambridge headquarter building begins to ramp up. And as I said earlier, we expect increased facility related spend for our new Cambridge headquarters in 2019. Incorporating in our Q4 guidance, for the full-year we are anticipating revenue of $2.693 billion to $2.71 billion, and at the midpoint, up $9 million from our previous guidance, despite increased foreign exchange headwinds.","EBITDA and non-GAAP operating margins of 40% and 26%, respectively, and at the high-end of the revenue range, non-GAAP operating margin could possibly even around to 27% for the full-year, which would be up nearly three points from 2017 levels. In factoring in these revenue and margin levels and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of roughly 19%.","We anticipate non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.53 to $3.59 for full-year 2018 and at the midpoint, up $0.24 from our previous full-year guidance. As a helpful reference, we will post our Q4 and full-year 2018 guidance ranges on the Investor Relations section of our website after this call.","In closing, we are very optimistic about the opportunities ahead for Akamai. We are confident in our ability to continue innovating and leveraging the Akamai\u2019s platform for new customer use cases. To achieve 30% operating margins in 2020 and to execute against the new $1.1 billion share buyback authorization over the next three years, all three, which we believe will add significant shareholder value over both the near-term and long-term.","Thank you, and Tom and I would like to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Keith Weiss","Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and a very nice quarter. I wanted to dig into the security business. [I assume that] the real outperformance, the real highlight the most recent quarter. Two questions for you. One, how should we think about the sustainability of growth? You saw nice acceleration in overall growth, but that had been declining trend line, do you think we're sort of back on an accelerating trend line today? And is there enough breadth of product so to sustain that accelerating trend line?","And then the second question comes in terms of investment. I think one of the key investor debates is whether given sort of the drive for higher operating margins, you're going to be able to invest enough in this business in terms of increased distribution, increased product and what is the really competitive space out there? How do we grow in our confidence that you guys are going to have the flexibility to invest aggressively enough behind this opportunity? Thank you.","Thomson Leighton","Yes. So we're pretty excited about the future potential for the security business. Today that revenue and almost all the growth is associated with our Kona Site Defender and Prolexic products now with Bot Management, being one of our most successful new products ever. And so that is the existing base. Bot Manager has a long way to go for growth, which is great. And then as we\u2019ve talked about on the call with our approach to enabling a zero-trust architecture, that's pretty much brand new and we're at the early stage of bookings, seeing them ramp substantially should start really making a difference with the revenue we report in 2019 and 2020.","And in the long run that has probably more potential than the existing business, which is already driving $700 million annual run rate and growing in the high 30s. So I think as you look to the future, there's a ton of runway for our security business and we're in a great position there.","Now in terms of your second question, ability to invest. Yes, I do believe that we can continue to make the margin improvement we talked about, get to 30% in 2020 and still be able to make the investments we need in security. And part of that is being very careful with how we spend our OpEx. And as you can tell, we've made great progress in the efficiency of our platform. We delivered a ton more traffic this year than last year, the dollars we spent to do that with bandwidth and Colo actually declined.","And that generates a lot of cash for us and we're focusing a lot of our investment to grow the security business. So I think with careful management of OpEx and fantastic product set and capabilities there, we got a long way to go with security growth.","Keith Weiss","Excellent. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Sterling Auty","Yes, thanks. Hi Guys. I'm going to go the other way. So if I look inside the Web Division and strip out security, the remainder of that segment I think saw the same kind of performance as we did last quarter, down about the same amount sequentially. And I think last quarter you called out competition and a few other items. I'm just wondering if you can go into a little bit more color and detail as to what you experienced specifically there and what you anticipate will happen through the end of the year?","Thomson Leighton","Yes, the performance products are performing comparable to last quarter. As we talked about last quarter, there's some pressure on our customers in that segment of commerce and retail. They've got \u2013 their hands full with some of the cloud giants in terms of competition for their businesses. That puts pressure on in terms of what they can spend. There's price pressure there. We talked about that last quarter with prices coming down a little bit faster than traffic is growing there, and so the performance products, a little bit of a flat business.","As we also talked about, we're packaging our product, security and performance products together. And in some cases that means something that might have been, a small amount of performance revenue might now get counted as part of the security bundle because these packages are being driven by our customers demand for security products.","Jim, you want to add to that?","James Benson","Maybe only other thing that I would add is that we've had \u2013 as we talked about on the last call that one of the go-to-market areas that we really focusing on is new customer acquisition. And in particular, we actually had a really strong quarter in Q3 on new customer acquisition in the Web Division actually up over 30% from Q2 level.","So we're starting to get traction on new customer acquisition. As we talked to you about in the past, we\u2019ve done exceptionally well as a company of expanding our offerings into the installed base, as evidenced by a lot of the new product traction that we have made, I think in Q2 with $170 million run rate business on an annualized basis, and it's over $220 million in Q3, so great progress on selling more to the installed base.","The area that we had some work to do was around new customer acquisition and we were quite pleased with the traction that we made in the quarter. So I think Tom is right. [There\u2019s always areas] to the portfolio that are doing better than others that we\u2019re pretty optimistic that the actions that we have in place between new customers, pricing and packaging, new product upsell that those are the right sets of actions to drive performance improvement for the company.","And I think what it also does as we talked about at the Investor Day is Akamai\u2019s revenue streams are so much more diversified now. So our strategy around investing both organically and through M&A to broaden the solution base, to broaden the customer base, and expand further into new geographies, I think is a strategy that I think is the right strategy for the company to accelerate growth.","Sterling Auty","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Sameet Sinha from B. Riley FBR. Your line is now open.","Sameet Sinha","Yes. Thank you very much. A couple of questions. So your 30% target for pro forma operating income by 2020, can you talk about the interim? I remember during the Investor Summit that you had, you spoke about more investments into DevOp tools and internal systems. So kind of \u2013 I was just trying to get a cadence for how margins would expand into 2020?","And secondly, in the CDN business, can you talk about pricing? I know you were kind of targeting these top 250 customers. You're going to be tactical about pricing. If you can talk about that and contrasts with what you're seeing in the kind of low-end performance business? Thank you.","James Benson","Sure. On the margin expansion front, we're very, very pleased. Actually the progress we've made this year to be frank is exceeded our expectations. So ending Q3 to 27% operating margins guiding 28% for Q4 that we talked a little bit about that at the June Analyst Day around the areas that we are driving. And it's a bit of a follow-up to Tom's point around. I think it was key to ask the question around, can we make the investments we think we need while including margins?","I think it's important to remember that the areas that we're targeting is some level of improvement we\u2019re expecting in gross margins and you're already starting to see that. But we also talked a lot about the areas we're going after significant margin improvements really in G&A, it's not in R&D, and so that's not an area that we're going to be scaling back on.","There might be some areas of R&D that we can get some better efficiency out of, but the primary areas we're looking for scale or in G&A. We talked about what some of those areas are. We've already begun to get some traction in third-party procurement spend within our IT function in particular and we expect significantly more to be had there. We also expect some improvements in the go-to-market space as we drive more productivity per dollar we spend in sales and marketing.","So I'm pretty bullish about where we're at. And so, you think about where we're at, this is almost \u2013 if we hit the high-end of our range here, you could almost be operating at 27% operating margins, which is a 300 bps improvement from where we were in 2017. So we're well on our way to 30%. And there's a lot more work to be done. We've only begun to see the benefit some of the actions that we've taken.","And your second question around media. As we talked about in the past, the pricing environment in the media business is highly competitive and so that hasn't changed. It's a very competitive pricing environment, but the pricing environment hasn't changed really in the last quarter. It remains competitive, but not kind of better or worse than it was. I'd say in Q2. And it varies obviously based on customer and the amount of traffic that they pushed and the expected price point that they're looking for. But in general, the pricing environment is aggressive, but unchanged from Q2.","Sameet Sinha","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Van Rhee from Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open.","Jeff Van Rhee","Great. Thanks. So a couple for me. Just to the \u2013 back to the website for a second. I mean, we don't have the 2019 outlook yet, but is there any way you can just sort of frame for us from this 9% constant currency over the last couple of quarters? What are the puts and takes to drive that to acceleration? What would it take for that to decelerate? Just you gave us a kind of a great taste for Q4 around the seasonality and how you\u2019re thinking behind at a low range for the low-end of the range? Just I realize it's early, but any thoughts you can give us on how that line should behave in 2019?","James Benson","Yes. I mean, we're not going to talk about 2019 on this call. We will provide a lot more color on 2019 in the February call. But I do think that some of what we outlined at the June Analyst Day and we talked a bit about just now, which is Web growth is about a few areas. It's about new product upsell, so there's a lot more room to grow there. We\u2019re not nearly penetrated with the new products that we've introduced. There is a lot more rooms for new product upsell.","Tom mentioned pricing and packaging. This is packaging multiple products to customers. It makes us stickier with customers because you have a value proposition that competitors can't match. New customer acquisition is a big one. That is an area that we had room for improvement and early days still, but we're getting traction in new customer acquisition.","And so that's really the focus, obviously there's new areas that Tom Highlighted, Internet of Things being one, Blockchain being another. So there's enough catalysts for between existing products that we have that we're not penetrating new customers and then new emerging areas, to drive growth in the Web Division.","Jeff Van Rhee","Got It. And then my last, as it relates to sales and sort of sales structure, sales headcount. I think you had talked on the website particular, I think around security you are going to be putting money into products and in go-to-market can just spend a second and just touch on sales and sales structure with respect to what \u2013 where are you with headcount, where are you adding heads, where are you reallocating heads, just some sort of context of what the headcount and growth rates look like there?","Thomson Leighton","Yes, I mean we don't comment specifically on our sales and marketing or sales headcount. I can tell you that in particular for the Web Division, as you can imagine that we do have a specialty salesforce that is there support, our enterprise sales account leaders that have security expertise, they have enterprise security expertise in some cases they have expertise in particular domain areas and so we have a model where obviously the enterprise rep needs to be proficient in selling certain offerings and then they have a model of basically specialist support on top of that.","That is an area that we actually have kind of an outside consulting firm that's helping us; look at tuning the model, tuning the models to drive maybe acceleration in new customer acquisition, maybe through a more enhanced new customer motion. And then in particular trying to drive more velocity, the existing sales reps that we do have and some of that has to do with better leveraging the specialty model, possibly consolidating components of this specialty model.","So that's generally what the Web Division salesforce looks like. It's a little bit different on the media side. The media side, obviously the bulk of the revenue in the media business is traffic related revenue. So less of a \u2013 kind of an overlay model, although they do also get support from security and as I mentioned and Tom mentioned, a huge progress on selling security into the Media Division customer base we expect that to continue.","Jeff Van Rhee","And with respect to the outside consultant firm, sort of tuning the model, just any quick thoughts on what's a realistic expectation to start to see the results of those changes? ","Thomson Leighton","Well, you'll see it show up in a couple of ways. One, you will see it show up and kind of modest improvement with sales or marketing spend as a percent of revenue. And then if we execute well, you'll see in the form of an acceleration of revenue growth.","I think you know, that the Web Division is different than the Media Division where its catalyst is selling more sales transaction does not necessarily, having traffic and having the right customers that push traffic and then following that, you guys sell more to them. And so, it'll take more to get Web Division growth accelerated as far as the timeframe is concerned, but you'll see it show up if we execute well both in more improvement with sales and marketing as a percent of revenue and an acceleration and revenue growth.","Jeff Van Rhee","Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Turits from Raymond. Your line is now open.","Michael Turits","Hey, guys. Congratulations on a good quarter and solid guide. Two questions, one, about the CDN product grouping, which did the sell down to 1% from 3% of this quarter. And I know it includes both performance and the media as well as download, so what the drivers were there.","And then as we go into next year, and obviously you're not giving guidance, but to the extent you can talk about both the positives and the negatives, because there are some headwinds and going into next year, including getting past Nominum, lapping a lot of the out winds of the 250 top customers and more effects?","James Benson","Yes, I think certainly, Michael, I'd say the growth moderate a bit from Q2 to Q3 and the CDN other category, and talked a little bit about that that a lot of focus on security as Tom outlined. Some of that also as we saw packaging products that that is becoming kind of a little bit of blurry distinction because you're packaging performance with security as part of some of the offerings and so with an element of that.","And as we said, we\u2019re starting to see the salesforce sell more of our security offerings and what tends to happen is when you start to have something that they get traction and that's what they tend to sell more of them. We're starting to see that.","In relative to 2019, we'll share more of that in February. I think you're right that there are some things that you're going to anniversary that Nominum acquisition that actually happened this quarter as a matter of fact that we had them for a month in Q4. And then we know that there's variability in events in the media business that you tend to have more events and in even years than you do odd years.","But there's a lot of variability in the media business that it's not just events, events still drive while they are a catalyst for some level of traffic, there's a lot of things in the media business that we've talked about that if there's continued secular tailwinds in gaming, continued secular tailwinds with more and more traffic moving online as far as video delivery. So there's a lot of catalysts for growth in the media business.","So it's kind of \u2013 I'm not going to provide guidance here. But yes, there are some headwinds that you had outlined. But they're also a lot of tailwind opportunities just from a secular perspective in that business.","Michael Turits","I\u2019d say I don\u2019t know if I don\u2019t want to argue, but maybe at some point, I'd love to hear you talk more about edge and particularly, what you guys can be doing to enable developer activity on your platform? That's just an interesting topic to me.","Thomson Leighton","Yes, well already we now have the capability for developers in parallel at even a given company to make changes on the fly, test them out. We have an edge container for them and they can do it on the edge platform. So it's a very nice thing in terms of DevOps for our larger customers have lots of developers making changes simultaneously on their website and be able to do this in a safe and efficient way.","Just in terms of DevOps on our edge platform, of course the edge platform is important for so many other reasons, the capacity to deliver large amounts of video at high quality, the capacity to absorb giant denial of service attacks, the data that we get at the edge from conducting so many of the world's transactions and main server lookups being close to end users and all the devices, both through application performance, mobile performance and the Internet of Things, where you've got to be managing metadata within milliseconds of the devices, the edge is important for all of those reasons.","Michael Turits","Great. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from James Fish from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","James Fish","Hey, guys congrats on a great quarter. Maybe just to start it off, I guess what inning in the Web performance and security bundling story are we in. In other words, what is the percentage of customers that have both now? And then going back to the margin questions from before? Should we still expect a hockey stick like acceleration and margin expansion in between now and 2020 or a more linear one? Thanks.","Thomson Leighton","Yes. So on Web performance and security that probably has to do with actually more recent packaging to be frank, literally over the last call it six months to nine months. And so I think there are a lot more room to grow as far as bundling security with performance. Not just for existing customers, but it's also an attractive option to get new customers on the platform because they get both security and performance at the same time.","And so I think there's certainly an opportunity there. And as we talked about at the Analyst Day, although to be frank, our margin expansion in 2018 really have surpassed our expectations even at the Analyst Day. We talked a little bit about the fact that it wouldn't necessarily be linear, that you wouldn't necessarily see a linear progression from where margins were to getting to 2020.","Obviously you've seen here 300 bps, possibly of improvement from 2017 to 2018. So if you assume we're called 26.5% for 2018, you basically have 350 bps to get to 30% in 2020. It probably won't be linear in 2019. Having said that, there will be progress in 2019, so we\u2019ll not flatline, we will make continued progress in 2019, but it probably won't be linear.","So you probably won't necessarily have 175 bps improvements in 2019, but you will get improvement in 2019. And some of that is because a lot of the actions that we're taking a very smart and very measured. We're implementing changes in third-party spend. We're building out a global procurement function instead of capabilities. We're putting in place process standardization and automation in our G&A functions for critical tasks.","We're kind of revamping our go-to-market model in specific areas. And these are items that take a little bit of time to put in place. They're going to see that a lot of that infrastructure is going to be put in place in 2019 and you'll get the bigger benefit for that in 2020 to improve the efficiency. So there is a path to get there. And there is a path to get there with varying levels of revenue growth for the company. So we're pretty confident in our ability to get there.","James Fish","Got it. Thanks. And then, Tom, appreciate the competitive overview. Is there any way that you guys can provide us any sort of new customer expansion metrics or dollar-based retention rates like some of your peers do to just get a better understanding of what's going on there? It really \u2013 what I'm trying to get at is how the stickiness of the Akamai platform has evolved since the company took a more aggressive step on the bundling that we've been talking about here.","Thomson Leighton","Yes. We don\u2019t release the detailed statistics. But as I mentioned earlier, our competitive churn rate is incredibly low, very single-digit on an annual basis and actually declined year-over-year. So we're very pleased with our customer retention. Jim, do you want to add to that at all?","James Benson","No, I think you said it well in your comments, but I would have anything else to add.","James Fish","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Kvaal from Nomura Instinet. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey Kvaal","Yes, thanks very much. I'd like to follow-up on the security growth in the media side of the business if I could. Would you all mind shedding a little bit more light on what has changed in that side of the business to drive security growth, and what products are they buying and what should we think about for I mean how sustainable is that? Thank you.","Thomson Leighton","Yes. They're buying the same products, and in fact, we have a couple of very large media accounts, some of the first large adopters of our zero-trust solutions for the enterprise security. So I would say media companies are like other verticals in terms of having a real need for security.","And of course a lot of the headlines you read for data breaches some of those are big media companies. The only thing that makes media different is that there's a smaller number of really big customers that drive media revenue overall and media revenue overall tends \u2013 the majority of that is driven by their traffic, the traffic in the top 250 global media brands. But they are big consumers of security.","Jeffrey Kvaal","Should we expect that the pieces of the security business to move at the same rhythm and pace as the typical sort of performance side of that business?","Thomson Leighton","I'm not sure the question there. Our security products aren't traffic-based by and large, so the dynamic in our media company would be your \u2013 bulk of your revenue is driven by the traffic and the price of the traffic. And the security products can even be about a fixed price nature in some cases. Maybe, I didn't answer your question?","Jeffrey Kvaal","No, that was it Tom. Thank you.","James Benson","Okay. The only thing I would add is that, we still have a little over 40% of our customers buy one of our security products. But we are more \u2013 that\u2019s a total company comment, but we are more penetrated in the web division. I mean we certainly have a lot more room to grow in the Web Division.","We are not nearly as concentrated on security in the Media Division, so they make great traction. And one thing Tom didn't comment on is that the Media Division sales team put in place a pretty clever incentive compensation programs really drive security and we're seeing huge benefit from that in 2018. So I expect further progress in security and the Media Division here over the coming quarters.","Jeffrey Kvaal","Thank you both very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Vijay Bhagavath from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Vijay Bhagavath","Yes, thanks. Hey Tom, Jim, interesting call here. A quick question on Tom, I wanted to get you a bigger picture views on growing topline in particular in performance and in the CDN business, both of which know came in light versus expectations. And then Jim, any concerns that you might be running the business near peak margins? Do not 42 points of EBITDA margin on the guidance? Thank you. ","Thomson Leighton","Yes. So we very much like our CDN business and it has a lot of room for growth. I think the big drivers there obviously OTT video, seeing very strong growth there. Gaining, really strong growth set major records with the Fortnite the various Fortnite releases. So I think there's a lot of room for growth in the CDN business. Of course on the performance side as you move more apps into the mobile environment, performances especially challenging there.","People want to their sites to be more interactive, richer, have video now. We're broadening our Image Manager product to be Video Manager products. You can have short video clips on your commerce site. So performance continues to be a challenge for our customers there and I think in the long run, that's a very good business for us. Jim, you want to talk about margin?","James Benson","Yes, I mean, I think the actions we've taken over the last 12 months are manifesting themselves in the results you're seeing. Put some headcount actions for the Company in Q4 and Q1 the big focus of that really was a pretty deep inspection around some R&D areas that we weren't generating the level of return that we wanted. So you're seeing that manifests itself in the P&L You're starting to see some early traction and some of the efficiency efforts outside of that.","I mentioned third-party procurement spend being one, like I mentioned in the last call, facility consolidation being another. And so I wouldn't say we're operating at peak margin, obviously we showed good progress. I think we have a lot more room for expansion. Of course, you got to make sure that you're investing wisely in the areas they're going to continue to drive growth and scale for the company. And we think we're doing that, we're making the right prioritization tradeoffs, but I still think we can drive further margin expansion and make the investments in the business that I needed.","Vijay Bhagavath","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We have time for one more question. Our next question is from Brad Zelnick from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Brad Zelnick","Great. Thanks so much for fitting me and congrats on great results guys. So the security results are really impressive, but the stats that you shared around your zero trust solutions are even more impressive? Can you maybe give us a sense of the sales dynamic in the field, the length of these cycles and who do you find yourselves most competing with?","Thomson Leighton","It's very early days in zero-trust, and so I would say most enterprises see sales aren't there yet. But you're seeing the first wave and it comes across many verticals, which is really exciting prospect for us, we have the early adopters that they get it. They understand that the traditional model of building a moat around the castle or putting in the VPN in the firewall just doesn't cut it. It's just way too easy for somebody to click on the wrong link even when they're not in the company, when they're on the outside, bring the device on the inside and you\u2019re dead. Before you know it, you got a major data breach.","And so the notion of authenticating somebody that network layer, I think people are starting to realize it doesn't work. You can't get the security you need, plus have a big overhead with a lot of costs and instead by authenticating at the application layer, now you would get access on an app-by-app basis and then you can add in our Kona Site Defender that's fantastic. Much more secure and we've had some really great proof points among the early adopters of catching infections that were inside, devices on the inside that were infected, they were trying to ex-filtrate data that they just didn't know about.","So we're in the early days, we have a now over a couple hundred customers, some major brands using it and you see our bookings really accelerating now. So we're very excited about the future there. And they're still a long way to go either it's not going to be next year that all enterprise, suddenly decide they're going to totally change their security posture. But you are seeing the leaders now start to do that and that's exciting.","Brad Zelnick","Thanks Tom. It makes a ton of sense to us. And if I could just sneak in one last question here. We've heard folks in the industry starting to talk about customers implementing multi-sourcing strategies and performance similar to what we've seen in media in the past. To what extent are you seeing this and how do you expect that plays out?","Thomson Leighton","A little of it and sometimes \u2013 what we're really seeing is if there's sites or apps that don't matter that the customer has. They will sometimes source that with a competitor. But for apps and sites that matter in our base those would be Akamai. And in addition, if the app or site matters, you got to secure it. And you can't secure it with most all the other providers out there or at least not to the level that you need to. And so in fact, that's why the bundle is so helpful and a real competitive advantage.","And in many cases the sale is led by security and the delivery or the performance comes with the product or comes in the bundle, so that I think makes a big difference. It's not just an issue, hey, there's very few cases where you say, I'm going to split this site with two vendors.","Now you do get that in video or media. You don't really see that on the website. You'll see some of the apps that don't matter as much or you don't care about securing, those might be given to our competitor that we'll see some of that out there. And again bundling, I think can be a good defense against that as well.","Brad Zelnick","Great. Tom, thanks again for taking my questions.","James Benson","Thank you.","End of Q&A","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations for closing remarks.","Tom Barth","Thank you. In closing, we will be participating at several investor conferences and events throughout the end of the year. We hope to see you at some of those and those events can be found on the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. So thank you for joining us this evening and have a nice day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's program is being recorded.","I'd now like to introduce your host for today's program, Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Thank you, Jonathan, and good afternoon, and thank you for joining Akamai's fourth quarter and year-end 2016 earnings conference call.","Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Benson, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.","Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. These forward-looking statements included in this call represent Akamai's view on February 7, 2016. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to further reflect future events or circumstances.","As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of our website.","And with that, please let me turn the call over to Tom.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today.","Q4 was another strong quarter for Akamai with accelerated revenue growth and excellent earnings and free cash flow. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $616 million, up 7% year-over-year on constant currency. The strong revenue result was driven by robust seasonal traffic in Media, the continued rapid growth of our Cloud Security Solutions, and the success of our recently launched new products. Of particular note, revenue from our Cloud Security Solutions was $102 million in Q4, up 41% over Q4 in 2015.","Non-GAAP EPS for Q4 was $0.72 per diluted share, consistent year-over-year and up 8% when adjusted for the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit that benefited Q4 of 2015.","Cash generation continued to be strong, free cash flow of $106 million in Q4 bringing full-year free cash flow to $550 million, up 72% from 2015 levels.","As we discussed during our recent calls, our overall revenue growth rates in 2016 were lower because of the do-it-yourself or DIY efforts by a few of the Internet's largest platform companies. If we exclude the impact of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Netflix from our results, then our Q4 revenue was $558 million, which is up 15% over Q4 of last year in constant currency.","Revenue for 2016 as a whole was $2.3 billion, up 7% year-over-year and up 15% excluding the six large Internet platform companies. Our exposure to DIY in these accounts continue to diminish as they collectively accounted for less than 10% of our total revenue in the fourth quarter, down from roughly 16% a year ago. As a result, our overall revenue growth rate accelerated in Q4 due to the continued strong growth of our core business.","As I look back at 2016, I'm especially pleased with the success of Akamai's innovation engine. We released several new products last year, including Bot Manager, Image Manager and Enterprise Application Access, and their reception in the marketplace has been very positive. Bot Manager, in particular, has proven to be our most popular new product in several years. Bot Manager identifies nearly 1,400 types of bots and enables our customers to customize their response to requests based on the type of bot. We sell Bot Manager across all our major verticals and for a variety of uses. I recently spoke to one major enterprise that is saving many millions of dollars a year because of Bot Manager's ability to identify and mitigate price scrapers.","Our recent acquisition of Cyberfend is intended to further enhance Bot Manager's market-leading capabilities by providing even greater defenses against credential abuse. For many of our customers, a large fraction of the login attempts are from bots checking to see if stolen user credentials are valid on their sites. Validated credentials are then sold to criminal organizations for exploitation. By incorporating the Cyberfend technology into Bot Manager, we can more effectively stop these attacks then tell our customers which user IDs have been compromised.","Our new Image Manager solution has also gotten off to a very strong start in the market. Image Manager automatically optimizes images by creating and delivering the right size image for each user in real time based on the device type, browser type, and quality of connection. The solution enables our customers to accelerate their time to market, improve performance and conversion rates, especially for mobile apps and also to reduce their costs.","Last year we formed our Enterprise and Carrier Division, and I'm happy to report that we're now entering the market with two exciting new products to improve enterprise security, Enterprise Application Access and Enterprise Threat Detection.","Using technology acquired from Soha Systems in October, Enterprise Application Access, or EAA, addresses the growing need for businesses to more easily and securely manage application access for a growing mix of users with different risk profiles. EAA does not require enterprises to poke holes in their corporate firewall to enable access, which greatly improves security over traditional VPN solutions. EAA is also much easier to integrate and use than traditional remote access solutions.","Close on the heels of EAA is our new Enterprise Threat Protector or ETP service. ETP is now in beta with 15 customers. It helps companies block access to malware sites and data exfiltration botnets. Just like EAA, Enterprise Threat Protector is very easy to set up. Unlike most enterprise security products, ETP can be deployed and configured in under 30 minutes. Nearly all of the customers in our beta program have been able to get it up and running totally on their own.","EAA and ETP are attractive solutions for a wide variety of enterprises providing Akamai with an opportunity to pursue new customers and verticals. For example, manufacturing companies will be able to use ETP to block threats without needing to deploy and maintain on-prem hardware.","In addition to our successful new product introductions, our core business also remained strong in 2016 with a especially robust growth in our OTT business. Following a record-breaking Euro 2016 and Rio Olympics, we set a new record for a news event on the night of the U.S. elections, with 7.5 terabits per second of peak delivery, and during the holiday season the Akamai platform achieved a new traffic record of 46 terabits per second, doubling our 2014 peak of 23 terabits per second.","The global adoption of OTT has continued at a strong pace, not only in the U.S. but also in EMEA and especially in Asia and Latin America. Our experience and expertise in streaming video at scale with quality and reliability around the world means that we are in an excellent position to benefit from the increasing demand for high-quality content online.","Of course, security remains the most pressing concern for many of our customers, as the scale and sophistication of cyber attacks have continued to escalate along with the potential for disruption and damage. In 2016, the number of DDoS attacks launched against our customers grew by 75% over 2015.","We're very proud of our excellent track record of successfully defending our customers from some of the Web's largest and most malicious attacks. We believe that our unique approach of leveraging a distributed network of servers at the edge of the Internet, where there is enormous capacity, continues to be a critical differentiator for Akamai.","Just this morning, we announced our new Web Application Protector service, which is designed to provide online businesses with a low touch way to protect their websites from the most common attacks. We also announced enhancements to our flagship Kona Site Defender solution to defend APIs from a wide range of both DDoS and application layer attacks. APIs are emerging as a popular target for attackers as the usage of mobile devices continues to grow.","Over the last four years, we've grown our Cloud Security business from a little more than an idea into a $400 million market leader. We believe that our remarkable success in Cloud Security demonstrates that with prudent investment, we can create substantial new and profitable revenue streams beyond our core CDN business.","As we look to the future, we see several opportunities with similar growth potential, and so we are planning to increase investment in 2017 to capitalize on these opportunities to further accelerate our long-term revenue growth. Our goal is to replicate the success that we've had with our Cloud Security business in other adjacent areas where the scale, resiliency and security of our unique distributed edge platform can enable us to provide compelling cloud solutions to our customers.","This investment strategy will pressure margins in the near term, but we believe it will help accelerate revenue growth in the longer term. Of course, as always, we'll continue to keep a close eye on overall expense and to carefully track performance as we grow the business. We'll talk more about our plans for product expansion at our Investor Day on March 14, and as we make key investments.","In summary, I remain confident in our business strategy, our market position and our ability to execute on the significant opportunities for growth that lie ahead. I have never been more optimistic about our future.","I'll now turn the call to Jim to review our Q4 financial results and to provide the outlook for Q1. Jim?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone.","As Tom outlined, Q4 was another strong quarter for Akamai on both the top and bottom lines. Q4 revenue came in above the high end of our guidance range at $616 million, up 6% year-over-year or up 7% adjusted for foreign exchange movements. Revenue was up a healthy 15% if you exclude the six large Internet Platform Customers Tom just mentioned.","Revenue growth continued to be solid across the business with the overachievement versus our guidance driven by a higher-than-expected uptick in holiday season traffic with our Media Solutions and customers. I mentioned in our last call that holiday season traffic would play a large role in where we would land relative to our fourth quarter guidance, and it did. Media-related traffic was particularly strong in the quarter.","Before I get into the revenue details, please note that all revenue growth rate references will be in constant currency.","Revenue from our Media Delivery Solutions was $196 million in the quarter, down 10% year-over-year, but up 8% excluding our large Internet Platform Customers. We saw healthy seasonal traffic growth in both our gaming and software download verticals and continued robust growth in video delivery.","Turning to our Performance and Security Solutions, revenue was $367 million in the quarter, up 17% year-over-year. Within the Solution category, we saw solid growth across all major product lines. As Tom mentioned, we have been seeing strong traction with our recently launched Image Manager and Bot Manager solutions, and we have continued to see significant growth and demand for all of our Cloud Security offerings.","Fourth quarter revenue for our Cloud Security Solutions was $102 million, up 41% year-over-year, capping off another tremendous year of revenue growth and customer adoption of our security solutions globally. Exiting Q4, our Security business now has an annualized revenue run-rate of over $400 million.","We are very pleased with the growth and execution of our Cloud Security business over the past few years. This growth was driven by targeted product innovation and go-to-market resource investments, as well as a very successful acquisition. We plan to maintain this aggressive investment posture to further broaden not only our Cloud Security offerings, but also our Web performance and emerging enterprise solution capabilities where we see substantial long-term growth potential.","Finally, revenue from our Services and Support Solutions was $53 million in the quarter, up 14% year-over-year.","Turning now to our Q4 customer division results, revenue from our Web Division customers was $300 million, up 14% year-over-year. We continued to see solid growth in this customer base, particularly with our Cloud Security offerings.","Revenue from our Media Division customers was $301 million in the quarter, roughly flat year-over-year and up 15% excluding the impact of the six large Internet Platform Customers. This strong growth rate was driven not only by Media Division customers driving more holiday season traffic. but also from upgrading and penetrating more of Akamai's solutions deeper into this customer base.","Finally, revenue from our emerging Enterprise and Carrier Division customers was $15 million in the quarter, up 26% year-over-year.","Moving on to our geographies, sales in our international markets represented 31% of total revenue in Q4, consistent with the prior quarter. International revenue was $193 million in the fourth quarter, up 19%, driven by continued strong growth in our Asia-Pacific region. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact on revenue of just under $2 million on a year-over-year basis and a $6 million impact on a sequential basis as the dollar strengthened significantly through the quarter.","Revenue from our U.S. market was $424 million, up 2% year-over-year. If you exclude the large Internet Platform Customers, which are based in the U.S., revenue growth was a solid 13% across the rest of the business.","Moving on to costs, cash gross margin was 77%, up 1 point from Q3 levels, consistent with the same period last year and in-line with our guidance. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 67%, up 2 points from Q3 levels, consistent with the same period last year and a point higher than our guidance due to the strong revenue achievement.","GAAP operating expenses were $289 million in the fourth quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related charges, and other non-recurring items. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $230 million, up $23 million from Q3 levels.","This was above the high-end of our guidance, driven by increased year-end commission costs associated with the revenue overachievement, as well as a significant uptick in litigation spend associated with our Limelight patent infringement cases.","Moving in to 2017, we expect to see similar elevated levels of litigation spend.","Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $247 million, up $9 million from Q3 levels, and $10 million from the same period last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 40%, down 1 point from Q3 levels and from Q4 last year, and in line with our guidance.","GAAP depreciation and amortization expenses were $84 million in the fourth quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation associated with stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of capitalized interest expense. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP depreciation was $74 million consistent with Q3 levels and at the low end of our guidance due to the timing of some network deployments that shifted into Q1.","Non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter was $174 million, up $10 million from Q3 levels and up $6 million from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 28% consistent with Q3 levels and down 1 point from the same period last year and at the high end of our guidance.","Moving on to the other income and expense items, interest income for the fourth quarter was about $4 million, consistent with Q3 levels. Non-cash interest expense related to our convertible debt was roughly $5 million. As a reminder, this non-cash expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results.","Moving on to earnings, GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $92 million or $0.52 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $126 million or $0.72 of earnings per diluted share, $0.02 above the high end of our guidance range driven by higher revenues and a slightly lower tax rate. Adjusting for the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in Q4 2015, earnings grew 8% year-over-year.","For the quarter, total taxes included in our GAAP earnings were $34 million based on a Q4 effective tax rate of 27%. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $50 million based on a Q4 effective tax rate of 28% and coming in about 2 points lower than our guidance due to a higher mix of foreign earnings.","For the full year, the 2016 non-GAAP effective tax rate was just above 29%. Finally, our weighted average diluted share count for the fourth quarter was 175 million shares and in line with our guidance.","Now I'll review some balance sheet items.","Day sales outstanding for the fourth quarter was 54 days, down 2 days from Q3 levels. Capital expenditures in Q4, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense were $78 million and slightly below our guidance for the quarter primarily due to the timing of network buildouts that moved into Q1.","For the full year 2016, capital expenditures came in at 14% of revenue and below our long-term model as we grew into our existing capacity from the significant 2015 buildouts. We expect 2017 capital expenditures to be back in line with our long-term model range.","Cash flow generation continue to be strong in Q4. Free cash flow was $106 million in the fourth quarter and $550 million for the year or 24% of revenue. Our balance sheet also remains very strong with roughly $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at the end of the quarter. If you'll factor in our convertible debt, our net cash is approximately $1 billion.","During the quarter we spent $79 million on share repurchases buying back roughly 1.3 million shares. For the year, we spent $374 million buying back approximately 7 million shares.","In summary, we are pleased with how the business performed in Q4 and we remain confident in the long-term prospects of growth for the company. Looking ahead to the first quarter, we expect to see a normal sequential revenue decline for seasonality, perhaps a bit more pronounced in the recent years due to the particularly strong media performance this past quarter.","In addition, we expect further currency headwinds from the strengthening U.S. dollar over the past few months. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact on Q1 revenue of just under $4 million sequentially and $5 million compared to Q1 of last year.","Factoring in both of these variables, we are expecting Q1 revenue in the range of $596 million to $610 million. At the higher end of this range, year-over-year growth would be 8% constant currency, a slight acceleration from Q4 levels.","At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of 76% and GAAP gross margins of 65%. Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $217 million to $222 million, down seasonally from Q4 levels primarily due to less commission spend and fewer customer events.","Factoring in the cash gross margin and operating expense expectations I just provided, we anticipate Q1 EBITDA margins of 39% to 40%. And as mentioned earlier, we plan to significantly increase our investment levels in 2017 in new product innovation, service delivery enablement and platform scaling \u2013 important areas we believe will help us enable to drive accelerated, sustainable long-term growth and scale.","And while we're not providing specific guidance beyond Q1 during this call, we want to be transparent about our plans to grow investments throughout 2017 at a faster pace than revenue growth. Our goal is to re-accelerate the top-line growth back into double-digit levels in the longer-term. We are confident the success we have had with our Cloud Security investment strategy can be duplicated in other areas of the business, most notably in our new and emerging Enterprise Solutions portfolio. We also plan to broaden our offerings within our Security, Web Performance and Media Solutions portfolios. This deliberate investment strategy will result in EBITDA margins in the high 30s in 2017 and for the foreseeable future.","Moving now to depreciation, we expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $74 million and $76 million. Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margins of 27% to 28% for Q1. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I outlined, we expect Q1 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.66 to $0.69.","This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $48 million to $51 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of just under 29.5%. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of 175 million shares.","On CapEx, we expect a significant uptick from recent spending levels in both the first quarter and throughout 2017. This increase is driven partly by some platform deployments that shifted from Q1, but mostly by our desire to continue expanding our secure delivery network and increasing capacity to support our rapidly growing Security business. We expect to spend approximately $90 million and $96 million, excluding equity compensation.","It's also worth noting that our planned investment increases in product innovation and scaling our platform will impact CapEx as well as OpEx as we capitalize more R&D development. As such, we expect CapEx spending to return to our long-term model range of 16% to 18% of revenue in 2017. And with the increasing CapEx, you will also see an uptick in depreciation levels throughout 2017.","In closing, Akamai accomplished a great deal in 2016, and we remain confident in our ability to execute on our plans for the long term. We look forward to having an opportunity to go into more details with you about the business and future trends at our upcoming Investor Summit in Boston on March 14.","Thank you. And now Tom and I would like to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets. Your question, please.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks. You talked about these \u2013 the contribution from the three newer products \u2013 Bot Manager, Image Manager and the Enterprise and Carrier Division products. Could you help us think through the revenue ramp? In other words, how widely sold across the verticals are all three of those products? And when do you think that they'll be at a point where they'll be fully penetrated? Does that take 6 months, 12 months, 2 years? Thank you.","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah, I'll take that. But as you can imagine with new products, it's going to take a fair amount of time to actually fully penetrate them at installed base. But as Tom said, for both of these products, Bot Manager launched earlier in the year, Image Manager launched mid-year.","Bot Manager in particular, this is the fastest-growing product we've had in a long, long time, and so the penetration is still early days. But it was a reasonably meaningful contributor to growth in Q4, in particular, our Performance and Security portfolio. You'll see that continue to ramp and further penetrate in 2018, but it's probably going to take a couple of years to see it kind of fully penetrated.","As an example for Cloud Security, which we've been in market now for a little over four years. I think about 38% of our customers via Cloud Security Solutions. So still a lot of ramp to go even in Cloud Security, so it takes a while to have those customers ramp, but you can certainly see that we started a few years ago from roughly a few million dollars in Cloud Security to now over $400 million.","So I think these new product offerings are kind of again proof points to Tom's comments that innovation is alive and well, and there's more to sell to the installed base to accelerate growth of the company.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you, Jim.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Edward Maguire from CLSA. Your question, please.","Ed Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. I was wondering if you could discuss the competitive environment for your anti-DDoS services, particularly with AWS getting into the market. What sort of competition are you seeing there, and are there also other opportunities where you are seeing cross-selling and attach for the anti-DDoS services?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. We're in a good position with the DDoS solution because of our unique distributed platform. We're in a position to defend and absorb the largest attacks out there, and we've got a great track record and there's a lot of other folks that offer scrubbing services or DDoS services of one kind or another, and they've all pretty much had high profile failures. AWS, we don't see really much in the marketplace. For DDoS, it would be a different kind of approach. So we don't see that as being a significant threat to the DDoS business.","And DDoS is relevant for most of our customer base, so there's a lot of cross-selling that takes place and the Security Services, in general, were leading with a sale there and a lot of new accounts where they will join with Akamai because either our DDoS solution or our application layer protection capabilities with Kona and that brings new customers to Akamai.","Ed Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC","Great. And just to follow up on the \u2013 with the declines in revenue from the Internet Platform Customers, do you believe that you've reached a point of stability where the predictability of the migration away from your platform has reached an equilibrium of sorts?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. As we talked about, they're now collectively less than 10% of our revenue so the future impact is obviously limited, and we expect to see some further decline, but nothing to scale that we've seen over the last one to two years.","Ed Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Heinz from Stifel. Your question, please.","Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. Just wondering if you could go in a bit more detail about some of the enterprise opportunities you're investing in outside of security, I guess, specifically on the Web performance side, and how you see those kind of markets transpiring today from a sales standpoint whether there's head count additions you need to make to broaden the distribution and kind of how those products are attaching alongside the Security Solutions?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Right. As we talked about with Image Manager that's a Web Performance Solution, very pleased with the early traction there. The new Ion 3 (31:30) solution has an SDK for a substantially improved performance especially for mobile devices and prepositioning of content. And as we make major investments this year, we'll talk about those as we make them. And we move into a new product area, then we'll talk about it then. Of course, it will be important that it's synergistic with the existing business and that can leverage Akamai's unique distributed platform.","Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, thanks. And then just one other on the share count guidance. It looks like you're kind of looking at a flat year-over-year share count. Just wondering if the increased CapEx expectations is at all kind of limiting the buyback in 2017 relative to what you repurchased in 2016?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Not at all, not at all, that our balance sheet has a lot of firepower to do M&A, to do CapEx purchases and to do our share buyback. And as we talked about, our share buyback is intended to offset dilution, but it's a programmatic trade that buys more shares when the stock price is lower and buys fewer shares when the stock price is higher. But we have ample firepower to do full CapEx purchases, share buyback and M&A.","Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sameet Sinha from B. Riley. Your question, please.","Sameet Sinha - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Thank you very much. I can understand if you don't want to talk about some of these new adjacencies that you're entering into, but can you give us what the profile of the company would look like? Are these products primarily SaaS-based so that you have an initial CapEx spend, but maybe at a later time that CapEx spend goes down and you get what you listed as a recurring revenue stream?","And the second question would be, any initial take on net neutrality? Obviously, the new administration is taking a pretty tough stance. Where do you think you stand on that? And do you think you'll benefit from it or potential negatives some point down the line?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah, of course. We're in a business with recurring revenue streams, and so any new areas we would go into you would think would be consistent with that model. So I wouldn't expect any major deviation there.","In terms of acquisitions we've done over the past, there's technology tuck-ins. Sometimes there's a product like Prolexic that's an adjacency that fits very well with our existing business, but is a new product that's very synergistic. And occasionally, over our 20-year history we've done some roll-ups. It's less frequent, I would say. And I don't think there would be a major difference in the kinds of things that we're planning to do this year from what we've done in the past.","With net neutrality, I think there's going to be changes there with the new administration. I think a lot of rules that existed before may go away, and I don't think that really makes much difference to our business. We weren't regulated in the first place, and I don't see anything coming there that would be bad in any way for Akamai.","Sameet Sinha - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Thank you","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg McDowell from JMP Securities. Your question, please.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. This is Richard Deloria (35:04) dialing in for Greg. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to kind of follow up on the head count question that was asked earlier, I mean because we did see a bit of an uptick in hiring this quarter.","With the increased product development focus and maybe a little bit more of a vertical focus within the Enterprise Division, how are you thinking about head count going forward not just for next quarter and later into 2017 but kind of beyond that? Can you see a return to normal head count growth that we've seen in the past? Or is it going to be a little more deliberate? And I have one follow-up.","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. We're certainly going to see a step-up in head count investments. You're right that we have a little bit more head count ramp here in the fourth quarter, but we hired for the year about a little over 400 people, I think, including some acquisitions. I think in years past, we averaged more than 1,000 hires per year.","I think what you're going to see is that this step-up in investment is that our head count ramp is probably going to be more similar to what it's been historically than it was this past year, and as I mentioned it's going to be targeted but very heavily focused in new product innovation.","There's also investment we're going to need to be making in our service delivery enablement that I mentioned, that our Services business is growing quite rapidly. And we're going to be making investments in continuing to scale the platform. So you should expect head count more similar to what it's been in the past than basically what it's been in 2016.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. And then just kind of a quick follow-up. Jim, you did say just in terms of looking at the Q1, we can expect a bigger sequential decline from Q4 to Q1 on a revenue basis than typically we've seen, and just wanted to understand how much of that is being driven by, like you said, the outperformance on the Media side? And how much of that is a continued expectation of \u2013 and I know it's not as significant as before but just the continued declines of revenue from the top six Internet Platform Customers?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Well, yeah, I mean, as Tom mentioned that we probably will see continued decline in the Internet Platform Customers in the first quarter; one, because seasonally they declined Q4 to Q1 anyways, because they also have a seasonally stronger Q4. But I'd say the bigger component of it is not that, and it's more that we had a very strong Q4 for Media.","Media traffic was kind of seasonally very, very strong. We had a large number of gaming releases, a fair number of software download events that the Media business can be a bit spiky that way. So some \u2013 I'd say the bigger part of the sequential decline is driven by the Media business, certainly not the performance in Security Solutions.","Unknown Speaker","Got it. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Bhagavath from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, thanks. Hi, Tom, Jim. A consistent question I hear from clients is whether Akamai is an episodic growth story, and I think where they're coming from is the Media Delivery business does extremely well during live events. We saw recently the elections, holiday season, on and on. I think what they're looking for is any data points or trends you could help us with to get all of us comfortable about the slow to mid-teens trajectory for the Media business now that we're lapping to DIY customers. And 2017 is a prime number year, so how would we feel comfortable with no major live events on the calendar this year? Thanks.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah, I don't know if it has too much to do with prime numbers. Even years there are more events, but as we've talked about in the past, any given event gives us some revenue, but it's not really swinging the needle. Now sometimes with Olympics and so forth new devices will come out and someday like VR, for example, we've started to do some of that, and that can drive traffic levels on a more sustained basis afterwards.","But I wouldn't read a lot into that, and I think the Media business is very healthy. We're seeing very strong growth in OTT, very strong growth in our gaming customers and just Modulo the very big, the six platform companies that are doing more on their own, the Media business has been very good.","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","I think it's also fair to comment that even outside of Media that I think the company is certainly much more diversified now than it was kind of even a year ago or two years ago, that our performance in Security business now represents 60% of the company's revenue, you include kind of services, call it 70-plus percent of the revenue. So Media is becoming a much smaller percentage of the company's revenue, and we know that the Media business can have variability just given the nature of the business.","So I think what you're going to see going forward is that you're going to see more stability in the company's growth rates. I do think that there is an opportunity for Media to reaccelerate growth rates, but I think the catalyst for that is really going to be a significant uptick in Over the Top viewing. And I think we're seeing steady growth in that area right now. But if you see that become more mainstream, I think we're poised to benefit significantly from that.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Perfect. A quick follow-on would be, do you see any cross-sell, upsell synergies between your gaming customers and DDoS? A common complaint from gamers is performance is weak because of DDoS attacks, hacker attacks, et cetera. And I think, they complain no matter what, but still do you see any synergies in gaming and the Security business? Thanks.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah, you're right. I think the gaming vertical is probably as attacked as any. And so they are large adopters of DDoS prevention services from Akamai.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Perfect. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.","Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Excellent. Nice quarter, guys, and thank you for taking the question. Following up on OTT, just to kind of help us mark-to-market, you talked about the steady growth. One, are we getting to a point where it's actually sort of materially driving the numbers in either Media or Performance in terms of that's a significant driver of revenues today?","And two, when we think about the uptick in CapEx spend into 2017, is that by any means based upon an anticipation of more OTT revenues, or is it more of the traditional businesses that are growing out that (41:48) CapEx?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah, I'll parse that. So, certainly on the OTT side that, yeah, we're seeing very steady growth in OTT. It's been that way for some time, but it's steady growth, so it's much more consistent growth in Over The Top than say gaming or software downloads, which tend to be much more variable based on games that get released or software updates that occur.","And I'd say that has been the bigger catalyst driving growth in the Media business that those \u2013 the gaming and the software download area tends to be much more spiky. And you'll have surges at times and then it won't at other times. So I think the catalyst for growth in the Media business is going to be OTT. I don't think you're going to see the catalyst. You may see even a catalyst, as Tom mentioned, as you see more VR and things like that in the gaming space that require performance to work well, but I think that between things like that and OTT, that's going to be the cause of kind of re-acceleration in the Media business.","And on your CapEx question, I'm glad you asked, because we certainly are not trying to signal that we're doing a build-out for some anticipation of further OTT. Actually, the build-out that we're doing is, as you can imagine, our Security business now is on an annualized run-rate of over $400 million. It's rapidly growing. And so there's build-out we're doing to support our Security business. And there's also build-out that we're doing with our secure delivery network. More customers want to have their traffic served over a secure delivery network, so we're building out capacity in that area. So it's really for other parts of the business. It's not so much for the Media business.","Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Excellent. Thank you. That was very helpful.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi from Wells Fargo. Your question, please.","Sitikantha Panigrahi - Wells Fargo Securities","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. On the Security business, you mentioned like it's already $400 million run-rate, while also you invested and you made a few tuck-in acquisition second half of last year and also introduced new products, I'm wondering how big is an opportunity at this point to cross-sell this within your installed base. How much penetrated at this point? And how sustainable is this 40% growth in Security business? And I have a follow-up.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Well, the cross-sell opportunity is very strong. And as I mentioned earlier, we also entered new accounts leading with security quite often. So it's good both ways.","Growing at 40% is really great to see. That obviously gets harder as the numbers get larger, but we're excited about Bot Manager and the Cyberfend acquisition, as well as the new products that we're bringing to market in enterprise security. So that's an area where we'll be continuing to make investments in order to maintain strong growth rates.","Sitikantha Panigrahi - Wells Fargo Securities","And with this new introduction of those new product and acquisitions, are you making any changes to your go-to-market strategy, or what are the other investments you're planning to do?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","With the new enterprise products, we have an overlay team, but we expect with those products that our existing sales force can sell them. They're both easy to explain. And as I mentioned, easy to use and integrate and get going. And so I think our existing sales force is going to be able to sell those. And right now, we're helping them with an overlay.","Sitikantha Panigrahi - Wells Fargo Securities","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael from Cowen & Company. Your question, please.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company","Great. Thank you. You mentioned, too, you're obviously going to be investing in the business, and for the year, we should see EBITDA margins in, I think, you said high 30s. And I think you also mentioned that the intention is to get back up to double-digit growth.","So I guess my question is for the company to continue to grow at double-digit growth beyond 2017 into the next few years hopefully, do you think that you have to remain in the high 30s and therefore, that's the new long-term operating margin for the business \u2013 or EBITDA margin for the business? Or do you think this is more of a one-time investment through 2017, and then as we go into 2018 and beyond, we can potentially get back up to that 40% type EBITDA margin? Thanks.","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Thanks for the question, Colby. I mean, we'll cover it more at the upcoming Investor Summit, but I still think the long-term model for the company in the low 40s is the right one. I do think that what you're going to see in 2017, and I said for the foreseeable future, because I think you're going to hear in 2017, you're going to hear about new product adjacencies that we are going to enter. And I think what you're going to see is we're going to make investments in those areas. Those investments are probably going to extend beyond 2017.","And so I think the interim model for the company, not the long-term model, I think, the interim model for the company is going to be the high 30s. But I do think that once those businesses get to a level of scale, because they'll be kind of early-stage businesses, I think once they get to scale, I think that we will be able to get the company model back to the low 40s EBITDA. But I think that even beyond 2017, we intend to operate the company in the high 30s. And I think that given the nature of the adjacent areas, I think that they have significant opportunities for EBITDA that's more like our Performance and Security EBITDA. But obviously, it's going to take a time for those businesses to ramp to be able to realize that, and I think what we want to do is we don't want to constrain investment. We want to make sure we're investing to capitalize on that because now is the opportunity.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Breen from William Blair. Your question, please.","James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks. Just want to clarify one thing, and then just follow up the question. On the CapEx you talked about significantly going up, but still within the 16% to 18% range? That's my understanding.","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yes, yes.","James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay.","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","That means we were 14% in 2016. We'll be back in the 16% to 18% range in 2017.","James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. And then just on new sales and where the revenue growth is coming from as you look across sort of Security, Performance and Media as three separate segments, is it adding new customers? Is it existing customers taking more services? And does that differ across those segments? Thanks.","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. I would say that the more of the growth has been coming from selling more into our installed base. We've been able to take the offerings that we have and further penetrate them into the installed base. I think Tom's right that Security's been a product category that we've been able to penetrate with new customers, and then once you get in you can Land and Expand them. You can expand it via other offerings.","But I'd say more of the growth to date has come from penetration into the installed base. And there's still a significant opportunity to do more there. I mentioned earlier that 38% of our customers buy security, so that means there's an opportunity for 62% of customers to actually buy one of our Security Solutions.","And so I think you're going to see that we're going to further penetrate the offerings, and I think as we bring more innovation to the table, there's more of an opportunity to sell more into the installed base. And then I think you're going to see us do more in the way of new customer acquisition, Land and Expand model, and I think some of the new offerings are actually going to help us with that.","James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Will Power from Baird. Your question, please.","Will V. Power - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you. Yeah. Just to maybe come back on the Security area. Tom, you referenced the strength in Bot Manager, that being one of the most successful newer products you've had in the last couple of years. And you've got a couple of the new Enterprise Security products, which I realized are early, but I'm wondering if you could just help us maybe frame how we should think about the market size opportunities for each of those, Bot Manager and Enterprise, perhaps relative to your DDoS market, and what you're doing in Security today?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","I think they're very large. Now Bot Manager fits in with our Kona Site Defender and the Web security product space. And Bot Manager's market is at least as big as Kona, and we're seeing that in terms of the ARPUs with customers that are adopting that.","EAA and ETP are on the Enterprise side, and that's a new market for us to go into. That's a market that's traditionally used devices that are purchased by the IT manager, operated in the private network. I think as we go to the future, you're going to see those capabilities sold as cloud services in a recurring revenue market, and we're bringing those kinds of products to market now to help that fundamental change in enterprise architecture and enterprise security.","In the long run, I think the services for enterprise networking and security have a bigger TAM than Web delivery and security. Of course, it's just at the beginning, so it'll take a long time to catch up, but there's a lot more money spent in enterprise networking than there is in Content Delivery. And I think the term often you'll hear in the industry is enterprise networking is turning inside out, and I think you'll be seeing the adoption of cloud services replacing the purchase of devices operated by the IT manager and the WAM (52:07).","Will V. Power - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits from Raymond James. Your question, please.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Can I see if we could maybe put a finer point on the top six question? I know you said it would decline in 1Q, but is 1Q the point where it bottoms as a percentage of revenue? And is there any \u2013 especially the top four because those are the material ones, that might be up for renewal later in the year where there might be some risk to that bottoming out of those six as a percentage of revenue?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","No. As we talked about, I think as a percentage of revenue we expect or certainly prefer to see a decline in percentage of revenue. First, you have the rest of the business, the core business over 90% growing at a very strong clip, and I think these six of which there's really three that are larger today quite possibly could decline in the revenue they pay us, which would mean their percentage would continue to decrease.","And as we look to the future sort of that's the way we're thinking, of course, we're going to do everything we can to maximize revenue in those accounts. I think we provide them tremendous value and three of them are still sizable customers, and I think will always be sizable customers for Akamai.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","And then as I said, any of the top four \u2013 I guess, the top three are that ones that you're focusing on, that would be a risk in the back half of the year as far as renewals?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","I don't think there's so much of an issue there and the impact that any one of them can have is now much less than it used to be, so I don't think that's an issue really to be thinking about. I think the key is they're less than 10% today. We're anticipating further declines certainly as a percentage of revenues through the year and potentially in the future. But I don't think there's any giant event in a single quarter associated with any one customer.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","I'm going to try and squeeze one more in, sorry, but I don't know if you guys want to, but any thoughts about trying to give us a sense for what depreciation should be for next year, so we end up getting not just EBITDA but below the line right as well?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Well, I think, again, I think you should look at our depreciation expense (54:31) as a percent of revenue to take the depreciation expense that we've been incurring as a percent of revenue. And as you ramp CapEx, as a percent of revenue you should be ramping depreciation as a percent of revenue in a similar way.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Horan from Oppenheimer. Your question, please.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. So just two clarifications. Tom, can you give us your best guess maybe on the top six of what's going on? Is it just one or two that are still kind of really seeing declining revenues and maybe a guess on where they can bottom out as a percentage of revenue? Is it 8% of revenue, 4% of revenue, just any more color around that would be great? And I had a quick follow-up.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. No, we're not giving guidance at that level of detail, (55:15) to say we expect some further declines not at the rate we've already seen, obviously, because now they're less than 10% of our total revenue. And this is associated with these companies spend billions of dollars a year in infrastructure generally, and they're doing more the delivery themselves. I think we still provide them significant value. And of course, I'd like to see the revenue there increase as we go forward, but we're not expecting to have that happen.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. And then on the OTT video side, can you maybe talk about why is it accelerating now? What's kind of come together? And a few of the offerings seem to be off to a rocky start in terms of quality, can you talk about it? Is that because of the CDN bottleneck, or is there some other bottlenecks? And maybe just lastly on the OTT front, how do you think your quality is kind of comparing to your competitors in the OTT front? Thanks.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. I'd say OTT is growing at a very solid pace. It hasn't exploded. At times people think that might happen, but that's not taken place. I think there's a lot of new offers out there \u2013 continue to be new offers. People are going to try lots of different kinds of things, and some will have more success than others in the marketplace. It is a very hard thing to do. Just even the delivery of the videos at high levels of quality is very hard, and that's where we really excel. And so we get a significant share of that market and as it grows, we should be in a position to benefit from it. And there's other things besides the delivery that are complicated technically, things involving ads, with ads supported OTT, very complicated to do, and there's a lot of players in the ecosystem in getting everything to work just right. There's problems sometimes.","Again, this is where Akamai really helps their customers in being able to make sure that OTT, it is delivered reliably, can handle large-scale at high bit rates, which means high quality pictures and at a reasonable price point because as that industry grows they need to see the cost per bit delivered come down. And so that's a place where we've got great strength, and I'm very optimistic about the future growth of our OTT business.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut from Guggenheim Securities. Your question, please.","Jonathan Schildkraut - Guggenheim Securities","Good evening. Thanks for taking the questions here. Listen, I'd like to maybe do a little bit of follow-on on to the large Internet Platform question. Even this quarter and last quarter, you've been \u2013 the revenue numbers have held a lot better than we were anticipating, and I'm wondering as we think about that customer group if it is still sort of overflow that you're receiving in terms of traffic, or if there's been any sort of change in terms of the workloads maybe that they're handing off to you versus the ones that they're keeping on their own do-it-yourself platform. Or maybe even alternatively, we've seen them push into some of the new product offerings that you guys are out there with. That incremental color would be helpful. Thanks.","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. We don't really operate on an overflow basis. So it's whatever you're seeing is not really attributed to that. I don't think there's really been a fundamental change in the Internet platform companies in terms of their utilization quarter-to-quarter. Generally, the trend that we expect to see is they're going to try to do more of the delivery themselves. Obviously, they'll take the easier stuff and work on that first. That's one thing that we've seen in the past. That said this stuff is hard to do and to do well and actually to do affordably. So I think that we will continue to have business with these customers. I just think it'll be a lower percentage of revenue going forward.","Jonathan Schildkraut - Guggenheim Securities","All right. Understood. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Your question, please.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, thanks. Hi, guys. So in terms of the increased investment that you're planning on making, I want to understand, I know you don't give guidance beyond the March quarter, but just philosophically, is it a front-end loaded investment in the year where there's more hiring upfront and maybe the non-head count investment happens in the back half? Just how do you layer it in? So do we just step down to the high 30s and then it's a stable EBITDA? Or is there going to be a gradual move down to a trough and then an improvement off the bottom?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","No. I think you're going to see a steady increase in investment throughout the year. I think you're going to see that investment occur, it's going to begin in the first quarter. You won't see it manifest itself significantly because it's going to take a while to get the head count on board and the spending to ramp. So I think you're probably going to begin to see that effective in Q2.","And then my expectation is that, again, it'll stay in the high 30s thereafter. So I think you'll probably \u2013 I'm not going to specifically guide for Q2, but as I said beyond the first quarter, which I said 39% to 40%, and I think that it will be 39% to 40% depending upon where our revenue lands in the range. But I do expect that kind of in Q2 and beyond that it's going to operate in the high 30s.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then my follow-up question is I think you gave us a comment on the top six customers and what you expect in terms of the further decline in the March quarter. I want to make sure I heard you correctly. Does that leave the rest of the customers actually need to accelerate in terms of growth? And if that's the case, where's the source of that acceleration going to come from? Is it the Security side or the Performance or Media side and why?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. Well, part of that is, again, when you talk about acceleration, you're talking about year-on-year. So as Tom mentioned, the declines we've seen in these large customers were much more significant in 2016. So the wraparound impact of that really began a little bit in Q4 and you're going to see that continue in Q1. And so some of it is the wraparound effect of these customers not having nearly the impact on the company growth rates as they did a year ago. My comment was more of a sequential comment that Q4 to Q1 we always see some seasonal declines in the company revenues and also with these big customers, and I expect to see that happen.","And as I mentioned, I think some of the seasonal decline is going to be much more notable in the Media business, and I think you're going to see steady growth in the Performance and Security business.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So basically at the midpoint of the range outside the top six you're expecting the same performance in March as you just saw in December?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah, roughly, yes.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Isbell (01:02:22) from Pacific Crest Securities. Your question, please.","Unknown Speaker","Hey, guys. Tom, just a quick question. Hey, can you guys talk a little bit about your relationship with Microsoft? And if you're seeing any sort of adoption from public cloud users purchasing your product on their platform?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. You can click to buy Akamai Whole Site Delivery on Azure. A lot of companies have done that. It's not a material amount of revenue to us. The Microsoft relationship, on the other hand, is very important to us. We have a substantial number of customers and revenue that flow through Microsoft. And of course, they're a large customer themselves.","Unknown Speaker","Great. And then it sounds like you guys are seeing a little bit more success maybe on the outbound sales side, particularly with Security. What do you need to do to sort of turn that equation around to get more of a pull in effect? I know you guys are stepping up your sales force to go after that growth, but if you could talk a little bit about that, that would be great.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah, we have a new CMO, Monique Bonner, and really making substantial progress in our digital marketing effort, and I think that'll help quite a bit in terms of generating more efficient inbound sales.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Olson from Piper Jaffray. Your question, please.","Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hey, good afternoon. Just to clarify, when you talked about getting back to double-digit revenue, were you suggesting that happens in 2017 or beyond 2017, or you weren't saying any timeframe at all?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","I wasn't referring to a specific timeframe. I think you know the company has been operating in double-digit revenue growth. This is actually the first year we have not. I think you know that certainly the driver of that has been what's been going on with these large Internet Platform Customers. The company growth rate outside of them has been growing in the mid-teens.","So we have been growing in the double-digits. I think that my point was that as we make these investments, these investments are going to take a bit of time to see revenue ramp, and so you're going to see the dividends from these investments more in 2018 and 2019. And I think that is what's going to lead to consistent double-digit growth for the company.","Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. Thanks. And then for international, it's been growing, but it still remains around 30% of revenue. Is part of the investment in 2017 focused at all on initiatives that maybe over-indexed internationally? It seems like that could be a huge opportunity. Is product set or getting the right sales team in place the key factors to drive international to a higher percent of revenue?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","We're pretty pleased with our international growth, but you're right that our international growth has been growing very fast and growing very fast particularly in our Asia-Pacific region. So our investments are much more weighted, I would say, on R&D innovation, to be frank. Our investments are not heavily weighted towards more go-to-market. I actually think the go-to-market side of the equation \u2013 we will make some investments there. It's a matter of giving our existing sales force more products to sell.","Our sales force is pretty confident that penetrating our products into their installed base set of customers is a matter of giving them more products to sell, and I think that by stepping up investment in R&D, getting more products announced, I think will lead to kind of more revenue. And we've proven we can do that, Security being the most recent example.","Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Jonathan, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Certainly. Our final question comes from the line of Jeff Van Rhee from Craig-Hallum. Your question, please.","Unknown Speaker","Yeah, hey. Good evening, guys. This is Ryan (01:06:13) sitting in for Jeff. Just for Ion, I know at the last Analyst Day you mentioned 53% penetration with the product in your customer base. Any update you can provide on base penetration? Or where you see the penetration peeking out? And the price uplift you're seeing from that?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, I think in general that we continue to get good traction in upgrading Ion to our customers that buy our Web performance products that you can imagine that it's kind of a hierarchy of \u2013 it starts with customers that really, really care about performance. And so I think we have a further room there, but I think that kind of the customers that are going to buy Ion \u2013 many of them are already buying their products.","While there's more to sell there, I'd say that probably not a significant, significant opportunity there. And, yeah, we have seen when customers upgrade to Ion that there is an ARPU uplift at times, but I also think there's other things to sell for our Web Performance Solutions. As Tom mentioned, Image Manager is another offering to sell into the installed base.","So if they're buying Ion, now they can buy Image Manager. If they're DSA, now they can buy Imagine Manager. And I think you're going to see us have other adjacencies like that within Web Performance as well.","Unknown Speaker","Great. Thanks. And then back to the top six customers of platform customers, is there any change you guys are seeing in terms of your share of the traffic that you're delivering relative to what the platform company may be doing themselves for using a multi-CDN strategy for?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","With the top six, we have obviously lost share to the do-it-yourself effort. We're not seeing lost share to other third-party CDNs. It's an issue with the DIY, which is the big company has their own platform and they want to try and do more of it themselves.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Thanks.","Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, everyone, and we appreciate you joining us for today. And in closing, as Jim mentioned, in addition to our 2017 Investor Summit on March 14, we will be presenting at a number of investor conferences in February and March and details of these can be found on the Investor Relations section of akamai.com.","Thank you all for joining us, and have a wonderful evening.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference.

My name is Darcel, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Natalie Temple. Please proceed.","Natalie Temple","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Akamai's investor conference call to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2012 financial results. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Benson, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.","Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on February 6, 2013. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances.","As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the News & Events portion of the Investor Relations section of our website.","Now let me turn the call over to Tom.","F. Thomson Leighton","Thanks, Natalie, and thank you, all, for joining us today. I am delighted to be speaking to you as Akamai's new CEO, and I'd like to begin by thanking Paul Sagan for his leadership and many contributions to the success of Akamai during the past 14 years. The transition has been going well, and I look forward to continuing to work closely with Paul in his new role as Executive Vice Chair of the Board.","Now on to our results. Akamai posted record revenue and record earnings in Q4, and our strong results in the quarter capped off a full year of excellent performance in 2012.","Fourth quarter revenue was $378 million, a 17% year-over-year increase and a 9% increase over the third quarter of 2012. As you know, our fourth quarter revenue can vary depending on the strength of our e-commerce holiday traffic, which was strong this year but not as strong as the record levels we saw last year.","Normalized EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.54, of which $0.04 was from a favorable change in tax rates, which Jim will discuss further in a few minutes. Without the tax change, normalized EPS would have been $0.50, up 11% from Q4 of last year and up 16%, sequentially.","For the full year, we grew revenue to over $1.37 billion, up 19% over 2011. We generated normalized EPS of $1.81, also an increase of 19% over 2011. And we continue to generate strong cash flow, with full year cash from operations of $530 million.","Beyond the record revenue and earnings, 2012 was a strong year for Akamai in other respects. We introduced new products in each of our solution lines. We completed 4 acquisitions to accelerate the company's longer term growth. And after placing a major emphasis on driving efficiencies in our network operations, we improved margins in our core CDN business for the first time in several years.","These were clearly impressive results, but I'm even more excited about the opportunity that lies ahead. My excitement stems in part from our belief that the primary forces that are shaping the future of the Internet are very closely aligned with Akamai's core strengths. For example, the rapid growth of media over IP, the proliferation of new and more powerful mobile devices, the urgent need to defend against evermore powerful cyber attacks and the shift to business online as enterprises move to the cloud are all driving business to the Akamai platform.","Taken together, these mega trends have the potential to create significant growth opportunities for Akamai over the next 3 to 5 years.","So that you can better understand these opportunities, I would like to say a few words about how I view our business and the kinds of investments that we are making to drive the next phase of our growth. Of course, we'll say a lot more about these subjects at our Investor Summit on March 11 in Cambridge, where we'll have the time to provide a deeper view into the financial aspects of our various businesses.","In the past, we've talked about our business as having 2 broad product categories: content delivery and cloud infrastructure solutions. Roughly speaking, the content delivery category consisted of services for storing and delivering content, such as pictures or videos, and the cloud category comprised everything else.","For consistency, we will continue to report on the split of our revenue between these 2 categories. But going forward, we will also talk about the company in a more granular way. Specifically, we will talk about our 2 largest and most firmly established businesses, media delivery and web performance; as well as 3 smaller relatively new businesses, web security, network operator solutions and hybrid cloud optimization. I think of all of these businesses as being cloud businesses. And I want to say a few words about each of them today, starting with our media delivery business.","Our success in the media delivery business is determined by how fast the volume of traffic increases, our cost for delivering the traffic and the pricing that we can command in a highly competitive marketplace.","Our quarterly revenue and margins can also vary as we renew customers at lower price points or we refuse to pursue deals that we deem to be unprofitable or of little strategic value. Over the long term, I'm enthusiastic about the potential for profitable growth in the media delivery business. That's because of our proven ability to reduce our cost of serving video traffic and because of the potential for a large increase in the amount of video traffic that can move online.","If the industry were to reach a point where a significant portion of video is consumed over IP and if this video were to be delivered at true HD bit rates, then the volume of video traffic could increase by a factor of 100 or more from today's levels. To capitalize on this potential opportunity, Akamai will continue to invest in our Sola Media Solutions in 2013.","We will focus our efforts on growing network capacity, reducing network cost, improving quality and making the Akamai Intelligent Platform more user-friendly. By providing high-quality video at great scale and reduced cost, our goal is to continue to be the video distribution partner of choice for leading media brands, such as Apple, Sony BMG, News Corp., Nintendo and NBC.","In contrast with our media delivery business, Akamai's web performance business is less about traffic and more about enhancing the performance of mission-critical sites and applications. As many of you know, when it comes to Internet applications, performance matters, and Akamai has always been the leader in performance. That is why so many of the top brands on the Internet, retailers like eBay, Rakuten, Zappos and Ticketmaster, and enterprises like Morgan Stanley, FedEx, Boeing and Standard Chartered Bank, use our web performance services.","But we believe we can do even more in this area, going forward, particularly outside North America. We see 2 significant mechanisms are driving growth in our web performance business.","First, we are increasing our sales capacity and supporting go-to-market functions. In the short term, this sales investment shows up as OpEx, and it lowers EBITDA. But over the longer term, it will fuel further growth in this very profitable business.","Second, we are allocating resources to improve the performance of our services. Our ultimate goal is to provide nearly instant response times for applications and web pages, even for mobile devices, which today often suffer from painfully slow performance.","As I mentioned earlier, Akamai has 3 emerging businesses: web security, network operator solutions and hybrid cloud optimization. Among these newer focus areas, you've heard the most about security. Last February, we introduced Kona Site Defender. This web security solution is designed to leverage our global distributor platform to defend a website or application against a large-scale DoS attack without sacrificing performance, something that we believe solutions offered by other companies can't do.","Kona Site Defender was critical to the defense of some leading U.S. financial institutions as they battled the operation [indiscernible] attacks over the last several months. Despite the large volumes of these attacks, upwards of 65 gigabits per second in some cases, Kona Site Defender kept our customer sites accessible and performing well.","To best defend against such large-scale attacks, we believe that you need the capacity and distributed architecture that is unique to the Akamai platform. In 2013, Akamai will continue to increase investment in our security solutions, with a focus on extending our protective capabilities and in making our product easier to deploy and more channel-friendly for key partners.","Our second emerging business is focused on solutions that we sell to major carriers, such as our AURA Network Solutions. These solutions are designed to help operators reduce cost, improved performance and create new revenue streams by offering their own CDN services based on Akamai technology.","In addition to generating revenue, we believe that having a deeper relationship with carriers can benefit Akamai over the longer term by reducing our CapEx, co-location and bandwidth cost as we leverage the carriers' infrastructure, by improving performance for our customers as we deploy our software even deeper into the last mile networks and by improving sales capacity and efficiency by extending our channel relationships.","We have already made positive inroads with major networks as witnessed by the recent announcements with AT&T and Orange. And we believe that our acquisition of Veraview in December will accelerate our time-to-market with a license component of our operator CDN solution.","Third, I'd like to talk about a new opportunity that we see in helping enterprises take advantage of hybrid cloud computing strategies. For nearly 15 years, Akamai has excelled at improving performance for websites and applications delivered over the public Internet, outside the corporate firewall.","Our goal going forward is to extend our services to reach behind the enterprise firewall, applying our acceleration security and offload capabilities to applications wherever they reside and however they are accessed. Such a capability is rapidly increasing -- becoming increasingly important to enterprises as their applications move into the cloud and as their employees need to access those applications from mobile devices and locations outside the corporate headquarters.","Capitalizing on the opportunities that I have described today will require investment. In this context, it is -- I think it is important to understand 3 things: First, our 3 emerging businesses are highly synergistic with each other and with our core media delivery and web performance businesses. And so they all benefit from the common technology base in an economy of scale associated with the Akamai Intelligent Platform.","Second, we believe that the proven capabilities of our platform, combined with our ability to innovate, puts Akamai in an excellent position to be able to offer unique, compelling and highly profitable services in important adjacent markets.","Third, we will continue to keep a close eye on overall expense and to carefully track performance. If an initiative is not proving to have a desired synergy or potential for future profit, then we will have the discipline to terminate that initiative. As an example, we've recently announced the sale of our Advertising Decision Solutions business to MediaMath. As our ADS business grew and as the online advertising industry evolved, it became clear that the potential for our ADS business could best be realized outside of Akamai and through a partnership with MediaMath. And so we divested that business, thereby freeing up operating expenses for more promising areas that we believe will be more synergistic and profitable for Akamai in the future.","In summary, 2012 was an excellent year for Akamai, and I am very excited by the opportunities that lie ahead. In 2013, we plan to continue to innovate and to make the disciplined investments needed to fuel our long-term growth.","Jim will now review our 2012 results in detail and look ahead to the start of 2013. Jim?","James Benson","Thank you, Tom. As Tom mentioned earlier, our business performed well in the fourth quarter, capping off a very strong 2012.","We grew revenue $33 million sequentially and 17% year-over-year to $378 million in the fourth quarter, coming in just shy of the midpoint of our guidance range. I mentioned on our last call that the online holiday shopping season will play a large role on where we would land relative to our fourth quarter guidance. And while we had a solid e-commerce season, it was not as strong as the record growth we saw last year.","During the quarter, we grew our content delivery solutions revenue 11% year-over-year and 5% sequentially, solid growth when you consider the timing impact of the significant Q3 software releases we discussed in our last call, releases that historically took place and benefited Q4 growth.","Our cloud infrastructure solutions grew 20% year-over-year and 12% sequentially in the fourth quarter. We are particularly pleased with the great traction and demand for our security solutions, with more than 5x year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter, and we had more than 400 customers leveraging at least one of our security offerings at year end. For the quarter, total cloud infrastructure solutions comprised 60% of our total revenue.","Turning to our key industry verticals. Enterprise was our fastest-growing vertical, with revenue up 28% year-over-year and 11% sequentially, as our customers shifted more applications to the cloud and we saw increased demand for our optimization performance in security solutions.","Our commerce vertical increased 17% over Q4 of last year and 21%, sequentially. We continue to see strong growth in our flagship website acceleration solutions, as well as continued traction with our security solutions.","Revenue from our Media & Entertainment vertical grew 15% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. This is particularly strong growth when you consider the timing of the significant Q3 software releases I just mentioned.","High tech revenue grew 13% compared to Q4 of last year and 6% sequentially. Growth in the quarter was driven by solid software download volumes and Software-as-a-Service customers adopting more of our cloud infrastructure solutions.","And finally, Public Sector revenue grew 14% year-over-year but was down 6% from a very strong Q3, due to the timing of several large custom government projects that were completed in the third quarter.","Turning to our geographies. Sales from outside North America represented 29% of total revenue in Q4, consistent with the prior quarter and up 1 point from the prior year. International revenue grew 22% year-over-year and 10% sequentially in Q4.","Foreign exchange provided roughly a $1 million benefit on a sequential basis in the quarter. This benefit was lower than our guidance expectations by about $1 million. On a year-over-year basis, foreign exchange had a negative impact of about $1 million.","Excluding the impact of currency, revenue growth outside North America grew 23% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. Revenue from North America grew 15% year-over-year in the quarter and was up 9% sequentially. Resellers represented 23% of total revenue in the quarter, up 1 point from last quarter as we expanded our partner ecosystem in new markets.","Turning to costs. We were extremely pleased with our continued execution on managing cost of goods sold and gross margins in the quarter. Our cash gross margin for the quarter was 82%, up 1 point from the last quarter and up 3 points from the same period last year and at the high end of our guidance range. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 70% for the quarter, up 2 points sequentially and from the same period last year. We've continued to find ways to make our network even more efficient while taking advantage of our scale. These are critical factors in our ability to deliver gross margins at these levels.","GAAP operating expenses were $170 million in the fourth quarter. These GAAP numbers include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets and stock-based compensation. Excluding noncash charges, our operating expenses for the quarter were $137 million, up $15 million from Q3, up 26% on a year-over-year basis and in line with our expectations for the quarter.","Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $173 million. That's up 17% from the same period last year and up 11% from Q3 levels. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 46%, better than our guidance due to our higher gross margins in the quarter. This level was consistent with the same period last year and up 1 point from the prior quarter.","For the fourth quarter, total depreciation and amortization was $55 million. These charges include $44 million of network-related depreciation, $6 million of G&A depreciation and $5 million of amortization of intangible assets.","Net interest income for the fourth quarter was $1.6 million, roughly flat with Q3 levels.","Moving on to earnings. GAAP net income for the quarter was $68 million or $0.38 of earnings per diluted share. As a reminder, our GAAP net income includes $23 million of stock-based compensation, including amortization of capitalized equity-based compensation and $5 million from amortization of acquired intangible assets.","Taxes included in our GAAP and normalized earnings were $29 million, based on a full year GAAP tax rate of 36.6%, but driving a 30% tax rate for the fourth quarter. As Tom mentioned earlier, this tax rate is more favorable than our 39% full year guidance range, due primarily to higher foreign earnings as a result of a full year tax adjustment to our global cost-sharing model.","Specifically, we adjusted the way we share our R&D costs across our subsidiaries. Including these tax charges, our normalized net income for the fourth quarter was $98 million. That translates to $0.54 per diluted share on a normalized basis, up $0.09 from Q4 of last year, up $0.11 from Q3 levels and coming in $0.04 above the high end of our guidance range.","The favorable tax rate contributed to $0.04 of this overachievement.","Our weighted average diluted share count for the fourth quarter was 182 million shares.","With our solid fourth quarter results, we finished the year with $1.37 billion in revenue, an increase of 19% over 2011. Full year GAAP gross margin came in at 69%, up 1 point from 2011. Cash gross margin was 81%, up 2 points from the prior year.","We are extremely pleased with our margin expansion this past year. Our improvements in this area are a direct result of the work by our engineering and network teams to implement a number of hardware and software initiatives to manage our global network more efficiently, and we believe we can maintain our momentum in scaling the network going forward.","Full year GAAP operating expenses were $628 million. These GAAP numbers include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets and stock-based compensation. Excluding these noncash charges, operating expenses for the full year were $493 million, up 25% on a year-over-year basis.","As we discussed throughout 2012, we are committed to pursuing the exciting opportunities in front of us. Last year, we invested both organically and through M&A, taking steps to increase the pace of innovation and accelerate growth. We hired over 700 employees across the company, focused primarily in additional engineering resources, service and customer support staffing and network efficiency scaling. We also began to ramp sales and supporting go-to-market capacity and expect to further ramp hiring in this area in 2013.","Full year adjusted EBITDA was $615 million, up 17% from 2011. And full year adjusted EBITDA margin was 45%, consistent with the prior year.","GAAP net income was $204 million or $1.12 of earnings per diluted share for 2012. This GAAP net income included $98 million of stock-based compensation expense, including amortization of capitalized equity-based compensation and $21 million of amortization of intangible assets. Excluding these items, our normalized net income for the year was $329 million or $1.81 of earnings per diluted share. That's up 16% from 2011. This number includes a full year GAAP tax charge of $118 million based on a full year GAAP tax rate of 36.6%.","Now let me review some balance sheet items. Cash generation was very strong. Cash from operations for the fourth quarter was $147 million. And for the full year, we generated $530 million of cash from operations or 39% of revenue. At the end of Q4, we had over $1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on the balance sheet.","Capital expenditures in Q4, excluding equity compensation, were $61 million. For the full year, capital expenditures were $220 million or 16% of revenues, in line with our expectations heading into the year. This number includes both investments in the network, as well as capitalized software development, facilities and IT.","During the quarter, we spent $30 million on share repurchases, buying back about 800,000 shares at an average price of $37.50. For the full year, we spent $141 million, buying back over 4 million shares at an average price of $32.50. We are also pleased to announce that our board has authorized an extension of our share repurchase program, authorizing an additional $150 million over the next 12 months, effective February 1. As with our existing program, we intend to fund it out of our cash generation, with a primary goal to offset dilution from ongoing equity grants.","Finally, days sales outstanding for the quarter was 55 days.","With a solid Q4 and a very strong 2012, we are optimistic about our long-term growth potential. We continue to see strong demand for both our content delivery and our cloud infrastructure solutions. We believe that we are executing well in our management of cost of goods sold and expect that to continue. We are also committed to making the investments to deliver near-term performance for the business and to drive Akamai's growth beyond 2013.","Before I get into guidance for the first quarter, I wanted to address 3 items that will be factored into our future results: First, and as Tom alluded to earlier, we announced on January 24 that MediaMath acquired our Advertising Decision Solutions business, which we call ADS. Given the timing of the divestiture, our Q1 guidance will include roughly 1 month of the ADS business. To help you understand the impact of the ADS divestiture to our previously reported 2012 results, a detailed breakout of the ADS business can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.","Second, our Q1 guidance will include a full quarter of the Veraview business. This business will have virtually no impact to the top line but will add roughly $3 million of operating expense in the quarter.","And third, it has become clear that the expected average useful life of our network servers is actually closer to 4 years rather than the current 3-year depreciation convention, due to the software and hardware initiatives we have undertaken to manage our global network more efficiently. Effective Q1, we plan to extend the useful life depreciation methodology of our network assets by approximately 1 year. This will result in less network depreciation recorded in Q1 2013 as we distribute the depreciation expense over a longer period of time.","This change in methodology will impact both existing network equipment on our books as of December end and future network purchases. A supplemental table highlighting the impact of this change on our existing assets can also be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.","Now on to guidance. We are expecting Q1 revenues of $352 million to $362 million. This range represents 13% to 16% year-over-year growth adjusted for the ADS divestiture. The expected deceleration versus Q4 growth of 17% is due to the following: First, as Tom mentioned, we are continuing our selective approach to the management of our media delivery business, and we will be winding down some contracts with a few media accounts in the first quarter that are not of long-term economic value.","Second, we anticipate more difficult comparisons in our cloud solution growth rates, partially due to the wraparound effect of the Cotendo acquisition, which we closed in March -- last March.","And third, we expect that foreign exchange will be a headwind in Q1, with expected negative sequential impact of about $1 million based on current spot rates.","We expect first quarter cash gross margins of roughly 82%, up 3 points year-over-year and consistent with the Q4 levels. We expect GAAP gross margins of roughly 73%. Included in our GAAP gross margin guidance is a roughly 4-point favorable impact to depreciation as a result of the change in our estimated useful lives of existing assets as of December 31 and new assets acquired during Q1.","Q1 operating expenses are projected to be up about $4 million from Q4 levels. This increase is driven primarily by a full quarter of Veraview and continued headcount investments focused in sales capacity, building out some of our new partnerships and in some of the R&D areas outlined by Tom. As a result, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins to be in the range of 42% to 43% for Q1. And we expect to continue to accelerate investment, likely yielding an EBITDA margin in the low 40s for the next several quarters.","At this level of revenue, we expect to see normalized EPS in the range of $0.50 to $0.52 for the quarter. This EPS guidance includes taxes of $26 million to $29 million based on an estimated full year GAAP tax rate of 34% to 35% and a quarterly tax rate of approximately 31%. The driver of the lower Q1 tax rate is the full impact of the reinstated 2012 federal R&D tax credit in Q1.","This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of roughly 181 million shares.","On CapEx, we expect to spend about $65 million to $70 million in the quarter, excluding equity compensation. This reflects our desire to stay ahead of the growth we expect on the network and, more specifically, the impact of increased capitalized software and facility build-out investments to support the headcount growth in the business.","Overall, we are pleased with the performance of the business, and we remain optimistic about our growth potential. We look forward to having an opportunity to go into more details with you about the business and the future trends in the industry at our upcoming Investor Summit in Cambridge on March 11.","Now Tom and I will take your questions. Operator, the first question, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark Kelleher with Dougherty & Company.","Mark Kelleher - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division","I was just wondering if you could go into some more detail on the accounting change. Did you say -- first, just a clarification, did you say 4 points of gross margin effect to that? And if that's right, can you kind of give us an apples-to-apples on the -- what the EPS guidance would be without that change of accounting?","James Benson","Sure. Let me clarify again kind of what we're doing here. So as we talked about over the last year, we've made tremendous progress on improving the hardware and software initiatives and implementing a bunch of hardware and software initiatives to actually manage our network more efficiently. We're actually getting more utility out of our servers. We've been watching that over a period of time. And actually, the useful life of our servers on the network is actually more in the range of 4 years than the current 3-year depreciation convention. That's why we're making the change because we believe we're going to be able to have these assets on the network for a longer period of time. And to your point or question around the impact, yes, it has about a 4-point impact on GAAP gross margins. So think of that as, if you look at the Investor Relations section of our website, that's about $14 million for the quarter. We actually provided what the impact is for the year as well. And if you look at that impact on an EPS basis, because you have to tax effect that, and so when you tax effect that, the EPS impact or benefit in the first quarter is about $0.05.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Bob (sic) [Scott] Kessler with SP Capital IQ.","Scott H. Kessler - S&P Equity Research","It's Scott Kessler. So I guess, a couple of questions. Tom, you highlighted some of the strength that you've seen in the businesses. And Jim, I think you touched upon the particular strength in enterprise, being up 28%. I'm wondering if you could go into some specifics as to maybe some noteworthy wins as to how people are kind of thinking about purchasing and deploying your product. And I'm also wondering if you think you might have benefited from the equivalent of a budget flush. And I have a follow-up as well.","James Benson","I can start, Tom, and you can kind of comment on it. So enterprise in particular, we talked about getting good traction with our security solutions. We've gotten really good traction with our security solutions with our enterprise customers. So I'd say, one notable area that's fueling kind of an acceleration in our enterprise growth actually is the adoption rate of our security solutions. We also continue to get good penetration in the enterprise market with our web performance solutions as well. So we just had -- I think the focus there, I think the focus of the sales force and the investments that we've made there is starting to prove a return in the enterprise space. Tom, I don't know if you want to comment more on the solutions?","F. Thomson Leighton","Yes, I think the message of protect and perform is unique in the marketplace, and it's being very well received. And we're seeing many accounts now where an enterprise will buy the solution driven by our ability to defend them against the cyber attacks and then also buy the web performance solution, the acceleration for their website. And it's a shift in our business that, traditionally, it's always been about performance for enterprises. Now the security aspect is often in the driver's seat and very important.","Scott H. Kessler - S&P Equity Research","My second question involves the balance sheet. So obviously, you talked about, I guess, the new $150 million authorization, given that the other authorizations had expired. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about how you think about capital and, more specifically, what percentage of the indicated cash and investments resides overseas at this point?","James Benson","Sure, that's a good question. So of our roughly $1.1 billion of cash, about $100 million is overseas. So actually, we have most of our cash is not overseas, which actually we're in an enviable position in that regard. But as far as the way we're looking at our capital and our capital structure, for sure, there are significant market opportunities in front of Akamai. And one of the things that we're looking at our balance sheet for and our cash position is to, first and foremost, see if we could put that cash to use in the form of M&A. And what you see us do in 2012 is we actually acquired 4 companies and spent over $300 million on acquisitions. So we will continue to be very active shoppers in the market across our various portfolios, we're going to be very disciplined buyers. And we're pretty much be looking not in any one particular area, but across where it makes sense to have a logical adjacency. So that's probably the first area to be put to use as far as the cash. The second area is we will continue -- as we've done before, continue with the buyback of stock to basically offset dilution from new equity. So that's really the approach that we're taking to the management of the balance sheet.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Gray Powell with Wells Fargo.","Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just had a couple. Can you help us just think about customer demand for Aqua Ion versus your legacy DSA product? And has the addition of front-end optimization technology to the offering created any incremental demand?","F. Thomson Leighton","Yes. Ion was launched in Q4, as you may know. And the initial results are positive, both in terms of offering greater performance, particularly in the mobile environment. As you know, mobile is really critical in the web going forward as the world moves to mobile. And also, in the uplift, we're seeing customers upgrade from DSA to Ion, in some cases, also with Kona for the security offering. And so we're seeing a very nice uplift in the revenues as we convert those deals. Now a key component of the new Ion solution, the first version, is front-end optimization. And that has a variety of capabilities to make the experience be really tailored to the device into the environment where it's operating. So for example, if you're in a congested network and you've got a small form factor device, we'll automatically adapt the images to compress them. So you still get a good picture, but a lot fewer bits are passing through the congested environment. So the front-end optimization has been very favorably received, especially in the mobile environment.","Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got it, got it. And I guess, just -- since you touched on it, can you just give us some insights on how customer demand is changing for mobile beside acceleration-type services? And then I don't know if it's possible or not, but like can you help us just think about the additional ARPU lift on a DSA contract if a customer signs up for Aqua Mobile as well?","F. Thomson Leighton","Yes. I think you go couple of years ago and mobile was barely an afterthought among folks with websites and applications. And today, it's mission-critical. As more commerce moves online and moves on to mobile devices, more business is done on mobile devices, performance now really matters. So you see the folks of websites are actually making special applications or sites for the mobile devices and now they worry especially about the performance there. And that's particularly important because mobile performance is often very bad. Some of studies say that if you look at the mobile Internet today, it performs sort of like the landline Internet performed 9 years ago. And we remember how bad that seems in comparison to today. So mobile acceleration is important. We have a special offering there of Aqua Ion for mobile, and it's doing very well.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Some expense questions for Jim, and then a bigger picture question for Tom. So on the expense side first, so it sounds like a couple -- you said several quarters, I think, of EBITDA margin is in the low 40s, so I assume that's about where we end up kind of at the year. And what is the OpEx growth really going to be like? It was in the upward to 25% last year. What is it this year? And also, I guess, back to the EBITDA question, you're cutting out ADS because it looks like ADS had a $5 million EBITDA loss. And that's why I particularly want to get a sense of the OpEx because even with getting rid of that $5 million of loss here, you're down a couple of points in margins.","James Benson","Well, we didn't lose -- they were -- the ADS business was EBITDA positive. But let me just kind hit [ph] your question more directly, which we have been making investments in 2012 and we specifically made those investments very targeted at accelerating the pace of R&D innovation. And you've seen us introduce products in every single one of the company's product categories. And we're going to continue to make investments in R&D innovation going forward, they're going to be very focused on the areas that Tom had outlined, specifically, building out a security product more fully, expanding our carrier product solutions or our network operator solutions and actually going into an area of hybrid cloud optimization. So from an R&D perspective, we're going to continue to make investments in those areas. I'd say an area that we made some investments in 2012 but probably more in the back half of the year was around incremental sales capacity. There is significant demand and market opportunity for our offerings. And one of the things that I think we talked to you guys about before is that 40% of our business that is CDN-driven, that is more traffic-related, is not a sales resource intensive business. The 60% of our business that is cloud solutions is a transaction monthly recurring revenue business that does require sales capacity to grow. And so we are going to continue to make investments in sales capacity because we believe the market opportunity today are to reaccelerate our growth in our cloud solutions areas. So those are 2 very specific targeted areas. And the reason we're guiding kind of to be low 40s EBITDA is because we believe these are the right investments to make for the company for the, one, to deliver near-term potential for the company, and also to deliver what we believe is future growth potential in kind of some new adjacent markets.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of David Hilal with FBR.","David M. Hilal - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","A couple ones. First, I believe you're having the sales kickoff this week in -- with the calendar year starting, I'm wondering, are there any interesting changes in the sale structure or quotas, alignment, anything that could help or disrupt the pipeline for the most immediate 1Q?","James Benson","I think the main emphasis and change is around our security offerings and getting the reps in the field up to speed on selling that. We're very excited about the potential for security this year and going forward in the future. Otherwise, I would say, it's a pretty typical sales kickoff, and things are going well.","David M. Hilal - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. Let me shift to your comments about not doing uneconomical deals in the media sector. When you say uneconomical, should we interpret that as breakeven or deals that lose money? Or actually, is there a threshold? In other words, are there -- is there profitable business that you would turn away because it doesn't meet the profit requirements that you guys have set?","F. Thomson Leighton","Yes, I'll take that. So I mean, we've always taken a disciplined approach to the management and pricing of our media business. So it really isn't a change necessarily. However, we don't view all customers the same. Some customers are of more long-term economic and strategic value to Akamai that we believe you can make an investment in. And then there are other customers that we don't believe are worth making that investment in. And I think what you're seeing us do is in a handful of cases where we're choosing to wind down a relationship and a contract with a customer because it doesn't have the economics that we're looking for and it isn't of strategic value long term for Akamai.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ben Rose with Battle Road Research.","Ben Z. Rose - Battle Road Research Ltd.","With regard to the recent AT&T partnership that you announced, I was hoping, Tom, you could give a little strategic context to that? And then if Jim could provide any kind of financial color on how the partnership might unfold during the course of 2013?","F. Thomson Leighton","Sure. I think that's a very exciting development for the company. As you probably know, AT&T has, for years, invested significant money and resources into building their own CDN, specifically to compete with Akamai. And so it's really great. That's a great validation of our platform, that they have decided to discontinue that. And they're standardizing their offerings today on the Akamai technology. They'll be a very valuable channel for us going forward, and we're very much looking forward to going forward to the market with them in 2013.","James Benson","Yes, I can comment a little bit about the kind of the rate and pace. So obviously, beginning in Q1, I would say the first half of the year is going to be more of an investment phase where both companies are going to be making an investment in the partnership. We're going to be investing in kind of channel resources to support them. They're going to be investing in sales resources to basically sell the kind of the Akamai product set. There's also some work that we're doing with them from an engineering perspective around building out some particular portal features that they're looking for. So the way to think about it is, it's an investment probably in the first half of the year. We'll begin to get some revenue streams probably for the latter half of the year. And our expectation is going into 2014, that they're actually going to go to be a very significant channel partner for us in the U.S., in particular.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I have 2 questions. They're follow ups to questions already asked. But the first one, just going back to AT&T for a moment, can you just talk about -- is that really going to be focused on what we think of as traditional CDN services and more of a focus towards the Media & Entertainment and the e-commerce verticals? Or is there going to be more of a broad focus to sell some of the new services that you're introducing, particularly in 2012, to call up that enterprise base? And then the second question, just goes back to the guidance you mentioned, the low 40s for EBITDA margin. I assume that's -- when you say low 40s, that's pretty much the same guidance you gave for the first quarter. What I wanted to just make sure I understand is that, you're expecting your gross margins to remain at the levels that we've seen really in the last quarter or 2 in that, call it, low 80s. And it's really the increase in the sales and marketing that's going to go up, that's going to drive those margins down relative to what we saw probably in 2012.","F. Thomson Leighton","I'll take the first question. The AT&T partnership is broad-based and, in fact, that's one of the advantages that AT&T saw in working with Akamai. Just having a CDN really doesn't cut it anymore. You need the advanced solutions and the road map for those solutions that really Akamai uniquely has. And I think that was the key factor why AT&T chose to abandon the internal efforts and to decide to standardize their offerings with Akamai.","James Benson","Yes, and I'll take your -- you're thinking about it the right way, Colby, that we made great progress last year on improving gross margins in our CDN business. And we're actually very confident that we can maintain the momentum that we've had in 2012 into 2013. So the way you're thinking about it is the right way that what's going to drive EBITDA margins to probably be in the low 40s is we're going to make very targeted investments in operating expenses. It's not -- I mean, I would say, it's going to be very heavily focused on sales and marketing and building out sales capacity and supporting go-to-market resources, but it's not going to be just in those areas. We're also going to continue to invest in R&D innovation in the areas that Tom had outlined. Certainly, the Veraview acquisition is but one example where you're going to see that we basically acquired 70-plus employees that you're going to see for -- and we will continue to add on top of that, one, to build out and accelerate our time-to-market for our network operators solutions. Two, Tom talked about security, we're going to continue to make investments in security R&D. We're going to make investments in hybrid cloud optimization. And we think that there's an opportunity for us to continue to innovate in the web performance area as well. So the area -- I would say the investments are going to be targeted towards incremental sales capacity and go-to-market investments. And because our solution sets also are very high performing and very complex, you also need a level of service infrastructure to support them, but we're also going to be investing in the R&D area as well.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Tom, I'm wondering with all the different announcements today in terms of the investment, the focus, et cetera, how much of this is you putting your stamp on the strategic vision now that you're in the CEO role versus how much of this was already kind of set into motion prior to that decision being made?","F. Thomson Leighton","Well, Paul's job, which he did extremely well, was to lead us past the $1 billion. My job is to lead us past $5 billion. And my strategy is going to be to use our very strong cash flow and market position, the unique capabilities of our platform and our ability to innovate to develop new businesses in security, in carrier products and in hybrid cloud optimization, all of which are adjacent markets, new markets for us with very large potential. We're also going to work to improve the growth of our web performance business, as we talked about, in part, by improving performance with a special focus on mobile. Of course, a lot of business is moving to mobile, as you know. And also, by growing our sales capacity, as Jim talked about, that's really vital for that business. We're also making a special effort going forward on making our services easier to integrate and easier for our partners to sell and deploy, with the goal of growing the share from our channel partners. And of course, in media, as we talked about, there's always been a large potential for growth. The traffic always grows at rapid rates, and the key there is to have quality at scale at very low cost. And so we're continuing to work on reducing the cost of our media business. I might add that Paul and I worked together for many years. We share the same vision, and I look forward to working with him in his new role as Executive Vice Chair of the board.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","On the AT&T partnership, you mentioned they're standardizing. But can you review for us, is AT&T putting all of their CDN, both business and content delivery, through Akamai? Or is there a portion, like in the volume content delivery, that they'll continue to be a participant and be a competitor to Akamai?","F. Thomson Leighton","No, they are standardizing their CDN offerings on the Akamai platform.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe with Morgan Stanley.","Jonathan Parker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This is actually Jon Parker calling in for Jennifer Lowe. I was hoping that we can actually dig in a little bit more to the volume businesses. The deceleration was a little bit more than, I think, we were looking for. Two years, around the time we saw a little bit of an issue with a large number of significant renewals coming up at the same time. And I'm wondering how much of the deceleration might be a function of some dynamic around those just coming up for renewal again versus the uneconomical type business, media business, you assessed earlier, versus any other changes in pricing or anything else that we should be aware of? And so I would appreciate any additional color you guys might have on that.","James Benson","No, I'll take that. That's a good question. I mean, I think that it's coincidental. You're right that 2 years ago, we had a phenomenon in Q1 of 2011, where 8 of our top 10 media customers renewed. And it's now 2 years later, and the question is, is that because those customers are now up for renewal, and the answer is no. So we've not having that same effect. I think what you're seeing is just a consistent approach that Akamai is taking. It just happens to be there's a couple of maybe larger ones this quarter where we've looked at the relationship, we've looked at the economics of the business, we've looked at the strategic value of the customer and we've just decided that it's in the best interest of both parties for -- to wind down the relationship. So that's really the driver of kind of what's happening in the near term. I would kind of bring you back maybe to Tom's point earlier, which is there is huge opportunity for traffic growth with media customers. And so what you're seeing here is kind of a slight dip or wind down in these customers throughout Q1. Obviously, they'll be on the platform in Q1. They'll be off the platform in Q2. So you can kind of have an expectation of what's going to happen in Q2 as well. But we also have significant opportunity to continue to grow and penetrate and grow with customers that are of strategic value for Akamai and new customer acquisitions that meet the financial profile for the business.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Sitikantha Panigrahi - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is Siti Panigrahi for Phil Winslow. Could you talk about your competitive landscape? And also, if you could comment on any pricing trends that you're seeing in M&E versus commerce business and anything that you expect to see going forward?","F. Thomson Leighton","Sure. Our competitive landscape varies depending on the business you're talking about. In media, as we talked about, of course, it's a highly competitive landscape, lots of competitors, and there's always pricing pressure there. And it's all about growing the traffic and providing a lower cost of service that we can grow that business profitably. In the web performance business, it's a different situation. The primary competition is do-it-yourself. Our customers see tremendous value in our service because as we make their applications and sites be faster, they get a higher ROI, higher conversion rate, more use of their site. And so we are the fastest out there. We're the most reliable and the most secure, and that has real value to our customers. Now that said going forward, we're making our services even better, to set even a bigger gap between us and the competition to grow that business going forward. If you look at the security space, you have a different set of competitors. You have carriers can offer solutions. You have the cloud washing companies, and you have companies that will sell a device you stick in your data center. Now this is an exciting area for us because none of those solutions can protect the major enterprises against the big attacks. Akamai is unique in its capacity and its ability to do the packet inspection and filtering out of the edge. And really, that's the only way to defend yourself against the large attacks. That's why you see [indiscernible], for example major banks, don't have Kona Site Defender made headlines because you have a large-scale attack and all those cloud washing solutions, boxes and carrier solutions simply can't work once the attack gets to the data center. You go into the carrier operator solutions, different set of competitors, again. And hybrid cloud is sort of a new space moving forward, where, again, I think we're in a unique position because we can leverage the Akamai platform and connect it to software we're placing in the branch offices and in the retail stores to accelerate the performance they see for all of their applications, be it in the private network and the public network or in SaaS, and to offload the connection into that branch office, which is often very expensive. So the competitive landscape is variable, but I think Akamai is very well positioned going forward.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Chad Bartley with Pacific Crest.","Chad Bartley - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","A lot of moving parts with the acquisitions and divestitures. But it seems like the cloud business grew maybe in the mid-teens in Q4 on an organic basis, and then you talked about CDN at 11%. So can you talk at all about growth rates for those 2 segments that's sustainable going forward? I mean, what are the growth ranges we should be thinking about? Or do you guys expect any sort of pickup or slowdown anywhere?","James Benson","I'll take that. That's a very good question. So you're right, our cloud solutions growth kind of for 2012 organically. If you kind of separate out the benefit that the company received from the Cotendo acquisition, it was about 18% growth year-on-year, so very good growth rates. But as I mentioned earlier, what really fuels the growth of the cloud solutions business is sales capacity. It is highly attractive financial model because it has very, very high gross margins but -- and it has very, very low capital expenditures, but it does require operating expenses to grow. In particular, it requires sales capacity and it also requires service capacity, as well as some R&D innovation. So it's been a very healthy financial model. It's actually a more attractive EBITDA and then the company's kind of average EBITDA. But the way this -- the way the business works is you have to make an investment in the sales capacity, and it takes a while for the sales resources to become productive. And the way this business works, because it's a monthly recurring revenue business, once they ramp and become productive, you get them on -- you basically book a piece of business, we integrate them on to the Akamai platform and then they grow. So you have this lag period of time where you have investment in advance of accelerating revenue growth. So I think what you're going to see is that we think we can get the growth rates back in that business, back to the levels that they were, maybe in the 20-plus percent growth range but it's going to take some time for the sales capacity to become productive and then to turn them on to the Akamai platform and turn that into revenue. So it's not -- we're not gated at all by market opportunity. The market opportunity is huge, a significant demand for our solutions. What we need to do is we need to increase sales capacity to accelerate that growth, and it's going to take a little bit of time. So I think what we're signaling a little bit is, one, we're going to see the wraparound effect of the Cotendo acquisition, which will come up in March. And therefore, the comps become more difficult for the company, but we're making the right investments. We began making these investments in 2012 in sales capacity, and we're going to do more in 2013. And our expectation is that you should be able to see accelerating growth in that business going into 2014.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Sonya Banerjee - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is Sonya on for Heather. I guess just as it relates to the core content delivery business, what are you guys anticipating in terms of pricing erosion and traffic volume growth relative to 2012 just for this year? And then are there any dynamics that would drive a more steep price decline this year than what was seen last year?","James Benson","I'll take that so -- because I don't think we really commented on the pricing, that's a good question. A couple of people have asked that. So the pricing environment in the CDN space, as Tom mentioned, has always been highly competitive. But we track it. And I've been with the company now for about 3 years, we've tracked it for the last several years around the pricing. It's been pretty consistent, the rate and pace of pricing. And pricing is declining, but kind of the bands of pricing erosion have really not changed materially. And actually, we don't expect that going forward, they will. We don't expect that they're going to worsen, and we don't expect they're going to get better. We expect them to continue at the rates they've been at. And so really growing the content delivery solutions business has really been about traffic. Right? If you can -- if you believe that the price component of it is going to be relatively stable, meaning that the pricing declines are going to be consistent with what they've been, it's a matter of traffic growth. And admittedly, that is a harder area for Akamai to call. We can call it pretty well in a 3-month period. But beyond the 3-month period, it's really a function of how successful our customers are with basically their products in getting traffic to their websites that we are serving. So certainly, in the near term, we're quite confident in the range that we've provided. I think there's huge opportunity, as more and more content moves online, as Tom outlined, that I would say, that the rate and pace of when that happens quarter-to-quarter is hard to see. I think we know over time, there's going to be an explosion of traffic. And as long as we can make sure that we're the platform of choice for the various companies that we're serving their traffic for, there's a significant opportunity for long-term growth for Akamai.","Sonya Banerjee - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just really quickly on Veraview. You said no impact to the top line, but a $3 million impact to cost. Do see this business progressing toward breakeven or profitability later in the year?","James Benson","Yes, what we had talked about when we made the Veraview acquisition in December was we actually said they would probably be about a $0.01 dilutive to our 2013 earnings. And the way to think about that is, that $0.01 dilutive to probably in the first half of 2013. What we're going to be able to do is get and accelerate our time-to-market with products in that space, get customers on basically a licensed CDN product. So that towards the back half of the year, what you're going to see is revenue that offsets that expense. But for the first half, it's probably slightly dilutive. But in the second half, you'll see it be breakeven.","F. Thomson Leighton","Thank you very much.

Welcome to the Q3 2017 Akamai Technologies Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following management's prepared remarks, we will host a question-answer session, and our instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","It is now my pleasure to hand the conference over to Mr. Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Great. Good afternoon, and thank you, everyone, for joining Akamai's third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Benson, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.","Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on October 24, 2017. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances.","As a reminder, we'll be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of our website. Also, please note that all growth rates referenced today will be in constant currency, unless otherwise noted.","With that, let me turn the call over to Tom.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. Akamai delivered strong results in the third quarter, driven by the continued rapid growth of our security offerings and strong traffic acceleration in our Media business.","Revenue in Q3 was $621 million, above the high-end of our guidance range and up 6% over Q3 of last year. Non-GAAP EPS in Q3 was $0.62 per diluted share, also coming in above the high-end of our guidance range.","The fastest-growing part of our business last quarter was our Cloud Security portfolio, which grew 27% year-over-year to $121 million in revenue or about 20% of Akamai's total revenue. Our leading Kona Site Defender solution continue to be a primary driver of this growth, and I think recent events can help you understand why.","By now, almost everyone has seen the headlines about the breach at a major credit reporting agency that exposed the personal financial data of more than 140 million people. According to published reports, the attackers exploited an Apache Struts vulnerability in a public-facing website to gain access to the confidential data. The company's leaders believe they patched all their sites and apps after the vulnerability was identified. But when there are a lot of sites and apps to update, it's really hard to be sure they're all covered.","As it turns out, they missed one and the gap was exploited, with bad consequences for their customers, their brand, and their market cap. This is one of many scenarios where Kona offers significant value. Kona examines all the traffic coming to a website to determine whether it's safe, attack traffic trying to exploit the Apache Struts vulnerability, or other web app vulnerabilities can be blocked by Kona so adversaries won't cause harm.","In other words, Kona can be used as a virtual patching layer in front of websites and applications, allowing our customers to be protected even when they haven't patched everything. As this example illustrates, using Kona to provide defense in-depth is more important than ever when it comes to cyber security in today's world.","Kona also leverages the enormous capacity in the Akamai platform to protect our customers from large DDoS attacks. By placing our servers in thousands of locations near end users, we can absorb enormous volumes of attack traffic that could easily overwhelm traditional data center defenses.","Kona was a major topic this month at Edge, our 10th Annual Customer Conference, where we announced and demonstrated the latest addition to our Cloud Security portfolio, Bot Manager Premier. Bot Manager Premier is designed to use the advanced machine learning technology that we acquired from Cyberfend to stop account takeover attacks.","Account hacking is becoming a huge problem. In a recent study, we found that about two-thirds of the login attempts that we monitored across our customer base came from bots that were trying to break into accounts. And these bots are becoming more sophisticated at evading traditional defenses based on things like the number of login attempts that come from the same IP address.","To counter this threat, Bot Manager Premier uses artificial intelligence to distinguish machines from human users. It can detect the way humans touch a screen, or press a key, or move a cursor with a mouse, or how people hold and move mobile devices in ways that machines do not. Although Bot Manager Premier has only been in the market for a short while, we already have over 70 customers who are using it to help reduce the billions of dollars that we believe are lost to credential abuse annually.","Bot Manager Premier and Kona Site Defender are designed to protect external-facing apps. At our Customer Conference, we also demonstrated a new solution that will enable enterprises to use Kona to protect their internal applications. The traditional way to protect internal apps has been to use firewalls and architectures based on the notion of a perimeter defense. We believe that such methods aren't good enough anymore. That's because the majority of data breaches are now triggered from inside the enterprise perimeter.","Sometimes, it might be a malicious employee doing something bad, but more likely it's as simple as an unwitting insider getting infected with malware by clicking on the wrong link, or visiting a compromised external website, and then bringing the infection inside the perimeter, thereby, enabling the attacker to corrupt, destroy or even exfiltrate sensitive data.","Last month, a major airline deployed our new solution to protect their internal applications. And within the first week of use, Kona had discovered and blocked 85 attacks that came through trusted insiders. Another new solution that we released in June, Enterprise Threat Protector, helps enterprises prevent employees from getting infected in the first place and also helps stop data from being exfiltrated once the enterprise has been breached.","Enterprise Threat Protector provides a recursive DNS service designed to block employee access to infected sites and to enforce compliance policies quickly and uniformly. Customers love that it's very simple to implement, with most getting it up and running in a matter of minutes.","As we announced on October 11, we expect Enterprise Threat Protector to benefit from our planned acquisition of Nominum later this year. Nominum provides recursive DNS and enterprise security products for over 100 of the world's leading carriers, across more than 40 countries, and serving 500 million subscribers. Nominum's threat avert service detects suspicious DNS activity and identifies malware in subscriber and enterprise devices, thereby protecting users, businesses and carriers from malicious, noncompliant, or otherwise undesirable content.","In addition to bolstering our enterprise security offerings through enhanced data and functionality, we expect that the Nominum acquisition will strengthen our access to the carrier channel for our enterprise security products. I'm happy to report that many of our carrier partners who attended Edge were enthusiastic about the planned acquisition and the opportunity for us to work with them on technology that is so important to the operation of their networks.","Most people don't pay a lot of attention to DNS, but DNS is the onramp to the Internet. It's key to managing traffic flows, and it's a great place to insert security. Some of you may remember a year ago when a small DNS provider got hit with a DDoS attack that resulted in a large number of important websites becoming unreachable.","By integrating Nominum and working more closely with our carrier partners, we believe that Akamai will be able to help make our customer sites and the Internet as a whole much more resilient in the future.","While many of the conversations at our Customer Conference were dominated by concerns over cyber threats and interest in our new security products, there was also a lot of interest among our Media customers in the rapidly evolving OTT landscape and especially direct-to-consumer offers.","Based on our meetings with key executives from several of the world's largest broadcasters, Disney's direct-to-consumer announcement in August is an example of what we think may become a trend over the next several years. We believe this would benefit Akamai because of our close relationships with many of the world's leading broadcasters.","During our last earnings call, I outlined several steps that we're taking to accelerate revenue and traffic growth in our Media business. I'm happy to report to you today that these efforts have started producing results. Year-over-year traffic growth on the Akamai platform accelerated in Q3 to the highest levels that we've seen in two years. In fact, Akamai's traffic grew faster than the 24% year-over-year growth rate that Cisco estimates for the Internet overall; and our video traffic grew at nearly double that rate.","Just last month, we supported a single media event that drove more than 17 terabits a second in traffic. And on that day, we delivered 60 terabits per second overall on the Akamai platform, establishing a new record for our business.","To put this number in perspective, 60 terabits per second is the equivalent of 12 million people watching a video streamed at 5 megabit per second at the same time. And 5 megabits per second is a typical bit rate for the over-the-top streams provided by major broadcasters today.","It's not hard to imagine audiences that are 10 or even 100 times as large in the future and viewing media at even higher bit rates. This is a key reason why we're so optimistic about the future of our Media business and why we continue to focus on improving the scale, quality, and affordability of our over-the-top Media Delivery services.","At our Customer Conference earlier this month, we demonstrated our new low-latency streaming technology which provides an experience that is several seconds ahead of satellite. This is a big improvement over other Internet streaming solutions that are anywhere from 10 to 90 seconds behind satellite, a delay which creates a much less desirable experience for live events and linear broadcasts.","At the conference, we also demonstrated our new media client software which draws content from multiple sources to produce an optimal viewing experience for end users, while also providing cost advantages for our customers.","We still have plenty of work to do to return to historical levels of revenue growth in our Media business, but it's encouraging to see the hard work starting to pay off as we gain share in the market.","There's one last item that I'd like to mention about our Customer Conference, and that's how favorably our customers reacted to the progress we've made in DevOps. Many customers told me how pleased they are to see our advancements in tooling for developers and the ecosystem of partnerships we've built to make developers' lives simpler. We're making great strides in DevOps so the developers and system administrators can work with Akamai their way with the agility they need to deliver their software innovations faster.","In summary, I remain very confident about Akamai's prospects for future growth. I continue to believe that our solutions deliver excellent value for our customers and that our innovations will help our customers thrive as the Internet landscape continues to rapidly evolve.","I'll now turn the call over to Jim for an update on our financials and the guidance for Q4. Jim?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Thanks, Tom. Good afternoon, everyone. Before I dive into the details of the strong third quarter results, please note that all revenue growth rate references will be in constant currency.","As Tom just highlighted, Akamai delivered a strong Q3, with both revenue and earnings coming in above the high end of our guidance range.","Revenue in the third quarter was $621 million, up 6% year-over-year, and up 8% if you exclude our six large Internet platform customers. Revenue growth was solid across most of the business, with the overachievement versus our guidance driven by a higher-than-expected uptick in Media Division traffic and continued strong growth in our Cloud Security Solutions.","Looking more closely at the Q3 revenue results by our customer division lens, revenue from our Web Division customers was $328 million, up 14% over a particularly strong Q3 last year. We continue to see solid growth and diversification into this customer base, particularly with our Cloud Security offerings, with 53% of Akamai's third quarter revenue now coming from our Web Division customers.","Revenue from our Media Division customers was $273 million in the quarter, down 1% year-over-year and up 3%, excluding the impact of the large Internet platform customers. As we outlined in our last call, we've been working diligently to increase traffic growth and share in our Media customer base, and we began to see early traction in the quarter. Our year-over-year traffic growth rate in Q3 was the strongest we've seen since 2015 and exceeded our expectations entering the quarter.","Traffic growth was strong across both our Internet Platform Customers and our core installed base, with particularly strong growth coming from our video delivery customers.","Finally, revenue from our Enterprise and Carrier Division customers was $20 million in the quarter, up 1% over a particularly strong Q3 last year for our carrier business.","Turning now to Q3 revenue results for our solution categories, revenue from our Performance and Security Solutions was solid, coming in at $381 million, growing 10% year-over-year. This growth rate is a deceleration from historical levels, primarily driven by a moderation in the use of Performance solutions by our Media Division customer base.","Third quarter revenue for our Cloud Security Solutions was $121 million, up 27% year-over-year, led by our flagship Kona Site Defender, and Prolexic offerings, and our continued portfolio expansion into new areas like bot management. Our Cloud Security business now has an annualized revenue run rate of nearly $0.5 billion, and continues to grow at a very rapid pace.","Our Media Delivery Solutions revenue was $183 million in the third quarter, down 3% year-over-year; and up 2%, excluding our large Internet platform customers. This growth rate is an improvement over Q2 levels, driven by traffic acceleration throughout the quarter. Finally, revenue from our Services and Support Solutions was $57 million in the quarter, up 12% year-over-year.","Moving on to our geographies. Sales in our international markets represented 34% of total revenue in Q3, consistent with Q2 levels and up 3 points from Q3 of last year. International market revenue was $213 million in the third quarter, up 18% in constant currency, driven by continued strong growth in our Asia Pacific theatre.","Foreign exchange fluctuations had a positive impact on revenue of $1 million on a year-over-year basis and $5 million on a sequential basis. Revenue from our U.S. market was $409 million, up 1% year-over-year; and up 3%, excluding our large Internet platform customers.","Moving on to costs. Cash gross margin was 76%, consistent with Q2 levels and in line with our guidance. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 64%, down 1 point from Q2 levels as we introduced more capitalized software projects on to the platform in late Q2 and early Q3.","GAAP operating expenses were $310 million in the third quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related charges, and other non-recurring items. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $245 million, up $6 million from Q2 levels and in line with our guidance.","Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $226 million, up $2 million from Q2 levels. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 36%, down 1 point from Q2 levels and in line with our guidance. Approximately 1 point of the Q3 EBITDA margin compression is due to the impact of the SOASTA acquisition.","GAAP depreciation and amortization expenses were $97 million in the third quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation associated with stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, and amortization of capitalized interest expense. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP depreciation was $84 million, up $7 million from Q2 levels and slightly above the high-end of our guidance as we introduced more capitalized software projects on to the Akamai platform.","Non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter was $142 million, down $5 million from Q2 levels. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 23%, down 1 point from Q2 levels and in line with our guidance.","Moving on to the other income and expense items, interest income for the third quarter was $4 million, consistent with Q2 levels. Non-cash interest expense related to our convertible debt was roughly $5 million. As a reminder, this non-cash expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results.","Moving on to earnings, GAAP net income for the third quarter was $61 million or $0.35 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $107 million or $0.62 earnings per diluted share; and $0.02 above the high-end of our guidance, driven by the strong revenue achievement and a slightly lower tax rate.","For the quarter, total taxes included in our GAAP earnings were $26 million based on an effective tax rate of 30%. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $40 million based on an effective tax rate of just under 28%. This tax rate is about 1 point lower than our guidance due to a higher mix of foreign earnings.","Finally, our weighted average diluted share count for the third quarter was 172 million shares, in line with our guidance and down 2 million shares from Q2 levels, driven by increased share buyback activity.","Now, I'll review some balance sheet items. Day sales outstanding for the third quarter was 58 days, down 2 days from Q2 levels. Capital expenditures in Q3, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $108 million and coming in slightly below the low-end of our guidance for the quarter, benefiting from our focus on network CapEx efficiency.","Cash flow generation continue to be solid with cash from operations of $236 million in the third quarter. Our balance sheet also remains very strong with roughly $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on-hand at the end of the quarter. If you factor in our convertible debt, our net cash, it's approximately $725 million.","During the quarter, we spent $129 million on share repurchases, buying back roughly 3 million shares. As we've discussed in the past, we believe the strength of our balance sheet and cash position is an important competitive differentiator that provides us with the financial flexibility to make key investments at opportune times, including the repurchase program and M&A. We believe our SOASTA acquisition in Q2 and our expected acquisition of Nominum in Q4 are great examples of how we've used the strength of our balance sheet to invest for future growth.","In summary, we're pleased with how the business performed in the third quarter. We exceeded the high-end of our guidance range on both the top and bottom line. We've continued to see a robust pipeline of innovation across the business. And we've already seen good traction in our traffic share initiatives, which we believe will improve the performance of our Media Division.","Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, holiday seasonality plays a large role in determining our financial performance, driven by online retail activity for our e-commerce customers and traffic for our large media customers. As a result, the fourth quarter remains the hardest to predict.","Also impacting our guidance is the close of our Nominum acquisition, which is expected in mid-November. As we shared in our press release announcing the acquisition, we expect Nominum to be dilutive to earnings over the next four to five quarters due to the impact purchase accounting has on revenue recognition and cost associated with integrating and scaling the business.","We expect the acquisition will be accretive to earnings beginning in 2019. Operationally, we plan to integrate Nominum it into our core carrier business and, going forward, we will not be reporting on the Nominum business separately.","Lastly, we expect modest foreign exchange headwind from the strengthening of U.S. dollar over the past several weeks. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact on Q4 revenue of $1 million compared to Q3 levels.","Factoring in all these variables, we're expecting Q4 revenue in the range of $638 million to $656 million. This guidance assumes roughly 1.5 months of Nominum revenue. And due to the impact purchase accounting has on revenue recognition, Nominum's revenue in the fourth quarter is expected to be a modest $1 million. At these revenue ranges, we expect GAAP gross margins of 65% and cash gross margins of 77%, both up 1 point from Q3 levels.","Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $265 million to $270 million, up $20 million to $25 million sequentially, as the business absorbs 1.5 months of Nominum spend and as we continue to make targeted investments in our Web and Enterprise divisions.","Factoring in the cash gross margin and operating expense expectations I just provided, we anticipate Q4 EBITDA margins of 35% to 36%. As a point of note, Nominum is expected to compress EBITDA margins by roughly 2 points in the fourth quarter and into 2018 while we integrate and scale the business.","As we've said in the past, factors that could impact our EBITDA and operating margin profile would be M&A activities and revenue volumes quarter-to-quarter. As we absorb the SOASTA and Nominum acquisitions, they will weigh on EBITDA margins in the near term. And while we're not providing specific guidance beyond Q4 on this call, we are striving to operate the company in the mid-30% EBITDA margins and low-20s operating margins in 2018.","If we are able to continue to improve our Media growth rates and deliver continued strong growth in our Web business, we would expect to see EBITDA margins return to the high-30s. And we remain committed to balancing both top line and bottom line growth over the longer term.","Moving now to depreciation, we expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be $84 million to $86 million. Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 22% to 23% for Q4. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q4 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.60 to $0.65, inclusive of an estimated $0.04 dilution impact of the Nominum acquisition.","This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $41 million to $44 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of just over 28%. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of 171 million to 172 million shares.","On CapEx, we expect to spend $90 million to $100 million, excluding equity compensation, in the quarter. For the full year, this level of CapEx would equate to roughly 16% of revenue, at the low-end of our long-term model of 16% to 18% of revenue.","In closing, we remain confident in our ability to accelerate revenue growth rates for the business, execute on our continued product and customer diversification strategy, and deliver a compelling financial model for our shareholders.","Thank you. And Tom and I would like to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. And our first question will come from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Thanks. Hi, guys. Wanted to dive into the Media strength, but the performance weakness in the quarter. Sound like it might both be coming from the same set of customers. So can you give us specifics as to what within those changes resonated to gain share and drive Media strength? And what drove the weakness in the Performance piece?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. So as I talked about in my remarks, we have some really strong new capabilities for Media, particularly around video. The idea that now we can do live and linear broadcast ahead of satellite, that's a pretty big change over what is otherwise available with OTT streaming typically being 10 seconds to 90 seconds behind the satellite broadcast. The new capabilities from the client side software to be able to take sources of the content \u2013 multiple sources, integrate that and provide a seamless viewing experience for the user and also at a lower cost point for our customers is important.","Broadcast operation support is really important for high-quality OTT. The accelerated ingest technology, origin-connect capabilities so we can connect directly with the large broadcaster origins. The focus on the big 250 global media companies that we talked about in the last call, giving them the kinds of packages and capabilities that they want for things like subscriber-based pricing, background downloads where that makes sense, peer-assisted delivery, regional pricing based on our deep carrier relationships, things like managed CDN services.","So a lot of stuff that we do that's very unique in the Media business and focused on the big media broadcasters and customers. And we're seeing really strong response there in terms of gaining market share, traffic growth, particularly in video.","On the Performance and Security side, obviously, Security doing very well with several new capabilities coming into market over the last several months that we think will drive continued strong growth for our Security products. And in the Web Division, which features the Performance and Security products, 14% growth there. A little bit less than it was last quarter. And part of that driven by some of the things going on in public sector, which tends to be lumpy and there's some uncertainty in Washington right now. And so, that had a little bit of an impact on the Web Division customer base growing at 14% this quarter.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And then, just one follow-up for Jim. Thanks for the color on 2018 margins, just in general. But I know we're going to get the question \u2013 I have the question. So as March should have a full quarter of Nominum headwind, shouldn't that be the trough in margins and would you expect steady increase from there? Or is it one of these things where you take a hit, maybe it comes up a little and just kind of flat lines until you see some of those top line drivers that you spoke about kicking in?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","I think you're thinking about it the right way. Whether it's a trough or not, Q2 is also a quarter for the company where we do tend to seasonally have an uptick in expenses just in the core business. And so, it'll probably be a little trough in Q1 and Q2, and then it should scale from there.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Siti Panigrahi with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Siti Panigrahi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up to Sterling's question on the Media traffic side. This quarter you talked about two record peaks in terms of Media traffic; September 12, the 60 terabits, and that beat your August 29 peak. So is that any kind of one-off event that you experienced this quarter? Just wanted to understand how sustainable is this traffic growth or is it something to do with your focus now back on the top 25 media customers?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yes. So there's always events that take place, and the big events drive the new traffic records. And as we talked about before, any given event itself, because it's a short-duration event, usually doesn't have a lot of revenue associated with it. But when we're talking about the overall traffic growth, we're talking total bytes delivered. And that's not driven by events; that's driven by the top 250. And we were very pleased to see that our total traffic growth in the quarter, the growth rates there being the highest we've seen in two years, higher than the Internet as a whole. And really pleased with the aggregate video traffic growth being nearly twice what you see the established reports saying for the Internet as a whole. So really gaining strong share there. And that's not measured really by these one-off events that sort of get the headlines because that's where you hit the peak of traffic. We're talking about the core business in Media, total bytes delivered. And that's because of the focus on the top 250, the focus on scale, quality at an affordable price, and all the capabilities that I talked about around Media.","Siti Panigrahi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you, guys, for taking the question. When we think about the Media business, particularly the platform side of the equation, you guys have seen revenues around $51 million for I think this is like three quarters in a row. Is it safe to say kind of like the worst is behind us in terms of the declines that you guys expect from those platform customers and that should grow on a going forward basis or is this more of a pause in what could be a longer term declining trend line?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yes. I think with the big platform companies, it appears as they've sort of stabilized at about combined 8% of our revenue, seeing the same quarter-over-quarter. Now we've got a little bit of time still for the year-over-year wraparound effect. So there's a little bit left to see there. But basically, it looks like things have stabilized on that front with the six giant platform companies accounting for about 8% of our revenue.","Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And then just one question on pricing, particularly the pricing that you guys get on the video traffic versus the rest of the traffic. How should we think about that, the relative pricing on one versus the rest of the traffic?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yes. I think the pricing tends to be higher where it's more difficult to do and there's a perceived higher value. So in terms of bulk bit delivery, if it's something like a background software download, you'd see the lowest probably pricing there. If it's doing something for OTT, live linear video where our customers' users are paying, that's where quality matters the most and where our capabilities matter the most and so we would be, generally speaking, paid more there. Now, of course, the largest volume customers will also pay the lowest rates. And so, when you have very large customers, that will drive a lower price point per byte delivered. So those are sort of the two ways of looking at it. One is sort of the scale, and the other is in terms of the value that's being provided.","Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. So when we see the video traffic growing twice the rate of the overall traffic, is that a positive for pricing?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. Well, I think it's a positive for Akamai. I think we look at the future of the Media business as really being driven by video. There will always be software and gaming delivery, but really the future is the adoption of OTT at real scale. And we're really still at the beginning of that. And when we see the video traffic growing, that's something that we see as a very positive sign for us.","Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you very much, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Please proceed.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. Michael Turits. Thanks a lot. So one question on Media and one on Performance. So it's great the acceleration in traffic growth rates. Is that a function of you guys regaining share given the fact that you've had a new strategy on pricing and how you look at customers, or is it a function of the customers accelerating their, let's call it, organic growth rates? And then I had a question on P&S also.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Well, probably there's some combination there, but we do believe we're gaining share. And that's specifically account by account based on delivering what a major broadcaster needs or a major media company needs.","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","I think also, when you measure based on the Internet as a whole, we're growing faster than the Internet as a whole...","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Right.","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","...which would suggest we're taking share.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yes. So we're comparing against the established reports out there what the Internet's growing as a whole. In some cases, we have competitors that publish reports on how fast they're growing. And so, when we see ourselves growing faster, a lot faster than that, we take that to believe \u2013 as further proof that we're growing our market share.","Now that said, I think OTT will continue to grow as a market as a whole, and there's a long way to go there for future growth as I talked about with some of the ways of thinking about 60 terabits a second today and what viewing audiences might look like in the future.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Right. And then maybe I'll follow up on Media instead of talking about Performance. But on Media, it seems as if it's \u2013 is there a change in your view relative to the Internet platform guys? I guess my thought process \u2013 or (38:25) your thought process was that there was probably still some significant share movement of the DIY guys from this point forward. Has that changed, if you feel like you've actually bottomed at this percentage level?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","I don't think there's a fundamental change. The giant platform companies are going to do a lot of DIY; they are doing a lot of DIY now. We're seeing a stabilization in terms of percentage of our revenue, 8% being from those six large platform companies. I think as we look at OTT in the future, those six companies are going to have a reasonable share of OTT. And I think as we look forward, we see a world where there'll be a lot of direct-to-consumer and other distribution mechanisms in addition to those six large platform companies. And that presents a very large opportunity for Akamai.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Tom and Jim.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Brad Alan Zelnick - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks very much, guys, and congrats. Nice to see stabilization in the Media Delivery side of the business. Most of my questions have been answered on that front. I want to turn just to Cloud Security, which in the quarter decelerated, but at a consistent rate with I think what we've seen in prior quarters. And as we think about the trajectory going forward, I wanted to just drill into Nominum a bit.","So as you stated in your prepared remarks, builds on Enterprise Threat Protector. And if I'm not mistaken, it's a Carrier and Enterprise play. Can you talk about the go-to-market and types of investments you need to make in this channel and how you see them paying you back over time? And perhaps if you looked out into the future, how much of security over time comes from the Carrier channel, looking out three to five years maybe?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. I think the Carrier channel is very important for us. Carriers are incredibly important partners. They're our fastest growing channel by far. We're deepening the relationships with the world's major carriers. Nominum helps us do this. They provide a very important technology for the carriers. And then, with the recursive DNS, it's what controls the onramp to the Internet, it's what controls traffic flows across the carrier backbones. We're in a great position to combine that with our capabilities to really help the carriers manage large traffic flows.","Now, on top of that, Nominum's built their enterprise services, the enterprise security services that are very synergistic with our Enterprise Threat Protector services. And so, this will help Enterprise Threat Protector and it will help grow the Carrier channel for us; already our fastest growing channel, but I think helps it further. So it's important for us in both senses: first with enterprise security products and capabilities; and, secondly, deepening the relationship with the world's major carriers.","Brad Alan Zelnick - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Mark Kelleher with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed.","Mark Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Sorry to do this, but I want to go back to the Media again. You saw some great growth there, 24% year-over-year, but revenue was down year-over-year. So can you talk about the pricing dynamic? I know you talked about some steps you were going to take last quarter competitively to regain some of that. Can you talk about \u2013 I know one of your competitor is in the process of being acquired. Yeah, just talk about what you're seeing in pricing. And was part of the dynamic where in the value curve the bits were that you were delivering? Maybe not OTT, but maybe more on the commoditized side? Thanks.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. First, our growth was in excess of 24%, which is the Cisco-published stat for the Internet as a whole. Pricing is competitive in the Media segment. It has been from the beginning, for the 19-years we've been in business, and I think it will always be competitive. And we work really hard to provide the best possible pricing for our customers, so they can grow their business on the Internet. We work really hard to lower our costs, so we could be competitive out there and still be profitable in our Media business.","So I don't think there's been a fundamental change in the pricing dynamic. Every year, there's more traffic and at a lower price point per gigabyte delivered. We're looking forward, as we gain share, we definitely want to do that. And we do believe it will help us grow revenue going forward and accelerate revenue growth going into 2018. Jim, do you want to add anything to that?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","No, I think you covered it pretty well that, obviously, the revenue is a function of traffic and price point. And I think, as Tom outlined, that what we saw was a acceleration in traffic growth. Our expectation is, if we can continue to execute well, you'll start to see that acceleration in traffic growth manifest itself into an acceleration in revenue growth in the Media business.","Mark Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of James Breen with William Blair. Please proceed.","James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking the question. I think, it might have been last quarter, you talked about on the video game side seeing a little weakness here in some of the updates. Are there any particular verticals this quarter that you saw strengthen that you hadn't in the past? And then just with the big six, are you seeing \u2013 the revenue's been stable now for three quarters \u2013 any different types of traffic that you can tell that you're getting or not getting from them and has that shifted over time? Thanks.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. I think we're very pleased to see, within the Media area, very pleased to see the growth in video traffic. That's, of course, where we're focusing. And that's been, I think, the major change from prior quarters. And I think with the big six, again, we're going to get used more for video, we're going to get used more for live and linear events within video. So not a fundamental change there. Of course, we did do some very large events that we talked about; and those were for some of the giant platform companies. So not a fundamental change. Again, if quality matters, which it does more for video, there will be more business turning to Akamai.","James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC","And then, just quickly on the housekeeping, how much did you spend in buybacks during the quarter and then how much free cash flow did you generate? Thanks.","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","So we spent about $129 million in the quarter in the buyback, and our cash from operations was about mid-230s.","James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, thanks. Yeah. Hi, Tom and Jim.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Hi.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, hi. It'd be very helpful for us to know in terms of what are the sustainable drivers for traffic volumes? And the reason I ask is, traffic volumes have been lower than expected recently and then we saw this acceleration. So what's driving the acceleration? And is part of the acceleration due to this move to your off-peak pricing strategy? Is that starting to resonate with some of your top customers? Is this why perhaps we could see like sustainably high traffic volumes moving forward? Thanks.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","I think the sustainable drivers for traffic are focused around OTT and the growth there. And, for us, to gain share there is the focus on quality, on scale, on affordability, on the functionality that we talked about. Low-latency streaming, being as current or better than satellite, instead of 10 seconds to 90 seconds behind satellite for the client-side software that provides even better quality and potentially lower price, for capabilities like accelerated ingest or connecting directly to our large customers' origin, broadcast operation support. All these things that Akamai uniquely does, I think, help us and our sustainable drivers for traffic growth for Akamai.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Perfect. A quick follow-on would be on the enterprise security business. I mean, arguably you've done many interesting acquisitions recently. So when could we start seeing enterprise security inflect as part of security revenues? Would it be sometime like front half or second half next year, so helps us model the security business as enterprise starts waterfalling in? Thanks.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Right. No, good question. These are very early days. We just released our first product, as we've talked about. And we'd like to see it start to make a difference at the end of 2018. So it's big enough that you'll start to notice, and we'll report it out separately. Our goal is to have the same kind of growth trajectory we had for web security, which was nothing about five years ago, and now is on a $0.5 billion a year run rate. So that's the goal, which would mean we'd start to see something meaningful by the end of next year.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Rob Sanderson with MKM Partners. Please proceed.","Rob J. Sanderson - MKM Partners LLC","Yeah. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for the question. I want to dig into the Web Performance business a little bit. Growth of 4% by my calculation, that's pretty significant deceleration from the 8%, 9%, 10% that we've been seeing recently. So I've got a few questions. I think the large majority of this business is recurring revenue. Should we assume that bookings and renewals are both fairly weak here? Or is there more lumpiness or what we used to call bursting revenues years ago in this business?","Second question is, I think this is an area that management has identified as where you could be growing faster. I know there's been some reorg and some leadership changes over the past couple years. Can you comment on your satisfaction or dissatisfaction in those efforts? And then, finally, how would you characterize the competitive dynamic as it relates to the slowdown in growth from Web Performance products? Thank you.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. We, principally, don't look at it from the product perspective there. There's such a blurry line between the Media products and the low-end Performance products. And so, the Web Performance product number gets caught up in Media. So I don't think it makes sense to look at it that way. I think the right way to look at it is what the Web Division number is, and that grew at 14%. Of course, Security is an important part of that, but so is Performance. And we have more revenue from our Performance products there than we do Security still.","So I would say that business is strong and growing in a good clip. Like all of our businesses, it's very competitive. And we have seen some burstiness in public sector, which is part of our Web Division customer base. And as we talked about, there's a little bit of softness there right now. And that helped contribute to go from a 16% growth rate in the Web Division to 14%. So I think that's the right way to look at it. You don't get caught up in anything that's going on around Media, and whether they're buying Media products or Performance products. Think of it as the Web Division customer base. That's how we think about it. And it's at a very healthy 14% growth rate.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Hi. I just wanted to follow-up on the Performance business as well. I was wondering if you could talk about year-over-year pricing trends in the quarter for Performance, in particular? And also kind of how this compares to what you've seen for the year?","And also, I mean, maybe I missed it, but can you give us an idea of the amount of revenue there that's driven by the Media customer overlap and how we should think about that going forward? Thank you.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. I think the pricing trends are pretty typical in the Performance business. Every year, the pricing based on traffic comes down per byte delivered. We do have several new products there that are very successful. There's the entire security product line that we talked about. We also have Image Manager, which is new in the last year, getting a lot of success in terms of the Web Performance products. We have now the mPulse and the SOASTA products now in the marketplace getting traction. We have the mobile SDK for the mobile apps. An increasing the amount of the traffic is going to mobile apps. And so, the API traffic there is very important. So those are new products that we're bringing to market. And that helps offset the normal decrease in pricing, so that we actually grow the revenue we're receiving for our Performance products in the existing customer base.","And I wouldn't really think too much about the overlap of the low-end Performance products that our Media customers can buy. Think about it in terms of the Media Division and what they're doing; and a lot of that we're focused on there is on video. And then, you think about the Web Division customer base, which is pretty much everybody about media and carriers. That's the vast majority of the Fortune 1000, and they focus on the Web Performance products and the web security products. And we're seeing very strong growth there. No unusual behavior, I would say, in pricing. And the good news is, there's new products we're bringing to market, not only in security, but also in Web Performance that are gaining traction.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. I guess, what I was trying to get at is just the Performance business decelerated year-over-year. And it used to be a line that I think people thought of as kind of the high-single digit performer. Are these new products that you're talking about, just is that stuff that will help the growth next year or is that something that they were in the market for all of Q3? I'm just trying to get a sense for the deceleration and how do we think about just that Performance line when we think about sustainable growth rate going forward, because that also includes the SOASTA acquisition, if I'm not mistaken.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Right. I think the new products will help the Performance product revenue going into 2018. They are new this year, so they're at very early stage in terms of their overall revenue contribution. But, yeah, I think you will see improvement in 2018 based on those new capabilities.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Michael Hart with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed.","Michael Hart - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. There's been a lot of questions that I had already asked, but I wanted to dig into something that hasn't come up as much yet. In recent quarters, you've consistently called out the Asia Pacific region as driving strong growth within your international segment. I was wondering if you could provide any incremental color on maybe what kinds of customers or solutions or maybe any particular countries that are really driving the strong performance there.","And then also one quick housekeeping question. On the Nominum deal, can you tell us what the price you paid was? And I assume it will be funded from cash on the balance sheet. I just wanted to confirm that. Thanks.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. APJ continues to be a strong growth region for us. We also had good growth in EMEA, but APJ leading the way. It's similar kinds of customers and solutions that we sell here, but there's just a lot of growth in that region as a whole and for us in particular. And you think about it, a lot of the Internet users are there, a lot of the major device manufacturers are there, a lot of the world's major enterprises are there. So it's not too surprising. And it's the countries you'd expect that are leading the way. Japan being very strong, Australia being strong, Singapore and Southeast Asia having strength. So I would say there's nothing really unusual there, sort of what you would expect knowing our business. And, Jim, you want to talk about Nominum?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, I don't think it would be appropriate to talk about the price for Nominum. The deal hasn't closed yet. The deal is supposed to close kind of in the next couple weeks. You'll certainly see it in our Q4 cash flow statement, but I'd rather not comment on it right now until the deal closes.","Michael Hart - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay, understood. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. I'll just ask one question, please, on OTT. Is there any way you could quantify what percentage of traffic \u2013 or what percentage of revenue that currently constitutes? And just an outlook just on the OTT segment or that channel. Thank you.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. We don't split that out. But obviously that segment is growing more rapidly within the entire Media portfolio, but we don't give that split on a quarterly basis.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks anyway.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Barry Sine with Drexel Hamilton. Please proceed.","Barry Michael Sine - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Hey. Tom, at your Edge conference in Las Vegas, I thought your presentation with SOASTA was pretty compelling. I know you've only had it for a quarter or so, but could you talk about how that's driving? And I guess that really drives revenue from other products. But what's been the customer reaction from that presentation and then using that tool with customers?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. We got a great response at our Customer Conference. For those of you who weren't there or didn't see the video, we offered a free 30-day trial, a freemium capability. And we were really pleased to see that a lot of customers signed up on the spot to try it out.","And we derive revenue in two ways from SOASTA. One is when they buy the service on an ongoing basis, because it really helps them manage their websites and apps more effectively and their online businesses more effectively. And then, of course, when they see the benefit they can get by adding new Akamai capabilities, there's a very strong tendency to buy those capabilities from Akamai. And so, we get revenue from our other Performance services on top of just the plain SOASTA revenue. So we were very pleased with the response and really excited that customers on the spot there could turn it on and start seeing what's going on with their websites.","Barry Michael Sine - Drexel Hamilton LLC","And then a question for Jim on the buybacks in the quarter. Where you are right now in the aftermarket, the stock was as much as 20% below that in August. So you had a pretty good opportunity for buybacks. What was the philosophy there? What's the philosophy going forward? Do you have the ability to drive buybacks higher? The stock is still relatively undervalued where it's been historically.","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. I think we've talked about it before that the way our buyback program works is it's an algorithm and it basically is an algorithm that buys back more shares and spends more money when the stock price is at lower valuation levels and it buys back less when the stock price is at higher valuation levels. So you certainly saw that the uptick in Q3 was a function of our belief that obviously the company's valuation was low.","As you can imagine, we're fortunate to have the benefit of generating a lot of cash as a company and having a fair amount of cash available to be able to do both buybacks and M&A. And so, buyback has been an important component of our capital strategy. As you can imagine, one of the things we've talked about is that we've been acquisitive in areas, most recently with SOASTA and next with Nominum, and so we'll modulate the buyback program based on also firepower that we want to have available for M&A. But we viewed Q3 as an opportunistic time to spend more on the buyback.","Barry Michael Sine - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Jeff Van Rhee with Craig-Hallum. Please proceed.","Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Great. Thank you. So three brief ones. One, if you could just touch on Nominum's pre-acquisition growth rates to give us a little context of the trajectory of the business.","And then the second one, around network utilization overall, I know you don't quote a number, but as you stand now, how are you positioned with respect to overall network utilization and maybe compared to the last two, three years? And how do you envision maybe the next year or two playing? Maybe asked differently, do you intend to operate the network at a higher utilization rate?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Take the first one?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. The first one is that, as you can imagine, Nominum's growth impact on Akamai is going to be fairly minimal early on because of the impact of deferred revenue and purchase accounting, because a very large percentage of their business is a license and perpetual revenue stream where we're not going to be able to recognize that revenue until we resell their business once we bring them on. But their business, on an organic basis, was growing in kind of the high-single digits. But combined with Akamai, we think that we're going to be able to integrate that, as Tom mentioned, some of the capability into our security offerings and increase the revenue growth rate. It's going to take a while to anniversary this deferred revenue impact. So you should expect to see their business kind of begin to accelerate, from a growth rate perspective, throughout 2018 and more notably into 2019.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. And on the second question, I think we're in very good shape there. We talked about recently doing 60 terabits per second of traffic, and I can tell you there was plenty of headroom on top of that available for us. And, as you may know, we put a ton of work into always improving the efficiency of our software and platform, and that helps us get more bits per second out of every dollar we spend on colo or a CPU. And so, we have plenty of room now. And as we go into next year, what we have will be able to produce even more. So that's an area where we're pleased with the progress we're making, and I think we're in pretty good shape.","Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Maybe if I can just try one other question here. With respect to last quarter, you touched on your intention to drive some differentiated pricing. I think that's the words you used. As you look at the contracting structures and pricing methodologies, particularly on Media this quarter, can you color that in a little bit what did differentiated pricing look like as it sort of played out in the field?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah, sure. Things like per subscriber pricing, per geo or per carrier pricing, pricing depending on a particular customer's needs. So just a lot of flexibility there so that we can align our pricing to our customer with their revenue model so that it takes a little of the risk off of them and they can run their businesses more effectively. So that's the kinds of things that we are doing in the marketplace as customers come up for renewal.","Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Got it. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Sameet Sinha with B. Riley. Please proceed.","Sameet Sinha - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Yes. Thank you very much. A couple of questions. And just looking at fourth quarter guidance, if I make my assumptions about revenues from SOASTA and Nominum, seems like you're guiding to, at the midpoint, a slight slowdown from the third quarter at about 4%. Just wanted to understand the dynamics in the fourth quarter. I can understand \u2013 you spoke about e-commerce and how this is an unpredictable quarter. Is there some impact potentially from the Presidential elections on a year-over-year basis as well? So if you can provide some clarity.","And, secondly, last call you had spoken about just managing costs and cost reductions. Can you talk about your initiatives in that direction and how we should think about it as we head into next year? Thank you.","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Sure. So on the Q4 revenue guidance, actually, we think this is a pretty robust guidance. We had a very, very strong Q3. Actually, and as we mentioned, significantly better than what we expected going into the quarter. And, as you mentioned, that the holiday seasonality plays a large role in where Q4 revenue land. So we think it's a reasonably strong guidance. I think it is fair to say that we had an exceptionally strong Media quarter last Q4, so there's a pretty significant difficult compare in the Media business year-on-year.","But I think, as I color the guidance, that I think that \u2013 if the holiday season and the e-commerce season is strong, we would expect to be kind of towards the higher end of our guidance. And if it's not as strong, maybe to the lower end and kind of, call it, the midpoint, call it, having a solid holiday season. And again, last Q4 was a very strong holiday season and was a very strong e-commerce season. So tough to predict what's going to happen. Those things are somewhat out of our control, all-in making sure that we're the provider of choice for that business.","And as far as cost efforts, I think Tom commented a little bit on it. We are continually focusing on cost, in particular around driving more network costs out of the platform, driving bandwidth costs down, getting more efficiency out of collocation, software efficiencies to get more kind of throughput out of our servers. So there's a lot of activity. That's not something new. It's something that we continue to do. You kind of heard from my guidance for the fourth quarter that we're expecting an uptick in gross margins from Q3 to Q4. Invariably, some of that is seasonally when revenue grows like it does Q3 to Q4, but you can also read into that that we're making continued progress on our network cost efficiencies.","And we do the same thing on the OpEx side, that some of what you've seen here recently with some compression for the company's EBITDA margins has been heavily driven by acquisitions that we've done. And it takes a while to absorb and scale these acquisitions that we think are the right things for the business. And then, there are targeted areas of investment that we want to make sure that we're investing in even with what's been happening kind of more recently with our Media business slowing. So this is a pretty balanced approach we take to the business, focusing on managing costs in the network and focusing on managing and kind of prioritizing cost around OpEx as well.","Sameet Sinha - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Operator, this is Tom. We have time for two more questions.","Operator","Understood. Our next question will come from the line of Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Brandon Nispel - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey. Thanks for taking the questions. Two, if I could. I was wondering if you guys could give us a midyear update in terms of adjusted EBITDA margins within the Media, Web Performance and Security categories. And then, just looking at the growth rates coming back to a little bit higher this quarter in the Media side, is your expectation still to achieve double-digit growth in 2018? Thanks.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. The first one is, we provide an annual update on EBITDA margins. Again, we don't manage the company that way. That is just a \u2013 we do an annual exercise to go through allocating the company's costs into the various businesses. And so, a Media update would kind of be not appropriate. I'll certainly provide an update on the margin profile of our businesses, and probably more notably even our divisions at the upcoming Investor Summit that we'll do in Q1. But I think it's fair to say, call it, in aggregate without even having even done the model that some of what you're seeing is probably a modest compression in the EBITDA margins for Media and probably stable margins within the Performance and Security business.","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","And with the growth rates, we are looking to get to double-digit growth rates for the company by the end of 2018. We believe that we can do that and looking forward to that next year.","Brandon Nispel - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And just one quick one to follow-up, the compression in the Media and some outperformance in the Web Performance, is that relative to the margins you laid out in your Investor Day presentation?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. And again, as I said that we'll update them again in Q1, because we don't do it and we don't manage the business that way. I've just given you some general qualitative color. But, yes, it would be compared to what I shared in Q1.","Brandon Nispel - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question will come from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company. Please proceed.","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for fitting me in. As it relates to video, which you've stated is obviously a driver of traffic, I was wondering if you could tease that out a little further to try and get a sense of where that's coming from. Maybe (01:09:36) to bucket it as either social media, or broadcasters, or those providing subscription, OTT players, or maybe there's a different way that you would think about it. Just trying to get a better sense of where that's actually happening or where that happened in the third quarter.","And then, secondly, I think last quarter you mentioned that obviously you're focusing on the top 250 media customers. But by definition, you're also de-emphasizing those below that. I was wondering if there was any work done with that already and if that's leading to any type of margin improvement that might be happening with the company as well?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. On the last question, you want to think about it as reallocation of resources which we've done a bunch of and in the process of doing to get greater focus and more return for the investment. As Jim talked about, we are very serious with how we invest every dollar.","In terms of the video traffic growth, we saw strong traffic growth really across the board, but I think you want to think of it as more broadcaster OTT high-quality video than social. And I think in the long run, OTT will \u2013 the big bits will be driven by the broadcaster, the high-quality long-form content.","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks.","Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Thank you. In closing, we'll be presenting at a number of investor events throughout the rest of this quarter.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following management\u2019s prepared remarks, we will host a question-and-answer session, and our instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","Now, it\u2019s my pleasure to hand the conference over to Mr. Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Tom Barth","Thank you very, Brian. Good afternoon, and thank everyone for joining Akamai\u2019s second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Benson, Akamai\u2019s Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.","Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai\u2019s filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company\u2019s view on July 25, 2017. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statement reflect future events or circumstances.","As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today\u2019s call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of our website. Also, please note that all growth rates references will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted.","With that, let me turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Leighton","Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. Akamai delivered solid overall results in the second quarter. Revenue in Q2 was $609 million, up 7% over Q2 of last year in constant currency and at the high end of our guidance range.","Non-GAAP EPS for the second quarter was $0.62 per diluted share, $0.01 above the high end of our guidance range and up 4% over Q2 of last year when adjusted for foreign exchange and the dilution associated with the recent SOASTA acquisition.","The second quarter featured continued strong growth from our Web Division customers, who contributed $315 million in revenue, up 16% over Q2 of last year in constant currency.","It\u2019s worth noting that Q2 was the first quarter where our Web Division customers accounted for the majority of our revenue. This milestone reflects the success we\u2019ve had in diversifying and growing Akamai, both in terms of new product lines and in terms of the kinds of customers who buy our products.","Over the past several years, we\u2019ve grown well beyond our origins as a pure-play content delivery network into the world's largest and most trusted cloud delivery platform.","We\u2019ve broadened our product portfolio to include application acceleration in cloud security services, and we substantially broadened our customer base beyond media companies to include many of the world's largest financial institutions, retailers, airlines and auto manufacturers.","Innovation has been a cornerstone of our success in developing new product lines, especially in the area of cyber security. Our cloud security business delivered $115 million of revenue in the second quarter, up 34% over Q2 of last year in constant currency.","Looking forward, we believe that we can continue to grow this industry-leading business at a rapid pace, with annual revenue expected to exceed $1 billion within the next four to five years. This belief is fueled in part by the opportunity we see for further penetration of our Kona Site Defender, Prolexic, Bot Manager and Web Application Protector product lines.","The latest version of Kona Site Defender protects API endpoints for customers, such as leading footwear retailer, DSW, to help secure their websites, mobile infrastructure and other API-driven requests.","Our most recent Bot Manager product, Bot Manager Premier, was released earlier this month after a very successful beta with customers such as Hyatt Hotels. Bot Manager Premier features the machine learning technology that we acquired from Cyberfend that is designed to sort even the most sophisticated account takeover attacks.","Of course, scale has become even more critical for cyber defense, as typical attacks now contain tens or hundreds of gigabits per second of malicious traffic, more than enough to overwhelm the traditional defenses of even the most well-equipped data centers.","This is another area where Akamai Solutions are differentiated in the market due to the enormous capacity contained in the Akamai platform, which can be leveraged by all our security solutions.","We\u2019ve also been seeing good traction with our latest web performance products, Ion 3.0 and Image Manager, both of which can greatly enhance the user experience, especially on mobile devices.","Mobile applications have become an important area of focus for our customers like the Telegraph Media Group in the U.K., Billabong Sports Retailer and Six Flags Amusement Parks, due to the widespread use of mobile devices and the challenges that can arise with performance and this is an area where we believe Akamai\u2019s superior capabilities can make a big difference.","In addition, Ion is now complemented with two new products that we obtained as part of the SOASTA acquisition; mPulse, and CloudTest. These highly differentiated solutions are designed to help customers, such as Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods and Churchill Downs, measure, validate and improve the business impact of their websites and applications.","Overall, we\u2019re very pleased with the performance of our Web Division. Looking forward, we believe that we can maintain a mid-teens annual revenue growth rate from this customer base, with the potential for acceleration over the longer term as our new enterprise products gain traction in the market.","As all of you know, enterprises are rapidly moving their applications to the cloud, and this is leading to changes in a way that IT managers architect their networks and manage their security.","Traditional devices located in enterprise data centers are being replaced with cloud services, and we believe this shift creates a substantial opportunity for Akamai to do for the enterprise what we\u2019ve done for the Internet, namely, to make application access faster, more reliable and more secure.","Each of our new enterprise products addresses a fundamental need arising as part of the transformation of IT that\u2019s occurring within enterprises today. Enterprise Application Access addresses the growing need for businesses to more easily and securely manage application access for a growing mix of users with different risk profiles and without poking holes on the enterprise firewall.","Thus far, adoption of our Enterprise Application Access solution has tracked along the same growth trajectory that we achieved for Kona Site Defender in its first year. This is an encouraging sign that our emerging enterprise business can become as successful as our web security business.","Following a very successful beta, we launched Enterprise Threat Protector in late Q2. Enterprise Threat Protector is designed to protect enterprise employees and infrastructure against phishing, malware and data exfiltration attacks by providing a cloud-based recursive DNS service to block access to malware sites and data exfiltration botnets.","Enterprise Threat Protector leverages the massive amount of security data that Akamai collects every minute to provide customers like Norwegian Cruise Lines with a layer of intelligent security across all their offices and cruise ships around the world. As a result, Akamai is now protecting, not only the company, but also their employees and passengers from complex targeted attacks.","I\u2019d now like to shift gears and talk about our media business. Our Media Division customers accounted for $276 million of revenue in Q2, down 1% year-over-year in constant currency. As has been the case in recent quarters, the performance of our Media Division was impacted by the six large Internet platform customers. These customers contributed $51 million to our revenue in the quarter, down 17% over Q2 of last year. In Q2, they accounted for 19% of our Media Division revenue and 8% of Akamai\u2019s overall revenue.","More generally, and as we signaled in our last quarterly call, the traffic from our media customers overall has not grown as fast as we had expected for the year. To be clear, the traffic from our media customers has been growing. In fact, if you pull out the contribution from the six large Internet platform companies, the year-over-year traffic growth rate for our media customers has been well above the 24% growth rate that Cisco reports for the Internet overall.","The issue is that our current traffic growth rate is lower than it\u2019s been historically and lower than we\u2019ve been expecting. And this impacts the revenue that we receive from media customers for our media products as well as our web performance solutions.","This leads to two important questions; what steps are we taking to improve the media business in the near term? And how do we think the media business will perform over the longer term? I\u2019d like to start talking -- by talking about the longer-term prospects for the media business.","As we look to the future, we continue to believe that there is significant upside potential for the media business from the increasing consumption of video online. Already, video accounts for the majority of the traffic on the Akamai platform. And our video traffic has been growing at a substantial rate, faster than the growth rates that Cisco reports for Internet video overall. TGG Research has predicted that over-the-top viewing will exceed traditional broadcast viewing within four years.","Even if this prediction is only approximately correct, there is the potential for a very large amount of video traffic to move online, and we believe that Akamai is very well positioned to benefit as a result. That\u2019s because Akamai is widely regarded as the go-to provider when it comes to delivering high-quality video at scale online.","We believe that we have an unmatched ability to help our customers offer their viewers the highest-quality viewing experience no matter what device they are using, no matter where they\u2019re located around in the world and no matter how they\u2019re connected to the Internet.","Our video support services are another differentiator for Akamai, especially when it comes to live and linear delivery. All this means that media is an important business for Akamai, one that we believe will contribute significant revenue and profit growth in the future, even as we expect the media business to comprise a smaller share of our overall business as we continue to diversify and grow our web and enterprise businesses.","Of course, we are very aware of the impact that media customers are currently having on our overall financial results, and I want you to know that we are taking several steps that are intended to improve the media business in the near term, both in terms of accelerating revenue growth and in terms of decreasing cost.","First, the media business is now managed by Adam Karon, who has had a long track record of success and operational excellence in growing Akamai\u2019s services business while also tightly managing cost.","Adam took on a leadership \u2013 took on the leadership of our media business in March, and he\u2019s implementing aggressive plans with the goal of increasing our traffic share through a heightened focus of providing the best possible service to the top 250 global media companies.","These companies account for the vast majority of the traffic on our platform. Some of them also make use of other vendors to deliver a portion of their content, and this provides an opportunity for Akamai.","While our share of their business is substantial today, we believe that we can do even better by providing focused support for each customer\u2019s individual needs. In some cases, this means customized integration of unique Akamai capabilities such as accelerated NGS, broadcast operations support, low latency streaming technology and Akamai client software.","In other cases, it means differentiated pricing to better conform to customer needs for background downloads, peer-assisted delivery and subscriber-based pricing. And in still other cases, it means leveraging our deep carrier relationships to provide regional pricing and dedicated managed CDN services.","Of course, we\u2019ve always worked hard to reduce our costs in the media business, and under Adam\u2019s leadership, there is a renewed focus and sense of urgency to further drive costs down, with an emphasis on the large operational and CapEx costs associated with delivering very large volumes of traffic.","Lowering our cost structure will help improve our profitability while also allowing us to pass on some of the savings to our customers so that our services will be even more attractive in the marketplace.","It\u2019s important to note that the media business is a cash generator for Akamai today and that it helps to pay for much of the infrastructure that we use to defend the world\u2019s leading enterprises from large-scale cyber attacks. Through the steps we\u2019re taking, we believe that we can further increase the cash flow from this business while also positioning ourselves for the future upside from over-the-top video.","As we work to improve the media business, I want you to know that we intend to manage costs in a way that will keep overall company EBITDA margins in the mid to high 30s. We believe that we can do this while still making the investments needed to fuel the growth of our new enterprise business and our highly profitable web business.","In summary, I believe that Akamai is very well positioned for future growth, thanks to our world-class and highly innovative technology, our broadening portfolio of services, our diversifying base of customers and our highly talented employees. These are some of the reasons why I remain so confident in Akamai\u2019s future and also why I\u2019m continuing my personal share repurchase program through the rest of the year.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jim to go over the financials in detail, and then we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. Jim?","Jim Benson","Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As Tom highlighted, Akamai delivered a solid Q2, with revenue coming in at the high end of our guidance range and earnings slightly above the high end of our expectations.","Revenue in the second quarter was $609 million, up 6% year-over-year, or up 7% in constant currency, and up 10% constant currency, if you exclude our six large Internet platform customers. Before I dive into the revenue details, please note that all revenue growth rate references will be in constant currency.","Looking first to the Q2 revenue results by our customer division lens. Revenue from our Web Division customers was $315 million up 16% year-over-year. We continue to see solid growth and diversification into this customer base, particularly with our cloud security offerings, with over half of Akamai\u2019s second quarter revenue now coming from our Web Division customers.","Revenue from our Media Division customers was $276 million in the quarter down 1% year-over-year and up 3% excluding the impact of the large platform customers. As we had projected in our last call, media growth rates are lower than the past several quarters driven primarily from a continued moderation in traffic growth across our media delivery and lower end web Performance Solutions.","As Tom outlined we are working diligently to improve the media business. We are confident that our action plan to aggressively increase traffic share could improve our traffic and revenue growth trajectory.","We are beginning to see early signs of traction, but it will take a few quarters to realize the full benefits of our actions. Finally, revenue from our Enterprise and Carrier Division customers was $18 million in the quarter, up 10% year-over-year.","Turning now to our Q2 results for our solution categories, revenue from our Performance and Security Solutions remains strong coming in at $376 million growing 16% year-over-year and contributing 62% of total revenues in Q2.","We continue to see very strong growth for these products from our Web Division customer base, although we saw a down tick in revenue from our traffic related web Performance Solutions sold to our Media Division customers.","Within our Performance and Security solution category, we saw particularly strong growth continuing in our Cloud Security Solutions. Second quarter revenue for our Cloud Security Solutions was $115 million up 34% year-over-year led by our flagship Kona Site Defender and Prolexic offerings and our continued portfolio expansion into new areas like bot Management. Our Cloud Security business is now nearing an annualized revenue run rate of a $0.5 billion.","Our Media Delivery Solutions revenue was $179 million in the quarter down 9% year-over-year and down 4% excluding our large Internet Platform Customers. As I just mentioned, this revenue moderation was due to further traffic growth deceleration in our Media Division customer base most notably in our Americas theatre. Finally, revenue from our services and support solutions was $54 million in the quarter up 13% year-over-year.","Moving on to our geographies. Sales in our international Markets represented 34% of total revenue in Q2 up one point from Q1 levels. International market revenue was $206 million in the second quarter up 19% in constant currency driven by strong growth in our Asia Pacific theatre.","Foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact on revenue of $5 million on a year-over-year basis and a positive impact on revenue of $4 million on a sequential basis. Revenue from our U.S. market was $403 million up 2% year-over-year and up 5% excluding our large Internet Platform Customers.","Moving on to costs. Cash gross margin was 76% down one point from Q1 levels and the same period last year and in line with our guidance. GAAP gross margin which includes depreciation and stock based compensation was 65% down one point from Q1 levels and up one point from the same period last year.","GAAP operating expenses were $307 million in the second quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock based compensation, acquisition-related charges and other non-recurring items.","Excluding these charges, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $239 million up $11 million from Q1 levels and in line with our guidance. The sequential expense increase was heavily impacted by the absorption of the SOASTA acquisition.","Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $224 million, down $17 million from Q1 levels. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 37%, down two points from Q1 levels, down three points from Q2 last year and in line with our guidance. Approximately 1.5 points of the EBITDA margin reduction is driven by the impact of the SOASTA acquisition.","GAAP depreciation and amortization expenses were $89 million in the second quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation associated with stock based compensation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of capitalized interest expense.","Excluding these charges, non-GAAP depreciation was $77 million, up $2 million from Q1 levels and in line with our guidance. Non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter was $147 million, down $19 million from Q1 levels and down $10 million from the same period last year driven by the areas I outlined earlier.","Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 24%, down three points from Q1 levels and from the same period last year and in line with our guidance.","Moving on to other income and expense items. Interest income for the second quarter was $4 million, down slightly from Q1 levels. Non-cash interest expense related to our convertible debt was roughly $5 million. As a reminder, this non-cash expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results.","Moving on to earnings. GAAP net income for the second quarter was $58 million or $0.33 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $108 million or $0.62 of earnings per diluted share and slightly above the high-end of our guidance driven by the strong revenue achievement.","For the quarter, total taxes included in our GAAP earnings were $30 million based on an effective tax rate of 34%, up from 29% in Q1 due primarily to the accounting for the SOASTA acquisition. Taxes included in or non-GAAP earnings were $44 million based on an effective tax rate of 29% consistent with Q1 levels and in line with guidance.","Finally, our weighted average diluted share count for the second quarter was 173 million shares, down 2 million shares from Q1 levels and down 3 million shares from Q2 of last year driven by increased share buyback activity.","Now I\u2019ll review some balance sheet items. Day sales outstanding for the second quarter was 60 days, up two days from Q1 levels and from the same period last year. Capital expenditures in Q2 excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense were $105 million and slightly below the low-end of our guidance for the quarter, primarily due to the timing of some planned network investments and IT projects that shifted into Q3.","Cash flow generation continued to be solid with cash from operations of $225 million in the second quarter. Our Balance Sheet also remains very strong with roughly $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on-hand at the end of the quarter. If you factor in our convertible debt, our net cash is approximately $725 million.","During the quarter, we spent $105 million on share repurchases buying back roughly 2 million shares. As we\u2019ve discussed in the past, we believe the strength of our balance sheet and cash position is an important competitive differentiator that provides us with the financial flexibility to make key investments at opportune times including the share repurchase program.","In summary, our Q2 top and bottom line results met or exceeded the high end of our guidance. We continue to see a robust pipeline of innovation and strong revenue growth in our web and enterprise divisions and have put in place plants we believe will improve the performance of our media business.","Looking ahead to the third quarter and as signaled in our last call, we expect Media Division revenue to continue to moderate from Q2 levels. In addition, this is a particularly difficult compare period, given last year\u2019s Olympics and various selection coverage events.","We are confident that our action plan to aggressively increase traffic share can improve our traffic and revenue growth trajectory. We\u2019re beginning to see early signs of traction, but it will likely take a few quarters to realize the full benefits of our actions.","Overall, we are expecting Q3 revenue in the range of $604 million to $616 million. At the high end of this range, year-over-year growth would be 6% in constant currency. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a positive impact on Q3 revenue of $3 million compared to Q2 and a negative impact of $1 million compared to Q3 of last year. At these revenue ranges, we expect GAAP gross margins of 64% and cash gross margins of 76%.","Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $241 million to $246 million, up roughly $5 million sequentially at the midpoint, driven by targeted investments in our web and enterprise divisions. Factoring in the cash gross margin and operating expense expectations I just provided, we anticipate EBITDA margins of roughly 36%.","While we are not providing specific guidance beyond Q3 during this call, we believe continued targeted investment in select areas is the right decision for the medium and long-term growth prospects for the company while we work through our media action plan.","In the near term, we intend to operate the company and the mid-30s EBITDA. As we work to improve our media performance and deliver continued strong growth from our Web Division customers, we would expect to see EBITDA margins return to the high 30s. And we remain committed to balancing both top line and bottom line growth over the longer term.","Moving now to depreciation. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be $80 million to $82 million. Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 22% to 23% for Q3. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q3 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.57 to $0.60. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $40 million to $41 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of 29%. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of 172 million shares.","On CapEx, we expect to spend $110 million to $120 million, excluding equity compensation. This amount is an uptick from second quarter levels, primarily due to the timing of planned network and IT investments that shifted from Q2 into Q3 as well as some additional infrastructure investments for our Security Solutions.","In closing, we remain confident in our ability to accelerate growth rates for the business, execute on our continued product and customer diversification strategy and delivering a compelling financial model for our shareholders.","Thank you, and Tom and I would now like to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Mark Mahaney","Thanks. Just a little more color please on the traffic slowdown. I know you called out the Americas as a region where you had that traffic slowdown. I think last quarter, I think you also called out verticals and you talked about the gaming vertical.","Could you spend a little bit more time on which industry verticals were behind that, that you\u2019re seeing are behind that traffic slowdown? Thank you.","Tom Leighton","Yeah, sure. As we talked about the deceleration in traffic and remember traffic is still growing, the deceleration is primarily due to the six large internet platform companies that we\u2019ve talked about and as we talked about on the last call, there was some share loss and some large gaming customers in the Americas and that is exactly what happened I would say in Q2.","Beyond that, we don\u2019t see any evidence of major share loss. In fact, there\u2019s a lot of accounts where we\u2019ve increased share and our traffic is growing. If you take out the six large platform companies, it\u2019s actually growing faster than the published results for the internet as a whole.","So, it\u2019s just the issue is it\u2019s not growing as fast as we\u2019d expected and it\u2019s not growing as fast as the historical trends and so that\u2019s why we\u2019re putting in place some pretty significant steps to increase traffic share and get revenue growing and at a stronger pace including the six largest internet companies.","Mark Mahaney","Thank you, Tom.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.","Mike Olson","Hey, good afternoon. You mentioned that as you drive costs lower in media delivery; you can potentially offer lower pricing to those customers. Is that a big part of the strategy going forward to reduce the gap in pricing between you and your competitors for media delivery? Thanks.","Tom Leighton","It\u2019s not a big part I would say, but it is a part. We want to be sure we\u2019re offering competitive pricing. When I talked about several of the steps that we\u2019re taking, a lot of it is around providing the very best service and really customized service to the world\u2019s largest media companies and we\u2019re focused on the top 250 and we\u2019ve got a lot of unique capabilities that I mentioned earlier that we are going to be helping those customers integrate into their platforms.","And I think we've much greater focus with those accounts providing exactly the services they need and in some cases, it will involve differentiated pricing if they\u2019re doing a background download or they\u2019re working in a particular geography or if they\u2019re using our client-assisted delivery software that the pricing can be more tailored for them.","But pricing is I think a component, and as you know pricing always decreases on an annual basis and we are seeing and as far as we know we\u2019ll continue to see price decreases within historical norms. So, I would say it\u2019s mostly a focus on providing better and differentiated services with a lot more focus and energy there on the top 250 global media companies.","Mike Olson","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Matthew Heinz with Stifel. Please proceed.","Matthew Heinz","Hi, thanks good afternoon. If I could just go kind of in more detail on your commentary around traffic, it seems as if your traffic is still growing faster than market, but I think the comment was not as fast as we\u2019d like.","I\u2019m just trying to square up. Have you lost share, where would you say your share stacks up versus maybe a year or two ago and is the issue more broadly defined in terms of the traffic slowdown and if so, I guess how do you think, why do you think your initiatives will be successful in kind of clawing that back?","Tom Leighton","Sure. As we\u2019ve talked about, we\u2019ve lost significant share in the big six internet platform companies due to their do-it-yourself efforts and we\u2019ve talked about that a lot that they drive a lot of traffic on the internet.","And just to be clear, even counting that, we\u2019re still growing traffic on the Akamai platform at a good clip. And in fact, if you take out those big six, it\u2019s growing faster than the internet as a whole.","In terms of share and as we talked about, we did lose some share in a few large primarily American gaming companies. We\u2019re actually working hard at getting that share back and I\u2019m optimistic about that.","Otherwise I don\u2019t see any share loss compared to say last year and in fact, our goal and we\u2019re working hard to do this is to increase share and as I talked about, I think we see strong potential to do that.","As Jim mentioned, already the steps we\u2019re taking we\u2019re beginning to see some acceleration in traffic and increase in share. It\u2019s very early and as Jim mentioned, I think you really want to be thinking about a few quarters to see the full benefit from the action we\u2019re taking, and it really is centered around greater focus and energy and customization of what we do for the world\u2019s largest media companies.","And as you might imagine, aside from having a lot of traffic and a lot of end-users they have special needs and we\u2019re in a great position I think to satisfy those needs with the right packaging of capabilities for them.","And we believe that by doing that we can increase our share, which is already large in the world\u2019s largest media companies. We can increase it and drive revenue growth going forward.","Matthew Heinz","Okay, thanks. And then as a follow-up just on the enterprise initiatives, enterprise networking initiatives specifically, I think you made mention that you expect that business to track similarly to how the Cloud Security business kind of ramps in the early days.","Can you just provide a little bit more insight around kind of where you are in those conversations, how your Cloud Security products are enhancing your conversations with customers and if there\u2019s sort of synergy there, and how quickly we can expect a meaningful revenue contribution from that business?","Tom Leighton","Sure. The buyer of our Enterprise security products is not the same person as the buyer of our web security products, but they do track up to the same CSO and CIO, and our reputation as now the world\u2019s largest pure play web security provider really is very helpful in our customer base and is I think really going to help us jump start our Enterprise security business and the products there today are Enterprise application access and Enterprise Threat Protector.","Now, as we look over the long-term, we believe that the market for the Enterprise products is in the long run larger than the web security products and our goal is to grow that business on the same trajectory that we grew the web security business and in the first year, that\u2019s been the case.","If we look at our -- the Enterprise Application Access product that we launched through an acquisition late last year, it\u2019s tracking ahead of the first year of where we were with Kona Site Defender, which was our flagship product to get the web security business going.","And in terms of the question about when can we see meaningful results, we\u2019re optimistic that we can start seeing results that will make a difference, and then we maybe starting to talk about in terms of the dollar volumes for enterprise security towards the end of next year. And if we stay on the same track we\u2019re on now, that would \u2013 that should be possible, it should make a difference in our results towards the end of 2018.","Matthew Heinz","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Michael Hart with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed.","Michael Hart","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. The first question I had, I\u2019m trying to piece together the commentary around the pricing actions you\u2019re taking in the Media Division and the efforts around increasing customization as well as your comments about the long-term margin.","And I just was wondering if you can offer some color on what you think the long-term impact to margins will be from increasing customization for these customers in the context of also taking actions to maybe provide differentiated pricing to these customers?","Tom Leighton","Yeah. I think, in the long run, not only does it grow revenue, it also improves margins. Growing traffic is generally a good thing. And it\u2019s not just about pricing. We\u2019re driving a lot of our costs out of the delivery, and that improves our margins.","It does enable us to pass through some of the savings to customers, which we always do, and that keeps our products competitive in the marketplace and not just an issue of competition, but as you look at OTT, which we look as driving a lot of the future growth for the media business, the cost is an important component for our media customers.","The broadcasters come from a world of satellite delivery, and in the satellite world, every additional subscriber is free.","Now in the Internet, that\u2019s not true. And so, we have to do work to decrease costs to help enable the increasing growth in OTT. Now in terms of what we\u2019re doing with the largest customers, as I mentioned, we\u2019re working hard to take unique Akamai capabilities and integrate them better into our largest customers platforms, things like accelerated NGS, broadcast operations support, low-latency streaming technology, Akamai client software.","And these are all things that improve the end user experience, several that do lower costs for everybody for the ecosystem, so that\u2019s a good thing. And there is \u2013 for some of our customers, they need differentiated pricing models to make it work for their businesses.","For example, subscriber-based pricing, peer-assisted delivery, folks with background software downloads. In that case, our cost is lower. It makes sense to be able to pass that on to the customer. And in some cases, customers need us to be leveraging our deep carrier relationships in countries around the world.","And they need regional pricing, and they need things like dedicated managed CDN services. These are all capabilities Akamai has and, generally, uniquely capable of providing. And they\u2019re going to see and you\u2019re going to see a lot more focused support for the largest customers, and we\u2019re really putting our effort there.","And we think, by doing that, we can increase \u2013 we have a large share today. We can increase it substantially. That\u2019ll improve revenue. It will improve our margins and be good for the business.","Michael Hart","Okay. Thanks. And then one quick follow-up, the SOASTA acquisition, Jim I appreciated the commentary about some of the impacts to the financials, but one thing which I think I missed was did you offer some color on what the topline contributions for SOASTA was in 2Q and also what you\u2019re expecting for 3Q and maybe when you think SOASTA could be accretive to the EPS line?","Tom Leighton","Sure. I spoke about that beginning of the investor summit and a little bit on the last call that because of the deferred revenue impact in purchase accounting, there was a few million dollars for SOASTA revenue in our Q2 results and we\u2019re managing that business as part of our web performance business unit and that\u2019s where it resides.","We aren\u2019t going to guide to it specifically each quarter, but what I said during the investor summit is that that business kind of on an annual basis, once we work through the purchase accounting impact of deferred revenue, could be roughly a $30 million business, so that\u2019s the rough profile of what you should be looking for going into 2018.","Michael Hart","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Sameet Sinha with B. Riley. Please proceed.","Sameet Sinha","Thank you very much. I wanted to actually dive a little deeper into the performance unit. Can you talk about kind of the trends in the marketplace there? And of course, you made the acquisition of SOASTA.","Can you talk about where is the demand, is it coming from mobile, is it coming from -- just kind of use cases there and the competitive environment and then I have a follow-up question?","Tom Leighton","Yeah, no I think you nailed it. The biggest trend in performance is around mobile performance where the conditions can be particularly challenging for a good end-user experience. That\u2019s what our Ion 3 is all about. Image Manager makes a huge difference for mobile performance. We\u2019re seeing great traction with that new product.","And of course, the SOASTA acquisition with mPulse and CloudTest are all about measuring performance, helping our customers optimize it in a way that maximizes their business, and I would say mobile is front and center there.","Of course, security, also very important for those customers and that\u2019s partly why you see our security business growing so rapidly as really the industry leader and the only company capable of providing the kind of security that major Enterprises need online today.","Sameet Sinha","The follow-up question, I wanted to speak about the margin guidance. I mean you had opportunities to bring that down in the last couple of quarters and now it\u2019s taken another step down.","Can you talk about the rationale that you did mention continued investments so if you can delve into specifically where you\u2019re investing in? What product lines that will kind of give us a sense of where we can expect leverage? Thank you.","Tom Leighton","So obviously, we talked about the media business and when the traffic has been less than we\u2019d expected and therefore the revenue less than we\u2019d expected. That put pressure on our margins in the near-term and as you know, we\u2019ve just talked about we have an active plan to improve the performance there.","When you look at our Web Division there and you see very high margins, you see excellent growth rates; I think it\u2019s really important that we continue the investments there to fuel the growth of that business.","If you look at our Enterprise business which is very early days, we now have two products in the market off to excellent start, and we think that has an even better longer-term potential for growth. And so, the last thing we want to do is do anything to interrupt the great performance and growth that we\u2019re seeing there.","So, we are incurring lower EBITDA margins in the near term as we work through and improve the media business. And as we talk about, as we do that, and as we continue to drive very strong growth for our highly profitable web business, and as the enterprise business starts to make a difference in our numbers next year, we do expect to see margin improvement.","Sameet Sinha","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Vijay Bhagavath","Yeah. Thanks. Yeah, hi, Jim, Tom.","Tom Leighton","Hi.","Vijay Bhagavath","So, my question is really on the new enterprise opportunities you guys are pursuing. Help us understand the magnitude of the opportunity next year. And when should we start kind of baking it into the model?","Would it be as early as the fourth quarter of this year? Would it be front half of next year? And roughly, what are the components of the enterprise opportunity? Would it primarily be this behind the firewall security opportunities? Also, some, like, corporate video offload?","So, anything and everything you could help us with this new enterprise opportunity would be very helpful. Thanks.","Tom Leighton","Yes, I think it\u2019s everything you mentioned and more. For example, Enterprise Application Access is all about authenticating in a much safer and less expensive way, enterprise employees to get access to enterprise apps. In the past, this was all behind the firewall. And of course, as you know, Enterprise Networks are turning inside out.","As cloud -- as enterprise applications move to the cloud, as you need to give access to contractors and third parties and enterprise employees on the move, you need to give them access to those applications. You need to be able to do that, and the traditional approach just isn\u2019t effective anymore.","In fact, access that wasn\u2019t intended is the number one cause of data breaches today. And this is an area where you need new ways of doing it, and that\u2019s exactly what Enterprise Application Access does. And that product is now tracking faster in terms of adoption in revenue than our Kona Site Defender product.","If you look at Enterprise Threat Protector, which just came out of a very successful beta trial, that\u2019s all about stopping malware, blocking phishing attempts and stopping data exfiltration, which is probably the biggest threat and the biggest expense for enterprises. When they get hacked and they lose their internal data, it\u2019s pretty disastrous.","And just in the beta trial alone, we found examples with major enterprises, where we did exactly that. We caught, through this product, data exfiltration happening from, in one case, an air-conditioning unit, that nobody was really thinking that it\u2019s connected. It has a CPU and a full communication stack. Lo and behold, it was infected, collecting the corporate data and exfiltrating it.","So, I think the eventual market for these products is very large. You look at the traditional enterprise security market, and traditionally, that was done on your private network, buying devices, that\u2019s a much larger market than web security. And that market is getting turned inside out along with the enterprise network.","And those are going to be services that will have to be purchased in the cloud. And we\u2019re in a great position to offer those services. It\u2019s new technology. So, it really is different.","It\u2019s not just taking your box and putting it out there in the Internet. That\u2019s not good work that way. These are going to work that way. These are going to be platform cloud services, and Akamai has a lot of experience doing that.","Vijay Bhagavath","Thanks. Very helpful. A quick follow-on for Jim. Price competition is a strategy, would that be kind of near term onetime? Or would it be structural in terms of looking to get back some large business in gaming or in software or even in over-the-top video? Thanks.","Jim Benson","Well, I think Tom covered that pretty well, as outlined. The plans that we\u2019re going through to increase traffic share in the accounts, I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s much more to comment on.","Tom Leighton","Yeah, it\u2019s not a pricing strategy. Obviously, pricing drops every year, it has for 20 years. And it\u2019s dropping within historical norms. I don\u2019t see anything that\u2019s going to change that.","Now getting the right pricing model and how the services are packaged which can vary for each major customer that certainly, we\u2019re working on with the major broadcasters and video customers.","Vijay Bhagavath","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Sterling Auty","Yeah. Thanks. Sorry for the background noise. But you mentioned this customized solutions for the large media customers. Will that actually take extra investment to customize and for each customer? Or is there a way to make that efficient?","Tom Leighton","Yeah. What we\u2019re doing is reallocating investment within the Media Division to weight much more heavily in the top 250 customers and for smaller companies to handle those in more efficient ways. So, this is not a net increase in investment. In fact, Adam is working very hard to lower the costs in our Media Division.","Sterling Auty","And that\u2019s the perfect segue. I guess I don\u2019t understand what types of products you would be able to take out on \u2013 to lower the overall cost of products?","Tom Leighton","I didn\u2019t quite understand the question. Are you \u2013 so can you restate the question?","Sterling Auty","Yeah. So what types of cost, I think you mentioned using background delivery, but what specific costs can you actually take out of that media delivery business?","Tom Leighton","There\u2019s lots and we\u2019ve been working to reduce our costs for 20 years there. Every year, pricing comes down, and so does our internal cost. There is things all the way from better CPUs that we buy, better use of that through software improvements so per dollar of CPU, per dollar of Co-Lo, we deliver a lot more traffic.","There\u2019s better use of our infrastructure to optimize what each server is doing and when. When you do have opportunities like background downloads, we can schedule the delivery at times to non-peak times.","So, you\u2019re taking advantage of Co-Lo. And maybe if we\u2019ve acquired bandwidth as use it or lose it, we would then use that for the background downloads. So, the marginal costs would be vastly less for us, and we can pass some of that on to our customers. We can use peer-assisted delivery and are doing that in some cases.","Again, lowering the costs of the ecosystem. It lowers our costs dramatically, and we pass some of that on to our customers. Greater use -- bandwidth costs are different amount in the many hundreds of cities where we\u2019re located around the world, and better use of that can lower our costs.","So, there is a lot of things that we do and have been working on for a long time. We have a lot stronger focus and allocation of resources to that endeavor today.","And on the go-to-market side, there\u2019s better and more efficient use of our people in terms of interacting with our customers and as we talked about, be a lot greater focus of those resources on the largest media companies and there\u2019s relatively a small number.","It really is about 250 customers that comprise the majority of our traffic and very large majority of our revenue today, in media.","Sterling Auty","Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Please proceed.","Michael Turits","Hi guys, Michael Turits, thanks. I wanted to just make sure the two clarification EBITDA margin guide. I think when Tom finished his section he said mid to high 30s and then Jim, I think you said mid 30s.","So, I just want to make sure that\u2019s right so it\u2019s mid-30s I assume in the near-term which I would think as kind of a one-year timeframe. Is that how to think of it?","Tom Leighton","Yeah, I mean that\u2019s why -- I mean what Tom highlighted is we intend to offer the Company in mid to high 30s. So, we expect to get the model back to the high 30s as we\u2019re going through our media improvement plan as Tom outlined it and as I said it\u2019s going to take a few quarters to see the full benefit of those actions.","And so, what we\u2019ve said is in the near-term as we go through that, we\u2019re going to be operating a Company in the mid-30s to make the investment that we need to make in the Web Division, in the Enterprise division in the areas that Tom had outlined.","And so, the plan is to do both. Near-term mid-30s, once we start to see the media improvement plans take hold, which is in both on the revenue and the cost side, our expectation is you should then begin to see margin expansion.","Michael Turits","Okay and then there\u2019s been a lot of discussion on the call that you guys mentioned about the traffic slowdown, and caution around that and yet, you beat revenue this quarter.","You actually guided nicely above the street and it looks like revenue growth is stabilizing a bit instead of decelerating and I don\u2019t know if part of that is but I noticed the Internet Platform Customers are actually flat quarter-over-quarter.","So, what\u2019s despite these headwinds from traffic slowing, what\u2019s sustaining the level of growth right now? Is it that the IP guys are just not moving off quite as fast right now or what\u2019s holding you in there?","Tom Leighton","Well we do have a little bit of stabilization in the big six customers. We have a great security business which is really meaningful in terms of revenue and growing at a really good clip.","We have new product introductions and we\u2019re particularly excited about our Enterprise products and that as I mentioned should start to be noticeable towards the end of next year and those are all very helpful to growing our revenue.","The Web Division customer base growing at a very solid clip which we think we can maintain mid-teens there, and so really, the area where we\u2019ve got and we\u2019re planning to do better is around media, and that\u2019s growing share and providing a better service to the top media customers and that will help us grow revenue and I think with some of the technologies we talked about grow margin.","Michael Turits","Thanks, Jim and Tom and Tom I\u2019d love to drill down a little bit more in areas of security at some point, but obviously not on this call. Thanks very much.","Tom Leighton","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen & Company. Please proceed.","Colby Synesael","Great. Most of my questions have been answered but just to follow-up on Michael\u2019s question. Last quarter, I think the commentary was that margins could dip below 37% and now we\u2019re saying mid-30s.","And I\u2019m just curious is that a difference or are you just using different nomenclature to describe margins and if it is different and you are signaling this quarter versus last quarter some increased pressure, where exactly is that coming from?","I know we\u2019ve been talking about media, but is for example, gaming getting worse? Is there now a new sub-segment that\u2019s pushing on that? Is the security business even though it\u2019s growing very strongly, just not growing strong enough to make up for everything?","Just a little bit more specificity to understand what\u2019s changed and how that\u2019s impacting margins versus the comments you guys made last quarter would be helpful.","Tom Leighton","Yeah, I don\u2019t think anything is substantively changed, Colby. I think what we said last quarter was that we were seeing traffic moderation in the media business and we had even said that we thought it could persist into the back half, and we also said that at that time that we thought that the EBITDA margins would dip below 37. So, kind of mid-30s is we\u2019re not that precise, and we certainly guided to 36.","And I think what we\u2019re signaling now is consistent with what we said then. It\u2019s just a matter of I think we\u2019re trying to be very candid about working some very specific actions in the media business. We\u2019re starting to see some of those actions take hold, still early.","We think it\u2019s going to take a few quarters to see the full benefits of them and that really is the sole reason why you\u2019re seeing pressure on EBITDA margins, which is challenges in the Media Division customer base that we have our arms around and that we\u2019re working. And I think we\u2019ll be able to work through that in the next few quarters.","EBITDA margins in the mid-30s will allow us to make the investments we think we need to in critical areas of the business that will fuel growth for the Company longer term which are huge catalysts for growth of the company that we don\u2019t want to constrain right now.","And so, think of it as mid-30s for kind of the next several quarters. And once we start to see the media actions take hold, we expect that we should be able to see expansion from there.","Colby Synesael","And then just on the other question, Michael asked around the top six being flat quarter-over-quarter. Was that an anomaly, just something, guess more coincidental or would you expect that the worst of that reduction is behind you and that sub-segment of customers will may now grow effectively in line with the rest of the business?","Tom Leighton","Well, clearly the worst of it is behind us by the fact that only 8% of our revenue. And as you know, they were more than double that. Not so long ago. So, the worst is behind us. I think it would be prudent to plan that there could be some further erosion there.","That said, we\u2019re working very hard to grow with those customers. I do believe that it makes sense for them to grow their business with Akamai. I think we can do a better job at a lower price point.","And you know, in the past we have seen some of those folks that had DIY and they were taking share reverse course and then put more traffic on Akamai. It does take a little while for a particular DIY project to run its course, but at the end of the day I think we do offer a better service at a lower price point.","And so, we are working hard to grow that business. That said, I think given what we\u2019ve experienced in the last year, it is prudent to be planning for further declines, but certainly nothing like it just can\u2019t be, because it\u2019s only 8% now like what we\u2019ve seen over the past year or so.","Colby Synesael","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Rob Sanderson with MKM Partners. Please proceed.","Rob Sanderson","Yeah. Thanks for getting me in there, guys. So, on the media business you\u2019re talking about a greater traffic and top line deceleration than expected and obviously heading into a cycle of deleverage as that comps together.","So, what I want to revisit is what Jim said at Analyst day about the -- I think the comment was that media operated about 25% adjusted EBITDA in 2016 and still have a low 30s long-term target.","Can you give us some commentary around where you\u2019d expect this \u2013 the media business to perform from a margin perspective over the next few quarters and against that baseline? And then also, any reason to think the long-term target should also come down? Thank you.","Jim Benson","Yeah. Let me preface it with that, we\u2019re a one-segment company. So, we go through an exercise once a year to attempt to take the Akamai cost structure and cut it into our kind of three solution categories. But we actually don\u2019t manage the company internally that way.","And so that \u2013 those profiles are kind of our best effort as trying to allocate costs that way and to basically look at general profit models for those businesses to give investors a flavor of what\u2019s the general profile of our media business, our performance in security business and our services businesses and where we think we\u2019re trying to drive them to.","And nothing is going to change. I don\u2019t think the models that we\u2019ve outlined, as far as target models for those businesses, has changed in a material way. I do think it\u2019s fair to say that the EBITDA margin pressure that you\u2019ve seen for the company over the last few quarters is specifically driven by the media business.","So, the profile that we provided for 2016, if we were to go through that allocation exercise right now, you would see the EBITDA margins for that business have come down.","But as Tom said, it\u2019s still a free cash flow generating business. Margins are down from where they were in 2016. I think the actions that we\u2019re taking to reaccelerate growth to drive down costs should yield both revenue acceleration and margin expansion, but it\u2019s going to take time for these initiatives to take hold.","Tom Leighton","This is Tom, Brian. I think we\u2019re running a bit over. So why don\u2019t we take one more question.","Operator","Yes, sir. Our last question for today will come from the line of Will Power with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.","Will Power","Oh, great. Okay. Yeah. Thanks for sticking me in. Tom, just kind of stepping back, I was interested in some of the long-term media commentary and optimism I think video is one of the key. I think you also said that video was already a majority of revenue.","So how do investors get confidence that this video growth is really going to help you we accelerate revenue relative to what you\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years? Any further color there with respect to just traffic trend, pricing, et cetera would be helpful?","Tom Leighton","Sure. Video today is now the majority of our traffic. And that said, we still have a substantial portion of traffic. We have other media customers, software downloads, gaming, some social networking and so video is not yet all of it. Video is growing at a good clip.","And I think as you look at the estimates and the modeling that people are doing about the rate at which TV and typical delivery of video moves online, that leads to a very good place for Akamai. And I think it depends now, who will be delivering that.","But I think by the models that you look at, a lot of that is ideally suited for Akamai. We do a lot of the delivery for the world\u2019s major broadcasters and also a lot of the world\u2019s major aggregators of video.","So, I think it\u2019s not \u2013 you can\u2019t say the next year everybody is going to be watching their video online, but it\u2019s certainly growing. The industry is certainly planning in the long term to have the majority of the video be watched over IP. And that is an excellent outcome for Akamai.","And it will probably take us some time to get there, but already it\u2019s a majority of traffic. It is growing at a good clip and it\u2019s growing faster for Akamai than it is for the industry as a whole or the internet as a whole on video.","Will Power","Okay. Thank you.","Tom Barth","Thank you, Will, Tom. Again, I want to thank everyone for joining us on this call this evening. In closing, we\u2019ll be presenting at a number of investor events throughout August and September and details of these can be found in the Investor Relations section of akamai.com and I want to thank you and again for joining us and have a nice evening. Brian back to you, please.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. And you may all disconnect.

My name is Derrick and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Tom Barth","Thank you, Derrick, and good afternoon, and thank you for joining Akamai's Fourth Quarter and Year-end 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Benson, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance and the expected closing of our acquisition of Prolexic Technologies. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.","Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on February 5, 2014. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances.","As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of our website.","With that, let me turn the call over to Tom.","F. Thomson Leighton","Thanks, Tom, and thank you, all, for joining us today. Q4 was an excellent quarter for Akamai. We generated record revenues and earnings, with both exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Q4 revenue was $436 million, up 15% year-over-year and up 21% when adjusted for the ADS divestment and foreign exchange headwinds. Revenue exceeded our expectations in every solution category and in every geography.","Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $100 million or $0.55 per diluted share. Our strong results in the quarter capped off a very solid year for Akamai. For the full year, we grew revenue to nearly $1.6 billion, up 20% over 2012 when adjusted for the ADS divestment and foreign exchange headwinds.","We generated non-GAAP net income of $367 million or $2.02 per diluted share, up 26% over 2012 and up 15% when adjusted for the change in depreciation methodology that we introduced at the start of the year. And we continue to have strong cash flow generation, with $564 million in cash from operations during 2013. I'll be back in a few minutes to talk more about the progress that we made in 2013 and the opportunities that lie ahead.","But first, let me turn the call over to Jim to review our financial results in detail and to provide the outlook for Q1. Jim?","James Benson","Thank you, Tom. Akamai had a great fourth quarter and a very strong 2013 fiscal year. Before I get into the details, I would like to remind you that the ADS divestiture and the depreciation methodology change for our network assets continued to impact our 2013 reported results and growth rates. Where appropriate, I will point out the impact of these items, so you can better understand the operational performance in the quarter.","As Tom outlined, Q4 revenue came in well above the high end of our guidance range at $436 million, up 15% year-over-year or up 21%, if you adjust for the ADS divestment and foreign exchange headwinds.","As I mentioned in our last call, there were 2 factors that would play a large role in where we would land relative to our fourth quarter guidance. The first was the timing of the renegotiation with our largest media customer, which did not impact the fourth quarter. The second was the strength of the holiday season, which exceeded our expectations in every solution category and in every geography.","Turning to our media delivery solutions. Revenue was $207 million in the quarter, up 19% over Q4 of last year and up 10% sequentially. Traffic and revenue growth continued to be very strong across our video, gaming, social media and software download customer base and particularly strong among our largest, most strategic accounts.","Revenue from our performance and security solutions was $192 million in the quarter, up 18% over Q4 of last year and up 11% sequentially. Within this solution category, we continue to see strong demand for both our website and application acceleration solutions, as well as our security offerings. Notably, signings for these solutions were the strongest we saw all year. We believe this represents an important proof point for the traction we began to see from our sales force investments.","Finally, revenue from our service and support solutions was $36 million in the quarter, up 36% over Q4 of last year and up 11% sequentially. We continue to see strong traction in service attachment rates to both our core media and core performance and security offerings.","Turning now to our geographies. Sales in our markets outside North America represented 29% of total revenue in Q4, flat from the prior year and up 1 point from Q3. Revenue outside North America grew 17% from Q4 of last year and 13% sequentially, with currency fluctuations having a negative impact on revenue of approximately $4 million on a year-over-year basis and a positive impact of roughly $2 million on a sequential basis. Excluding the impact of currency, revenue outside North America grew 20% from Q4 of last year and 12% sequentially. We saw continued strong growth in our Asia-Pacific geography and performance in our EMEA markets was better than expected despite continued macroeconomic headwinds in Southern Europe.","Revenue from North America grew 15% from Q4 of last year and 9% sequentially. If you adjust for the impact of the ADS divestiture, North America grew a healthy 21% year-over-year. North America continued to perform very well for us and had particularly strong growth in our large strategic accounts. And finally, revenue through resellers represented 21% of total revenue in Q4.","Moving on to costs. We were pleased with our continued execution on managing cost of goods sold, which resulted in another quarter of expanding gross margins. Our cash gross margin was 78%, up 2 points from the prior quarter and up 3 points from the same period last year and coming in at the high end of our guidance range. As we have demonstrated over the last couple of years, our network operations and engineering teams continue to execute well on managing cost of goods sold through the implementation of ongoing platform efficiency initiatives.","GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 69%, up 2 points from Q3 and up 6 points from the same period last year. This year-over-year improvement included a favorable impact of roughly 2 points due to the depreciation methodology change that took place at the beginning of the year.","GAAP operating expenses were $186 million in the quarter. These GAAP numbers include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges and acquisition-related charges. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $150 million, up $21 million from Q3 levels and slightly above our guidance range for the quarter, due primarily to an increase in year-end performance-based compensation accelerators from the revenue overachievement and an increase in demand generation spending.","Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $192 million. That's up 11% from Q3 levels and from the same period last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 44%, at the high end of our guidance range due to the strong revenue performance. This result is consistent with Q3 levels but down 2 points from Q4 of last year, driven by our continued targeted investments in the business.","For the fourth quarter, total depreciation and amortization was $50 million, which included $37 million of network-related depreciation, $8 million of G&A depreciation and $5 million of amortization of intangible assets. Interest income for the fourth quarter was $1.5 million, roughly flat with Q3 levels.","Moving onto earnings. GAAP net income for the quarter was $80 million or $0.44 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $100 million for the quarter or $0.55 of earnings per diluted share and coming in $0.02 above the high end of our guidance range due to the strong operational execution areas highlighted earlier.","As a reminder and as we included in our Q4 guidance, $0.03 of our Q4 EPS is attributable to the depreciation methodology change which we made in the first quarter to extend the useful lives of our servers by 1 year.","For the quarter, total taxes included in our GAAP earnings was $37 million based on a tax rate of about 31% and taxes in our non-GAAP earnings were $50 million based on a tax rate of about 33%, which was slightly favorable to guidance due primarily to higher-than-expected foreign earnings. Our weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was 182 million shares.","With our strong first quarter results, we finished the year with nearly $1.6 billion in revenue, an increase of 15% over 2012 or an increase of 20%, when adjusted for the ADS divestment and foreign exchange headwinds.","Cash gross margin was 77%, up 3 points from the prior year and the second straight year of improved gross margins. Full year GAAP gross margin came in at 68%, up 7 points from 2012 or up 4 points, if you adjust for the depreciation methodology change introduced at the beginning of 2013. We are extremely pleased with our margin expansion this past year and we believe we can maintain our ability to scale the network going forward.","Full year GAAP operating expenses were $653 million. These GAAP numbers include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges and acquisition-related charges. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP cash operating expenses for the full year were $517 million, up 28% on a year-over-year basis. As we discussed throughout 2013, we are committed to investing organically and through M&A to drive innovation and future growth.","For the full year, we added over 800 employees across the company, focused primarily in sales and supporting go-to-market capacity, service and customer support staffing, network efficiency scaling and engineering innovation.","Full year adjusted EBITDA was $697 million, up 13% from 2012. And full year adjusted EBITDA margin was 44%, down 1 point from the prior year.","GAAP net income was $293 million or $1.61 of earnings per diluted share for 2013. $0.18 of our EPS is attributed to the depreciation methodology change. Non-GAAP net income for the year was $367 million or $2.02 of earnings per diluted share. That's up 26% as reported from 2012. This number includes the full year non-GAAP tax charge of $180 million based on a full year non-GAAP tax rate of 33%.","Now I'll review some balance sheet items. Days sales outstanding for the fourth quarter was 55 days, down 2 days from last quarter and down 1 day from Q4 of 2012. Capital expenditures in Q4, excluding equity compensation, were $63 million, slightly above our guidance. As a reminder, this CapEx number includes network investments, as well as capitalized software development, facilities and IT-related expenditures.","Cash generation continued to be very strong. Cash from operations for the fourth quarter was $172 million. And year-to-date, we generated $564 million in cash from operations.","At the end of Q4, we had roughly $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on the balance sheet.","During the quarter, we spent approximately $48 million on share repurchases, buying back 1.1 million shares at an average price of just over $45. For the full year, we spent $160 million, buying back over 3.9 million shares at an average price of just over $41. And since the inception of our share repurchase program in April 2009 through Q4 2013, we have spent a total of $785 million, buying back over 26 million shares at an average price of just under $30.","In summary, we are very pleased with how the business performed in Q4 and the full year. We continue to execute well, deliver strong revenue growth, manage network cost effectively and make the necessary investments in the business to build a momentum -- a foundation for sustained long-term growth. And we believe we have good momentum as we head into 2014 and are expecting another strong quarter in Q1.","Before I get into the guidance specifics for the first quarter, I want to address 2 items that are related to our guidance. First, we outlined in our last call that we are in the process of renegotiating the contract and pricing terms with our largest media customer. Our Q1 guidance includes this customer's new pricing terms retroactive to January 1. Second, since the Prolexic acquisition is not yet closed, we have not included any impact of Prolexic in our Q1 guidance.","With these 2 factors in mind, we are expecting Q1 revenue in the range of $426 million to $442 million. This range represents 17% to 21% year-over-year growth, when adjusted for the ADS divestiture and foreign exchange headwinds. At the midpoint, this translates to 19% year-over-year growth.","At current spot rates, foreign exchange is expected to have a negative impact of approximately $1 million compared to Q4 and $2 million compared to Q1 of last year. We expect cash gross margins to remain flat to Q4 levels at 78% and GAAP gross margins to come in at 68%. Q1 non-GAAP cash operating expenses are projected to be $145 million to $150 million, down slightly from Q4 levels as commission accelerated reset at the beginning of the year. We anticipate EBITDA margins of about 44%. However, as I have mentioned previously, we intend to operate in the low-40s EBITDA margin over time.","With this revenue and spend configuration, we expect non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.51 to $0.55. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $48 million to $52 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of 34%, which is negatively impacted by about 1 point due to the expiration of the federal R&D tax credit. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of roughly 182 million shares.","On CapEx, we expect to spend approximately $72 million to $77 million in the quarter, excluding equity compensation. This is an uptick in spend due to the addition of several large facilities and IT investments that are focused on scaling our infrastructure.","Let me now give you a brief update on the Prolexic acquisition. We are working our way through the regulatory review process, but we cannot provide an exact closing date. When the deal does close, we intend to integrate the operations of the Prolexic business into our existing security business. And going forward, we will not be reporting Prolexic separately. However, to give you some color around the impact to our business, Prolexic's current revenue run rate is roughly $5 million per month. We also expect Prolexic to reduce Akamai's organic EBITDA margins by about 2 points and to be slightly dilutive to non-GAAP earnings by $0.06 to $0.08 in the first 12 months. Once we integrate the companies, we are confident that we can grow and scale the business to drive profit growth over the longer term with the anticipated growth in the business and market opportunity.","In closing, we accomplished a great deal in 2013 and remain confident in our ability to execute on our plans for the long term. We look forward to having an opportunity to go into more details with you about the business and future trends in the industry at our upcoming Investor Summit in Cambridge on March 25.","Now let me turn the call back over to Tom.","F. Thomson Leighton","Thanks, Jim. Akamai is stronger and more profitable than ever. And I believe that our financial results demonstrate that the fundamentals across our business are solid and that we continue to be a key player in the growth of the Internet.","February marks the 15th anniversary of the beginning of our commercial service when we first delivered a single object for a single website. We've come a long way since those early days in 1999. Today, Akamai delivers a large portion of the web content that matters, handling over 2 trillion requests per day from over 1 billion end users and supporting traffic levels of over 20 terabits per second.","In the United States, we are trusted by 97 of the top 100 Internet retailers, 9 of the top 10 banks, 20 of the top 24 cable networks and 72 of the top 100 media companies, including 19 of the top 25 gaming companies.","In Latin America, we support 8 of the top 10 e-commerce companies, all top 3 banks and the 5 largest media conglomerates in Brazil.","In Europe, we are trusted by 5 of the top 7 automotive companies, 6 of the top 10 banks and 21 of the top 25 the media companies.","And in Asia, our customers include 4 of the top 5 airlines, 5 of the top 10 banks, 3 of the top 5 stock exchanges and 9 of the top 10 media companies.","It took a lot of hard work over many years by our very talented employees to achieve these impressive results. And we believe that work has positioned us well for an even more promising future. Everyone and everything is getting connected, creating a new environment that some refer to as the Internet of Everything, others call the Internet of Things and we know as the Hyperconnected World. Whatever you choose to call it, vast amounts of traffic are poised to move online and users everywhere are demanding near-instant access to applications and information from a myriad of connected devices. This demand represents both a challenge and an opportunity. And the investments that we've made over the past several years should help us to address the challenges and to capitalize on the opportunities that lie ahead.","2013, in particular, was a year in which we made significant investments to pave the way for future growth. For example, in our media business, we expanded our network footprint to nearly 150,000 servers in over 1,200 networks spanning over 90 countries. We reduced our network costs to improvements in software and hardware and the development of more robust and scalable network management processes. And we forged deep and strategic relationships with leading carriers such as AT&T, Orange, Swisscom, Korea Telecom and T\u00fcrk Telekom. We expect these relationships will enable us to grow revenue more economically and to further improve end user performance.","We're also excited to be continuing our work with the world's leading device manufacturers and technology companies. For example, at the recent Consumer Electronic Show in Las Vegas, Akamai teamed up with Qualcomm to showcase the online delivery of 4K videos. This new ultra high-definition format is expected to quadruple the resolution of the average HDTV. Delivering this level of quality and scale presents many technical and financial hurdles for content owners and service providers, problems that Akamai is already solving.","We also joined forces with Qualcomm to demonstrate the significant performance benefits and cost savings that can be attained by having Akamai software run on a device in the home, such as Qualcomm's Atheros Smarthome gateway. Demonstrations like this provide a glimpse into the future, where we endeavor to locate our software in homes, offices and devices everywhere, thereby enabling faster and more secure access to media and applications at lower costs.","Akamai has always worked closely with our customers to provide the ultimate in online viewing quality. Last weekend, Akamai delivered the Super Bowl online to over 0.5 million concurrent viewers with an aggregate traffic level of over 1 terabit per second, making it one of the most viewed live streams ever. Later this week, Akamai will be providing the streaming, site acceleration and security services for NBC's online coverage of the Winter Olympics Games in Sochi. The Sochi Olympics marks the first time that all the competitions will be streamed live. For live and on-demand video delivery, NBC Olympics is leveraging Akamai's digital media solutions to stream all 98 events, including highlights, athlete interviews and profiles. Akamai was chosen by NBC in part because our suite of cloud-based, media workflow storage and delivery solutions provides the necessary quality and scale to solve the challenges of multi-device media consumption.","We also made major investments in our performance and security businesses in 2013, significantly growing our sales capacity and launching several new products and key features. We ended the year slightly ahead of our sales hiring plans, growing our direct rep count by over 40% in 2013. We believe this additional capacity will provide us with the opportunity to not only reach new prospects and new geographies, but also to provide additional solutions to our installed base, particularly in performance and security. Our product releases focus on self-service ability, more advanced reporting and on improving real end user experiences, especially for mobile devices. Our customers can now see how their websites and applications perform for real end users and they can dramatically improve that performance by leveraging the many innovations that Akamai brought to market in 2013 as part of our Ion suite of solutions.","Cyber attacks continued to increase in both scale and sophistication in 2013, requiring a distributed approach to defending a website and the data behind it. Akamai Security Solutions leverage our global platform to provide a large and powerful layer of defense for any website or web application. As a result, security was our fastest-growing solution line across all of our geographies in 2013, as both our existing customers and new prospects turn to Akamai for help.","At the end of the fourth quarter, nearly 800 customers were using our security products and nearly 230 had purchased our flagship Kona Site Defender solution. Our portfolio of security services will be significantly enhanced in the near future when, as Jim mentioned, we expect to close the Prolexic acquisition. Once the acquisition closes, Akamai will extend our security solutions to protect all enterprise applications against DDoS and other malicious attacks, substantially enhancing the completeness of our offerings.","In summary, 2013 was an excellent year for Akamai. In addition to our solid financial performance, we continue to build the foundation that will propel our future growth. That's important because, as exciting as the last 15 years have been, I'm even more excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.","Thank you for your time today. Now Jim and I will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Sterling Auty, JPMorgan.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","One question and one follow-up. I just want to make sure that we're clear. In terms of the guidance for the first quarter, you mentioned the price going into effect retroactively to January 1. Are you saying that, that contract renewal is complete and enforced? Or you're saying that once it's complete, you'll roll it back to January 1? And then, I have one follow-up.","James Benson","So it's the latter, which is the -- we've agreed to pricing terms. We have to finalize all the -- kind of, dot the i's and cross the t's but it will retroactive pricing to January 1. And that's what's reflected in the guidance.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. But the basic terms are -- you've got to go through the contracting process, but all the major items are [indiscernible].","James Benson","That's correct.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then, one follow-up in a different area. You talked about the strong signings in security and performance as evidence of the traction of productivity in your sales hires. Can you give us a little bit more color there? So specifically, what are you seeing in terms of the productivity? What is it that's finally allowing them to turn the corner? And how should we think about what that will drive as 2014 unfolds?","James Benson","That's a good question. I think we shared with you all year that there were going to be 2 things: One, you need to get the reps onboard; and then, two, we will be monitoring the productivity of the reps and we call it, by tenure class. And we said that it takes several quarters before a rep is fully productive. And as you know, we only began to ramp up the sales force investments really in the back half of 2012. And so, call it, the first class of tenured reps is, kind of, coming full circle here. And what we saw across the board was we just saw, again, all the reps by tenure class are tracking to our expectations and you're starting to see the benefit now of reps that have been a long -- in the company for a longer period of time are beginning to produce. And so, again, I would say it wasn't a big driver of the revenue overachievement in Q4, but that strong bookings, which was significantly higher than it had been all year, I think, is a proof point of what we've been saying, which is we expect to see accelerating revenue growth in the performance and security solutions category in 2014. I think this is a really important proof point, that the sales force is onboard, they're trained and we're starting see some productivity from them that we're expecting to see yield revenue growth in 2014.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Jennifer Lowe, Morgan Stanley.","Jennifer Swanson Lowe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And maybe even following up on that last train around the guidance. We were impressed to see a guidance that basically implies revenue flat quarter-over-quarter, which is sort of normal seasonality despite what I would assume is a pretty material reduction in revenue from the large digital media customer. So can you just give us a little color on what's offsetting that price decline at the large customer? Is there anything unusual in Q1 that we should be thinking about? Or is it really just the demand in performance and security offsetting some of the pricing impacts there? How should we, sort of, contextualize the guidance relative to what is normal seasonality?","James Benson","Sure. I think the way to think about it, I think the business, in general, across the board is very strong. It's strong in the media business, it's strong in performance and security, it's strong in service and support. And one of the reasons why we provided some color about this large customer renegotiation in Q4 is we wanted to make sure it was open and transparent that the rest of the business is performing very well. And I think what this is reflecting in our guidance is you can see the rest of the business is performing very well. That pricing impact is factored into the guidance and it's -- as we said, this is a customer that has not had a pricing adjustment for several years. So it is a significant impact. But the rest of the business in media and in performance and security is just compensating for that. And it's just offsetting what is a headwind from 1 particular customer.","Jennifer Swanson Lowe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And then, just one follow-up for me. Given the strong demand that you're seeing and the 40% growth in sales headcount last year. What are you thinking about in terms of the level of investment into sales this year?","James Benson","Well, we're going to continue to make investments in the sales force. We haven't specifically provided guidance around what that's going to be, but you can expect that we're going to be adding sales reps at, kind of, a similar rate clip in 2014.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Heather Bellini, Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Two questions. One is -- regards to some comments that you made, I think, a couple of months ago about the impact that the NSA and the spying, it has the potential to impact your business outside of the U.S. So I was wondering if you could touch a little bit about that. And then, secondly, just in relation to what happened last month regarding net neutrality and kind of your views on how that might impact the industry.","F. Thomson Leighton","Okay. First, let me make it really clear that the PRISM press has had no meaningful impact on our business. And I don't anticipate it will. It is not a good thing out there. It does cause conversations to take place. There might be a deal or 2 in Germany that take longer, but that's not impactful in any meaningful way to our business. So I want to make that really clear. Second, in terms of net neutrality, I think there's still a ways to go before all that plays out. As you may know, CDNs were excluded as part of the net neutrality regulations in the first place. To the extent that changes are eventually made that are beneficial to the carriers, I think that's either neutral or beneficial to Akamai. As you know, we partner very closely with the carriers. We have deep strategic relationships with several of the major carriers. And so, if something happens that's favorable to them, being a major technology provider to them, that is helpful to us, I think.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Mark Kelleher, D.A. Davidson.","Mark Kelleher - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Wanted to go back to the contract that you renegotiated. Is there any timing, any length of time that you can give us some insight on that? I'm just wondering when we need to worry about this again coming up. And then, just as a follow-up, is there any sense, within that contract negotiations that you discussed were -- may eventually, as large content provider sometimes do, bring their CDN in-house?","James Benson","So we're not going to provide any details about the customer negotiation. That's us -- between us and the customer. So we're not going to give you the average contract length or any of that. I can tell you that the pricing impact is as of January 1 and we expect this customer to be a continued customer for us going forward.","F. Thomson Leighton","And in terms of the do-it-yourself, generally, any very large media company at one time or another, I think, in the past or currently, is looking at a do-it-yourself solution. That is not uncommon. Do-it-yourself, as we've always talked about, is one of our largest competitors. It's a lot harder than people think, though, to really do the delivery at scale, continually improving it and to continually be reducing the cost for it. And we've seen examples where very large media companies have gone off and done it and then, within some small number of years, realized that it's not core to them and they're not doing it as well as they had hoped. And they actually come back and use Akamai again. In fact, there's a large media company today that's nearing the second end of that cycle. It's not as -- not so easy to do and we put a lot of effort into doing it really well and to continually improving the quality, the scalability and the cost.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Aaron Schwartz, Jefferies.","Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Two questions, if I could. First, on the media growth there, it seemed like the holiday or e-commerce metrics for you were probably a little bit of an uptick relative to what you saw last year. And I was wondering if there is any way you could differentiate between, sort of, the traffic growth you saw and then also the download activity -- you saw for download activity that may have been either directly or indirectly related to e-commerce sales just -- as just people sort of activate new devices around the holiday season? And then, the second question on the margins. I know you're not including Prolexic in the guidance. But if we assume the dilution you spoke to, your longer-term margin is still sort of below what would get us there. And I'm just wondering what the delta would be there. Is that just continued investment in the business that we should think about? Or is this just some wiggle room for potential future and organic deals? If there's any way you can, sort of, reconcile the 2 there, that would be great.","James Benson","Sure. So to take your first -- and I'm glad you asked on the holiday season. I think, sometimes, people think that the holiday season impact is really just the commerce effect and it's really much more than that. The -- there's a significant amount of new devices that get released around the holiday season that drives a lot of traffic. There's usually a significant number of software downloads or gaming releases that come around the holidays that drive a lot of traffic. And really, what we saw in Q4 was -- as I mentioned, it was across the board. We saw very strong growth in our social media customers. We saw very strong growth in our video delivery customers. We saw very strong growth in gaming. We saw very strong growth in software downloads. So it wasn't 1 area, it was all areas, all 4 areas that we talked about as far as secular, kind of, tailwinds. And our media business continued to perform very well. And that was really what took place in Q4. And relative to commerce, commerce is really germane to our B2B customers and B2C customers and we had a strong commerce season. But I'd say, the -- probably, the most noteworthy was what we saw around just incremental traffic in the media space. And relative to margins, we have told you for a while that we intend to operate the company in the low-40s EBITDA. We ended Q4 at 44%. And you're right, you can do kind of the math around ultimately when the impact of the Prolexic acquisition occurs, that that's going to have about a 2 point impact on EBITDA margins. And I think what we're trying to tell you is that we believe that we -- our aspiration is to grow this company at a compound annual growth rate of 18-plus-percent growth rates. And we want to make the investments in the business either organically or through M&A to enable that. And we believe that operating the company in the low-40s EBITDA is going to enable us to do that.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Colby Synesael, Cowen.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Two questions, if I may. First off, I think, since you last reported, Verizon announced that it acquired EdgeCast. So if I'm not mistaken, Verizon is a reseller relationship of yours. So I'm curious if you anticipate that deal having any impact on your current relationship with Verizon. And then, my second question has to do with your guidance -- and maybe I'm being too cute. But your revenue range is about $16 million. I think that that's a little bit larger than it typically is. Is there something there that you're not as confident as you might typically be that could affect that there?","F. Thomson Leighton","So I'll take the first question. The VDMS, or the digital media unit within Verizon, purchased EdgeCast. That group has been a competitor with Akamai in the past and will remain so in the future as a result of the acquisition. Akamai's relationship with Verizon has been through the Enterprise Services, or VES group. That relationship is not changing right now. So customers can continue to use that channel for Akamai services and both companies are committed to continuing and making that work. Obviously, it's a situation that we're closely monitoring. But at this point in time, we don't see any near-term impact to our business as a result of the acquisition.","James Benson","And, Colby, relative to the guidance range, the company is getting bigger now. And so, I think it's time for the company to widen the guidance range, that when you start approaching $400-million-plus per quarter in revenues, I just think it makes sense to widen the range. We've told you in the past that, in particular, the media business will have more variability because of traffic spikes due to gaming releases, software downloads, et cetera. And even though we've seen some sustained growth there, there can be some spikiness there. And so, what we're trying to do and account for that by broadening the range a little bit.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Gray Powell, Wells Fargo.","Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Tom, you made a really interesting comment specifically about larger customers that get to a stage where they want to go out and they want to build their own CDN. They realized it's tough and then they end up coming back. Is that part of this large uptick in traffic that we've seen in the last few months?","F. Thomson Leighton","I don't think so. That's a macro trend. It's been going on for over 10 years, I would say. And that's -- any given account, it works over a period of years generally, both to get started and to wind it down, if that's what happens.","Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. But is it something that you're seeing recently?","F. Thomson Leighton","This is something we've been seeing in a steady state for as long as I can remember. It is not uncommon for a very big media company to think about and\/or try to do it themselves. Once you go down that path, the lifespan is generally measured in a period of years. And over a period of years, a lot of things change. Our services get better all the time. Costs change pretty dramatically over a period of years. And so, what may have seemed like a good idea at the time, after a period of years often doesn't.","Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Understood. Okay. That's very helpful. And then just -- can you help us think about leverage on the cost of goods sold line? Specifically, it looks like co-location costs have been flat to down in absolute dollar terms the last 2 years, whereas your server count has increased by 50%. So I'm just -- how should we think about the efficiencies there going forward?","James Benson","I think we told you that I'm actually -- it's a stuff that actually track -- we actually haven't added a dollar of co-location spend really in -- over 2 years. So you're right. And I think it really attributes to our network operations and engineering teams that they've just driven a lot of initiatives that have been -- allowed us, one, to get more throughput out of the servers that we have on the network and not have to add co-location costs. And so, it's really -- it's a combination of a lot of factors with -- but we think we can maintain all of that. I don't think that we're going to continue in a model that we'll never add co-location spending. But we think we can maintain the momentum that we have. And what that's going to equate to is a stabilization in gross margins from the levels that we're at right now. And then, I would say, over time -- when I say over time, as the mix shifts more to the performance and security solutions -- you should see some gross margin expansion. But that's going to take some time as those businesses grow.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mike Olson, Piper Jaffray.","Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","On the sales force ramp, there's been a lot of questions about this already. But would you be willing to share how many salespeople you've hired to-date or maybe by the end of Q4? And then, kind of, how many are left to be hired at this point based on your current plans?","James Benson","Yes. So we shared with you that we had a plan to end the year with about 308 sales reps. We actually ended the year at 310. So we did a little bit better than we expected. And that's a net add of about 95 now -- year-on-year. There were a few sales reps in the prior year that were from the ADS business. We actually have a net add of actually over 100. So we had, roughly, 215 last year and now we have 310. And we're not going to provide specific guidance going forward of the exact number of sales reps that we're going to add. But I can tell you that we're going to add, as I mentioned earlier, at a similar rate and pace to what you've seen in the last year plus.","Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. For the remainder of 2014 or just for the first couple of quarters of the year?","James Benson","No, no, it's going to be throughout the year. And I think one of the things we've shared with you is that, that sales force investment has been a little bit more weighted towards our international markets. And you'll -- you should expect that will continue to be the case.","Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And then, for media delivery in Q1, I know you guys always say that any 1 particular event doesn't move the needle. But will the Olympics move the needle in Q1? Or in the context of the overall business, is it immaterial, or...","James Benson","No, it's immaterial. It's not a notable driver of revenue. But it's an important proof point around the consumption of information on the Internet. And so, I think we comment on it because the more -- this is becoming much more pervasive, people watching live streams via the Internet. I think it just tells you that we're at the early days around people's consumption there. I think it's just going to continue to grow. But as an event by itself, it's not material at all.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Michael Turits, Raymond James.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Two questions, one on revenue and the guidance and the other on margins. First, on revenue guidance, it's obviously a great guidance for 1Q. Is there anything either in the price and contract negotiations that came out better than you expected, or is there anything in the quarter, in particular -- I know this is strong across the board, but in particular, that was upside such that we got such a strong upside to our expectation?","James Benson","No, Michael, on the revenue guidance, the -- I think the expectation of the large customer negotiation is pretty much as we expected it to be. So it's just the health of the business outside this particular customer is just very, very solid. As I mentioned, it's solid across all of our categories. And I think we're just -- we're bullish that we're going to continue to see that in Q1.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, on the margins, I mean, you've given guidance very roughly to low-40s. I think the Street is about 43%. I guess, I'm just wondering if we can get any more specific. Does that going to -- whether or not you think that, that's an aggressive or a conservative number for the rest of the year.","James Benson","Yes. And the reason I used the term \"low,\" is I hesitate to give you an exact number because I think it's going to vary based on different factors. Some people might think 43% is low, low-40s. Some people might think 41% to 42% is low. But I think that -- just to give you a little bit of color. So we're guiding to 44%. And I said that I think Prolexic is going to be a 2 point impact on EBITDA margin. So that will at least give you some color around what we expect in the near term to operate the company at.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Right. But you thought it was low-40s x Prolexic, right?","James Benson","No, it will be low-40s with Prolexic.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Phil Winslow, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just have a question digging back into the gross margin side and also on the sales force. Your comment on co-location expenses, I'm wondering if you could also give us some color on just bandwidth expenses you're seeing there and any sort of changes you have seen or might expect to see. And then, also, with the sales force, I'm wondering if you could just give us a sense for what you're seeing in terms of just a ramp of the sales force as you bring heads on, how long it takes for them to get to, sort of, the levels of the, kind of, efficiency that you'd want to see out of them.","James Benson","So on the COGS side, again, we've made great progress on co-location. On the bandwidth side, we continue to drive bandwidth cost down. We are a large purchaser of bandwidth so we certainly get buying leverage from that. And we -- there are other -- there are initiatives that we're driving to try to reduce bandwidth even further. So we think we can continue the kind of rate and pace of both bandwidth reduction and the progress we've made on co-location, again, yielding a stabilization in margins. On the sales ramp, again, I think we provided some color before on other calls that there are few things that are going to drive improvements in bookings. One, for your tenured sales reps, you want to make sure you retain them and we've done a very good job of doing that. Two, for your new sales reps, you want to make sure they are tracking to productivity expectations. And it's hard to call an average but it takes 4 to 5 quarters for a rep to get fully productive. And we track each rep class and see how they're tracking. And throughout 2013, we were tracking very well. And I think what you had in Q4 was the wraparound effect of more tenured reps for those that were hired in late 2012 and a little bit in -- early in 2013.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of James Breen, William Blair.","James D. Breen - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just on -- again, another question, sort of on the margins, where the guidance is relative to long term. Maybe, Jim, if you can just talk about the network agreement [ph] that you're seeing now. Is that something that you should expect to go for several more quarters, or do you feel like you're towards the end of that? And then, second part of the question, maybe for Tom. As you look at your business domestically versus internationally, obviously, Apple moving to China should have some impact. I'm just wondering as to what your thoughts are on the International business relative to the U.S. and where the growth rates are accelerating.","James Benson","So I'll take the margin. On the margin front, again, this was the second year in a row. I mentioned in the opening remarks that we've expanded gross margins. And I believe we can maintain the margin levels that we're at. And not calling that they're going to expand further other than what I had said a few questions ago, which is I think, over time, as more of the business is weighted to performance and security solutions, which have higher on average gross margins in the media business, that you will get some gross margin expansion but certainly not in the near term. I think we can stabilize gross margins in the near term.","F. Thomson Leighton","Yes. In terms of international markets, percentage of our revenue that's been outside of North America has been pretty steady. But I think the growth should start coming more internationally. We're making majority of our investment outside of North America. We're opening new territories, we're getting a lot more feet on the ground in territories where we've been established outside of North America. And you think about where the people are and the people are coming online in a lot of the businesses and you would look outside of North America. So I think, over the longer term, we would expect the percentage of our revenue that's outside of North America to grow.","James D. Breen - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And then, just one follow-up on the M&A side. You obviously have quite a bit of cash now and you're generating more and more each quarter. Can you just give us your thoughts on M&A, in general? In terms of, are you looking to buy $100 million of revenue a year, $200 million of revenue a year in terms of the size of the companies?","F. Thomson Leighton","That's not exactly the way we think about it. We're looking to make acquisitions that will help Akamai grow, bring greater benefit to our customers that can come in the form of a company that has existing revenue. Quite often, we buy companies that really don't have any revenue, but they've got a good technology and really smart employees that we can integrate into Akamai and bring leverage to what they've got across our customer base to help Akamai grow. So when we think about M&A, we're looking to make acquisitions that will help Akamai grow and bring better value to our customers.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ben Rose, Battle Road Research.","Ben Z. Rose - Battle Road Research Ltd.","Just a couple of questions. In light of the events that have taken place at Target in the last couple of months, are you seeing increased interest on the part of the e-tailer community?","F. Thomson Leighton","Yes. I think the e-retail community is very interested in our Kona Site Defender and our Security Solutions. Because of our distributed network and tremendous capacity and all the investment we put into our web app firewall, we're really in a great position to help defend against the largest and most nefarious attacks out there, whether they're attempting to do a denial of service or to go in and corrupt content or to steal information from the website. And there's just many examples of named brands that have been hit by cyber attacks over the last several months and last couple of years. So I think there is increasing awareness now really across the board, but certainly in the e-commerce vertical.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ed Maguire, CLSA.","Edward Maguire - CLSA Limited, Research Division","I was wondering if you could give an update on your progress with some of your carrier solutions so far that have been off to an encouraging start last year. Also, if you could comment on your hybrid cloud initiatives as well. I believe we were expecting to see some betas of your retail solutions. Would appreciate an update.","F. Thomson Leighton","Yes. I think we're making excellent progress with carriers. Now of course, as you know, we have over 1,200 network partners. But in particular, we put a lot of focus on the leading global carriers and getting a much deeper and more strategic relationship there. And during the prepared remarks, I summarized the major step forward we took last year. And I hope you'll see an impressive group of new carrier strategic relationships this year. So it's an area where we're making a lot of effort and I think it has a lot of long-term value to Akamai. We view ourselves as being a technology -- a strategic technology supplier to the major carriers. The carriers own the last mile. They have great enterprise relationships. They are helpful to us in a variety of ways, help us to get to market, help us improve quality, help us reduce costs. And we do the same thing for them. We help them improve quality. We help them bring services to market. And we help them provide better service to their customers and to their end users. So I would say I'm very pleased with the progress there and we're making a lot of effort. In terms of hybrid cloud optimization, it's very early stages. We had excellent early traction last year. We actually have our technology deployed in several stores around the world on a trial basis. The feedback from those trials has been very encouraging. As you may know, we demonstrated our software running on a Cisco branch office router at our Edge Customer Conference in October and that relationship is making good progress. And just as I mentioned earlier, at CES, we took another set of Akamai software and put it onto a Qualcomm Atheros Home Gateway -- Smart Gateway device and showed how that can bring benefits to the home in terms of improving the speed of software delivery, improving the quality of movies that you watch and decreasing the congestion along the last mile. And the really nice thing about that is that demonstration was actually done by Qualcomm, at the Qualcomm booth at CES. So we're in early stages. We're not forecasting any meaningful revenue this year, but I am optimistic about the long-term value of that capability. And that's one of the areas we look at for driving new sources of revenue for Akamai going years into the future.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Tim Horan, Oppenheimer.","Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Do you have any other customers that are more than 5% of revenue at this point? And I -- would it include some of the resellers like Verizon out there? And just as part of that, have you kind of smoothed out the contracts at this point that we don't have to worry about, kind of, lumpiness quarter-to-quarter with repricing of media and other contracts?","James Benson","Sure. So we don't have -- as I said before, we don't have any 10% customers. I'm not going to talk about size of customers beyond that. We don't have any 10% customers. Obviously, we talk about this 1 notable customer that was close to that given their impact. And relative to the way we structure contracts, again, we've told you this time and again that, that's a nature of the media business. The media business is a business that's going to have variability in traffic. It's a business that's going to go through periods where you're going through a pricing reset and that's just the nature of the business. And I think we've proven over multiple years, when you look at this business, this is a very solid growing business. And so, it's -- you shouldn't overreact when there's a downtick in the business. I think if you look at this business over multiple years, it's proving to be a very steady grower in a very sticky business with our customers.","Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And then, you upgraded a lot of your products, obviously, about a year ago or so and have been rolling them out with the new sales force. Can you talk about the customer adoption of those upgraded products and how the pricing kind of compares versus some of the legacy -- for things like Kona and Aqua and other products?","James Benson","I mean, I think it's consistent. Again, we're getting traction with all of our sales reps. I think we're getting traction across the portfolio. We continue to make good traction in selling our security solutions. We had a very strong quarter in selling our performance solutions in Q4. So I think, in general, across the board, we're getting good take rates for the new products that we've introduced.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Kevin Smithen, Macquarie.","Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Research","Can you talk about the impact of mobile on your business segment by segment and, specifically, how the uptake has been on the Aqua Ion refresh a lot of mobile applications on it?","F. Thomson Leighton","Sure. Everything is going mobile. We see about 25% of the transactions today being done from a mobile device, some of our customers in some parts of the world, that's already the majority. We believe that, within a couple of years, it will be the majority across our platform. That creates the challenge for performance. As you can imagine and probably you know from just using a mobile device, that it's a lot slower to do your web applications and transactions on a mobile device than it is on a land device, especially if you're on a cellular network. And as more of those transactions go mobile, this becomes a really important problem for the application owner, for the enterprise, for the commerce side, for the bank. And that's where we provide, really, substantial value. We're not quite to the point where we can make it as fast as a landline yet, but we can bring it a lot closer. And with our new real user monitoring as part of Ion, we can really give that kind of visibility to our customer. And they are now much more interested in mobile performance since it's becoming so important. In terms of media, the proliferation of the devices causes the need for a lot of software downloads because the device, itself, runs big software packages. And then, as you download each app on your device, that means you're downloading software. And as you play games on it, that means you're downloading software. So we do see a lot of demand for software downloads because of the proliferation of the devices. Now in terms of video, I think, in the long run, the large majority of the bits will be watched from the living room, probably on some kind of TV device. That said, people will watch videos when they're on the run, they'll watch their sporting event when they're on the run. So there are certainly more devices which can be downloading video. The big quality or the high quality, which means the high bit traffic for a video, you think will tend to be more centered on a bigger screen, which tends to be less mobile. So there's some increase in video traffic because of mobile. But I think, in the long run, it's more of the change in the formats, things like 4K, Ultra-HD and the viewing habits, where you go home and you watch something over IP instead of over cable or satellite and that's what will drive the traffic. And lot of that growth won't be mobile devices, per se.","Operator","There are no more questions in queue.

The tax rate change had a $5 million or $0.03 per share impact on non-GAAP net income that was not included in our guidance. Jim will provide more details on the tax benefit in a few minutes.","Cash flow generation continued to be very strong, with $158 million of cash from operations in the quarter and $390 million year-to-date.","I'm also pleased to let you know that our board has authorized a new share repurchase program for $750 million. Our goal with this program is to put in place a multi-year capital allocation plan to offset dilution from our equity compensation plans and to provide us with the flexibility to return cash to shareholders, as business and market conditions warrant.","I'll be back later to talk about some highlights from our recent customer conference and some specific achievements in the quarter. But first, let me turn the call over to Jim for the details on Q3 and the outlook for Q4. Jim?","James Benson","Thank you, Tom. Akamai had a great third quarter. Before I get into the details, I'd like to remind you that the ADS divestiture and the depreciation methodology change for our network assets continue to impact our 2013 reported results and growth rates. In addition, there was a third discrete item this quarter that positively impacted our Q3 GAAP and non-GAAP net income and EPS. It was not factored into our guidance. This item is related to a retroactive income tax deduction benefit that I will outline further when we discuss taxes and earnings. Where appropriate, I will point out the impact of these items, so you can better understand the operational performance in the quarter.","As Tom mentioned, revenue came in well above the high end of our guidance range at $396 million, up 15% year-over-year or up 19%, if you adjust for the ADS divestment and foreign exchange headwinds. The overachievement was largely due to stronger-than-expected growth in our media delivery solutions, most notably a bigger impact from the significant software release we mentioned in our last call.","We also came in better than anticipated in our Performance and Security Solutions, driven by 2 significant non-recurring engagements: The initial setup of a managed CDN engagement and the completion of a large custom government project.","Turning to our media delivery solutions. Revenue was $189 million in the quarter, up 5% sequentially and up 15% over a very strong Q3 in 2012. In addition to the large software release exceeding our expectations, we also saw strong growth across some of our largest, most strategic accounts. We are very pleased with this growth. But as we have stated in the past, the drivers of our Media business, namely traffic volumes and price, can lead to meaningful revenue variability from 1 quarter to the next given the nature, timing and size of software and gaming releases, as well as the adoption of new social media and video platform capabilities.","Revenue from our Performance and Security Solutions was $174 million in the quarter, up 4% sequentially and up 19% over Q3 of last year. This growth was significantly aided by the completion of 2 non-recurring deals I just mentioned, as well as a full quarter impact of the IT accelerator solution deal we discussed in our Q2 earnings call.","Finally, revenue from our service and support solutions was $33 million in the quarter, up 5% sequentially and up 34% over Q3 of last year. We continue to see strong traction in service attachment rates to our core media, performance and security offerings. Services and support is an important element of our offerings, since customers who purchased these services have proven to have both higher customer satisfaction ratings and have tended to buy more of Akamai's core product offerings.","Turning now to our geographies. Sales in our international markets outside North America represented 28% of total revenue in Q3, flat from the prior year and down 1 point from the prior quarter. This revenue grew 1% sequentially and 13% year-over-year despite currency headwinds. The stronger dollar was roughly neutral on a sequential basis, but a $4.3 million headwind on a year-over-year basis.","Excluding the impact of currency, revenue growth outside North America grew 1% sequentially and 17% year-over-year. As you may recall, Q3 of 2012 was a particularly strong quarter, benefiting from some one-time sporting events in these markets. We again saw solid growth in our Asia-Pacific geography, but continue to see softening revenue growth in our EMEA markets, primarily due to macroeconomic headwinds.","Revenue from North America grew 6% sequentially and 15% from Q3 of last year, or 20% growth when normalizing for the impact of the ADS divestiture. Most of the quarter's revenue overachievement came from North America. And finally, revenue through resellers represented 21% of total revenue in Q3.","Moving onto costs. As expected, our cash gross margin was 76% for the quarter, consistent with Q2 and up 2 points from the same period last year. As we have demonstrated over the past couple of years, our network operations and engineering teams continue to execute well on managing cost of goods sold through the implementation of ongoing platform efficiency initiatives.","GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 67%, consistent with Q2 and up 6 points from the same period last year. This year-over-year improvement included a favorable impact of roughly 4 points due to the depreciation methodology change that occurred in Q1.","GAAP operating expenses were $164 million in the third quarter. Cash operating expenses for the quarter were $129 million, up $7 million from Q2 and up 29% on a year-over-year basis. This is slightly below our guidance range due to some planned hiring shifting into the fourth quarter.","Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $173 million. That's up 5% from Q2 levels and up 11% from the same period last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 44%, at the high end of our guidance range due to the strong revenue performance. This result is consistent with Q2 levels and down 1 point from Q3 of last year.","For the third quarter, total depreciation and amortization was $48 million. These charges included $36 million of network-related depreciation, $7 million of G&A depreciation and $5 million of amortization of intangible assets. Net interest income for the third quarter was $1.5 million, roughly flat with Q2 levels.","Moving onto earnings. GAAP net income for the quarter was $80 million or $0.44 per diluted share, and non-GAAP net income was $90 million or $0.50 per diluted share.","As a reminder, and as we included in our Q3 guidance, $0.04 of our Q3 EPS is attributable to the depreciation methodology change we made in the first quarter to extend the useful lives of our servers by 1 year. In addition, the retroactive adoption of the tax deduction I mentioned earlier positively impacted GAAP net income by $17 million or $0.09 per diluted share. The impact on non-GAAP net income was a benefit of $5 million or $0.03 per diluted share, which was not included in our Q3 guidance. Excluding this benefit, our Q3 non-GAAP EPS would have been $0.47, coming in at the high end of our guidance range.","For the quarter, total taxes included in our GAAP earnings were $21 million and taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $43 million. Given the significant impact of this tax benefit to net income this quarter, let me provide you some additional color about it.","The tax deduction we adopted in Q3 is often referred to in the tax community as a Section 199 or production -- Domestic Production Activities Deduction. Akamai qualifies for this deduction due to its software development activities. While many high-tech companies take advantage of this deduction, the timing and amount of the deduction reflect an evolving practice in the software industry. As part of adopting this tax deduction in Q3, the accounting rules require a one-time retroactive true-up within the quarter. The net result of this adoption resulted in Q3 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates of 21% and 32%, respectively. On a go-forward basis, we expect a tax benefit of approximately 1 point on the overall company GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates.","Our weighted average diluted share count for the third quarter was 182 million shares.","Now I'll review some balance sheet items. Days sales outstanding for the quarter was 57 days, consistent with last quarter and down a couple of days from Q3 of 2012. Capital expenditures in Q3, excluding equity compensation, were $61 million, coming in below our guidance range due to some of our network investments shifting from Q3 to Q4. This CapEx number also includes capitalized software development, facilities and IT-related expenditures.","Cash generation continued to be very strong. Cash from operations for the third quarter was $158 million. And year-to-date, we generated $390 million in cash from operations. At the end of Q3, we had roughly $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on the balance sheet.","During the quarter, we spent approximately $30 million on share repurchases, buying back approximately 700,000 shares at an average price of just over $45. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in April 2009 through last quarter, we have spent a total of $737 million, buying back over 25 million shares at an average price of just over $30.","As Tom mentioned, we are pleased to announce that our board has authorized a new share repurchase program, authorizing $750 million running from now until the end of 2016. As we have discussed in the past, our overall aim is to deploy our capital to achieve favorable returns for our shareholders in a manner that we believe is in the best interest -- long-term interest of the company and our shareholders.","Given our strong balance sheet and cash generation, this new program is intended to enable us to not only offset dilution from employee equity programs, but to also give us the flexibility to opportunistically return more capital to shareholders depending upon both business and market conditions.","We are very pleased with how the business performed in Q3. We continue to drive solid revenue growth, manage network cost effectively and make the necessary investments in the business to build a foundation for sustained long-term growth.","Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, holiday seasonality plays a large role in our performance, driven by online retail traffic for our e-commerce customers and traffic for our large media customers. As a result, it is the quarter that is most impacted by the external macroeconomic environment, which remains hard to predict. We are expecting Q4 revenue in the range of $412 million to $430 million. This range represents 14% to 19% year-over-year growth, adjusted for the ADS divestiture and foreign exchange movements. At the midpoint, this translates to 16% year-over-year growth.","This growth rate is slightly lower than our Q3 growth due to a couple of key factors: First, Q3 was a very strong revenue quarter. As I mentioned earlier, our media delivery solutions benefited from an exceptionally large software release, and we also benefited from a couple non-recurring deals in our Performance and Security Solutions.","Second, we have factored into our guidance range the potential impact from a renegotiation with our largest media customer. Given the size of this customer and the fact that their existing pricing was set a few years ago, we believe the step-down in revenue will have a notable impact in the quarter the renegotiation takes place and will impact overall company growth rates over the next few quarters. The exact timing of this renegotiation is still being worked. And while we believe it is likely to take effect in Q1, we have included the impact in the low end of our guidance, should it take place in Q4.","To better frame the guidance range, if the holiday season is strong and the renewal takes effect in Q1, we would expect to be near the higher end of the revenue range. If the holiday season is weak and the renewal takes effect in Q4, then we would expect to be towards the lower end of the guidance range.","Foreign exchange is anticipated to have a positive impact of approximately $3 million compared to Q3, but a negative impact of $3 million compared to Q4 of last year. We expect cash gross margins to be in the range of 77% to 78% and GAAP gross margins to come in at approximately 68%.","On the operating expense side, we expect to grow cash OpEx by $13 million to $17 million on a sequential basis, driven by typical year-end expense items and continued investments in go-to-market and R&D initiatives that we believe will yield important, longer-term benefits.","Year-to-date, we have added approximately 700 employees across the company, with these additions focused primarily in sales, supporting go-to-market capacity; service and customer support staffing; and engineering resources. We expect to continue hiring in all of these areas in Q4.","With these increased expenditures, we anticipate EBITDA margins in the range of 43% to 44% for the quarter. We continue to expect EBITDA margins to decline to the low-40s over time.","At this level of revenue, we expect non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.49 to $0.53 for the quarter. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $46 million to $50 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of 34%. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of roughly 183 million shares.","On CapEx, we expect to spend approximately $60 million in the quarter, excluding equity compensation. For the full year, we are forecasting to be at 16% of revenue or at the high end of our long-term model, due primarily to significant facility-related and IT investments that we have made throughout the year to support the headcount growth. We have accomplished a great deal so far this year and remain confident in our ability to execute on our plans for the long-term.","Now let me turn the call back over to Tom.","F. Thomson Leighton","Thanks, Jim. It's been a great 9 months, and we're on track for a great year. Our financial results demonstrate that the fundamentals across our business are solid, and we remain confident in our strategy and the market opportunity for our products over the long term.","Our optimism is reinforced by the enthusiastic feedback that we received at our Sixth Annual Customer Conference held earlier this month. We had roughly 1,500 attendees from over 30 countries, and it was our largest event ever. Conversations with several media customers in the conference made it clear that they believe that vast quantities of higher quality video are poised to move online over the next several years. Not only is more media viewing moving online, but the emerging formats like 4K or ultra HD require much higher bit rates to satisfy the growing user demand for quality. This is good news for Akamai since it suggests that media traffic levels could accelerate going forward.","To meet this anticipated traffic demand, we are continuing to invest in our platform to provide high quality and reliability at scale. In September, traffic levels on the Akamai platforms surpassed 21 terabits per second. This record is 40% higher than our previous peak in June and highlights the ability -- our ability to scale our platform to handle unprecedented volumes of traffic while maintaining industry-leading levels of performance.","We are also investing to improve the performance of our media services. In September, we released the first version of our new FastTCP technology across the entire Akamai platform. Leveraging the FastSoft technology acquired in Q4 of last year, FastTCP is designed to optimize the throughput of video and other digital content, resulting in faster and higher quality experiences for end users around the world. Our performance testing indicates that the new technology improves average throughput levels to end-users by 15% in North America, 22% in Europe and 105% in China. These higher throughput levels mean faster download times for large files and higher-quality viewing experiences for end-users watching video online.","Conversations with our B2B and B2C customers at the conference made it clear that they expect more applications and online transactions will be moving to the cloud. They also recognize that the frequency of online transactions being handled by mobile devices is rapidly increasing, which creates greater challenges with performance. That is good news for Akamai since the goal of our web acceleration business is to achieve near-instant response times for dynamic websites and applications no matter where the user is, what device or browser they are using or how they are connected to the Internet.","Last quarter, we shared with you the benefits of our real user monitoring, or RUM, capabilities, which are designed to help customers understand their true web performance across the many environments being experienced by their end users. We now have 100 customers who are leveraging our RUM capabilities, and the data we have seen validates the performance benefits of our new Ion web acceleration service for both land and cellular devices in many countries around the world.","We believe that our web acceleration services are unparalleled in terms of their speed, reliability and compliance with security standards, such as PCI, and it is this performance and quality differentiation that makes Akamai unique.","A top concern of customers across all our verticals at the conference was that cyber attacks are dramatically increasing in size and sophistication, requiring a distributed approach to defending a website and the data behind it. Akamai's web security services leverage our global platform to provide a large and powerful layer of defense for any website or web application, and we believe that our flagship Kona Site Defender service is unique in its ability to defend major websites against large scale targeted attacks, while preserving site performance and availability. As a result, web security continues to be our fastest-growing solution line across all of our geographies. At the end of the third quarter, over 700 customers globally are using our security products.","As we continue to evolve our offerings, we believe that leveraging managed security service providers will be increasingly important to our security strategy. I'm very pleased with yesterday's announcement that IBM has chosen to partner with Akamai to integrate Kona Site Defender into its cloud security services portfolio.","At the Customer Conference, we also made an exciting announcement about our plans to work with Cisco on hybrid cloud optimization, an emerging segment within our Performance and Security Solutions. Our hybrid cloud optimization service is designed to provide acceleration and last mile offload for all IP activity and branch offices, including retail stores, hotels and any other remote location. By integrating Akamai technology and software into Cisco routers, we believe that we can help enterprises offload existing network links and improve performance for web and business-critical applications across the land, as well as the Internet.","Many of our network partners were also at the Customer Conference. Carriers have always played a critical role in our platform strategy since our servers reside deep within their networks, enabling us to provide unparalleled performance for our customers, while also reducing costs for our carrier partners and the entire ecosystem. Going forward, we anticipate developing new capabilities within our licensed and managed CDN solutions so that we can work even more closely with our carrier partners. Our long-term goal is to have every major carrier standardize its content delivery, acceleration, offload and security capabilities on Akamai technology.","In this context, I was very pleased to announce our new Open Platform Initiative at this year's Customer Conference. Akamai Open is designed to help customers and partners work with Akamai more easily. The set of programs and APIs that comprise Open is intended to create more opportunities for community collaboration and innovation and provide deeper visibility into and greater control over how enterprises interact with our technology.","In summary, the world around us is rapidly evolving. Everyone and everything is getting connected, creating a remarkable new environment known to some as the Internet of Things, to others as the Internet of Everything and to still others as the Hyperconnected World. Whatever you choose to call it, we are becoming a world in which billions of people, tens of billions of machines and countless petabytes of information are all interlinked and in which instantaneous and intelligent access becomes the expectation.","At Akamai, our objective is to meet this expectation using innovation to deliver on the promise of a Hyperconnected World, improving and transforming online experiences for everyone and everything, wherever and however they are connected.","Thank you for your time today. Now Jim and I will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Gentlemen, your first question today comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe with Morgan Stanley.","Jennifer Swanson Lowe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Maybe just a first question, I wanted to touch on the commentary around the renegotiation of the contract and -- as we think, in the past, we've seen some of these -- have pretty big. I'm thinking 2 years ago, I think, or 3 years ago when there was the 8 of the 10 largest or some big number of the 10 largest that all came up for renewal at once and had a pretty material impact on the growth trajectory in the Media business. It sounds like, in this case, it's really just one customer. So as we think about the magnitude of what potentially we could see as an impact from this renegotiation versus where we saw a number of renegotiations in 1 quarter, is it potentially something of that magnitude or is this going to be a little bit more moderated since its one, not multiple? How should we sort of contextualize it versus some of these transitions that we've seen in the past?","James Benson","No, that's a very good question. You're right. It was Q1 of 2011 that we talked about kind of 8 of our top 10 media customers renewing. I think the way to frame it is, it is our largest media customer. We don't have any 10% revenue customers, but we have kind of disclosed in the past that we have had a 10% receivable customer. And so, you can -- we have a very large customer, this is that large customer that's renewing. This customer has not renewed in a few years, so you can imagine that their pricing is dated from a few years ago. I can't give you any specific details on, obviously, the pricing. We're going into the renegotiation with them now, but that gives you a little contextualize [ph] of roughly kind of how big could the customer be. The customer hasn't repriced in a few years. So the timing of when the renegotiation takes place, whether it's Q4 or Q1, will have an impact on the company's growth rates. Having said that, we talked to you in the past that, that is the nature of the media business. The media business has traffic spikes and traffic dips at times. We go through pricing renegotiations with customers. This happens to be a large customer. We certainly have optimism that the media delivery business has very strong growth opportunities for all the reasons that Tom outlined. So again, this is a common renewal process, which happens to be with a large customer. Hopefully, it gives you a little color around roughly the size, so you can kind of maybe model it without us giving you some of the specifics. But again, it will happen either in Q4 or Q1. We think it's going to happen in Q1, but what we did in our guidance range was make sure that if it did occur in Q4, that we widen the range here on the low end to make sure that we gave you that context as opposed to surprising you later.","Jennifer Swanson Lowe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. That's helpful. And I just wanted to touch base on the repurchases, too. And, Tom, in your remarks, you sort of hit on some of the ambitions to return capital to shareholders and all the good stuff that we like to hear. And I know, in the past, Akamai's repurchase activity has tended to really concentrate around some of the opportunistic troughs in the stock. And usually when the stock's at these levels, the repurchase activity has been a little bit more modest. As we think about sort of the magnitude of $750 million, that's pretty big versus some of the repurchases you've done in the past, is it going to continue to be sort of that same type of opportunistic cadence, or do you see scenarios where you could even really be materially buying back stock with the stock where it is today?","James Benson","So, Jen, it's Jim. I'll take that. So just to clarify, our prior share repurchase programs have really been exclusively focused on offsetting dilution from the company's employee equity programs. It was only once that we asked for an incremental authorization from our board to opportunistically buy back more shares when the stock price was at a pretty low level. So our objective in the past has been annually to have a program that offsets dilution. What we're signaling here is that, given the company's cash balance, given the company's cash flow generation, we believe we have an opportunity now to not only offset dilution, but to also have the flexibility to opportunistically buyback more shares. Obviously, it will depend upon business conditions and market conditions. We continue to have and will have a very active M&A pipeline. So you can imagine the reason we outlined it for 3 years is that if the M&A pipeline is large and we think there's some transactions, obviously, we'll probably moderate the buyback. But if not, you can expect that we're going to continue to operate it as we have in that we're going to have it continue under a 10b5-1 plan that we repurchase quarterly. It will -- and it will continue to have kind of tranches. But you can expect that we're going to do more than offset dilution from equity programs. That's really the objective of this. It's really more the timing of it will depend upon the business and the overall market conditions.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mark Kelleher with D.A. Davidson.","Mark Kelleher - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","I wanted to touch on your partnerships with IBM and Cisco in light of some of the ebbs and flows on the media side. This is on the other side. Can you give us maybe some sizing or some scope or some feel for where those relationships might develop to and the timing? I know you've had some announcements with partners in the past, but can you talk about where these 2 might go?","F. Thomson Leighton","Sure. Both are early stage, but both are very important to us and I think have in the longer-term significant potential. With IBM, that is to help sell our Security Solutions. They are integrated into IBM's managed security service solutions, and it gives us a great channel and it's just in the very early stages, just being announced. And so, it's obviously not material yet, but we hope that it will become so. Cisco is even earlier stage. At our Customer Conference, we demonstrated Akamai software for branch performance optimization. We're working on a Cisco router. That's a demonstration, and we'll be looking forward to work with Cisco this year to get that out as a Cisco product that hopefully would be sold through their channel, and that's what we're working on with Cisco now. So there's no revenue there today. But it's something that we hope, over the next several years, could generate meaningful revenue for both companies.","Mark Kelleher - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","And while I'm asking about some of the partnerships, is the partnership with Orange on track where you expect it to be?","F. Thomson Leighton","Yes, that's going very well and is one of the flagship accounts for us with our carrier strategy. And so, again, we're -- it's in the early stages, but proceeding according to plan and we are very optimistic in the future of that relationship. Not only in France, but they operate in many countries around the world and gives us a chance to get into those markets with Orange as our partner.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of David Hilal with FBR.","Samad Samana - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","This is Samad Samana in for Dave. I wanted to follow up on the hybrid cloud optimization product. Has that become generally available, or could you update us on the progress of the beta and when you expect that to be fully available to the customer base?","F. Thomson Leighton","Yes. So we are on our own in beta with a relatively small number of customers. We've had early trial results from retail stores in major cities around the world. The trial results were -- I would characterize them as very successful, showing both offload and improvements in latency for users in the store. And the informal feedback from the customers has been that the users in the store were very happy with the capabilities of the service. And so, that's at the very early stages, looking very good and that is the technology that now we're embedding into the Cisco router. So it's the same technology. Now as we go forward, our hope is that the Cisco relationship will prove very successful and that, that could be a fabulous go-to-market opportunity for Akamai. Obviously, Cisco, much larger company, much larger presence with their routers in the branch offices on a global basis, and that's a real opportunity for Akamai to leverage that.","Samad Samana - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And then, a question on the security side. So in 1Q, you had about 500 customers that jumped to 650 in 2Q. The jump was a little bit slower in 3Q to 700. I was wondering, are you seeing a little bit of a slowdown there? Is there more competition with Google talking about potentially launching a DDoS application? Could you please talk about that a little bit?","F. Thomson Leighton","I'd say the competition levels are pretty steady. We had very good traction with our Kona Site Defender service, which is our flagship service. We added 40 units during the quarter to get to a total of 180 customers. So very strong growth in the quarter. The Google offers something pretty much unrelated to what we do, and I don't see any really direct competition with the Google offer.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I have 2 questions, if I may, for Jim. The first one, Jim, I'm sure you could anticipate one of the questions that's going to come out of this call, is there another shoe to drop as it relates to customer renegotiations? So I was wondering if you can give us any color on what you see on the horizon and maybe to kind of put some people's minds at ease. The other kind of question tied to that is, is your customer concentration you'd argue increasing or decreasing if you kind of look now versus maybe a year ago? I know you've talked about how there's really no 10% customer, but just trying to get a sense of customer concentration. And then, just -- my second question has to do with the sales ramp. I think, Jim, you talked about, about a year ago, how sales will be a little bit light in 2013 because you really didn't get the sales force in place the way you'd wanted to in 2012. You've added a lot of people this year. Is it fair to assume that we could see an acceleration in sales simply because of the increased distribution you have out on the street now?","James Benson","Sure. So I'll take your first question that's really around kind of renegotiations. You're right that we have pricing renegotiations with our media customers all the time. Certainly, in Q1 of 2011, you had a period where you had 8 of your top 10. This happens to be our largest customer. I would characterize that, obviously, this one will be notable because it is our largest customer. And even though they're not a 10% revenue customer, they are a very large customer. And when you have a very large customer that has not been repriced in a few years, you're going to see an impact on that. I think, beyond that, you're going to -- every quarter, you have large media customers that renew. And so, I would say -- in the horizon, I would say that nothing else is notable. You're always going to have big customers renew. This happens to be a very large customer. As far as concentration, there really hasn't been any concentration change from year-to-year. As far as the mix profile and whether we're more weighted to a handful of customers. That's not the case at all. And then, relative to the sales ramp, we're very pleased with the sales ramp. We're actually a little bit ahead of plan around sales hiring through Q3. You may recall that we came out of Q1 a little bit light. We recovered in Q2. And we're actually a little bit ahead of plan now. But having said that, it takes a while for the sales force to on board, get trained, become productive. And then, there's obviously a lag period between once they become productive for that turning into revenue. So I think, right now, the early indications are that we're on track for the staffing. We've been tracking the productivity of the new reps, and they're tracking according to plan. Admittedly, their productivity is a lot lower than a tenured rep, but we expect that. But they're tracking in line with what we would have thought. And so, our expectation is that we'll end the year, as we said, with the increase in the sales force. And once we get them productive in 2014, we're hoping that kind of in the back half of 2014, that you'll start to see these tenured reps start producing and then have that convert into accelerating revenue growth, in particular, for those solutions that grow with sales reps, which is our Performance and Security Solutions, obviously, not so much our media solutions.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ben Rose with Battle Road Research.","Ben Z. Rose - Battle Road Research Ltd.","Tom, one of your most significant competitors recently had a service outage on the media delivery side, and I'm curious to know whether that's translated into an opportunity for renewed discussions with some of their customers that may have been affected.","F. Thomson Leighton","I think, whenever a competitor does have a major outage, that helps go to our value proposition that we are the most reliable provider out there and we provide the best performance, and it really hits home to a potential customer when that kind of thing happens. This versus any of the others that have taken place, I wouldn't say, make a material difference, any one of them. But the pattern of outages like that do make a difference over time, and I think customers do appreciate Akamai's great track record of reliability.","Ben Z. Rose - Battle Road Research Ltd.","Okay. And then, just a follow-up question. I know that you've also stated a desire to be disciplined on the acquisition side. Specifically, in the security area, are you beginning to see some of the valuations perhaps become a bit more reasonable?","F. Thomson Leighton","Well, we're looking across all of our areas for acquisition. We always are. Last year, we did close 4 deals. The year before, we didn't do any. We haven't done any yet this year. But we're always looking and we're always working on it in all the major areas, from media to acceleration to security and to hybrid cloud optimization and carrier products, where we made an acquisition at the end of last year. So it's something that's a constant and ongoing effort, and we are disciplined about it. We want to make sure that we buy companies that really -- that we can leverage to add value to our customers.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Sonya Banerjee - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is Sonya Banerjee on for Heather. Just thinking about guidance for 4Q, if the customer roll-off puts you at the low end of the range, what are the levers that could drive out performance? And in particular, how are you thinking about software downloads impacting results in the quarter?","James Benson","Good question. So I covered that a little bit in my opening remarks that the way to, kind of, think about the guidance range that I provided is a $412 million to $430 million is -- you're going to be at the lower end of the range if 2 things happen. One, that renegotiation takes place in Q4, but that's not the only reason. The other driver that would get you down to the low end is if the e-commerce season and traffic there is light. So that's what would drive you to the lower end of the range. What'll drive you to the higher end of the range is, one, the renewal doesn't take place -- the renegotiation doesn't take place until Q1. You have a very robust holiday season. And to your point around downloads and traffic, we're expecting that in our -- kind of the higher end of our range, even at the midpoint of our range that we're expecting to have a strong holiday season. We're expecting to have a strong traffic season for downloads and things of that nature. So it's -- the way to really think about it is you'll be at the low end if the e-commerce and media season is a little bit light and the renewal took place. You'll be at a higher end if the media and the e-commerce season is strong and the renewal pushes to Q1.","Sonya Banerjee - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. And then, just separately, thinking about the media business generally, can you speak to the rate of pricing declines at this point? And I know it's still somewhat early, but how are you thinking about pricing dynamics evolving next year?","James Benson","That was a good -- I mean, we -- obviously, we talk -- that's a question that we get asked every quarter. The rate and pace of pricing is very consistent with what we've seen in previous quarters. It's a very competitive environment. We continue to see, kind of, prices go down. But the rate and pace of pricing erosion is no different now than it was, really, for the last couple of years. We've seen a very consistent pricing environment, and we expect to see that going forward.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Richard Fetyko with ABR Investment Strategy.","Richard Fetyko","The e-commerce vertical growth was about 8.5% year-over-year. It's been, sort of, in the high-single digits for the last couple of quarters and I know we had some tough comps year-over-year. But just curious if we should expect that to reaccelerate at some point? I mean, it's well below the historical levels.","James Benson","Yes, that's exclusively driven by our ADS divestment. If you pull out the ADS divestment, it's been growing in the low-20s. So it's been very consistent. We grew in the low-20s last year with ADS. It's growing low-20s without ADS.","Richard Fetyko","All right. And then, if I may, a follow-up on the Aqua Ion, sort of, upgraded product that you rolled out. What kind of take rates are you seeing there?","F. Thomson Leighton","We're having success with Aqua Ion. A lot of great case studies now with the real user measurements that I talked about, showing substantial performance benefits. And not only on a global basis, but also even within regions. So that you might have, say, a customer whose origin is hosted in Tokyo and users are primarily in Tokyo and all within Japan. And really, that's a great opportunity now for us with Ion because we can show performance benefit, whereas DSA had less of a benefit, small geography. Also, Ion has a lot of features now designed to optimize mobile performance on cellular networks where the challenges are really quite large and that becomes important now that more and more of the online transactions are being done over cellular networks. And the real user measurements, which we now can get for cellular users, show excellent performance gains. So we are having good success with Ion, and it's showing substantial performance improvements over the flagship DSA service.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Aaron Schwartz with Jefferies.","Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I asked this question earlier in the year, but maybe I'll ask it again since you're further into the year. Given the strength in the media business year-to-date, how are you looking at potential for early renewals or managing those contracts through the year? It just seems like a lot of your sort of run rate customers may be sort of at their higher end of the way they planned for traffic this year.","James Benson","Yes. I mean, it's really no different. I think, obviously, we're going through the renegotiation with our largest media customer. But there's really nothing notable as far as people burning through their commits early necessarily that, like I said, you see large renewals every quarter. We just happen to be going through one that obviously is notable, and we felt it was appropriate to signal that to you so you can understand what it is. But beyond that, really, the way these contracts get structured is they do tend to get staggered. You're right that if you burn through kind of the traffic commitments that potentially they can renew earlier. But my expectation is that the rate and pace of that is not any different than what it's been in the past.","Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And if I could sneak a second one in. I think you mentioned one of the significant non-recurring deals in the quarter was a setup of an LCDN customer, if I heard you correctly. Could you just walk through the economics of what happens at this point? Does that now sort of flip over to a capacity-based license, or how does that work now that, that customer has set up?","James Benson","Yes. It's actually a managed CDN customer. We have licensed CDN customers and managed CDN customers, one is we're licensing our technology to them. That's not what this was. This is literally a managed CDN, where we're helping them build out kind of a managed CDN network within their network. And the way it works is, at least, in this case, that there were some one-time, call it, setup fees that we received for the hardware and getting all of that installed for them or getting it engaged for them. And the way it'll work beyond this going forward is it will vary by engagement. But the way it works, it's more of, call it, a rev share-based model in some cases where they bring on traffic onto their network and we'll share based on that. In some cases, it's capacity-driven. You'll build out enough capacity for them. And as you build out capacity for them, you'll recognize the revenue over the kind of the, call it, the contract life for which the capacity is being served. So we're early stages on a lot of these. We happen to have a notable one in Q3 that really aided our growth rates, which is why we wanted to call it out to you because it's certainly helped the Performance and Security growth rates to be higher than what we had expected them to be.","Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And if I could, how long was that in process before you sort of completed the build-out to where you took the revenue?","James Benson","Well, we've been having discussions with that customer for a while. But I -- it probably took a couple of months for it get -- once we've concluded the negotiations with them to kind of get it set up. But it's getting the gear installed and then there's actually getting the network set up. And it depends, call it, roughly a quarter from the time you close one of these to maybe turning them on.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Gary (sic) [Gray] Powell with Wells Fargo.","Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So when you cite a potential strong holiday season as an assumption for the high end of revenue guidance in Q4, how would that compare to the holiday season last year?","James Benson","I would say, last year, if you recall, what we said was that it was an okay holiday season. It wasn't a bad holiday season, but it wasn't a","[Audio Gap]","holiday season. So I think consider at the midpoint of our guidance, we're expecting a solid holiday season, which was maybe what we see -- saw maybe more like a couple of years ago. Last year was a decent holiday season. So think of that as maybe the midpoint of our guidance.","Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then, you all continue to make good gains on the gross margin side and I assume that's probably through better co-location and bandwidth cost control. How should we think about margins going forward? And should we expect you to reinvest gains in gross margin back into R&D or sales and marketing or just something else?","James Benson","I think the answer to that is yes. As we've said, we intend to operate the company in the low-40s EBITDA is, call it, the model. We're operating higher than that right now. We're operating higher than that right now not because we're not making the investments in the business in R&D and sales capacity and things of that nature, it's just as we've been making those investments, you've seen a corresponding continued improvement in our management of cost of goods sold and expanding gross margins. You saw it again. We think we can stabilize margins at the levels that we're kind of at. You're going to see maybe, in Q4, they go up, but that's largely because of some seasonal revenue growth. But think of it as kind of high-70s cash gross margins. If we're a little bit higher than that, we do intend to reinvest it back into operating expenses. The way to think about our plans in managing the company is low-40s EBITDA. We're higher than that now, and we're obviously spending and we're spending because we want to increase the pace of innovation and we're spending because we want to increase the sales capacity to drive a re-acceleration in those solutions that kind of grow with sales transactions.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of James Breen with William Blair.","James D. Breen - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just a couple of questions on some of the, sort of, one-off media events. Last quarter, you'd made comments when you gave the guidance for this quarter that where you came in would depend on the timing of this software download. We had no FX [ph] update yesterday. It's the first time it's been free, that it hasn't been paid for. Do you take that in consideration and on the terms of the range you gave for this quarter?","James Benson","Yes. I mean...","James D. Breen - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","You did, okay.","James Benson","But the answer is yes, absolutely.","James D. Breen - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And then, from an order of magnitude standpoint, as you think about renegotiating with this customer, we have another significant sporting event, the Winter Olympics, coming up in the first quarter of next year. From an order of magnitude standpoint, you know what the impact from the Summer Olympics was. In terms of offsetting the potential repricing given sort of the growth rate impact you saw in the third quarter last year, can you just give us a little color on that?","James Benson","Yes. I mean, I'm not going to provide guidance beyond Q4. But just to give you some general color, it is true that you get a benefit from some of these one-time sporting events that happen over a period of time, meaning, like an Olympics. But the benefit you get from that is not -- certainly not nearly enough to offset given the magnitude of the size of this customer. So I don't want to set an expectation that those things will offset this. Now I will say that we saw very strong growth in our media customer base across our social media customers, our video delivery customers, our gaming customers and software downloads. So all the areas that we've mentioned to you in the past, we continue to see very strong growth. So the business is performing very well across all of those areas. And all of those areas, I think, are going to continue to be growth engines for the company. Again, we're going through a renewal. That happens. It's part of the media business, as we told you in the past. But I think the fundamentals of our media business are extremely strong.","James D. Breen - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Great. And then, just one question on traffic -- types of traffic you're seeing. Can you just talk about, on the media side, sort of, the mode of traffic, mobile versus wireline and sort of the different types of customers there?","F. Thomson Leighton","On the media side, most of the bids go to landline or WiFi. Cellular is more congested. On the web experience side or the application acceleration side, about 1\/4 of the transactions now, we're seeing on mobile devices. That's up by about a factor of 10 from a few years ago. And we think, within a couple years, probably be the majority of online transactions will be on mobile devices.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","One question and one follow-up. You mentioned the non-recurring deals, I think, in the Security and Performance, but you alluded to them pretty quick. Can you give us more color there? And I believe this is the second quarter in a row where we've had either a non-recurring or a one-time type of deal. What does the pipeline for those types of deals look like for the fourth quarter?","James Benson","Yes. So you may recall in Q2, what we talked about was that we had a -- just one of the questions, we saw actually a Q2 growth in our Performance and Security Solutions of 19%, which was higher than we had expected. And we wanted to make sure people realized it was not because the new sales capacity was all of a sudden resulting in an acceleration in our revenue growth for that category, because it was driven really by pretty significant upgrade with our IP accelerator solution category. So it was really germane to one particular solution really with kind of one particular customer. What happened in Q3 was we saw the full quarter benefit of that IP accelerator solution. That solution actually is a recurring revenue solution. So that was as expected. But on top of that, as we told you in the past, we will have projects or custom projects with the federal government and the timing of when those complete vary. We happen to have a very large one that completed within Q3. And I just answered the question from someone that asked about this setup of our managed CDN, and we got some benefit from that. Really, if you kind of adjust for, call it, the non-recurring items, that business is growing more in the mid-teens. And our expectation is we can turn that growth around once we get the sales rep capacity up, ramped and productive. But that's not going to take place until 2014 some time.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then, the follow-up would just be on Europe. I think, in the prepared remarks, you talked about some of the macro squishiness. We're starting to see some of the PMI data out of Continental Europe starting to show some improvement. Wondering if that may be a leading indicator and you expect some improvement here in the fourth quarter and into 2014. Or do you think it's too soon to tell?","James Benson","I think it's too soon to tell. I think it's fair to say that our business, because it's a recurring revenue business, is more of lagging. So our -- the impact to Akamai for macroeconomic headwinds is kind of the longer effect for Akamai, whereas companies that are either selling licenses or hardware, they see an immediate impact from those macroeconomic headwinds. But I think for companies like us that are in a recurring revenue model, we see the impact of that much later. And I'd say that's what you're seeing now. So I'm not -- I think it's -- I don't think you're going to see a turnaround in our EMEA markets any time soon, meaning, in the next quarter or so that -- having said that, we still think there's a significant opportunity for the company because we're not nearly penetrated in those markets, but those markets right now are going through some pretty significant times, in particular, the southern markets of Europe. So hopefully, that provides a little bit of color.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ed Maguire with CLSA.","Edward Maguire - CLSA Limited, Research Division","I was wondering if you could comment on how the ramp of productivity of your sales hires that began in mid-2012 is tracking and if you're comfortable that each cohort is going to be delivering as you've been expecting.","James Benson","Yes. Good question. So, yes, we track every, we call them, tenure classes. We track every class, and we track their progress based on kind of a benchmark which we set for which is previous reps on average what they've done in their different tenures. And I'd say, on the whole, I think the classes are doing relatively well. And to our expectations, you're obviously going to have 1 quarter to the next that one class does really well and then the next quarter maybe not so well. But I'd say they're tracking to our expectations in general.","Edward Maguire - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Great. And just 1 follow-up, and this is really more -- is concerns for external sales, whether some of the disclosures around the NSA revelations have had any impact on the discussions that you have with your international customers?","F. Thomson Leighton","Yes, it has. There is concern outside of North America that a U.S. company would be prone to giving over-sensitive information to the U.S. government as a result of the PRISM disclosures. Fortunately, for us, most of that activity is stuff that doesn't really relate to our business. So it has come up, but we're not really in the focus of that storm. Probably, Germany is a place where it's been most a topic of conversation. So I don't anticipate major impact there to our business just because we're an American company. We're really not in the sweet spot of that. We don't have the data that was PRISM-like in terms of the press releases there.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Phil Winslow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Harris Heyer","This is Harry Heyer for Phil Winslow. I think you started to touch on bandwidth and co-location costs, but you didn't really get into any sort of detail in terms of pricing trends there versus the previous quarter. I was hoping you might be able to touch on that.","James Benson","Sure. There's really been no change notably. We continue to manage our network costs very effectively. I think we've talked to you in the past that, obviously, the 2 big drivers of our network costs are bandwidth costs and co-location costs. And our network and engineering teams have done a fantastic job of kind of continuing to put platform efficiency initiatives in place that make us a more efficient consumer of bandwidth and a more efficient consumer really of co-location costs. And so, the pricing environment there really hasn't changed in either one of them. It's really more been driven by our execution from our internal teams.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jeff Van Rhee with Craig-Hallum.","Jeffrey Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Just 2 brief questions. First, just maybe you could dial it in a little better on the sales side in terms of 2 basics: What is sales headcount now? And then, if you could dial it in a little more precisely as to the ramp, I know you've touched on it sort of at a high level but ramp to productivity over some sense of time so we can dial in a little closer.","James Benson","Yes. So we ended Q4 of last year with about 215, kind of, direct quota-carrying sales reps, and we ended Q3 at about 300. So -- and we've talked about the fact that we intended to end the year with roughly 100 sales reps added. So that's kind of where we're at on the hiring. Obviously, that hiring has taken place throughout the year, and the way it works, it probably takes 5 quarters for a sales rep to get fully productive. And as you can imagine, that ramps over time. So the question that was asked previously around how people are doing to the various cohort classes, we still have a pretty -- the new sales reps that we have on board are still pretty junior as far as their tenure. They're obviously seasoned sales reps, but they're junior as far as their tenure within Akamai as far as training. So our expectation is you'll start to see the benefit from them becoming productive sometime in 2014.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Kevin Sazar [ph] with Macquarie.","Unknown Analyst","I wondered if you could talk a little bit about the hybrid cloud products and potential revenue impact in 2014. Are these going to -- products going to be available in time to have a meaningful contribution next year, or should we really think about them as more 2015 opportunities?","F. Thomson Leighton","Yes, I think you should think about that, in terms of meaningful revenue contribution, as 2015. We will be in the market next year with the hybrid cloud optimization, but it's very early stage. You shouldn't be thinking about meaningful amounts of revenue then.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Tim Horan with Oppenheimer.","Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","You've rolled out a lot of upgraded products over the last 12 months, and I think you were going to charge, kind of, a premium for the products. Can you discuss whether you've been able to do that or not and maybe just a little bit more color on the uptake?","F. Thomson Leighton","Yes, we do get a good premium when customers upgrade from DSA to Ion. That's our app acceleration product. We also get a good premiums and higher ARPUs when selling Kona Site Defender, which is our flagship security product that we launched early last year. So when we do bring out the premium products, we are seeing uplift, which is good.","Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And just last, on the media customer, it sounds like it was a 3-year-or-so contract. Are these contracts -- do you usually price them down once and that's a set price for 3 years, or do they have kind of quarterly or annual step-downs?","James Benson","Yes. I mean, they vary. You can't generalize them to be the same, but you can -- think of it as they have volumes. And then based on volumes, they have different pricing tiers. And based on those volumes, they move -- you push more volume, you get a lower price. And so, you basically develop a bunch of tiers and throughout. So it isn't as if this customer has not had favorable pricing over time because -- but the pricing was based on the pricing table that was set up several years ago. But they -- certainly, the more volume they push, the better price they get.","Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And have you -- have many of the media contracts come due in the last 12 months or 18 months?","James Benson","I mean, as I said before, they come due every month, every quarter. It's -- you're just going through a very notable one here because it's our largest customer. And so, it was appropriate for us to signal that to you.","Operator","And there are no further questions at the queue at this time. So I'd like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks they'd like to make.","F. Thomson Leighton","Go, Red Sox. Thanks very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the presentation today. Thank you so much for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Earnings Conference Call. My name is Philip, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.","Tom Barth","Well, thank you, and good afternoon and thank you for joining Akamai's first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Benson, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on May 1, 2014. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances.","As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations website at akamai.com.","And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom.","F. Thomson Leighton","Thanks, Tom, and thank you, all, for joining us today. Q1 was another excellent quarter and a great start to the year for Akamai, with revenues and earnings both exceeding the high end of our guidance range.","Q1 revenue was $454 million. That's up 23% over Q1 of 2013. Our excellent performance was driven by continued strong traction across all of our major product lines and geographies, with especially strong growth for our security products. The overachievement compared to guidance was driven by greater-than-expected traffic for our media delivery solutions.","Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $105 million or $0.58 per diluted share, which is up 14% over Q1 of 2013. Our overachievement on the bottom line was primarily driven by the better-than-expected revenue.","As most of you know, we completed 2 major transactions during the first quarter. First, we closed the Prolexic acquisition on February 18. And then 2 days later, we raised $690 million through our convertible debt offering, further strengthening our balance sheet for additional strategic flexibility.","I'll be back in a few minutes to talk more about our security products and some of the other achievements from the first quarter. But first, let me turn the call over to Jim to review our financial results in detail and to provide the outlook for Q2. Jim?","James Benson","Thank you, Tom. As Tom just highlighted, Q1 was another strong quarter for Akamai on both top and bottom lines. As I walk through the details of our Q1 financial results, I'll provide you with the consolidated numbers that include roughly 6 weeks of the Prolexic acquisition, and where appropriate, I'll also provided you with Akamai's results for Q1 excluding Prolexic.","As Tom outlined, Q1 revenue came in above our guidance range at $454 million, up 23% year-over-year with strong growth across the business. Prolexic accounted for approximately $7 million in revenue for the quarter. Excluding the impact of Prolexic and also adjusting for the ADS divestment and foreign exchange headwinds, revenue was still up 23% year-over-year. Revenue growth was strong across every solution category, but the overachievement was primarily driven by better-than-expected traffic growth in our media business.","Turning specifically to our media delivery solutions. Revenue was $215 million in the quarter, up 19% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. We are very pleased with the growth in media coming off a very strong fourth quarter and absorbing the impact of new pricing terms for our largest media customer that became effective on January 1.","Traffic and revenue growth accelerated across most of the customer base, with particularly strong growth within our software download and gaming customers, driven by unplanned patches and gaming releases. Additionally, there were several large live events in the quarter that also had some modest contributions to the revenue overachievement. And while events like the Winter Games in Sochi and the NCAA Basketball Championships do not materially move the needle on revenue within the quarter, they do highlight our unique ability to deliver high-quality video over the Internet at scale.","Turning now to our performance in Security Solutions. Revenue was $198 million in the quarter, up 26% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially. Excluding the impact of Prolexic, revenue was up 22% year-over-year and roughly flat sequentially.","Within this solution category, we saw solid growth in our Web Experience Solutions, and as Tom mentioned, we saw a nice uptick in growth rates in our Web security solutions. Net signings were particularly strong for both our Kona and Prolexic security offerings, an important proof point of early traction with our Prolexic integration.","Finally, revenue from our services and support solutions was $41 million in the quarter, up 48% year-over-year and up 12% sequentially. We continued to see solid traction in service attachment rates across all of our solutions, and we saw an uptick in event-driven revenues as customers relied on Akamai service professionals to help them execute the notable live media events I mentioned earlier.","Turning now to a review by geography. Effective this quarter, we revised our method for splitting out U.S. and international revenues. Previously, revenues were split based on the invoicing location. Starting in Q1, revenues are split based on the location in which the sale originates. Prior period amounts have been recast under this new method, and the historic growth rate trends are very similar under both methods and a reconciliation of the 2 methods for fiscal years 2012 and 2013 can be found under the Quarterly Earnings Release section of our Akamai website.","Sales in our international markets represented 28% of total revenue in Q1, flat from the prior year and up 1 point from the prior quarter. International revenue grew 24% year-over-year and 7% sequentially, with currency fluctuations having a negative impact on revenue of approximately $2 million on a year-over-year basis and negligible impact on a sequential basis. Excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, international revenue grew 26% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. We continued to see strong growth in our Asia Pacific geography, and we were very pleased with the improved performance in our EMEA markets.","Revenue from our U.S. market grew 23% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Our U.S. market continued to perform very well for us and have particularly strong growth in our large strategic accounts. And finally, revenue through resellers represented 24% of total revenue in Q1, up 4 points from the prior year and up 3 points from the prior quarter. This improvement was primarily due to traction with our carrier partners, as well as contributions from Prolexic's strong channel relationships.","Moving on to costs. As expected, our cash gross margin was 78%, flat with the prior quarter and up 2 points from the same period last year. As we've demonstrated over the past couple of years, we continued to execute well on our management of cost of goods sold. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 69%, flat with the prior quarter and up 2 points from the same period last year. GAAP operating expenses were $193 million in the quarter.","These GAAP results include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges and acquisition-related charges. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $152 million, up slightly from Q4 2013 levels and at the low end of our expectations due to some planned hiring that shifted into the second quarter.","Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $204 million. That's up 6% from Q4 levels and up 23% from the same period last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 45%, up 1 point from Q4 levels and consistent with Q1 of last year. This result exceeded our expectations coming into the quarter, primarily due to our revenue overachievement and also from lower OpEx related to hiring that shifted into Q2.","For the first quarter, total depreciation and amortization was $54 million, which included $38 million of network-related depreciation, $8 million of G&A depreciation and $7 million of amortization of intangible assets. Interest income for the first quarter was roughly $2 million, consistent with the prior quarter. Noncash interest expense related to our convertible debt was $2 million. This noncash expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results.","Moving on to earnings. GAAP net income for the quarter was $73 million or $0.40 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $105 million for the quarter or $0.58 of earnings per diluted share and coming in $0.04 above the high end of our guidance range due to the revenue overachievement and hiring shifts I highlighted earlier.","For the quarter, total taxes included in our GAAP earnings were $47 million, based on a tax rate of 39%. This rate is up roughly 9 points year-over-year, reflecting the expiration of the R&D tax credit and a nonrecurring deferred income tax charge related to our foreign operations. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $55 million, based on a tax rate of 34% and in line with our guidance. Finally, our weighted average diluted share count for the first quarter was 182 million shares.","Now I'll review some balance sheet items. Days sales outstanding for the first quarter was 58 days, up 3 days from the last quarter and up 1 day from Q1 of 2013. Capital expenditures in Q1, excluding equity compensation, were $84 million, roughly in line with our expectations if you include Prolexic's CapEx. As a reminder, our CapEx number includes network investments as well as capitalized software development, global facility build-outs and IT-related expenditures. Cash generation continue to be solid, with cash from operations in the first quarter of $89 million.","During the quarter, we spent approximately $116 million on share repurchases, buying back about 2 million shares at an average price of just under $59. As of Q1 end, we had $586 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. We had roughly $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in the balance sheet at the end of the quarter. This includes approximately $655 million from the net proceeds of our convertible debt offering in February.","As we've discussed in the past, we believe our strong balance sheet and cash position are important competitive differentiators that provide financial flexibility necessary to make the best investments at the most opportune times. As always, our overall aim is to deploy our capital to achieve favorable returns for our shareholders in a manner we believe is in the best long-term interest of the company and our shareholders. Our Prolexic acquisition is a great example of how we've used the strength of our balance sheet to invest for future growth.","In summary, we are very pleased with how the business performed in Q1. We continue to execute well, deliver strong revenue growth, manage network cost effectively and make the necessary investments that we believe will build a foundation for sustained, long-term growth. As I have shared previously, we expect the Prolexic acquisition to be slightly dilutive to our earnings over the next 4 quarters, as expenses will exceed revenues until we absorb and scale the business within Akamai. Operationally, we will be integrating Prolexic into our core security business, and going forward, we will not be reporting on them separately.","Looking ahead to Q2, we are expecting another strong quarter, with revenue in the range of $464 million to $478 million. This guidance includes a full quarter of Prolexic revenue. As a reminder, Prolexic revenue run rate exiting Q1 was approximately $5 million per month. At current spot rates, foreign exchange is expected to have a positive impact of roughly $2 million compared to Q1 and $3 million compared to Q2 of last year. We expect cash gross margins of 77% to 78% and GAAP gross margins of 68% to 69%, which is flat to down about 1 point from Q1 levels as we absorb the Prolexic acquisition and increase network investments to support expected traffic growth.","Q2 non-GAAP cash operating expenses are projected to be $166 million to $170 million, up from Q1 levels as the business absorbs a full quarter of Prolexic spend as we continue to further ramp investments in go-to-market and R&D resources and as we add facilities and infrastructure costs to support headcount growth globally. Factoring in the above, we anticipate Q2 EBITDA margins of 42% to 43%, down 2 to 3 points from Q1 levels.","As I've been messaging in prior calls, we are planning to operate the company in the low 40s EBITDA range in the near term. To be more specific, we expect EBITDA margins between 40% and 42% in the back half of the year, as we fully integrate Prolexic and as we continue to ramp up the necessary investments that we expect will help drive Akamai's growth and scale beyond 2014. Whether we land at the high end or low end of this range will be heavily dependent on revenue volumes. I would also add, and as I shared at the March Investor Summit, the long-term EBITDA model for the company remains at 40% to 45%.","With this revenue and spending configuration, we expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.53 to $0.57. This EPS guidance assume taxes of $50 million to $55 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of 34%. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of roughly 182 million shares.","On CapEx, we expect to spend approximately $90 million to $95 million in the quarter, excluding equity compensation. This is an uptick in spending due to the addition of several large facility and IT investments focused on scaling our infrastructure, as well as costs associated with expanding the Prolexic network footprint. Taking into account these important investment areas, which will continue throughout 2014, we expect full year CapEx as a percent of revenue to be slightly above our long-term model for the year.","In closing, we accomplished a great deal in Q1 and remain confident in our ability to execute on our plans for the long term.","Now let me turn the call back over to Tom. Tom?","F. Thomson Leighton","Thanks, Jim. It's great to see Akamai get off to such a strong start for the year, and I'm very optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead.","I would like to thank all of you who joined us for our Investor Summit last month, whether you were here with us in person or you tuned in for the webcast, you heard me talk about the 4 grand challenges that we're focused on solving for our customers: delivering video over the Internet with unparalleled quality and scale and at affordable price points; making websites and apps have near-instant performance even on congested cellular networks; protecting websites and enterprises from the many attackers that are trying to take them offline, corrupt their content or steal their confidential information; and making branch office connectivity for major enterprises be much faster and more affordable.","I want to focus my remarks today on the challenges relating to video and security, both of which contributed to our success in Q1. As many of you know, the amount of video being consumed online has been rapidly increasing. For example, on February 2, we delivered the Super Bowl to 5.5 million online viewers, making it one of the most-watched live sporting events ever on the Internet. A few days later, Akamai provided the video streaming, website acceleration and web security services for 25 broadcasters of NBC's online coverage of the Winter Games in Sochi. This was the first time -- first Olympic Games where all of the competitions were streamed live.","In March, we delivered 21 million live video streams for March Madness. And just a few weeks ago, we helped IBM deliver the Masters Golf Tournament to 1.7 million viewers, with advanced functionality such as multiple camera views, live stream packaging and audience analytics.","I had the opportunity to meet with several of our large media customers last month at the NAB show in Las Vegas, and the positive feedback I received was a powerful validation of our success in delivering quality video at scale. I was especially pleased to hear one major media executive use the word flawless when describing his experience with our team.","People often underestimate just how challenging it really is to deliver high-quality video over the Internet at scale. Delivering great quality video to large audiences presents huge technical and financial hurdles for both content owners and service providers. This is an area where Akamai has repeatedly proven its capabilities while others have struggled. In fact, some of you may have seen recent news stories citing concerns about the Internet's ability to scale following the failures of some other smaller media events handled by our competitors.","Internet scalability is a very important issue. Akamai has always believed that if you try to deliver large volumes of video from a few data centers or through peering points, you were going to have capacity problems that will result in poor performance or failures. That is why our approach has always been different. We deliver video from servers in thousands of locations that are close to end users where there is far greater capacity and much lower latency, and that has been a key reason why Akamai has succeeded where others have failed.","As Jim mentioned, Akamai does not generate large amounts of revenue for delivering the live events that I have referenced. I have called out these events today because they demonstrate our unique capabilities to deliver high-quality video at scale, and these capabilities are responsible for a large portion of Akamai's revenue and growth.","It is also worth noting that an increasing portion of the revenue that we receive from media events is for other services, like website acceleration and web security. In fact, we believe that a key reason that you didn't see headlines about any of these websites being attacked is because they were protected by Akamai. The lack of headlines doesn't mean that the attackers didn't try to corrupt the sites or to take them offline. All high-profile events are prime targets. It's just that the attackers were thwarted by our security protection.","In general, cyber attacks are continuing to grow rapidly in terms of their frequency, scale and sophistication, with many attacks resulting in significant economic or reputational damage to enterprises, governments and end users. The enormous volume of many attacks can easily overwhelm the defenses traditionally deployed by major enterprises. That's because the attacker can induce large numbers of well-connected devices to flood a target with traffic, but the enterprise typically cannot amass the infrastructure needed to absorb or filter the attack using traditional defenses.","That's where Akamai's unique approach makes a big difference. Our servers are in thousands of locations at the edge of the Internet where there's plenty of capacity. By leveraging our massively distributed platform as an outer layer of defense to absorb large-scale attacks and to filter out malicious application layer exploits, we have been able to protect major enterprises in situations where their traditional approaches have failed.","Moreover, Akamai has integrated our performance capabilities into our security solutions, which means that our defensive shield can be applied without hurting performance. As a result, Akamai Security Solutions can be deployed in a proactive, always-on manner, which is an important advantage for Akamai in the security arena. Performance degradation is a challenge with traditional security products, and so they are often only turned on after the damage from the attack has occurred. Needless to say, that is often too late for the enterprise.","Because of our unique abilities to defend websites and applications, security is our fastest-growing product segment. At the end of the first quarter, and not counting Prolexic, 867 customers were using our security products including over 100 leading banks, and over 260 customers had purchased our flagship Kona Site Defender solution. Including Prolexic, we had over 1,250 customers using one or more of our security products at the end of Q1.","We are now in the process of integrating Prolexic capabilities with Kona Site Defender to form a combined security services stack. We are also investing to extend Prolexic's managed security services to include Kona. This will enable us to provide customers with a comprehensive portfolio of security solutions designed to defend an enterprise's web and IT infrastructure against application layer, network layer and data center attacks delivered via the Internet.","In closing, Q1 was a fantastic start to the year. The fundamentals across our business are strong, and we are continuing to drive innovation across all of our solution lines to help solve the major challenges our customers face in delivering a fast, reliable and secure web experience on any device anywhere.","Thank you for your time today. Now Jim and I will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to go into 2 subjects. The first one is the media delivery. You mentioned some of the large events. How -- as well as some of the software patches in gaming. How should we think about that flow or that volume as we look out, not only for the June quarter that you've given us guidance, but for the back half of the year? Is there additional catalysts and things that you already see that can continue that momentum?","James Benson","Sure. So I'll take that. So you're right. We had a very strong quarter in Q1, and we talked about this in the past that obviously, there's variability in our media business due to traffic. And it can be variable due to large software downloads, gaming releases that happened in one quarter and maybe don't happen in the next. We happen to have a very strong quarter pretty much across the board in media. We did well in social media. We did well in video. We did well in software download and gaming. So pretty much all the areas that I've talked about in the past. But what was notable in Q1 was we had some large, unplanned software downloads that benefited the quarter and which is really what drove us to be above our guidance, as well as some gaming releases. So it was a very strong software download and gaming quarter. It's tough to say going forward. I think what happened is that I think software downloads really are a little bit more consistent than they've been in the past. But when you have large ones like the ones that occurred, they do cause a spike in traffic and revenue in the quarter. And you're going to see those -- are you going to see them next quarter? Are you going to see them in the back half of the year? I'm sure we will, but there's a level of variability to them that I just really can't call out specifically. I can tell you that within my guidance range for the second quarter, certainly at the midpoint, we're expecting to have a very good media quarter again in Q2 going towards kind of the low end of the range, maybe traffic decelerates going towards the high end of the range, maybe traffic accelerates a little bit more. So really the variable probably for Q2 whether we're going to be at the high or the low end is going to be what happens in media. Does that help?","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then the security and performance, you mentioned the good signings in the quarter. How much of that is just the interest level in customers in the product portfolio that you've got versus can you talk to us about the topic we've talked many times which is the productivity of the sales hires that you've added over the last year?","James Benson","Yes, so I'll kind of bifurcate the 2. So we had a very, very strong security signings quarter. And as I mentioned kind of in my opening comments, they were strong across our Kona Security Solutions and our new Prolexic security solution. So we were quite pleased that we're starting to get some traction with our sales organization being more comfortable selling security. I think also the addition of the Prolexic sales resources have certainly helped that. So again, a very strong signings quarter for security. As far as productivity, we continue to add more sales reps in the quarter as we've talked about. I'm not going to talk about how many we're going to add for the year, other than I -- as I mentioned in the last call, that we're probably going to add a similar magnitude of people this year as we did last year. And largely speaking, kind of the productivity of the sales reps by cohort class are performing pretty well. There's going to be some quarters where they perform better than others. But I'd say on average, we're doing well on productivity.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe with Morgan Stanley.","Jennifer Swanson Lowe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. I just wanted to dig in sort of the strength in security in the quarter, and obviously there was at least one very high-profile security threat this quarter. Does that impact the demand for your security solutions at all? Is it -- do you start to see customers sort of scrambling to address the very high-profile threat and that has an impact in Q1 or in your pipelines going forward? Or is it a little smoother than that? And I'm just sort of curious if that had any accelerating effect on your security business at all.","F. Thomson Leighton","By the threat, do you mean the heartbleed bug?","Jennifer Swanson Lowe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes.","F. Thomson Leighton","Yes, I think the heartbleed situation shows why you want to have your secure communications and your commerce sites and banking traffic with Akamai. If you're an Akamai customer, your communication, that bug would've been patched 3 days before it was publicly released. And so when it was released, if people try to exploit it then, if you're on Akamai, you're fine. If you were trying to do it yourself or using a lot of our competitors, you would've been exposed at that time. Now I don't think that caused necessarily a lot of people to run and sign up with Akamai. But it's, again, another validation of why you want your HTTPS or your secure traffic on the Akamai platform.","Jennifer Swanson Lowe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And Jim, I just wanted to dig in to the margin guidance a little bit around the second half of the year being slightly lower than even Q2, which fully has the Prolexic business integrated in. And as we think about those expenditures, you've already kind of talked about the sales hiring for the year. Is that -- where are those investments going to be? Are they on the product side? On the sales side? How should we think about what's going to be incremental in the second half versus purely just getting the Prolexic cost layered into the business, which we should see in Q2?","James Benson","Sure. So you're -- certainly for Q2, Q2 was much more of a -- you have a full quarter now of Prolexic. But as we talked about in the past, put Prolexic aside for a moment, we've been making investments in the company. We will add more sales reps in Q2 and the back half of the year. We're going to add more go-to-market support capacity for those sales reps. We're going to continue to add more service professionals. You see that we have a very healthy services business. So we'll continue to add more services professionals. We're going to continue to add more R&D resources to really accelerate kind of R&D innovation. And then in addition to that, there are some infrastructure costs that we're building out. So we are adding cost because we're building out more facilities as we add more headcount. And as we add more headcount, we have to build out more IT-related spending. So it's in all those outlined areas. And the reason I wanted to be quite specific about the back half of the year is it -- the company's going to continue to make these investments. And I've been talking in the past about low 40s EBITDA, and I felt it was probably appropriate to be a little bit more specific for you. And obviously, where you land at the low or the high end of that will be how strong revenue is in the back half. And as you know, in Q3, Q3 is notably in the summer, seasonally softer as far as revenue because it's not as much viewing of content on the Internet. And so seasonally, from Q2 to Q3, revenue doesn't grow as much. And if we are continuing to make the investments that I mentioned and revenue doesn't grow as much, it'll put pressure on EBITDA in the short term. But I want to assure you that we're still planning and committed to operating within the guidepost that I mentioned around 40% to 45% EBITDA. And there'll be periods where you're at the low end, and there'll be periods where you're at the high end. I think we're just going through a period of investment right now that we believe the company will be able to scale better going forward and have more sustainable long-term revenue growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So obviously a very strong quarter and a very strong guide. Some of the upside in 2Q, as you said, came from gaming, some of the -- and software downloads you said, some of which was -- some of which is unanticipated. But the 2Q guidance is very robust also. So what gives you -- and the kind of similar sequential growth rate. So what gives you the visibility, if you had the unanticipated step in 1Q, what gives you the visibility into 2Q to have a similar seasonal guide and not say, hey, this was a little bit of a onetime -- a little bit of a one-timer.","James Benson","Yes, no, it's a good question. I mean, I think within kind of a 3-month window that especially with our large customers, you usually have a pretty good idea of what they're going to do. You are right. There were times where even though you don't understand, that they're going to have an unplanned patch. So some of that is really a function of we have very good communication with our customers on what they're going to do. But sometimes, these patches are patches that they are not even planning on that takes place. You also got to remember that Q1 to Q2, we're going to have a full quarter of Prolexic. So we had $7 million of Prolexic in Q1. You'll obviously get now 7 more weeks of Prolexic since we only had 6 weeks in Q1. So some of it's Prolexic. But even if you adjust for Prolexic, you're right, it is still a strong guide, and I think it reflects what we believe is continued strength in the business. And in particular, as I mentioned in my comments that I believe it's going to be more the media side that's going to be the driver of whether we'll be -- we're at the high end or the low end. And I just think it's important that we provide you guys a range of where we think we're going to be and what the driver of that is.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So again, the visibility into next quarter, you said you have a feel in what your customers can do. Is that, again, on the software downloading and gaming side?","James Benson","It's pretty much across the board. It's across our video delivery customers. It's across our download customers, gaming customers, social media customers. So it's pretty much across the board. Specifically, with your large customers, as we talked about, that this has been several quarters in a row where we had particularly strong growth across our large strategic accounts. And large strategic accounts can move the needle in a quarter when their business starts to pick up, or there is a large gaming release or there is a large software release. So I'm pretty confident in the range that I provided. And as I said, I think at the midpoint, it's another strong quarter. At the high end, it means that the traffic growth continues to accelerate even beyond what we saw in Q1 and maybe you have some more unplanned patches and things of that nature. And at the low end, it says things are still strong but maybe not as strong as what we saw in Q1.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Jim, can I squeeze one more in? Can you -- obviously you're giving us essentially EBITDA guide into the back half of the year, which we really appreciate. But can you talk a little bit about, if you could, about depreciation? Depreciation came in a little above where we were looking for this quarter, granted it's just our model, but then you had brought on a new company. Anything to help us out there in terms of what depreciation looks like in the back half or 2Q and into the back half?","James Benson","Yes, I'm not going to guide on depreciation specifically, but I think maybe a little bit of it, Michael, is that as you know, we changed our depreciation methodology last year, in Q1 of last year, which effectively lengthened the depreciable life of our network assets from 3 years to 4 years. And we got a benefit, as we mentioned, all last year of assets that were on our books as of the end of 2012. And so there's a little bit of a compare headwind for us when you look at 2014. But you -- I think the way to think about it is that we had a pretty -- even though we came in where we thought, CapEx was kind of in the, call it, the $84 million range in Q1. We said $90 million to kind of $95 million in Q2. So you're seeing that -- now admittedly, when you double-click on that CapEx, actually the network CapEx, with the exception of Prolexic, is actually pretty flat as a percent of revenue. It's probably around 8% of revenue, which is roughly what we've been operating at. So really where we're seeing more CapEx, which probably leads to less depreciation is when you're doing leasehold improvements and IT buildout because that gets depreciated over a longer life. But I think what we try to do is give you enough information for Q2 that you can almost back into what the depreciation guidance is, because I gave you EBITDA, I gave you EPS, I gave you the tax rate. You can kind of assume what interest income is going to be because it's roughly what it's been in the past and you can kind of back into depreciation. So I think that will at least help you understand maybe what depreciation is going to be for Q2, so it will help you build your model for Q3 and Q4.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs.","Justin Rowley - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","It's just Justin on for Heather. Nice quarter. I think a question you get a lot from investors is where does Akamai fit in the conversation about net neutrality. So if we just assume that ISPs are indeed going to be allowed to get preferential treatment from certain customers, presumably at higher cost, can you guys help us frame where Akamai shakes out in this? And maybe a scenario where you could see yourselves benefiting and then if there's any negative consequences, that would be helpful.","F. Thomson Leighton","Yes, there's, as you know, a lot of discussion going on in Washington and in other countries, and it's not yet clear what laws are going to get passed and if and how the rules will be changed. But Akamai is in a very good position here. We work closely with both sides, the content folks and the carriers and both of our customers and partners. And really, if you want to think of Akamai as providing the technology that enables the performance, and it enables high-quality video at scale. And that we do all this in a way that reduces cost for the ecosystem. So really, however the rules shake out, there is going to be a need for what we do, and we're closely tied to both sides and I think in a very good position to supply the technology that's going to be needed to have a better Internet, to have a video quality at scale and of course, to have security at affordable price points. So I think -- I like where Akamai sits in the ecosystem as this debate unfolds.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Schwartz with Jefferies.","Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I had a question on the services business. You talked about the strong attach rate again and certainly, the trend line there as just a percent of total continues to move higher. I guess the question I have is a lot of the sales hiring you've made here recently seem to be focused on more \"enterprise-type products\" that may require even further services, and that business is at a lower margin. So could you just talk about maybe where you think that business goes as a percent of total over time and just sort of how you manage the margin of that business over that period of time as well?","James Benson","Yes, you're right. Certainly, the sales reps that we're adding, and as we've talked about for our performance in Security Solutions, which is effectively an enterprise sell, that most, if not all, of those customers when they're buying those offers, and even our media solutions, that they are interested in buying kind of -- attaching services. And just to be clear, our services are product enablement focused. So we're not in the services business that is providing kind of consulting and support. This is a product enablement services business. But I think what you've seen is that it wasn't that many years ago where effectively, the services that -- we were not monetizing services. We've put together packages for services, and we found huge interest from our customers who want to get more expertise from our service professionals and helping them leverage how they use the Internet and how they use our solutions. So some of it is that we have very good traction, and you're right. I talked about good attach rates with services. I had mentioned this quarter as well that these large events that I mentioned, the media events that take place over kind of a longer period of time, many customers rely on our service professionals to help deliver those events for them. So what you saw in Q1 was kind of some event-driven services revenue. But you are right that I think 2 years ago, services revenue was about 7% of our revenue. Last year, services revenue was 8% of our revenue. If you look at just Q1, I think that's about 9%. It's probably going to be somewhere, call it, in the 9% to 10% range. I would say we're not throttling back services. If it's leading to more ability for customers that want to buy more of our performance products, buy more of our security products, buy more of our media products, which we've actually proven that it does, we'll continue to grow the services business. You are right. I provided a model for you guys that it is a lower gross margin and EBITDA model, but it's still pretty attractive gross margin and EBITDA model. So I think the way you have to look at the company is we are a blend of a media business. We are blend of kind of these Infrastructure as a Service\/SaaS business in performance and security, and we have a services component. And when you look at that, the company has a pretty attractive overall model. And so I don't want you to think that we're throttling services. But you can kind of think of it as we'll continue to grow it in line with as long as it continues to be product enablement-oriented and drive more stickiness of our solutions, that's really the strategy that we have with that part of the portfolio.","Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And just a quick follow-up, if I could. If that sort of stabilizes, just for conversation's sake, if that stabilizes at roughly 10% of the mix, is the cost sort of what it is? Or does -- are there opportunities for you to possibly raise the margin within services?","James Benson","I mean, it's obviously -- we're working every day and not just our network costs and trying to drive network cost down. We do the same thing in the services business. There's a lot of work of the services team is doing to try to drive down the cost of delivering service. Some of that is tools. Some of that is making it more self-serviceable. So there's a bunch of things we're doing that are focused on margins and services, just like we're focusing on margins in media and focusing on margins in our performance and security solutions.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Just a few. So first off, I just wanted to get an update on where we are in the Ion and Alta upgrade opportunity. I know that that's -- the last few quarters had been a driver. I'm just trying to get a sense of where we are in that opportunity. The second thing is, Jim, just to clarify your comments around CapEx. You said CapEx will be at the higher end of the long-term range. I think that range is now 14% to 16%. But if I look back really the last 3 or 4 years, you've been above 16%. So you're effectively just calling out that, that same trend that we've really been seeing for a while now is simply going to sustain. Or is it actually going to go even higher than, call it, 16%, 16.5% or so where we've been? And then just point of clarification as well on servers, you added just 2,065 servers in the quarter. Just going through my model, last time it was low was the second quarter of 2009. Just wonder if there's anything to call out there.","F. Thomson Leighton","Yes, in terms of the upgrade opportunity for Ion and Alta, I would say we're in the early stages. The Ion product provides excellent performance gains, particularly in the most challenging environments, countries that are relatively small and for example, cellular environments, which are challenged in terms of congestion and latency. And we're seeing upsell when customers upgrade from DSA to Ion, which is great. We are also combining it with a protect and a perform offer. So it can go out there with -- and sell it with Kona, and that's been successful. So we're in the early stages and a long way to go in terms of realizing benefit from Ion and Alta.","James Benson","Yes, and I'll take the CapEx question. So I think we need to clarify, so we've been operating at about 16% of revenue for the last couple of years, and that is the high end of our long-term model. But to be clear, what I said is I think we're going to be slightly above the high end of our long-term model. But you have to double-click on our CapEx, which is basically 3 areas: one is network CapEx, one is capitalized software and the third is facility and IT. And network CapEx has scaled very nicely for the company over the last 2 years and actually this quarter. So it wasn't that many years ago that network CapEx was over 10% of revenue. Network CapEx is now in the 7% to 8% of revenue range. So network CapEx is scaling very nicely. Capitalized software has been increasing, and it's about 5% of revenue. And you've got to think of that as that really is because we capitalize R&D, that is really new product innovation. And so I consider that kind of good CapEx. Where we notably had a large uptick in CapEx, we had a large uptick last year. And I think we're going to have an even more notable uptick this year is in facility and IT. You don't add the number of resources that we have without the need to build out facilities and without the need to add kind of related IT expense. So we're going through a period that I believe is going to continue this year, that is going to be more substantive facility and IT buildout. I don't think you're going to see those volumes going into 2015, but you are in 2014. And so I think that -- you got to kind of look at our CapEx and break it out because I think there are some notable things going on which is nice scale within the network. And notably, we're going through a period, as you invest in headcount, that you're going to need kind of, call it, infrastructure buildout for them that should not be CapEx that you need to do every year. You have to try to get ahead of it now. Does that help?","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Yes, it's just that it didn't seem like there was really much of a change. So I was just curious what you're calling out just based on what you've actually been doing, but that's helpful. And just quickly on the servers?","James Benson","So there's nothing notable on the servers. I mean, we have more efficient servers that we put -- every quarter and every year, we're working on what are the -- what is kind of the server design that we're looking for. And every year, we get more efficient servers, which gives us more throughput. So that's really what's going on in the server front.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Richard Fetyko with ABR Investment Strategy.","Richard Fetyko","Just curious on the international side, if you could tell us if the mix of revenue among your segments is different from the U.S. and which product specifically within the performance and solutions side perhaps is driving the growth? Or are you leading with the media-delivered typically solutions?","James Benson","It's good -- I mean, the mix is relatively similar outside the U.S. as it is in the U.S. kind of media versus performance, security and service and support. So I mean, the mix is not materially different. You are right that we certainly have more -- we have more greenfield opportunity outside the U.S. And so it's easier for a sales rep, when you add them, to probably go and sell our media products for us and then sell performance and security second. But it's something that we look at, but I would say that there's really not a notable difference in kind of the mix of the offerings in any of the regions.","Richard Fetyko","Okay. And just to follow up on the earlier questions around the professional services revenue growth. Which product tend to have the highest attach rates for services?","James Benson","Well, I think -- probably it's -- we -- again, it's product-enablement services. So in some cases, think of it as their support packages where you get a higher level of response. So those are getting a good uptake. I think there's also -- some of these are packages where we're selling them with, say, our security solutions. And they are being bundled into our security solutions where we're providing a Web Application Firewall to the customer. And the -- basically, the rule settings need to be updated. And so we're able to sell a service package which actually have services resources working with the customer to continue to update the rule setting based on different security threats so that the customer wants update on an ongoing basis. So I think it varies, but I'd say we're probably getting stronger attach rate in the performance and security solutions than we are on the media solutions because those tend to be more sophisticated offerings that require more of our services professionals. But hopefully that gave you a little bit of color on the type of offerings that are doing well within the services.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of James Breen with William Blair.","James D. Breen - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just a couple of questions, one with respect to the product set and the performance and security solutions. Any color you can give us on the customers -- existing customers that are now taking a security solution? Is that sort of the grow -- fastest-growing segment of products? And then how many of the total customers are taking a security solution now versus where we were a couple of months ago and does Prolexic help that?","James Benson","Yes, I mean, I don't think anything has notably changed. I mean, we shared with you guys at the Investor Summit just a month or so ago kind of the penetration of our solution -- our security solution and the penetration of our performance solutions with our customers. So I don't think it notably changed since then. I do -- I would say, though, that obviously we've had Prolexic. It was 6 weeks in the quarter. I mentioned that we had very good signings. I think the strong interest from our customers in both our Prolexic offerings and our Kona offerings. So we're pretty pleased kind of early days here with the integration and the interest from customers in our security offerings. And I think I shared with you guys in the past that security is a different sale, and our sales professionals were much more accustomed selling performance. And I think they're getting more comfortable selling security, and I think the addition of the Prolexic sales reps and us having maybe more of a sales specialist model on the security side is actually leading to additional traction in security that we hope that we can continue going forward.","James D. Breen - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And with respect to Prolexic, you've talked about it being a $5 million a month in terms of revenue. Is there really any EBITDA associated with this year? So as we think about margins in the back half, can we assume that's sort of revenue without EBITDA attached to it?","James Benson","Yes, I think the way to think about it is it's certainly, in the early goings, it's not -- it's more cost than revenue. And then I think probably as you go towards the outer part of the year, it'll probably be revenue and cost in alignment. But in the early goings, it's more spending than revenue. But obviously, we expect to continue to grow the Prolexic business that we think that you'll see probably by the end of the year, call it, neutral EBITDA. And then beyond that, our expectation in 2015 is you'll start to see some scale. Again, we're not going to separate Prolexic from the rest of our security business, but that's kind of generally the way to think about it.","James D. Breen - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then just last -- one last question on the media delivery solutions. As you sell more internationally, given your footprint globally and sort of lack of maybe underlying wireline infrastructure globally, is there an opportunity there in pricing in that segment to be better outside the U.S. than it is in the U.S. and will that help over time?","James Benson","I mean, certainly, the market dynamics are different in every geography. And so certainly, the price points for a U.S. customer for kind of that we price our media solutions are different than the price points that you're going to charge someone, say, in the Japanese market. But that's more a function of the local market dynamics. So it's tough to kind of -- you can't make a general statement. I think it depends upon the market and the cost associated with delivering services in those markets. And that's really -- we price based on local market conditions.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Smithen with Macquarie.","Unknown Analyst","This is Will filling in for Kevin. I know you touched on international a little, but I was wondering if you could give us any more color on the strength of bookings and the difference between EMEA and Asia Pac. And also, would you be able to break out the Prolexic revenue by geography?","James Benson","So we're not going to break out bookings between Europe and APJ. We -- that's just not something that we're going to do. I can give you a little bit of color on that, that we continue to make good traction. Growth has been very strong in Asia Pacific. It's been strong for a while. I think growth in Asia Pacific has been a little bit more media-oriented. I think we saw some nice improvement in growth rates in Europe. Europe is still suffering from some of the southern markets of Europe, from just a macroeconomic perspective are still not performing well. But I think generally speaking, both markets are performing well, and we expect over time that these markets are going to grow faster than our U.S. markets. Now that's an over time comment. And what was your other question?","Unknown Analyst","About the Prolexic revenue, if you could break that out.","James Benson","Yes, so the Prolexic's mix, I think, was about, if I remember it right, it's about 40% of their mix was in international, 60% in the U.S., roughly speaking. So it's a little bit more concentrated in international than the Akamai business, but not notably.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ed Maguire from CLSA.","Edward Maguire - CLSA Limited, Research Division","I was wondering if you could just discuss the competitive environment in the core media solutions business, and at least any discussions around some of your customers that may be large media customers that may be trying build-outs of their own because that's a recurring theme, particularly at the low end of the market, and how that may be informing some of the discussions you're having.","F. Thomson Leighton","Yes, media remains a very competitive business. There's a lot of competitors there. Price is an important consideration obviously. So there's no fundamental change in those dynamics. The good news is traffic's increasing at a rapid rate, and of course, pricing per bit delivered continues to decline. And as always, the largest -- the few largest media customers continue to try do-it-yourself solutions. I expect that to continue in the future as well. In some cases, they've actually tried in the past and now are coming out of that phase. As I mentioned before, it is much harder than folks think to really do video at high quality and at scale. And you -- it seems like a good idea at the time. And so you embark on a project and after few years, suddenly you're not current anymore and it's a lot more expensive than you thought. And so Akamai is in this for the long game, but I expect it to be -- continue to be a competitive environment and it's up to us to deliver better performance at better scale and affordable price point.","Edward Maguire - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Great. And just a quick follow-up, do you have any concentration of large contracts up for renewal in the next quarter or 2?","James Benson","Yes, I mean -- I think I've said this before that every quarter we have kind of notable customers that are renewing. I did mention the -- our largest media customer, only because of its size. We don't have any customer that's near that size. So every quarter, we see large customers that renew, but there's nothing kind of extraordinary that is going to take place over the next quarter or so.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sameet Sinha with B. Riley.","Sameet Sinha - B. Riley Caris, Research Division","I'm going to focus this on security. Now that you have Prolexic and you see how it works, can you think of other solutions that you could tuck in and patch, maybe it's internal, maybe through acquisition? But is there opportunity to continue to grow synergistically? Second question would be those competitor out there talking about them blocking the largest DDoS attack, probably in Europe, I think. And the size of the attack, if I remember the number correctly, was above kind of the peak rate that you had given out during your Investor Summit. So if you -- what do you need to build out to get after these bigger attacks, which some of your competitors are throwing out? Or do you think there's -- your number would account for 80% of the DDoS attacks out there?","F. Thomson Leighton","All right. So first question, we're always looking for new capabilities and technology across all of our solution lines, including security, and of course, you saw us make the Prolexic acquisition. We're also doing a lot of internal innovation and development across our solution lines, including in security. If we find a company out there that has a great technology that we can bring to market for the benefit of our customers and it makes financial sense to do the transaction, then we'll do that. In terms of -- I'm not sure what you're referring to in Europe, but I think Akamai has been uniquely capable of defending against the largest attacks that are out there, and we've got a great track record of doing that where others have not been successful. We will continue to build out our infrastructure for delivery, as well as defense and security purposes. So that's an ongoing situation.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rob Sanderson from MKM Partners.","Rob Sanderson - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Did make it in under the wire. Question on channel sales. Revenue contribution from resellers jumped quite a lot this quarter, and you called out carrier partnerships. Is this mostly in the media or the performance and security? And is this an unusual quarter, or do you think carriers are starting to become sustainably better resellers of your products?","James Benson","Yes, so really there's not -- it's not anything notable with the carriers as far as the difference kind of necessarily in the mix. They tend to sell enterprise-class products. So they'll sell all of our products but -- they'll sell media and performance and security. You are right. It was notable that we saw an uptick in our channel business, and in particular with the carriers. So part of it is that we've had good traction with our channel partners. We announced quite a few of them last year, and I think we're starting to see some traction with some of them. I do think it's probably important to note, though, that for some of these very, very large channel partners, part of the relationship that we have with them is we also help them by seeding them a little bit with their business to get them started. So there were some customers that we had on the direct side that we have seeded these -- some of these large carriers to get them going and get the business moving with them. So we've had traction both in selling offerings through the carrier. And admittedly, we've had some of that driven by, call it, the movement of some accounts that were on the direct side that we seeded to the partner. But across the board, I'd say we're pretty pleased with traction in the reseller space, and the fastest-growing reseller that we have are with carrier partners. And as we've talked about in the past, our expectation is that they will be the fastest-growing channel for us, and they're very important to Akamai's future growth.","Rob Sanderson - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Just a follow-up, if I could, on the -- back to the -- not to kill this one, but the margin guidance in the back half of the year, 40% to 42%. It seems like a downtick from what I think was interpreted to be 42% prior. Did something change in terms of your investment plans as you bring Prolexic in-house? Or is that just -- or has something changed there?","James Benson","No, nothing's changed other than -- certainly, I'm as aware of kind of how the street models the company as you are. And when I said low 40s, you're right. If someone says low 40s means 42%, I want to be very clear. A low 40s could mean something that's 40% to 42%, just to be clear, and it's going to be dependent upon revenue volumes. And I gave you guys an example of what could happen in the third quarter, just seasonally what happens Q2 to Q3. I'm not suggesting that's going to happen, but I'm trying to provide you a little bit of color so that we don't surprise you if in fact the company operates at those levels and you say, \"Why didn't you tell me that?\" I'm trying to signal to you what we intend to operate the company at.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Horan with Oppenheimer.","Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","You didn't touch too much on mobility on the call, and I was just wondering if you're winning many contracts on mobility and what you're seeing in terms of the ability to kind of improve latency on mobile networks and kind of how important that is for customers at this point.","F. Thomson Leighton","Yes, mobility is really critical across all of our product lines. We're nearing the point where a majority of the transactions are going to be on mobile devices, and that's a stunning increase from where we were a few years ago. And of course, as you know, that mobile is a place that's often very challenged in terms of performance, especially if you're on a cellular network where the congestion can be very high and the latencies are high. And that's where our Ion service is really great because it's really focused on mobile. And we have real user measurements now, so you can actually see how real users on the site are experiencing the site. You can see what kind of device they have, what browser they have, what carrier they're on, and you can see what their performance is. And the results we have, have been really great: dramatic speedups even in the most challenging cellular environments. So we don't break out mobile because -- well, pretty -- a lot of the business is becoming mobile. It just -- it goes with the business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered, but I just wanted to hit on gross margins again. They're strong. A tick above where your guidance range was. Just maybe just give us a little more detail on the sort of what you're seeing in terms of colo, bandwidth. And then I know you guys are doing sort of constant grooming of the network. But I guess sort of where do we stand in this process? And obviously, you've given a long-term guidance. Maybe if you could just help us out, walk through that and just what you saw this quarter, that would be great.","James Benson","Sure. So again, it -- this quarter was another good quarter. I think we guided -- we had said 78%. So our cash gross margins were certainly as we thought. They were flat to Q4. But again, we continue to do a good job with managing bandwidth costs, managing colocation spending. And we've talked about a lot of the things that we're doing, whether they are driving kind of software initiatives to get more throughput out of the servers, whether it's installing more efficient servers into the network. There's a bunch of things that we're doing, and we're going to continue to do. It is fair to say that certainly, we talked much more about the network side. Certainly, a piece of our cost of goods sold is the services side. As our services business grows, we will have to add services resources there. So it's probably important for us to make sure that we remind you that our gross margins are not just driven by what we do on managing network cost. They're also driven by kind of what happens with the revenue mix portfolio for the customer and -- or for our revenue mix. And so if we end up having more services revenue, that services revenue kind of has, call it, low 50s gross margins, which is very different than our media and our performance and security solutions. But I think, again, a very good quarter in Q1. It's been good the last couple of years. We think we can continue the momentum that we made there and, call it, the guide that we have for Q2 is we're absorbing Prolexic. And as a reminder, Prolexic's offering does have service professionals that are working within that offering. So some of our kind of erosion so to speak in EBITDA, you'll see some of that possibly on the gross margin line largely because of Prolexic or a fair amount of Prolexic's cost were in services cost of goods sold.","F. Thomson Leighton","So we'd like to thank you all for joining us today. We're obviously very pleased to have a great Q1, and we're very optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead in Q2 and beyond.","Tom Barth","Thank you, Tom. This is Tom Barth. I want to, again, thank you for joining us and just to remind you that we'll report Q2 results on July 30 after the market, and we look forward to speaking to many of you soon. Thank you, and have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may all now disconnect.

My name is Shekwana, and I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions]","I will now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Ms. Natalie Temple, Investor Relations. Please proceed, ma'am.","Natalie Temple","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Akamai's investor conference call to discuss our second quarter 2013 financial results. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Benson, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.","Additional information concerning these factors are contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on July 24, 2013. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances.","As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the News and Events portion of the Investor Relations section of our website.","Now let me turn the call over to Tom.","F. Thomson Leighton","Thanks, Natalie, and thank you, all, for joining us today. Akamai performed very well on both the top and bottom lines in Q2. Revenue in the second quarter was a record $378 million, up 14% year-over-year or 19% when adjusted for the ADS divestment and foreign currency headwinds. We had strong growth in all of our product lines, and we were particularly pleased with the 19% year-over-year growth in revenue, for our performance in security solutions.","We generated non-GAAP net income of $84 million, up 25% year-over-year, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.46 per diluted share, up 24% year-over-year. Of these results, $9 million, or $0.05 per share, are attributable to the change in our depreciation methodology that we introduced in Q1. Adjusted for the depreciation change, our non-GAAP EPS was up 11% over Q2 of last year.","I'll be back in a few minutes to talk more about our achievements in Q2. But first, Jim will provide the details on our Q2 financial results.","Jim?","James Benson","Thank you, Tom. As a reminder, there are 2 discrete items that occurred in Q1, which continue to affect our 2013 reported results and growth rates: the ADS divestiture and the depreciation methodology change for our network assets. As I walk you through the details of our very strong Q2 financial results, where appropriate, I will point out the impact of these 2 items so you can better understand the operational performance in the quarter.","As Tom mentioned, revenue came in at the high end of our guidance range at $378 million, up 14% year-over-year or up 19% if you adjust for the ADS divestment and foreign exchange headwinds. Growth was solid across the business. It was particularly strong within our performance and security solutions category, where we saw revenue of $168 million in the quarter, up 19% over Q2 of last year and up 7% sequentially, exceeding our expectations. This overachievement was primarily driven by faster-than-expected growth for IP accelerator solutions.","Turning to our media delivery solutions. Revenue was $179 million in the quarter, up 14% over Q2 of last year and down 1% sequentially. As expected and discussed in our last call, one of our large media customers fully migrated their video traffic off the Akamai platform, which contributed to the sequential revenue decline.","To give you a better sense of the puts and takes of our media revenue in the second quarter, overall traffic growth continued to be strong throughout the quarter for our video, gaming and social media customer base but slowed for software downloads. As we have stated in the past, software downloads can have meaningful variability from one quarter to the next, given the nature and timing of software releases.","Finally, revenue from our service and support solutions was $31 million in the quarter, up 41% over Q2 of last year and up 14% sequentially. We continue to make great traction, attaching our enterprise class professional services and customer support to our core business solutions.","Switching now to our geographies. Sales outside North America represented 29% of total revenue in Q2, up 2 points from the prior year and down 1 point from the prior quarter. Q2 international revenue grew 21% year-over-year and was flat sequentially. The stronger dollar had a negative impact on revenue of about $4 million on a year-over-year basis and $3 million on a sequential basis. Excluding the impact of currency movements, revenue outside North America grew 25% year-over-year and 3% sequentially.","We saw particularly strong growth in our Asia-Pacific geography, which offset continued macroeconomic headwinds in Europe, most notably felt in our Southern European business.","Revenue from North America grew 11% year-over-year in the quarter and increased 4% sequentially. Excluding the ADS divestiture, revenue from North America was up 16% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Resellers represented 20% of total revenue in Q2.","Moving on to costs. As expected, our cash gross margin was 76%, flat with the prior quarter and up 3 points from the same period last year. As we have demonstrated over the past 1.5 years, we continue to make solid traction on our management of cost of goods sold.","GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 67%, flat sequentially and up 7 points from the same period last year. This year-over-year improvement included a favorable impact of roughly 3 points due to the depreciation methodology change that occurred in Q1. GAAP gross margins were about 1 point better than our guidance due to lower depreciation from network asset purchases happening later in the quarter and some purchases moving from Q2 into Q3. GAAP operating expenses were $156 million in the quarter.","Cash operating expenses for the quarter were $123 million, up $7 million from Q1 and up 22% on a year-over-year basis. This is slightly below our guidance range due to some planned hiring shifting into the third quarter.","Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $166 million. That's up 16% from the same period last year and flat with Q1 levels. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 44%, down 1 point from Q1 levels and up 1 point from Q2 of last year. This was slightly above our guidance range for the quarter due to the combination of revenue coming in at the high end of guidance and slight favorability on both network costs and operating expenses.","For the second quarter, total depreciation and amortization was $44 million. These charges included $32 million of network-related depreciation, $6 million of G&A depreciation and $6 million of amortization of intangible assets. Net interest income for the second quarter was $1.5 million, roughly flat with Q1 levels.","Moving on to earnings. GAAP net income for the quarter was $62 million, or $0.34 per diluted share. We're pleased that due to strong operational execution, our non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $84 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, coming in at the high end of our guidance range. This result was up $0.09 from Q2 of last year. This was down $0.05 from Q1 levels as we benefited from the reinstatement of the 2012 federal R&D tax credit in our first quarter results.","As Tom mentioned and as we included in our Q2 guidance, $0.05 of our EPS is due to the depreciation methodology change we made in the first quarter to extend server useful lives by 1 year, $0.04 of which is attributable to network assets that were in place as of January 1, 2013, and an additional $0.01 is due to network assets that were added during the first half of this year.","Our GAAP -- our Q2 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 38% and 36%, respectively. Our non-GAAP tax rate is about 2 points higher than our guidance, primarily due to lower foreign earnings. For the quarter, taxes included in our GAAP earnings were $37 million, and taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $47 million.","Our weighted average diluted share count for the second quarter was 181 million shares.","Now I will review some balance sheet items. Cash generation continued to be strong, with cash from operations totaling $130 million for the quarter. Days sales outstanding for the quarter were 57 days, consistent with last quarter and Q2 of 2012. Capital expenditures in Q2, excluding equity compensation, was $72 million, slightly under our guidance range due to a shift in the timing of some of our network investments from Q2 into Q3. This CapEx number also includes capitalized software development, as well as facilities and IT-related expenditures.","During the quarter, we spent $42.5 million on share repurchases, buying back approximately 1.1 million shares at an average price of just over $39. The goal of our share repurchase program is to both offset dilution from our equity compensation plans and to opportunistically return value to shareholders.","At the end of Q2, we had more than $1.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on the balance sheet. Because a constant process of innovation is required in order to maintain our position as a market leader, we believe our strong balance sheet and cash position are important competitive differentiators that provide the financial flexibility necessary to make the best investments at the most opportune times.","As always, we continue to evaluate strategic investments to strengthen our business on an ongoing basis. Our overall aim is to deploy our capital to achieve favorable returns for our shareholders in a manner that we believe is in the best long-term interest of the company and our investors.","We are very pleased with how the business performed in Q2. We continue to drive strong revenue growth, manage network cost effectively and make necessary investments in the business in an effort to accelerate growth and innovation.","Looking forward to Q3, we are expecting another solid quarter. As a reminder, our strong Q3 2012 results were aided by onetime sporting events and the timing of some significant software releases. We are expecting another significant software release late this quarter, but the exact timing and traffic volume is difficult to estimate this far in advance.","Foreign exchange is expected to have a negative impact of approximately $1 million compared to Q2 and a $4 million impact compared to Q3 of last year.","Given all of this, we expect Q3 revenue in the range of $380 million to $392 million. This range represents 15% to 18% year-over-year growth when you exclude ADS and foreign exchange movements. Of course, the timing of the software release I just mentioned, will influence where we land within our guidance range for the quarter.","We expect cash gross margins to be in the range of 76% to 77% and GAAP gross margins to come in at 66% to 67%. On the operating expense side, we expect to grow cash OpEx by $8 million to $10 million on a sequential basis as we further invest in go-to-market and R&D initiatives that we believe will yield important longer-term benefits.","Through the first half of the year, we added nearly 400 employees across the company, focused primarily in ramping up sales and supporting go-to-market capacity, service and customer support staffing and engineering resources. And we expect to continue hiring in these areas in the second half of the year.","With these increased expenditures, we expect EBITDA margins in the range of 42% to 44% for the quarter. We continue to expect EBITDA margins to decline to the low 40s over time.","At this level of revenue, we expect non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.44 to $0.47 for the quarter. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $42 million to $46 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of 34% to 35%. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of roughly 182 million shares.","On CapEx, we expect to spend $65 million to $70 million in the quarter, excluding equity compensation. For the full year, we are expecting to be slightly above the high end of our long-term model for CapEx as a percent of revenue due to significant facility-related investments that we've made throughout the year to support the headcount growth.","Overall, we've had a very solid first half of the year, and we expect strong performance for the second half as well. We have been seeing promising momentum in the business, and we are making investments that we believe will position us for meaningful growth beyond 2013.","Now let me turn the call back over to Tom.","F. Thomson Leighton","Thank you, Jim. Akamai delivered another strong quarter, and our results demonstrate that our diverse and growing set of companies continue to turn to Akamai to accelerate and secure their online businesses.","Since our founding, Akamai has been at the vanguard of the Internet revolution. And as we prepare to celebrate our 15th anniversary next month, our spirit of innovation and our desire to solve the most difficult Internet challenges are just as strong today as they were 15 years ago. From day one, we have worked hard to gain an understanding of how our customers want to use the Internet to make their businesses more agile, more customer-centric and more profitable. And we use that understanding to guide our innovation and to invent new solutions to help make our customers' visions a reality.","For example, we learned early on that enterprises conducting transactions online need those transactions to be fast. And today, user expectations have increased to the point where transactions need to be nearly instantaneous. Many studies have shown that conversion rates for e-commerce sites grow substantially when download times improve from several seconds to 1 second, and that they are even higher when download times reach sub-second levels. They have also shown that user abandonment rates increase with every extra second of delay. Even small delays can result in lost business and brand damage.","Akamai has long understood the ever-increasing need for speed, and that is why we have engineered what we believe are the world's fastest application acceleration technologies. And as a result, many of the world's leading enterprises turn to Akamai to accelerate their applications online.","Our customer base now includes 96 of the Internet retailer 100 companies, 7 of the top 10 global banks, 19 of the top 20 hotel brands and more than 1\/3 of the global 500 companies. We accelerate nearly 2 trillion deliveries everyday and over $250 billion worth of e-commerce transactions each year. Our market-leading acceleration solutions, Dynamic Site Accelerator, DSA, and Web Application Accelerator, are considered by most to be unparalleled in terms of their speed and reliability.","But we have not stopped there. Late last year, we released our next-generation acceleration solutions, Aqua Ion and Terra Alta. And in June, we released the second versions of these solutions. The new versions of Ion and Alta provide even greater acceleration than their predecessors, and they are especially designed to speed up dynamic applications in the most challenging network and mobile environments.","The new versions of Ion and Alta also have the ability to provide timely reporting on the real end-user experience, such as which device and browser they are using, which type of network they are on and how it is performing and the speed observed by the real end user as they access the application. This capability to monitor real end-user performance as opposed to test agent performance has long been desired by our customers because it allows them to better understand exactly how their websites and applications are performing in the real world.","With the latest release of Ion and Alta, online businesses now have improved acceleration solution, coupled with the new ability to monitor and optimize the effectiveness of their applications across the wide spectrum of conditions experienced by their end users. Customers can now see for themselves the benefit provided by our acceleration solutions, and the results are impressive.","Real user monitoring has shown that by adopting Ion or Alta, leading commerce, high-tech and media companies can make their sites and applications nearly twice as fast and sometimes 3 times as fast as when they were using DSA. That's significant, especially when you consider that DSA has already been shown to be much faster than solutions offered by other companies.","Akamai has also long understood the critical need for web security. In fact, we've been working on cybersecurity defenses for our platform for over a decade, long before attackers began making headlines by taking down websites for major banks and enterprises. And so when our customers reached out to us for help with defending against cyber attacks, we were ready.","Over the past year, our flagship Kona Site Defender solution has proved to be successful against even the largest and most sophisticated attacks. In fact, it has succeeded in many cases where traditional security solutions have failed. That's because Kona Site Defender can utilize the massive scale and unparalleled capabilities of the Akamai Intelligent Platform to identify and filter out attack traffic well before it reaches the enterprise or cloud data center. And because of Akamai's expertise in acceleration, we can do the filtering without negatively impacting performance.","Among other things, this means that Akamai's defenses can be operated in an always-on mode. This is an important advantage over traditional security solutions, which often inflict a significant performance penalty and so are typically turned on after the attack has begun, which can often be too late.","The threat of web attacks is now a global concern as evidenced by the recent experience of several Dutch banks that are struggling with the same kind of punishing attacks that have plagued North American banks for the last year. Globally, 45 customers purchased Kona Site Defender in Q2, including 3 of the top 5 banks in The Netherlands.","In Q2, we also released 2 new products for sale to carriers. The first is Aura Lumen, a licensed CDN software suite based on technology obtained through the Veraview acquisition. The second is Aura Spectra, a Software-as-a-Service CDN that provides carriers with media CDN capabilities that can be quickly deployed and with far less upfront investment than is required by competing offerings.","Aura Spectra was a key component of the Korea Telecom partnership that we announced in Q2. Korea Telecom is the leading carrier in Korea, and having them join the Akamai family opens an important new market for us. We're especially pleased with the speed with which KT has integrated our solution into their network and go-to-market functions. In fact, they've already signed up their first customer using the Akamai solution.","Lastly, Akamai has always played a major role in the delivery of media content. It's how we started our business. And today, 2,400 customers use our media services, including all of the 30 largest global media companies. These customers require delivery solutions that can provide high quality of scale and at the lowest possible price, which is why we are continuing to innovate and to invest in these areas.","In summary, Akamai's goal is to deliver on the promise of a truly hyper-connected world, improving and transforming online experiences for everyone and everything wherever and however they are connected. We accomplished this goal through the development and operation of the world's largest and most advanced distributed platform for securing and accelerating web content and applications of all kinds, from media and software downloads to dynamic and personalized content for the world's most important applications.","As we move forward over the next 15 years, Akamai will continue to help improve our customers' businesses in a rapidly changing and increasingly complex online world.","Thank you for your time today. Now Jim and I will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark Kelleher, representing Dougherty & Company.","Mark Kelleher - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division","I wanted to look at the security a little bit deeper. Is there any way you can maybe break that out within the performance and security segment? Just give us some sense of the size of that? And can you also talk about how the recent Cisco acquisition may change your view or how the security market is operating out there?","James Benson","So I can cover the first part of it. So what we disclosed at our Investor Summit in March was that we're going to provide a breakout of all of the solutions within our performance in security portfolio annually. It doesn't really make sense every quarter because there's not a huge movement every quarter on some of the solution categories. I will tell you, though, that security solution is our fastest-growing solution in the web performance -- in the performance and security category and continues to be. So we continue to get good take rates there, but we only provide it annually. And I think what we shared at the Investor Summit was that the business was on a clip to be roughly at a run rate of roughly high 20s annualized run rate for revenue in 2013. So that's where we ended 2012, and we continue to have good progress in that business.","F. Thomson Leighton","And the recent acquisition by Cisco in that space really has no impact on our view of the marketplace. Our approach to web security is really quite unique, and we have tremendous advantages with the Akamai distributor platform in terms of a massive scale. And our approach is to intercept the attacking traffic really close to the source in the last mile long before it gets to the data center. And so we can withstand very large scale attacks that you just can't begin to defend against with devices in your data center or with traditional solutions. We also have very advanced application layer filtering capabilities that actually interact with the origin data center to see what impact a particular request is having on the origin. And we have the ability to filter out traffic based on rate controls of certain behaviors. We can actually deploy software on to the client device to check is it really a human or is it a bot. Lots of things you just can't do with the traditional approach to web defense.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Jennifer Lowe, representing Morgan Stanley.","Jennifer Swanson Lowe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up a little bit on the recovery or the rebound in performance and security solutions growth. It was a little bit lighter last quarter, and it looks like you had a really nice uptick and acceleration there even though it seemed like it should have been a tougher comp, given that you've anniversary-ed the Cotendo acquisition. I think in the prepared remarks, there was a comment that there was the IP acceleration that did particularly well. But any more color there in terms of was there a catch-up of business or anything like that, that was pushed out Q1 into Q2? Or really what was that driver of acceleration?","F. Thomson Leighton","Yes, we had a very strong quarter there, as you know, making a lot of investments there, both in terms of our -- the capabilities of the solutions, making the acceleration solutions, as I talked about, be faster, to really provide performance improvement in mobile environments as more and more critical transactions moved to mobile. Over the longer term, you'll see us move from web applications to general IP-based applications, and that's actually where we saw a little bit more business than we expected in the quarter that produced the upside in our performance with our IP accelerator solution. And that is used to find better routes in the Internet, better communication protocols to accelerate non-web applications. So nothing to do with caching, things like movies, phone calls, video, one-to-one kind of capabilities that are different than our traditional business. And so you'll see us move more into that area with all of our solutions, security and as we work on hybrid cloud optimization, to move beyond just web to do all IP acceleration and performance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Olson, representing Piper Jaffray.","Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just one other quick one on security. I think it was tracking at 500-or-so customers at the end of Q1. Any sort of update you can give us on that number? And then how is just the trajectory towards improving ARPU for Security Solutions tracking? From what I remember, it was expected to be trending higher as customers deploy the suite versus point products.","F. Thomson Leighton","Yes, we ended Q2 with about 650 customers using our security solutions, and ARPU continues to improve in security because we have more and more customers that are leveraging our flagship Kona Site Defender offering, which is -- has a much higher ARPU than some of the other security offerings. So good progress in both increasing ARPU and good progress on getting better customer penetration.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Hilal, representing FBR.","David M. Hilal - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Two parts. I guess, first, guys, public sector was quite strong in the quarter. I don't remember it being $20 million plus for a while. And I guess, I know that business is lumpy. So my question is, was this just a function of lumpiness in that business? Or was there something else suggesting that business is maybe going from being flat to a growth trajectory? And then my second question is in security. It's often been a missionary sale, as you guys have tried to convince prospects that you also can be viewed as a security company. I'm just wondering where in that evolution is Akamai? What type of progress have you made to build the brand on the security side?","F. Thomson Leighton","So on the public sector piece, you are right that we tend to have -- I think we've even used the phrase before, lumpy. We had a good quarter in the public sector business, but I'd say there's nothing kind of noteworthy other than there are times where project's complete within the quarter, and we happen to have that in Q2. And so we had a very solid public sector quarter but I would say nothing kind of noteworthy to call out.","James Benson","To the security question, there's no doubt that a customer under attack is our most motivated prospect. And we do sign up a lot of customers in that environment, and they become very happy and a long-term Akamai customer as a result. The recent headlines with banks coming under attack, both in North America and now in Europe, helps to increase awareness that cybersecurity is really an important matter. And that does help businesses as well. So I think over time, you'll see our customer base, even if they're not yet under attack, realize this is something they need to have. And we've invested substantially in terms of our field force, and we've talked about that, to get the message out with security, professionals that help speak the right language to our customers and to educate them that Akamai has a fantastic solution here, really does things that only Akamai can do with our distributed Edge platform. And we're making, I think, very good progress there. We're still small in the Security business but growing rapidly.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Phil Winslow, representing Credit Suisse.","Harris Heyer","This is Harris Heyer for Phil. We were hoping that you could comment on bandwidth and also co-location pricing. Have you seen any changes during the first half and what are your expectations for the second half?","F. Thomson Leighton","Yes, I think, in general, we've continued -- I think the cost of bandwidth continues to come down. And I'd say the rate and pace has been pretty consistent. We continue to see reductions in the pricing of bandwidth. I'd say the story on co-lo is it's really less a story of the cost of co-lo going down and just us being a much more efficient user of co-location, given that we're just doing a lot of work on our network to get more software efficiencies and throughput out of the existing servers that we have and, therefore, you're effectively being able to leverage your co-lo costs more effectively. And we continue to do that in Q2. We've done that -- literally, we've done that for many, many years. But literally over the last 18 months, we've made great progress. So we've made good progress both on co-lo, we've made good progress -- continued on the bandwidth. And that's what allowed us to stabilize margins as we had expected.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Sterling Auty, representing Morgan Stanley -- JPMorgan.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","On the performance in security, you mentioned the general IP accelerator. But what I'm curious about is, did you see the pickup in demand from new customers, further penetration into existing customers and how much of this acceleration actually just came from the additional sales capacity that you added? And the root of the question I'm trying to get to is, with this acceleration that you saw in this segment, how should we think about within the guidance you gave for September, should we see similar types of growth rates? Or how should we think about this segment for September?","James Benson","Yes, I mean, I think, in general, that -- I think as we told you in the past, just to kind of step back, we certainly have been making investments in the sales force that we began last year. And we're increasing the rate and pace of that hiring this year. I think what we said is that it's going to take 4 to 5 quarters to get those sales reps ramped and productive. And so you shouldn't read into the improvement that we saw in Q2 to be a reflection of the improved productivity of that sales force even though we're on track with the hiring that we had expected and, actually, the productivity of those reps relative to being early in their tenure as we expected. It was more driven by just continued penetration in our installed base set of customers. And with that solution, in particular, we happen to make some traction with some large accounts, and that was really the driver of it. But we also had good performance, in general, across the performance in security categories. So we notably talked about that area, but we made pretty good traction across the category in total. We mentioned security had another good quarter as well. And so I think what I've said to folks in the past is that you should expect that we're going to operate that business probably in the high teens for the remainder of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Colby, representing Cowen.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So I have 2 questions. The first one, the services and support line item, I think at your Analyst Day, you talked about how over the long term that would be flat and we should expect that to be flat. And obviously, you guys got an attach rate to some of your other businesses. Do you still think that long term that, that's a flat contributor to revenue? Or do you think that we could actually start to see that growth rate look more similar to some of the other segments? And then the second question is -- last year, you did about 3 acquisitions. This year, we haven't seen any. Is that meant to imply that you guys are getting more comfortable with your own internal R&D and perhaps less of a need to go outside the company? Is it simply there hasn't been really anything that's of meaningful interest to you just yet and that's probably more of the reason?","F. Thomson Leighton","Sure. So on the service and support question, just to make sure we clarify that, that really was not even kind of a solution category for the company, 4 or 5 years ago. We've made grade early traction in attaching our service and support solutions to our media customers, our performance customers, our security customers. And what you're seeing is just a continuation in that. I think what we said is that long term, once you get broader penetration, that the growth rates that we're seeing now will slow over time. But that's not going to happen in the near term. I think we expect that we're going to have very healthy growth rates for that business in the near term. As you get more penetrated around customers that actually have service and support solutions, you'll start to see it slow, and it will probably grow long term slower than the overall company. But that's more long term. I think in the near term, you can expect to see strong growth in that category. Relative to M&A, yes, last year was actually 4 acquisitions, not 3 acquisitions. And there were years before that we haven't had any acquisitions. So you shouldn't read into that because we haven't done something necessarily in the first 6 months of the year, that we're not continuing to look at opportunities across the portfolio because we are. We are looking at opportunities to accelerate the rate and pace of our R&D either in direct adjacencies or related adjacencies in all of our categories, and we continue to look at those opportunities. And I'm not signaling that we're going to do something in the second half, but I'm telling you that we're optimistically always -- we are very active shoppers but disciplined buyers. And we want to make sure that we're putting the cash that we have to use opportunistically because we want to make sure we have that leverage if the opportunity arises, that we can move on it. So don't read into it necessarily that we're just going to do it more for internal R&D even though we are quite happy with the internal R&D progress that we've made.","James Benson","Yes, and let me just add to that in terms of the innovation question. The innovation and engine at Akamai is really cranking, and we've had some very exciting innovations here over the past couple of years. And I expect that to continue and even accelerate. But that doesn't mean we're not looking outside for great ideas that are outside of Akamai. As we demonstrated last year with several acquisitions, really to gain technology that we could bring to bear for the benefit of our customers. So we're working hard at innovation inside with great success. But also, we've got our eyes open. And if we can find something good outside that will help our customers, we'll go and do that, if we can.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Scott Kessler, representing S&P Capital IQ.","Scott H. Kessler - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research","I guess 2 questions. The first is, is there any way that you can quantify the impact of mobile on your business? Obviously, it's one of the big themes that you guys have talked about for the last couple of years. And I'm just wondering if there's a way that we could understand how you think about that in a more quantified fashion. And then I have a second question as well.","F. Thomson Leighton","Yes, sure. Mobile has taken over the Internet. 14% of our traffic is now on mobile devices. That's up dramatically from a couple of years ago. It's estimated that in North America, 1\/4 of online transactions are mobile. That's up from a couple percent a couple of years ago. And it's expected that within a couple of years, that a majority of the online transactions in North America will be mobile. And large parts of Asia are already there. So I think if you measure by transactions, mobile is going to become the majority. If you look at bps, probably not going to become the majority for awhile because a lot of the bps come through software downloads that go to a lot of devices that aren't mobile and also video. And generally, mobile video has a little bit less in terms of the traffic share than video into your living room. But mobile is vital, and we have a lot of our R&D centered around products and services to make the mobile experience be really great for our customers.","Scott H. Kessler - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research","And so there's no way, Tom, that the company could offer maybe even like Jim had referenced earlier in terms of some of the details related to security being released on an annual basis. It would be kind of interesting to understand how mobile contributes to the business model from a revenue perspective, let's say.","F. Thomson Leighton","Yes, I mean, I think I commented on that a little bit. I mean, part of it is that within our performance and security suite of solutions, we tend to bundle mobile optimization as part of our broader packages because you have customers that buy our offerings, whether they're using it on a landline, whether they're using it on a WiFi, whether they're using it through a mobile network. And so it tends to be embedded and bundled into our broader set of solutions, and so customers get that. Because obviously, we're trying to solve the performance problem across all of those networks. And so actually, internally, we don't really look at it, to be honest with you, narrowly between kind of just what mobile acceleration is versus something else. We actually look at it as part of -- we can increase the overall ARPU for a customer by selling them some of our broader solutions that happen to have mobile bundled into it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ed Maguire, representing CLSA.","Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could just comment on sort of the broad pricing environment for your media business, as well as if there are any major contracts up for renewal or that you expect to come up for renewal in the next quarter or so?","F. Thomson Leighton","Sure. So the media pricing environment is pretty consistent. It's a very aggressive pricing environment, and we expect it to be that way. I think what you see quarterly is that it's -- what happens as far as traffic volumes, it depends upon the price point that different customers have. So there are some quarters where you're going to have customers that have higher price points and push more traffic than other quarters. But in general, the pricing environment has been pretty consistent, which is aggressive. And what was the other question? Major contracts for Q3? There's nothing notable. We have contracts that renew every quarter, and so there's -- you're going to see some contracts are renewed in Q3, but there's nothing kind of noteworthy other than historically what we've seen.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turits, representing Raymond James.","James Wesman","It's James Wesman sitting in for Michael. Just taking a look off of Ed's question. Could you talk to some of the competitive dynamics in the quarter? Are you guys seeing any signs at Amazon Web Services, Limelight, et cetera?","F. Thomson Leighton","Yes, we have a lot of competitors. And as you know, the media products for us have a large number of competitors. It's been around for a long time. Very aggressive pricing, as Jim talked about, and we expect that to continue going forward. Limelight is one of our major competitors there. Amazon Web services, not as much, not so much there. In terms of our acceleration products, it's a different environment there. We're pretty unique in what we do and the acceleration capabilities that we can provide. Most of the CDNs out there have some sort of offering around acceleration. None of them has a particularly strong force in terms of being a competitor for those products. In security, of course, there's lots of incumbent players in security that we're competing with to try to grab market share as we grow that business.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of James Breen, representing William Blair.","James D. Breen - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Can you just talk about some of the carrier relationships and maybe any traction that you're seeing now that the agreement with AT&T is a few months old, a couple of quarters old and then how you feel about that going forward? When can we expect more relationships on the horizon?","F. Thomson Leighton","Yes, the carrier relationships are going very well. This last quarter, we announced Korea Telecom. I talked a little bit about that earlier. And as you know, the AT&T relationship is an important one for us, and that is going very well. They've signed up several customers on the platform, even just in our security solutions alone. So I would say that relationship is proceeding very well. We are hard at work with other major carriers. And I hope through the rest of this year, you'll see other announcements.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Schwartz, representing Jefferies.","Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I had sort of 2 quick questions. First, on the Media business, you guys have talked about gaming and social media consistently as being strong verticals for you. My question is, is there a shift towards, I guess, traffic being delivered more to consumer-centric sites and is that any more seasonal into Q3 that maybe your traditional traffic on the Media business? And then the second question. Jim, I think you talked about some shift in CapEx from Q2 to Q3, but it looks like the Q3 guidance in absolute is a little less than your initial guidance for Q2. So I just wondered if you could reconcile the 2.","James Benson","Sure. So I think, certainly, what we've talked about is there's really kind of 4 factors that influence traffic: you got social media, you got gaming, you have video delivery and you have software downloads. And what we talked about in Q1 was we actually had a 4-for-4. All of them did particularly well and had very, very strong traffic growth. This quarter, we had strong traffic growth in video delivery. We had strong traffic growth in social media. We had strong traffic growth in gaming. Software downloads were a little bit down, but that happens from quarter-to-quarter because software downloads and software releases tend to be much more variable. So I think, in general, the trend we're seeing on traffic kind of going into the summer months, going into the summer months traffic does go down. And it goes down just because people are more active and outside and not consuming as much content on the Internet. So we do expect that. That doesn't mean it's not growing year-over-year. It just means that sequentially, you tend to see a downtick in traffic. Relative to CapEx, one of the things that we had talked about in Q2 was we had guided to $75 million to $80 million, and we came in at kind of $72 million. And that CapEx is related to network CapEx and facility CapEx. And I think I've been telling you guys that this year is a big year as far as doing significant facility build-out, given the headcount growth in the company. And relative to the network CapEx, some of the network CapEx moved from Q2 to Q3. But again, if you kind of take the 3 quarters combined, you look at it on a percent of revenue, what I said is I think we'll probably be at the higher end of our guidance range or our long-term model for the year. And if you kind of do the math on that, that kind of suggests that's where we're at. Now what you'll see in that, though, is that we're actually doing very well on network CapEx as a percent of revenue. Where you're seeing us maybe be a little bit above the model is on facility-related CapEx. So that is an area of CapEx that we don't expect to continue at that rate and pace kind of every year. You're going to have bumps on that when you have headcount growth and you need to accommodate that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Fetyko, representing ABR Investment Strategy (sic) [Janney Montgomery Scott].","Richard Fetyko - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Just curious with the partnerships and resale partnerships with AT&T and other carriers and also the license CDN deal that you've announced. Is that helping with deploying deeper into their networks and, therefore, also improving the performance of Akamai solutions outside of the carrier customers?","F. Thomson Leighton","Yes, absolutely. And that's one of the key drivers for why we're so interested in partnering with the major carriers. It also helps with our economics. The deeper we can go and the better the relationship we have, the better the economics work out, I think, for both parties. It helps in terms of the channel model. When we can have those kinds of relationships, we can now leverage the tremendous power and scale of the sales forces of these major carriers. So it's really across the board. And the revenue we actually generate from any particular deal is small in comparison to the overall benefit, economic benefit to Akamai and also performance benefit. Because as our servers and our software go deeper into these carriers, the performance for all of our customers and now their customers get better.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Gray Powell, representing Wells Fargo.","Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So obviously, distributed denial of service attacks have been getting a lot of attention. What part of your customer base have you see the most success on the upsell of Kona Site Defender? And do you see other tangential areas within security that you could expand to?","F. Thomson Leighton","Well, we actually see it across our customer base. Now obviously, the banks that are being attacked are a good target customer there. In fact, we signed 3 of the top 5 Dutch banks just in the last quarter, and that's probably related to the attacks that have begun there in the last quarter. But media companies buy the security solution. People try to get their message on a media company site to try to deface it to get some fame or to cause harm. Commerce companies, obvious targets for cyber extortion and attack. It really goes across the board, public sector, government websites get attacked by enemies of the country or people trying to make a statement. So cybersecurity is important pretty much across our base and in every vertical, and there's a lot of greenfield for us to go after there.","Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And then do you see any other tangential areas to DDoS that would make sense for you to get into?","F. Thomson Leighton","So it's not just DDoS, it's also WAF or web app firewall capabilities, that are attacks designed to corrupt and to take over the site, to steal personal information, which is a little bit different than the DDoS, which is a volume attack meant to bring it down. Often, you'll see them both in conjunction. You'll have the DDoS attack. And while the website's responding to all the alarms going off, you sneak in the attack to infect it or steal something or corrupt the site. But it goes across all of our customer base. And when you look in the long range, I think our Security business could be just as large as our Performance business is today. The target customers are similar. The early ARPUs look comparable. And the needs -- the level of need is different but comparable. So I think it's a large potential business for us going forward, which is why we're really investing there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Van Rhee, representing Craig-Hallum.","Jeffrey Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Two brief ones. Just wondered if you could just clarify on the headcount side. I think you ended '12 at 212 direct reps, and you were shooting for roughly 100 in the year. I heard sort of conflicting -- some hiring may have been pushed out, and I thought you said at one point it was on schedule. So just if you'd touch on the sales hiring. And then the second part was as it relates to guidance. You said the variability was software. Can you just expand a little bit more? Are there 1, 2 key events? What did you assume at the high and low end of those ranges so we have a better feel for that?","F. Thomson Leighton","Sure. So just to make sure I clarify on the hiring front. So I made a comment when I talked about OpEx being a little bit lighter in the quarter. It was due to some hiring that shifted into Q3. That was actually not on the sales force side. Actually, what we had talked about in Q1 was we were a little bit behind from Q1. We actually caught up for the most part on our sales hiring through the first half of the year, so very good traction on sales and go-to-market hiring. We're a little bit behind in kind of some other areas of hiring, and that's really what's driving kind of the delta. So I want to make sure we're clear that sales force hiring is kind of on pace and some other areas of the business shifted from Q2 to Q3. And also beyond that, some hiring actually happened later in the quarter, and so we didn't see the expense impact as we had expected for Q2. Relative to the software release in our guidance for Q3, as you know, that when you have large software releases in there, we actually talk about there is a planned software release late in the quarter. And you never know whether that release moves a week or not, and you don't what the traffic volumes are going to be. What we have assumed in the guidance is we have assumed in the guidance that, that traffic, that software release does happen. And so that's embedded in our guidance, that kind of if you'd go to the midpoint of our range, that's in our guidance range. And if it's a little bit stronger, maybe it will be a little better than that. If it slips, maybe it will be a little bit lower than that. I mean, that's one variable though. There are many other variables. We just happen to call that one out because it happens to be a noteworthy one for Q3.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Donna Jaegers, representing D.A. Davidson.","Donna Jaegers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Just a follow-up on your last answer, that software download would be a major operating system for handsets.","F. Thomson Leighton","Yes, I'm not going to comment on exactly what the software release is, but there is a large release planned for late in the quarter.","Donna Jaegers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then a more philosophical question. European Union recently rated some of the European telcos, investigating whether they're impeding Internet traffic. Does that slow down your goal of working with large carriers to try to create fast lanes in their network?","F. Thomson Leighton","No, not at all. Everyone wants the Internet to be faster, and that was a dispute between major carriers as to who pays who how much for taking each other's traffic. And that's really tangential to our business. Our relationship with the carriers is to provide better service for everyone at a lower cost, and I think everyone thinks that's a good idea.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Kevin Smithen, representing Macquarie.","Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Research","I wonder if you could elaborate a little more on your comments on international revenues, like the strength in Asia Pac is, I guess, a little bit different from what we've been hearing from other companies in the IT space. Are there any specific product launches that drove either in software or media, that drove the strength in Asia Pac? And what do you expect to see in terms of recovery for the rest of the year? And of your sales hires, how many of them are focused in international?","F. Thomson Leighton","Yes, so I'll take that. So our international growth in Asia Pacific, in particular, was we were in the 30s in Q1, and we were in the 30s in Q2. Now it isn't every single market in the Asia Pacific geography. There are some markets that, as you mentioned, are not doing as well. But in general, we've seen very strong performance. And you've got to remember that, that's a fairly greenfield opportunity for Akamai. And so admittedly, we're growing off a smaller base. We've made some investments in the sales force there over the last year plus. The weighting of our investments, even this year, is going to be targeted. We're going to still have sales force investments in the U.S., but you're also going to see them in the international markets. And we're not going to give you a specific percentage around what is going to be in APJ versus EMEA versus the U.S. But you can expect that we think there's significant opportunity in international markets, significant opportunity in APJ, in particular, or Asia Pacific and Japan. And we're very pleased with our performance there.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Chad Bartley, representing Pacific Crest.","Chad Bartley - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","If you're still breaking it out, can you tell us what percent of total revenue was tied to the kind of value-added cloud hybrid services, I think, the old label? And then e-commerce growth accelerated, I think, over 700 basis points, if you adjust for ADS. Can you talk a little bit more specifically about what drove that?","F. Thomson Leighton","Well, yes, I mean, I'd prefer not to talk about kind of our cloud versus content delivery because we're actually talking about the business in a media performance and security and service and support. That information is on the Investor Relations section of our website. I think it was 59% in the old definition. But I think the way you should look at the business is the way we're looking at the business internally, which is the 3 categories that I mentioned. And what was the second question? E-commerce growth? So e-commerce growth was actually strong. When you look at the industry vertical cut, it actually doesn't look strong. It looks like it's, I think, 9% growth year-on-year. But you've got to remember, our ADS business was in the commerce vertical. And if you pull the ADS business out of the commerce vertical, we actually had mid-20s growth rates in the commerce vertical. So we're very pleased with that growth rate in commerce.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Horan, representing Oppenheimer.","Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I had 2 higher-level questions. Can you talk a little bit about overall volume growth and maybe what -- has it shifted much on a quarterly basis or a year-over-year basis? And maybe how does your revenue tie at this point in terms of fixed fees and licenses versus directly tied to volume growth? And kind of related to that, how important is overage these days?","F. Thomson Leighton","Yes, I mean, if volume you're referring to traffic and how -- I think traffic volumes have been strong. As I mentioned, they were strong in social media. They were strong in gaming. They were strong in video delivery. They were not quite as strong in the software download space. So relative to whether it's -- what's committed versus kind of bursting, we tend to have -- most of our customers are on committed contracts, and the rate and pace of bursting really hasn't changed much from what it's been historically.","Operator","This concludes the Q&A session. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.","F. Thomson Leighton","Thank you."],"380":["Akamai Technologies, Inc.

Welcome to the Q2 2015 Akamai Technologies Inc. earnings conference call. My name is Steven, and I will be your operator for today. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Tom Barth - Head-Investor Relations","Thank you, Steven, and good afternoon, and thank you for joining Akamai's second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer, and Jim Benson, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represents the company's view on July 28, 2015. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances.","As a reminder, we'll be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of our website.","With that, let me turn the call over to Tom.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Tom, and thank you for joining us today.","Akamai delivered a solid second quarter, with strong revenue growth across all of our geographies and in all of our solution categories, with particularly strong growth coming from our cloud security offerings. Revenue in the second quarter was $541 million, up 14% year over year and up 18% when adjusted for foreign exchange headwinds. Non-GAAP EPS for the second quarter was $0.57 per diluted share, down 2% year over year but up 3% when adjusted for foreign exchange headwinds.","I'll be back in a few minutes to talk more about the progress that we made during the second quarter and the opportunities that lie ahead. But first, let me turn the call over to Jim for our detailed financial results and the outlook for Q3. Jim?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone.","As Tom just highlighted, Akamai performed well in the second quarter. Q2 revenue came in slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range at $541 million, up 14% year over year or up 18% if you adjust for foreign exchange headwinds, with strong and balanced growth across the entire business.","Media revenue was $244 million in the quarter, up 12% year over year or up 17% on a constant currency basis. These growth rates are particularly strong when you consider our very strong Q2 of 2014, which benefited from several large gaming releases and the World Cup matches. As I've mentioned on past earnings call, where we land in our revenue guidance range is heavily influenced by media traffic, and Q2 traffic came in at the midpoint of our expectations.","Turning now to our Performance and Security Solutions, revenue was $256 million in the quarter, up 15% year over year or up 19% on a constant currency basis. Within the solution category, we saw solid growth across most of the product lines. And as Tom mentioned, we continued to see strong growth in demand for our cloud security offerings.","Second quarter revenue for our cloud security solutions was $61 million, up 39% year over year or up 44% on a constant currency basis. We are pleased with our continued growth and market recognition of our unique and differentiated cloud security capabilities. We have grown our security business from just a few million dollars in 2011 to over $210 million over the past 12 months.","Finally, revenue from our Services and Support Solutions was $41 million in the quarter, up 14% year over year or up 18% on a constant currency basis. We continued to see improvements in new customer attachment rates for our higher-end enterprise-class professional services as well as service offering upgrades into the installed base.","Turning now to our geographies, revenue growth continued to be solid across all of our major geographies. Sales in our international markets represented 26% of total revenue in Q2, consistent with the prior quarter. International revenue was $142 million in the quarter, up 7% year over year or up 22% on a constant currency basis. The stronger dollar continued to weigh on growth rates and had a negative impact on revenue of $21 million on a year-over-year basis and $1 million on a sequential basis.","On a constant currency basis, we saw solid growth in both our Asia-Pacific and EMEA markets. Revenue from our U.S. market was $399 million, up 16% year over year, with solid growth across all solution categories. And finally, revenue through channel partners represented 27% of total revenue in Q2, up one point sequentially.","Moving on to costs, cash gross margin was 77%, down one point from the prior quarter and the same period last year and coming in at the lower end of our guidance range, given both the revenue results and the increased investment in network expansion in the quarter. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 67%, down one point from the prior quarter and down two points from the same period last year and in line with our guidance.","GAAP operating expenses were $255 million in the second quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related charges, and other non-recurring items. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $204 million, at the upper end of our guidance and up $15 million from the prior quarter as we absorbed a full quarter of the Octoshape and Xerocole acquisitions and continue to make head count and infrastructure investments across the business, with the goal of driving both growth and scale.","Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $214 million, down $9 million from Q1 levels and down $10 million from the same period last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 40%, down two points from Q1 levels and down three points from the same period last year and coming in at the low end of our guidance range given our revenue and gross margin configuration.","GAAP depreciation and amortization expenses were $74 million in the second quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation associated with stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, and amortization of capitalized interest expense. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP depreciation was $64 million, up $3 million from Q1 levels and in line with guidance.","Non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter was $150 million, down $12 million from Q1 and down $5 million from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 28%, down three points from Q1 levels and down five points from the same period last year and in line with our guidance.","Moving on to the other income and expense items, interest income for the second quarter was roughly $3 million, down slightly from Q1 levels. Non-cash interest expense related to our convertible debt was roughly $5 million, also consistent with Q1 levels. As a reminder, this non-cash expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results.","Moving on to earnings, GAAP net income for the second quarter was $67 million or $0.37 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $102 million or $0.57 of earnings per diluted share and coming in at the midpoint of our guidance range.","For the quarter, total taxes included in our GAAP earnings were $35 million based on an effective tax rate of 34.5%. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $49 million, based on an effective tax rate of 32.5%, slightly lower than our guidance due to a revised full-year 2015 tax rate projection that reflects a higher mix of foreign earnings.","Finally, our weighted average diluted share count for the second quarter was 181 million shares, consistent with Q1 levels and in line with our guidance.","Now I'll review some balance sheet items. Days sales outstanding for the second quarter was 59 days, consistent with Q1 levels and down one day from the same period last year. Capital expenditures in Q2, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $107 million, slightly below the low end of our guidance for the quarter, primarily due to some planned network capacity investments shifting into Q3. As a reminder, this CapEx number includes capitalized software development activities.","Cash flow generation was strong in the second quarter, with free cash flow of $168 million or 31% of revenue. During the quarter we spent $63 million on share repurchases, buying just over 850,000 shares at an average price of $74. At the end of Q2, we had $308 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization.","Our balance sheet also remains very strong, with roughly $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on hand at the end of the quarter. If you factor in our convertible debt, our net cash is approximately $835 million.","As we've discussed the past, we believe the strength of our balance sheet and cash position is an important competitive differentiator that provides us the financial flexibility to make key investments at opportune times. As always, our overall goal is to deploy our capital in a manner we believe is in the best long-term interest of the company and our shareholders.","In summary, we executed well and in line with our expectations in Q2. We delivered solid revenue growth and made the investments in the business that we believe are necessary to build a foundation for sustained long-term growth and scale.","Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect continued foreign exchange headwinds to weigh on growth rates. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact on Q3 revenue of about $2 million compared to Q2, and $20 million compared to Q3 of last year.","In addition to currency headwinds, we anticipate a moderation in media growth rates for Q3. As we have discussed in the past, traffic volumes can vary from one quarter to the next given the size and timing of software releases as well as the adoption of social media and video platform capabilities. And as you will recall, our very strong Q3 results last year were driven by unseasonably strong traffic and revenue growth, with our largest and most strategic social media, gaming, and software download customers in particular. We are not expecting that same level of traffic volume uptick in this Q3, and anticipate traffic patterns consistent with what we've seen seasonally during the mid-summer months, specifically lower traffic volumes as people spend less time on the Internet. And while we expect a moderation in media growth rates this quarter, we remain bullish on the longer-term secular trends for this business going forward.","Factoring in both of these items, we are expecting Q3 revenue in the range of $543 million to $555 million. This range represents 13% to 15% growth adjusted for foreign exchange movements over an exceptionally strong Q3 of last year. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of 77% to 78% and GAAP gross margins of approximately 67%.","Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $205 million to $210 million, up slightly from Q2 levels.","Factoring in the various items I just mentioned, we anticipate Q3 EBITDA margins of 40%. And as I have been messaging, looking beyond Q3, we expect to operate the company in the 40% to 41% EBITDA range for the foreseeable future. However, to be transparent, EBITDA margins will be heavily dependent on several factors, including revenue volumes, possible M&A, spending on platform capacity in anticipation of greater demand for our over-the-top video delivery services, and foreign exchange movements.","Moving on to depreciation, we expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be $66 million to $67 million, up from Q2 levels, driven by our first half and planned Q3 network build-outs and the completion of several large software projects.","Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 27% to 28% in Q3. And with the overall revenue expense configuration I just outlined, we expect Q3 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.56 to $0.58. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $49 million to $51 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of roughly 33%. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 180 million shares.","On CapEx, we expect to spend approximately $95 million to $105 million in the quarter, excluding equity compensation. The elevated levels of CapEx this year are driven by our desire to increase our capacity to stay ahead of anticipated traffic growth on the network. For the full year, we are expecting to be slightly above the high end of our long-term model for CapEx as a percent of revenue. Because the revenue benefit from our network build-outs tends to trail the investment, our margins are expected to be slightly pressured in the near term, but we believe it is the right business decision to build out now to ensure that capacity is available to support the potential for significant growth in online video traffic in 2016 and beyond.","In closing, we delivered another solid quarter and first half of 2015, and we remain confident in our ability to execute on our plans for the long term.","Now let me turn the call back over to Tom.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Jim.","It's great to see Akamai building on our strong start to the year, and I'm very optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead. We believe that our solid financial performance is evidence of the sound fundamentals in our business strategy and the pivotal role that we play in the growth of the Internet.","We continue to provide unique value by focusing on solving four grand challenges for our customers: delivering video over the Internet with unsurpassed quality, scale, and affordability; providing near-instant performance for websites and apps on any device anywhere; protecting websites and data centers from cyberattacks that aim to disrupt their online operations, corrupt their data, or steal sensitive information; and scaling enterprise networks to handle new cloud workloads with high performance and low cost.","End users today expect to be able to consume any content anywhere, anytime, on any device, and they expect their online experience to be fast, reliable, and secure. If they're watching a video, then the picture needs to have high resolution and never rebuffer.","In response, the world's major broadcasters and Internet companies are working to create over-the-top, or OTT, services and packages for popular video content. This has the potential to create an enormous amount of traffic on the Internet. Typical subscribers watching OTT video delivered across the Akamai platform could consume 10 megabits per second or more of traffic while they're watching. This means that an audience size of only 5 million users, which is the equivalent of about four Nielsen points, could generate 50 terabits per second of demand, far more than we deliver today for all of our customers combined. And if OTT becomes commonplace, the demand could increase by an order of magnitude or more. This is why we are investing in growing the capacity of our platform and why we are working on new technologies to decrease the cost of delivering large volumes of video.","But making OTT successful involves a lot more than just capacity and scale. The quality of the viewing experience is also critically important. Delivering broadcast quality video over the Internet at scale is a lot harder than most people realize, especially considering the diversity of video formats, devices, operating systems, browsers, video players, DRM and ad insertion technologies, encoders, and carrier equipment in the ecosystem. And that's just for the landline Internet.","The problem is even harder when you try to deliver high-quality video over cellular networks. That's because cellular networks were originally built for voice, and voice uses about 1,000 times less capacity then video.","Akamai's video delivery solutions are designed to manage all the challenges of delivering OTT content for the world's leading broadcasters, content providers, and major Internet companies. Our unique approach of streaming content through servers in thousands of locations close to end users allows us to bypass congested peering points, resulting in a more reliable viewing experience for end users.","Our superior communication and video transport protocols are designed to enable a higher-quality picture, which is increasingly demanded by users and broadcasters alike. And our highly talented media R&D team is constantly working to ensure that our platform has the scale, quality, and affordability needed for OTT to become widely adopted.","We also believe that we are making good progress with integrating Octoshape's streaming optimization technology into our next generation of video delivery solutions, and we are confident that our combined capabilities and scale will differentiate Akamai from our many competitors and do-it-yourself efforts.","Akamai's unique global scale is achieved by partnering with the world's leading carriers. Just last week, we were very pleased to announce our new strategic partnership with Telecom Italia. As a result of this partnership, Telecom Italia will now be offering Akamai's full suite of services within the Italian market, including video delivery, web acceleration, and security.","Overall, Akamai has more than 1,400 network partners, and we have about 190,000 servers in thousands of locations across 111 countries. Of course, the scale of our globally distributed platform offers significant advantages over the competition and do-it-yourself efforts when it comes to delivering large volumes of content quickly and reliably. It also provides significant advantages in defending websites against cyberattacks.","In the past year alone, the number of DDoS attacks mitigated by Akamai has increased by more than 130%. Today, we are defending many of the world's leading brands against attacks that typically flood their sites with many tens of gigabits per second of malicious traffic, and the largest attacks now contain several hundred gigabits per second of traffic. These volumes are more than enough to overwhelm traditional security defenses in most any enterprise, and that is why so many enterprises are turning to Akamai for their web security needs. Our flagship security solutions, Kona Site Defender and Prolexic, are differentiated by their scale, their sophistication, and their ability to sustain performance in the face of such large-scale attacks.","Over the past three years, we have grown our quarterly security revenue from $4 million when we first launched Kona Site Defender to $61 million in Q2. We were particularly pleased to see our security business grow 44% over Q2 of last year, the first quarter that included the full benefit of the Prolexic acquisition. As a result, Akamai is now one of the few cloud-based security companies with an annual revenue run rate of more than $200 million.","Our growth has not gone unnoticed in the marketplace, and our security services are now being recognized by the leading independent research firms. In the last month, both Forrester and Gartner published research reports on the cybersecurity landscape that included Akamai. Forrester identified Akamai as a leader among DDoS service providers and scored Akamai as the top company in the strategy and market presence categories. Gartner cited Akamai's differentiated WAF [Web Application Firewall]-as-a-cloud service solution and made us one of only a few companies to move up and to the right in their Magic Quadrant. In addition, Gartner stated that by 2020, more than 60% of web apps will use WAF delivered from the cloud, up from less than 15% today, which we believe speaks to the large opportunity ahead for Akamai's security business.","Since cybersecurity is so vital to our customers, we are continuing to invest in the development of new and more capable security solutions. In May we launched our first Client Reputation service. Leveraging behavioral analytics and the huge volume of web traffic that Akamai handles every day, our new Client Reputation service identifies IP addresses that have attacked or abused customer websites. Customers are able to alert or block the identified malicious users based on a risk score derived from the history of their past actions. Client Reputation is designed to complement and extend the protection provided by Kona Site Defender by blocking traffic from users that have attacked any Akamai customer within the past 45 days. Initial customer reaction to this new services been very positive, with numerous customers purchasing the service in Q2.","We are also developing a suite of enterprise security solutions to detect and prevent phishing, malware, and data exfiltration attacks against enterprises. We expect the advanced recursive DNS technology that we acquired with Xerocole in February to play a significant role in these offerings, which we anticipate introducing into the market in 2016.","In summary, Akamai is off to a very solid start in the first half of 2015, and I'm very excited about the opportunities for growth that lie ahead.","Thank you for your time today. Now Jim and I will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Stand by for your first question, which comes from the line of Gray Powell from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, thanks for putting me up early in the lineup. I appreciate it. So maybe to start, what is your view on the rate and pace of over-the-top offerings? Do you see a point in time over the next six to 12 months when it has more of a direct or potentially accelerated impact on your business?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's really hard to predict the rate of adoption and when new OTT services will become available. But we are in conversations with the country's leading broadcasters, in fact, several global broadcasters and major Internet companies, and there's a lot of buzz out there and a lot of interest in bringing major video content online over-the-top. And that's already starting to have an impact on our financials in the sense that we're buying more CapEx and you see us be a little bit above our long-term plan in CapEx this year. And as we put that CapEx into co-lo and get it connected with bandwidth, there's some cost there. And we want to be in the position of being prepared.","There is the possibility that it could have a significant impact on our financials next year. We are taking risk in doing this because there's always a chance that the offerings will be delayed or there won't be as much uptake among the users and subscribers as people are hoping for, but we're willing to take that risk. The downside there is that if we just deploy the CapEx a little early we'll be using it within a year anyway, but we really want to be ready if OTT takes off as a lot of people think it might.","Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it, and then just one more on the cost side, if I may. So I understand that the EBITDA margin target remains in the 40% to 41% range. Can you help us think through the components there? I think that your new sales reps, that continues to grow at the same pace that you've seen over the last couple of years. Productivity should scale. I would assume the Prolexic margin should be improving. Can you just help us think through some of these incremental investments in the line items to keep margins at current levels? Thanks.","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I'll take that. So as you can imagine, with the network CapEx build-outs that Tom referenced, that's going to pressure margins in the near term, in particular gross margins, but obviously that affects EBITDA as well. We think it's the right business decision, so you can expect that \u2013 last year I think we ended at 79% gross margin in Q4. Obviously we were at 77% in Q2. We will probably be in the 77% to 78% range for the foreseeable future.","But we still plan to manage the company at the 40% to 41% level, which tells you we are going to continue to make investments in the business, across the business. We're going to continue to make investments in all the areas that we have been talking about. We'll continue to make investments in R&D. We'll continue to make investments in platform capacity. We'll continue to make investments in go-to-market. But we'll obviously be mindful of those investments and managing these investments within the context of the fact that we're doing pretty substantial build-outs now on the network side. So we are certainly mindful of that, but you can expect that we'll continue to make investments.","And as I mentioned, for the foreseeable future, we expect to be in the 40% to 41% EBITDA range, but that does depend upon the things that I mentioned. It depends upon what happens with revenue volumes. It depends upon if there's an M&A that we think is opportunistic and the right decision for the company that that may be altered. But we're telling you what we see right now. And if we execute the plan that we currently have, I think that we can operate in those levels.","Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Understood, okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, guys, one question and one follow-up. First on the OTT opportunity, I wasn't quite clear. Is this an expectation of closing incremental new customers to drive that growth or is it that you expect your existing customers to drive additional volume, or is it a combination?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think the majority of it would be a substantial increase from existing customers. Today we already service pretty much all the major broadcasters. And as they bring content over-the-top, that would be traffic that would make sense to put on the Akamai platform. And in some cases, you have the big Internet companies out there maybe offering bundles and packages, and pretty much they are already Akamai customers. It would be a new service for them potentially, but most of the major media brands already use Akamai. So I think less of new customers, more of new service and substantially increased traffic from our existing customer base.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, and then the one follow-up. If I heard you correctly in your prepared remarks, it sounds like the guidance here on revenue for the September quarter incorporates not only the tough compare but maybe some moving around of timing of major software releases, et cetera. Can you help clarify in terms of \u2013 while you're not guiding for December, how should we think about the seasonal sequential growth in the back half of this year versus what you've seen in previous years?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I'll take that. I'm certainly not going to guide for Q4. But to give you little more color on Q3, as you mentioned, and you've followed the company for a while, we had a very, very strong media quarter last Q3. The media business last Q3 grew 7% from Q2 to Q3. It's never grown at those rates. Admittedly, we've told you that traffic volumes vary from quarter to quarter. Sometimes you get big gaming releases. Sometimes you get big software updates. Sometimes there's an introduction of new capabilities on social media platforms. And so that really affects traffic volumes. And so certainly for Q3, we're not expecting those same level of volumes that we saw last year.","It's probably less the timing of a big software release because I don't think that it's necessarily just the timing of the releases; it's also the size of those releases. And so there's a bunch of factors that we've outlined in our Q3 guidance. I really would hesitate to give you Q4 guidance because a lot of things can happen in Q4 because of the holiday season. It's seasonally our biggest quarter, and we usually provide fairly wide ranges of revenue guidance in that quarter because it can be heavily influenced by holiday seasonality.","But for the third quarter, you can expect the media business is certainly going to moderate because we expect traffic volumes. And to be clear, because someone is probably going to ask me this question, well is it related to some big renewal of a large customer? It's not driven by renewals of large customers. This is just driven by an expectation that traffic volumes are going to be more seasonally light, which is what we tend to see in Q3, and we haven't seen that in the last couple sequential quarters for Q2 to Q3.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Steve Milunovich from UBS. Please go ahead.","Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Could you go a bit deeper into the year-over-year decline in gross margin? How much of that comes from incremental depreciation associated with CapEx? Are there other factors? What are you seeing in pricing and so forth?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, so year-over-year GAAP gross margins were down two points. Cash gross margins were down I think about a point. Certainly a point of that is depreciation. And as we mentioned, we've been doing some pretty substantive build-out of the network, so you can account for half of that. And as you can imagine, we've been doing very large build-out in the first half. And so as you deploy CapEx onto the network, you end up having a fair amount of incremental cost to actually get that CapEx deployed on the network. There are network build-out costs. There are resources that need to go provide installation of our CapEx into the various networks, and so we did see an uptick in that. And that's what lowered gross margins down a point on a cash basis, down two points on a GAAP basis.","As you saw for the guide for Q3, we think we're probably going to hover around those levels. They're not going to worsen. If anything, they're going to be flat to up a point is what I guided. So that's where I see things in the near term, that we're probably going operate in the 77% to 78% cash margin range and probably in the 67% range for GAAP gross margins for the next few quarters.","Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC","Regarding timing of software releases and so forth, I know you probably don't want to comment too specifically. But there's talk that the Windows 10 launch could \"break the Internet,\" and one assumes that you're among those CDNs being involved in that. Is that taken into account in your third quarter guidance?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I'm not going to specifically comment on the Windows 10 release or any particular customer, but you can expect that we have a very close relationship with all of our large software download customers, and we have factored into our guidance an expectation from all of them. As you can imagine, with any release, the rate and pace of adoption of those releases varies. So it's not just the timing as far as when the release is provided, but it's the adoption of that release from the customers. And just to comment on Windows in particular, I think that's anyone's guess relative to \u2013 I would say enterprises are probably going to be much slower to introduce a Windows 10 release. I would say consumers, it's really a wildcard. But you can expect that we've included in our guidance an expectation of all software updates accordingly.","Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Will Power from Robert Baird. Please go ahead.","William V. Power - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good afternoon, thanks. I guess two questions, if I may. I guess first, just maybe coming back to the media business, I wonder if you could just address what you're seeing from a competitive standpoint, both pricing and any potential lost share as you think about the traffic trends. I'll start with that.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think it's like it's always been. We've got a lot of competitors. The very biggest media companies will have a do-it-yourself effort in-house. Pricing is always important, very competitive there. The only I'd say major change has been over the last few years we've developed much closer and better relationships with many of the world's leading carriers, some of whom had large competitive or do-it-yourself efforts in the past and now have abandoned those efforts and decided to partner with Akamai. So that's been one, I think, change over the last few years, and that's been a favorable change. Akamai tends to have very strong share, and I think that's because of our quality, our scale, reliability, and affordability.","William V. Power - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then, Tom, you had alluded to in your prepared remarks some new Internet security offerings you're working on that I think you thought you might introduce sometime in 2016. I wonder if you could help frame for us either, A), how big those might be for you in 2016 and beyond, and just how you think about the size of those markets that you're going to start addressing beyond what you're perhaps addressing today?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Today our security business is on the Internet, and it doesn't extend inside the enterprise. And as we look to the future, as enterprises move more into the cloud, they're moving out into the Internet. And I think it's important for us to move into the enterprise networks with our security capabilities, and that's what we're developing today. I think it's pretty speculative, but it could be a very large market for us. As you know, phishing attacks are rampant. You have data exfiltration happening, almost daily headlines of massive exfiltration attacks being publicized, and these are areas where I think we can help.","And I think it potentially is a very large market for the industry as a whole, having cloud-based offerings that help defend enterprises against those attacks. And I think it could be a large area for Akamai several years into the future. Obviously, we're in development now. If we bring a product to market next year, you wouldn't expect revenue instantly. But as we look towards the end of the decade, we think that could be a large source of revenue for us, which of course is why we're making substantial investments there today.","William V. Power - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mike Olson from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Good afternoon. As far as international, are there any particular areas that you're focused on building out your sales head count, or would it be just the most obvious markets that would follow the U.S., like Western Europe? And I guess is there any risk that you're at all late to the game in any of those markets? In other words, are there incumbent competitors that have begun to dominate some of those international markets that will create a hurdle for growth? Thanks.","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We've been making, our sales force investments have been pretty much in all of our markets. I would say that we're already in a lot of call it the mature markets in Europe and the mature markets in Asia, so we're just fortifying our investments in those markets. But I wouldn't characterize it as I think that there's someone incumbent that's already been there and the opportunity is lessened. We certainly have competitors in every region. In some regions there are local regional competitors, but we wouldn't be making the investments outside of the U.S. like we have if we didn't think the market was there. We think that we're significantly underpenetrated in those markets, and we think there's significant room for growth there.","Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","All right, thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Horan from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks, Tom. Sorry to harp on this, but I think you said pricing is very competitive, and our research indicates that a lot of your competitors seem to be \u2013 you've had a few new competitors lately, and they seem to be putting a lot more investment into CDN. Has pricing gotten a little bit worse, do you think, or is it stable? I know in the past you said it's relatively stable.","And then also, Tom, can you just talk a little bit about your multicast video capabilities with Octoshape and maybe how that works, how unique is it, and what the demand looks like for it? Thanks.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I would say that the competitive environment is pretty steady, which means with media in particular and CDN, pricing steadily drops per bit delivered or per byte delivered. And it's always been that way and I expect it always will.","And in fact, we're working hard in development, and this leads into the Octoshape acquisition and their multicast and their client assisted delivery capabilities in bringing technologies to market that have an even lower cost basis in addition to having much higher quality at the same time. So I would say that pricing is \u2013 the decline in pricing is pretty stable. The level of competition is pretty stable. Traffic rises at a pretty fast clip, and pricing drops at a pretty steady clip. And then you take the product of those, and that's been leading to our revenue growth in media, which can have small fluctuations up or down in any given quarter, but generally has been a strong grower for Akamai.","Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","And how unique is Octoshape? What are the barriers to developing that technology that you had to acquire then? Thank you.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Octoshape has some really strong technology, first when it comes to ingress of live video where it comes from a single point, and that means you have a single point of failure. And so you really want to be sure that you get that live video stream at high quality, at high throughput, and there are no interruptions. And they have some very good communication protocols for that and some very good technology there.","They also have some excellent client-side technology, which is used in the video players for both watching events on the Internet and also watching events inside an enterprise, and that technology allows you to do it at a lower cost point and also higher quality. They've been at this for a long time, and in our judgment have done some very special things that we are now integrating into the Akamai platform. Some are already benefiting us, and some will be part of our next-generation video solutions.","Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turits from Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. Jim, the EBITDA margin if I did the math right still comes out even slightly below if you go out a decimal place to 40% to 41%. It sounds like that you have some caution on the EBITDA range going forward. So, A), in general, are you more cautious than you were on the EBITDA margin the next couple of quarters? And is there any impact from the two acquisitions that we should be backing out here?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Certainly, I mentioned that we did absorb the acquisitions in Q2, and so we have a full quarter impact in Q2. But in general for EBITDA, I would say my caution or my statements were more driven by making sure people have a consideration for what obviously is going to affect EBITDA; that we're making in particular some pretty significant investments in the network build-out which we believe are the right business decisions of the company. And while I believe we can operate the company in the 40% to 41% range, I also want to be mindful of the fact that we're not going to not make the appropriate investments in the business that we believe are the right business decisions for the company in the medium term and the long term.","There are a bunch of things that can affect that, as you know. The media business in particular can have variability. And so if traffic volumes downtick a little bit, we're going to be at the lower end of that range. And I just want to make sure that I'm signaling that we intend to operate in the 40% to 41% range. There are variables that could affect that. I mentioned a couple of them. It could be network build-out being more substantive. It could be an M&A that we think is the right M&A. and if it is an M&A that is dilutive to the EBITDA model but we think is the right strategic decision for the company, then we're going to do it. But I'd say what we see right now, Michael, I think we can operate the company in the 40% to 41% range.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then, Tom, if you back out the security piece from Performance and Security, just to generalize here the DSA portion of the Performance, a piece of it seems to still be growing constant currency in the low to mid-teens. I think that you had your eye on trying to reaccelerate that. Any thoughts on that?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, it's growing in the low to mid-teens. We'd like to see it grow faster, and we're putting a lot of development effort in terms of innovative capabilities around mobile acceleration. That's an area that's particularly challenged in terms of performance. And as you start to see the majority of use cases and transactions now moving to mobile, it becomes increasingly important to our customer base. You see the rapid adoption of mobile apps, and that's an area we're making investments in, and we would like to see that area grow faster.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Breen from William Blair. Please go ahead.","James D. Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking the question, just a couple. One, from a regulatory standpoint, given some of the interconnect deals that have happened in the space, does that impact your traffic at all over the next couple quarters?","And then with respect to over-the-top video, you guys have talked about having a long-term business model growing the high teens, 17% \u2013 18% top line over the next five years. Is it safe to assume that the investments you're making in OTT would be something that could push those growth rates higher than that range? Thanks.","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I'll take that. I don't think the regulatory environment has anything to do with an expectation of our traffic growth rates whatsoever, so I'm not quite sure what you're referring to there. But I would say that we have certainly talked about a long-term model for the company is that we believe that we have an ambition to hit $5 billion by 2020. And if you do the math on that, it means you need to grow the company around 17% on a compound annual growth rate. And we have a pretty broad portfolio between media, web performance, security, and some of the new emerging areas with the carrier and also in cloud networking. We might not necessarily get the pieces right, but each of those areas are growing significantly that we believe the combination of them is more than enough from a market opportunity perspective to grow the company at 17%.","If you look through the first several years of the decade, we've been able to do that. And our expectation is if we execute well that we're certainly not market opportunity constrained. This is about execution, and I think with the combination of offerings that we have that with good execution that I think that those aspirations still make sense.","James D. Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Does it seem as though the target beat could be even higher now given the amount of focus on over-the-top traffic?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I don't know. I would say that it's all about rate and pace. You can see an uptick in that for a period of time. I think the media business does have variability, as we've said, so I think that could fuel the media business. And yes, I guess if you hit on all cylinders and the media business starts to accelerate because of over-the-top and we get an acceleration and continued growth in our Security and Performance businesses and we start to get traction in the newer emerging businesses, you could. We're not calling that because we know that across all of our portfolio we think there's enough that if you look at the \u2013 if you flawlessly executed against every single area, yes, we could. But I think what we're calling is in general, we think 17% on a compound annual growth rate is probably where our aspiration is. We'd love to do better.","James D. Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Kelleher from D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.","Mark D. Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask about Cisco. How is that partnership progressing, and in general, just your efforts to move into the enterprise and through the firewalls? How is that progressing?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","The partnership is strong with Cisco. As you know, we launched, or they launched Akamai Connect, which is software, Akamai software that's on their new branch office router, and there is customer adoption there in their sales. The product works very well. I would say it's been a slow-ish start there. We'd like to see stronger adoption, and Cisco is actively working towards that.","Mark D. Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. These go ahead.","Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, this is Sanjit Singh for Keith Weiss. Tom, last quarter I think you mentioned in prior investment waves that there was a one to two-quarter lag in terms of revenue after the build-out. So heading into this particular with OTT, heading into this particular wave, is there more uncertainty about timing then you had versus past cycles?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","With OTT, I would say there's a fair amount of uncertainty. Usually the build-out is at least a couple quarters ahead, and then you have to see \u2013 or the service is launched to the subscribers by the service, and it takes time for that, so it can extend beyond a couple quarters. At this point, we are engaged in purchasing CapEx and doing build-out for 2016. And it's hard to know exactly if and when the services get launched and the adoption takes place that drives the traffic. There is a lot of buzz out there. There is excitement. I think a lot of folks in the industry think that this is going to start happening more, but it's hard to say exactly when. And that's certainly outside of our control, but we want to be ready to support our customers as they make those decisions and as they do get adoption.","Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I appreciate that. And then just to follow up on back to the media business, you guys have been very clear, at least in the first half of this year, about some of the tough year-over-year comparisons as it relates to renewals, as it relates to some of the big events and software releases that we had last year. But heading into the second half, I think this time last year you were also expecting more seasonal growth in Q3. You ended up having a very strong Q3 last year and having a very strong Q4 last year. So where, what were the factors if you can be more specific in terms of that we're driving the upside in Q3 and Q4 that you're just not anticipating into the second half of this year?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I'll take that. As I mentioned earlier, and I even mentioned it in our prepared remarks, traffic volumes are really driven by a bunch of things. But most notably they're driven by the timing and size of gaming releases, software updates, the introduction of new features on social media platforms. So it's not just the consumption of social media, but it's also the introduction of new capabilities that get offered. As well as obviously what Tom had referred to, which is beyond over-the-top, just ongoing video delivery services.","And I would say last year, what you had, it was pretty much all year, to be quite frank. We had a four-for-four on all of those that every quarter there seemed to be some large chunky gaming releases, large software updates. We saw introduction, not just more people consuming social media, but introduction of new features on social media and continuing growth in video delivery. So across all those areas is what fueled last year's media business to grow 21%. So we've said you're probably not going to grow the media business 21% every year. We just grew the media business 16% in Q1 and 17% in Q2, so pretty darn healthy growth rates off of what were very strong growth rates last year. So we're very pleased with the growth rate in the media business.","Yes, you're going to see a little bit of a moderation in Q3 of this year. I think we're not worried about it because traffic volumes can vary. I don't think the trends in what drives that business have changed. It's just you're going to go through a period here where it's just a little bit lighter than maybe it was last year. And as I mentioned earlier, someone else had asked, it's too early to call Q4 because a lot of things can happen in Q4. But I want to make sure we're clear that we are very bullish on the media business. And just because it's going to moderate here a little bit in Q3, I don't think it's a sign of the health of the business at all.","Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I appreciate the answer, Jim. Thanks.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Vijay Bhagavath from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks, guys. Hi, Tom, Jim, two questions. The first is around your opportunity in the enterprise. And where I'm coming from is we do have reasonable color from you on the TV over-the-top and the security opportunities. But we lack insights on how would Akamai view the enterprise as a longer-term growth opportunity, first part of the question.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think as a longer-term growth opportunity, it is very large for us. That's why we've been placing significant investments to develop products there. They're focused in two particular areas. The first is for enterprise networking to enable an enterprise to have greatly increased and improved connectivity into the branch offices, both using its WAN and also using the Internet, and also to be able to do that at a lower price point.","Many enterprises today need 10X the capacity they've got into their branch office, maybe even more as enterprise employees need to access video, to access the web directly without having to go back through the WAN into the central data center. And as they increasingly rely on the Internet, they need it to perform really well to do their jobs effectively. And enterprise networking is very expensive, and this is an area where I think we can really help. And our first offer there is Akamai Connect. Actually it's offered by Cisco. And we are working on additional offers that we hope to bring to market next year to further improve the capability of enterprise networks to be faster, more reliable, more scalable, and more cost effective.","The other area which we talked about a little bit before on the call is with enterprise security, and here there are two factors. One is the enterprise is a huge target today, people trying to steal confidential information, spread viruses, do very bad things, and we've all read the headlines of the consequences of some of those bad things. And the other aspect is that the enterprise is becoming more and more vulnerable because the employees are accessing the Internet more and more to do their jobs. And so as you access the Internet, you need to be able to secure the enterprise from attacks coming in through the Internet.","This is an area where we've got great expertise and have enjoyed a lot of success with the Internet side of this with our Kona Site Defender, our web app firewall, stopping DDoS attacks. And what we want to do is now bring that capability into the enterprise, to defend the enterprise employee and the enterprise infrastructure against attacks. So whereas our existing products like Kona Site Defender defend an application from bad things happening, now we'd like to defend the enterprise and the enterprise employees from bad things happening. And so those are the two areas we're focusing on for our enterprise products in the future. And I think the markets can be incredibly large there, and they can be very important for Akamai as we move later in the decade.","Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks, that's very helpful. And then a quick second part of the question is on security. Give us a snapshot on the hiring plans. We did hear from our own channel checks, the company looking to staff up security overlay sales specialists who talk the security vernacular. So how is it going in terms of security sales hires and investing behind demand on that? Thanks.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's been going well. We do have an overlay force, and we also train our existing sales force in security. And our goal is that every rep, whether you're a specialist or not, should be able to sell security. We're not there at 100% yet, but we have had good traction with security sales. And as you can see, being up 44% year over year off a number that included all of Prolexic was something that we were very happy with. And now going from near nothing a few years ago to over a $200 million trailing run rate, again, we're very happy with that. And that's a reflection on the success that the sales force has had in learning how to sell security. It takes a lot of effort, and not everybody has done it, but as a company we've had real success there, and that's great to see.","Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks, Tom. That's been very helpful.","Operator","And your next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Heather A. Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, thank you. I was wondering if we could talk a little bit about the growth in the indirect channel. I think you had \u2013 over a two-year period you signed up about nine partners, if we go back to the slide deck from your Analyst Day in February. And I think if I recall you had 49% growth in that segment in the year-ago period, and you guys mentioned that that helped drive a lot of media revenue. I'm just wondering how much of a tough comp is that creating for this year?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I'll take that. It does obviously create a tough comp. The channel business is actually growing faster than our direct business, and it grew faster than our direct business this quarter as well.","Heather A. Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","But is that growth rate decelerating materially?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's decelerating, but it's decelerating from I think a very, very high base. We signed up \u2013 all the partners that you mentioned, in particular the carrier partners, they're still our fastest growing channel. As I mentioned last year, one of the drivers of our growth rates last year in the channel was that in order to get some of these channel partners and carriers in particular, we ceded some of our direct customers to them. And so some of the growth rate that you saw last year was ceding them direct customers that they were actually able to grow even faster than we were able to grow on our own by expanding further offerings into them just based on their relationships with them. So yes, you're going to see a deceleration in the channel growth rates, but we're very pleased with the performance in the channel, and in particular pleased with the performance with our carrier partners in particular.","Heather A. Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And I just had one follow-up, if I could. In response to the question asked about getting to your 2020 target, and it sounds like based on your answer that over-the-top is factored into that number, given the cost of delivering that content is more than the other content you're serving now, does that mean the profitability picture or the EBITDA target in 2020 has to be altered somewhat?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, no. I think our EBITDA range reflects the fact that if you're going to have a higher weighting of media revenue, you'll obviously potentially be at the lower end of that range, but our media margins actually are very, very strong, as I share annually. Media EBITDA, media free cash flow very, very strong for the company. So I don't think it changes. Plus we have to be careful that we're in 2015 and the model is 2020, and so a lot can happen between now and then. So yes, over-the-top is likely to gain traction, but we're hoping that we're going to gain traction in other areas as well. So I'm not prepared to call that our media revenue mix is going to increase exponentially because I think we have growth opportunities outside of media as well.","Heather A. Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Colby A. Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Most of my questions were already asked, so I'll just try to be a little bit more pointed in mine. So the DSA product, that's the one area where if I look back to last year, you've probably more consistently missed our numbers, and that's where the miss was at least in our numbers for this quarter. I know that the question was asked about that, and you mentioned that you'd like to see it growing faster, but I was just wondering. What are you doing to actually grow that faster? Is the issue with the product set? You mentioned mobile. Is it not necessarily improving mobile speeds enough that people are wanting to buy it? Is it a sales execution issue? And when can we actually expect to see some improvement in that business?","And then my other question, if I go back to OTT, which I know has been talked a lot about, when I think about last quarter, you talked about increasing the CapEx spend with the expectation that that could drive OTT acceleration in the back half of 2015. Clearly, the press release and what you said on the call today indicates that you're now expecting that in 2016. Was that one or two particular OTT launches that you had anticipated to happen that just aren't happening, or has there been something else that's changed in your view of the outlook for OTT? Thanks.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, I'll take those. First, with DSA, DSA is a very successful product, and it has been growing substantially. Now what we're focusing on with DSA and with Ion Standard, which we launched last year, is making it much easier to use, making it be self- configurable so that it's a more rapid sales process and customers can buy more of it more easily. And with the Ion Premium offer, that's focused on really making it be super-fast. And as I mentioned before, we're investing heavily in the mobile environment, the cellular environment where it's especially hard to get good performance. And where that becomes a lot more important is you have more mobile apps more transactions going online to mobile devices.","With OTT, looking forward, as I said before, it's really hard to say for sure exactly when the various packages and offers will be coming online and predict how fast they'll be adopted by subscribers. As we look forward to the future now, we are confident enough that we're making the investments. You start see that in our financials. And as we look towards the potential revenue, I think 2016 seems like a promising time, but there's risk there. It's just impossible to say exactly when these offers become available and how fast the adoption will be.","Colby A. Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Smithen from Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thanks. I wanted to follow up on Colby's question on the DSA. You mentioned better retraining of the sales force and improved execution on security. Do you get the sense there's any cannibalization going on at the sales force level perhaps now that they find it easier to sell your security products and less attention is going to DSA?","And I guess the second question on that, when would you expect a product refresh on the DSA business?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. So I think there is some. It's not cannibalization per se. but as you see such great traction with security and it's the newer thing that yes, it does take more of our reps' interest. We've got a lot of focus on training there. And so I think it is possible that that's \u2013 you see such great growth there, and actually it's pretty respectable growth. We'd just like to see it better with the performance products and DSA.","And in terms of the product refresh, we launched Ion Standard and Ion Premier at the end of last year. We've had strong adoption there. Ion Standard is all about ease of use, rapid adoption, self-integration, and then a situational awareness so it works in any environment, with websites, whether you're accessing it with a mobile device or off a desktop. And with Ion Premium, really focused on really fast performance; everything you can do to make the website be faster, front-end optimization, adaptive image compression, so a focus on the ultimate in speed. And as I mentioned before, there's a lot of focus now in development around other things we can do for mobile devices, especially in the cellular environment. So the product \u2013 DSA is an existing product we've had for a long time, great product. Ion Standard and Premier launched at the end of last year, and we're making improvements to those products now.","Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Just a quick question on China. You have some partnerships over there that you've announced. What is the revenue opportunity for you there without a license? And is this an important market for you?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","China is an important market for us, obviously a very large market, and for our customers it's important. So we do a lot of delivery into China for our customers that are based outside of China. We do a much smaller but reasonable amount of delivery from customers in China to users outside of China. An area that we've not really tapped into yet is for domestic delivery for domestic businesses in China. That's a large market, and it's a market we hope to explore with partners. And as you know, we've announced relationships with CT and CU, and we'd very much like to work with the major carriers and the major partners in the region that do have licenses. And that's really the only way we can go to market inside of China being a non-Chinese company.","Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great, thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ed Maguire from CLSA. Please go ahead.","Edward Everett Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi, good afternoon. I was wondering if you could just provide a bit of color on how your partnerships with carriers are tracking. I know you had mentioned a couple of recent wins.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I would say we're very happy with the relationships that we have and are establishing with the world's major carriers. We talked before about the competitive situation, and I think that's one area that there has been substantial change. You go back four or five years ago, and many of the world's leading carriers were either directly competing with us or they had a do-it-yourself effort that they were using as some kind of CDN. And many of them have now changed. The internal effort maybe didn't work out as well as they hoped, the competitive efforts weren't as successful as they had hoped, and they decided to partner with Akamai instead. And we've been very pleased to see the progress with those relationships as that's happened.","I can think of one large domestic carrier that used to be very competitive with us and is now one of our largest resellers and a very happy partner with Akamai. And that's really critical I think as we go to the future because a lot of the people connect through the major carriers. A lot of the enterprise do their business through the major carriers, and it's great for us to have such a strong relationship with the world's major carriers.","Edward Everett Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC","Great. And just to follow up, in terms of investment for the rest of the year, I know you've committed to a lot of CapEx. But what are your thoughts on continued hiring plans for sales force expansion as we look in the next couple of quarters?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I would say that we are continuing to make investments across the business, so it's not just sales. As you know, we've made very, very significant investments in the sales force over the last several years. And so you can expect that probably the rate of sales adds is going to moderate here, but you can expect that across the business we're going to continue to make investments in the business.","Edward Everett Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC","Great, thank you.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call over to Tom Barth for closing remarks.","Tom Barth - Head-Investor Relations","Thank you, Steven. In closing, we will be participating in a number of investor conferences and events in August and September. Details of these can be found on the Investor Relations section of akamai.com.

Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Tom Barth","Great. Thank you, and good afternoon and thank you for joining Akamai's second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Ed McGowan, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.","Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on July 30, 2019. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances.","As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of akamai.com.","And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Leighton","Thanks Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. Akamai delivered excellent results in the second quarter coming in above expectations on both the top and bottom lines. Revenue was $705 million, up 6% over Q2 of last year and up 8% in constant currency. Q2 non-GAAP EPS was $1.07 per diluted share, up 29% year-over-year and up 32% in constant currency.","As has been the case in recent quarters, these very strong results were driven by the rapid growth of our cloud security and international businesses strong traffic growth in our media business and our continued focus on operational excellence.","Our adjusted EBITDA margin in Q2 was 42%, up three points over Q2 of last year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 29% also up three points over Q2 of last year. These results highlight the excellent progress that we've made towards our goal of achieving non-GAAP operating margins of 30% in 2020, while continuing to invest in innovation and new products to drive our future growth.","Our security portfolio was again the fastest-growing part of our business in Q2, achieving revenue of $205 million, up 34% year-over-year at constant currency. And Bot Manager continued to be our fastest selling new product in recent memory, with hundreds of customers and a revenue run rate now over $100 million per year.","Bot Manager is designed to defend websites and applications from bot attacks of all kinds, including credential abuse, account takeover and theft. It's been recognized as a market leader by top analyst firms such as Forrester and Frost & Sullivan and it's tightly integrated with another of our industry-leading security solutions Kona Site Defender.","Kona Site Defender provides a Web Application Firewall or WAF service that is designed to protect websites and applications from downtime, defacement and corruption of content, insertion of malware and theft of data. Kona has been recognized as a market leader by numerous analyst firms, including Gartner, Forrester and IDC. And in its research report on critical capabilities for cloud WAF, Gartner rated Akamai as the best among all vendors at protecting critical business applications and mobile applications.","Akamai's leadership in WAF services is important, because having a state-of-the-art and well-managed Web app firewall is vital for any major enterprise doing business on the Internet. Well over 1,000 customers are using Kona Site Defender today generating more than $300 million per year in revenue.","In addition to Bot Manager and Kona, we also have a third market-leading security product that's generating more than $100 million in annual revenue and that's Prolexic. Prolexic provides protection from DDoS attacks to hundreds of customers, including many of the world's largest financial institutions. As a result, Akamai's been recognized as a market leader in DDoS mitigation by analyst firms such as Forrester and IDC.","As you can see from the customer accounts that I just provided, there's plenty of room for more adoption of Kona, Prolexic, and Bot Manager by our installed base customers. These products are also driving a lot of our new customer acquisition. We're also very excited about the growth potential of our two newest security offers, Akamai Identity Cloud and Akamai Enterprise Defender.","Akamai Identity Cloud, which was formerly known as Janrain Identity Cloud, provides a complete suite of consumer identity and login management services. It's been recognized as the overall leader in the consumer identity and access management space by KuppingerCole, Europe's leading research firm in this area. Identity management was a key theme at our recent Edge World Customer Conference, where we were joined by a senior executive from Sanofi to explain why they selected Akamai Identity Cloud to manage identities across their global business.","Sanofi is one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies with operations in 170 countries and they chose Akamai Identity Cloud over the competition and in part because of its superior performance, enhanced security and ease of use. Akamai Enterprise Defender, which we formally launched at Edge World in June, is designed to provide a robust zero trust solution to protect enterprise applications from unauthorized access and data breaches. It's comprised of our Enterprise Application Access, Enterprise Threat Protector and Kona Site Defender products.","These products become even more essential as major enterprises move their data into the cloud, where it can be more challenging to ensure that proper access controls are in place. It's still early days for zero trust but already Akamai's enterprise security solutions are drawing attention in the marketplace. For example, Forrester cited Akamai as a powerhouse of capability in its report on zero trust providers.","Gartner cited Akamai in its market guide for zero trust network access, recommending that enterprises phase out legacy VPN access for high-risk use cases and begin phasing in zero trust access. And we're continuing to see significant customer wins at major enterprises like SKF. SKF is the world's largest manufacturer of bearings with 44,000 employees worldwide and they're now replacing their traditional VPN with our Enterprise Application Access solution.","In addition to having great products, Akamai's security portfolio is supported by great people in our services and support organization. We've heard of many instances where a misconfigured or outdated product has been the route to a data breach and this is an area where our hundreds of security experts can help. Akamai's substantial security expertise can make the difference between operating safely and suffering a devastating breach, especially as enterprises make greater use of public cloud infrastructure.","Akamai has six security operation centers around the world where vulnerabilities and attacks are detected and mitigated by our security experts before they can cause harm. Well over 1000 customers, including many large financial institutions, retailers and media companies, now use our managed security services and this generates another $100 million plus in annual revenue for Akamai.","Overall, we're very pleased with the success that we're having with our security portfolio and we believe that the best is yet to come. Our customers are now telling us that they see Akamai as more than just the world's largest CDN. Many view us as an Internet security partner and strategic adviser, whose cybersecurity capabilities work hand-in-hand with our delivery offerings. As a sign of this important evolution in our business, security accounted for 29% of our revenue in Q2, up from 23% a year ago. And we believe that we're on track to achieve a $1 billion run rate for our security solutions in the next year.","As measured by security revenue, Akamai is now one of the world's largest public cybersecurity companies and arguably the largest when it comes to providing cloud security services. Changing topics, I'd now like to say a few words about our Media business, which also performed well in the second quarter. We continue to grow traffic faster in Q2 than published growth rates for the Internet as a whole, which means that we continue to gain share. Online viewing of live sports in particular has grown dramatically this year.","On July 9, the ICC's Cricket World Cup semifinal between India and New Zealand attracted over 25 million concurrent viewers to the Akamai platform. That's 36% more than our previous record set in May and it's triple the peak that we reached in May of last year. The growth in video traffic and the enormous scale provided by Akamai's unique Edge platform were major topics of interest at our customer conference.","There was also substantial interest in how our Edge platform will provide even greater benefit to our customers as 5G becomes widespread. That's because 5G is expected to connect hundreds of millions of people and many billions of devices to the Internet. And once 5G is deployed at scale, it should vastly improve the bandwidth and latency in the last mile.","But to take advantage of this capability and to not be overwhelmed by the resulting increase in traffic, you need servers close to the last mile at the Edge of the Internet and this is where Akamai really is unique with 4,000 points of presence in more than 1,000 cities across 140 countries. It's taken a while, but the industry has now come to recognize that having infrastructure at the Edge is critical for scale, performance and security.","Of course now that leading analysts are talking about the importance of the Edge, several of our competitors are suddenly claiming to have Edge networks and Edge services too. But they aren't at the Edge at all. They're located in tangent data centers in the core of the Internet just as they've always been.","Looking back at Q2, we're very pleased with our results and the strong momentum that we've established in the first half of the year. It's very good to see the impressive revenue growth for our security products, the high traffic growth in our CDN business, our strong growth and opportunity in international markets and our continued robust operating margins. We're especially pleased that our non-GAAP EPS grew more than 30% in constant currency for the fifth consecutive quarter even while we continue to invest in innovation and new products to drive our future growth.","In Q2, we also welcomed Madhu Ranganathan to our Board. Madhu has extensive financial experience at global software, networking and services companies and we're very pleased to have her join our Board's Audit and Finance Committees.","Now we'll turn the call over to Ed to review our Q2 results and guidance for the remainder of the year. Ed?","Ed McGowan","Thank you, Tom. As Tom outlined Akamai delivered another excellent quarter in Q2. We were very pleased to exceed the high end of our guidance range on revenue, operating margin and earnings and we remain confident in our ability to achieve our goal of 30% non-GAAP operating margins in 2020.","Q2 revenue was $705 million up 6% year-over-year or 8% in constant currency driven by strong security growth and higher-than-expected OTT video traffic. Revenue from our Web division was $380 million up 8% year-over-year or 10% in constant currency.","Revenue growth for this group of customers continued to be driven by our strong security business where we saw strong performance across multiple security offerings including Bot Manager, Kona Site Defender and Prolexic. In addition, we continue to see a very solid year-over-year growth in both the Asia Pacific region and in EMEA.","Revenue from our Media and Carrier Division was $325 million up 4% year-over-year or 6% in constant currency. The better-than-expected growth in Q2 came from continued very strong momentum in security and higher-than-expected OTT video traffic as we gain share in a few key customers during the quarter.","Revenue from the Internet Platform Customers, which is included in our Media and Carrier Division was $46 million up 5% from the prior year. Q2 revenue from this group of customers was slightly ahead of our projections due to higher-than-expected download in video traffic.","Turning now to our total company security products revenue. Security revenue for the second quarter was $205 million up 32% year-over-year or 34% in constant currency. We are very pleased to see that our significant investments in security are paying off.","Moving on to revenue by geography. Sales in our international markets continue to be strong and represented 41% of total revenue in Q2 up 3 points from Q2 2018 and consistent with Q1 levels.","International revenue was $288 million in the second quarter up 15% year-over-year or 20% in constant currency. We again saw strong growth in our Asia-Pacific region and continued steady results in our EMEA region. As Tom mentioned earlier, we have seen significant traction with our investments overseas and we plan to continue to invest internationally in order to take advantage of our unmatched global scale, reach and product portfolio.","Foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact on revenue of $2 million on a sequential basis and $11 million on a year-over-year basis. Finally, revenue from our U.S. market was $417 million up 1% year-over-year which is a two point improvement from year-over-year growth in the first quarter.","Moving on to costs. Cash gross margin was 77% down 1 point from Q1 levels and consistent with the same period last year. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation was 66% consistent with Q1 levels. ","Non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $254 million, up $1 million from Q1 levels and slightly below our guidance due to continued focus on operational efficiencies and some early returns from our enhanced procurement function we introduced earlier this year.","Now moving on to profitability, adjusted EBITDA was $293 million, down $6 million from Q1 level, but up $31 million or 12% from the same period in 2018. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 42% consistent with Q1, up 3 points from Q2 2018 and above the high end of our guidance range.","Non-GAAP operating income was $204 million, down $5 million from Q1 levels, but up $34 million or 20% from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 29%, down 1 point from Q1 levels, up 3 points from Q2 last year, and above our high -- above our guidance range.","Capital expenditures in Q2, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense were $153 million. This was slightly below our guidance range due to some spend related to our new headquarters that shifted into Q3.","Moving on to earnings, GAAP net income for the second quarter was $114 million or $0.69 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $176 million or $1.07 of earnings per diluted share, up 29% year-over-year or up 32% in constant currency and $0.05 above the high end of our guidance range.","Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $34 million based on a Q2 effective tax rate of 16%. This effective tax rate is 1 point lower than our guidance due to a higher percentage of foreign earnings.","Now, I will discuss some balance sheet items. We continue to have a very strong balance sheet. As of June 30, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, totaled $1.3 billion, up $109 million from the end of Q1, an increase driven by strong free cash flow of $185 million or 26% of revenue. Our total debt at the end of Q2 was $1.2 billion, reflecting the senior convertible notes that will be due in May of 2025.","Now I will review our use of capital. We continue to focus on the importance of returning capital to shareholders. During the second quarter, we spent $81 million on share repurchases buying back approximately 1.1 million shares. Our aim remains to fully offset our equity compensation dilution during 2019. We have approximately $1 million remaining on our previously announced share repurchase authorization.","We intend to continue return a large percentage of free cash flow through share repurchases, balanced against preserving our flexibility for strategic opportunities. We believe our disciplined and balanced capital allocation approach will allow us to continue to drive shareholder value through investing organically in the business, pursuing M&A and continued share repurchases. In summary, we are very pleased with our Q2 and first half results, and we remain confident in our ability to execute on our plans for the long-term.","I'd now like to provide Q3 guidance and update our previous 2019 guidance. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we are projecting another solid quarter on both the top and bottom lines. As a reminder, in Q3, we faced the normal summer month traffic seasonality, especially in our Media business.","And we expect further FX headwinds. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact of approximately $4 million to $5 million compared to Q3 of 2018, and a negative impact of approximately $1 million sequentially.","Therefore, we are estimating Q3 revenues to be in the range of $692 million to $706 million, up 4% to 6% in constant currency over Q3 2018. It is worth noting that we renewed two of our Internet Platform Customers at the end of Q2.","We expect our Internet platform accounts to decline in Q3 by approximately $4 million, which we have factored into our guidance. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of 77% to 78%.","Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $257 million to $261 million. This uptick from second quarter spend levels is driven by the expiration of the Limelight patent royalty payments, higher expenses related to our new headquarters facility and our annual employees' salary merit increase, which takes place at the beginning of Q3.","Factoring in the cash gross margin and operating expense expectation, I just provided, we anticipate Q3 EBITDA margins in the range of 40% to 41%.","Moving now to depreciation, we expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $89 million to $91 million. Factoring in this guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 27% to 28% for Q3.","Moving on to CapEx. We expect to spend approximately $170 million to $178 million excluding equity compensation in the third quarter. This includes approximately $31 million related to the continued build-out of our new headquarters as well as a more significant network investment in anticipation of increased OTT traffic in 2020.","And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q3 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.98 to $1.02 or up 6% to 11% in constant currency. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $32 million to $36 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 17%. It also reflects a fully diluted share count of 165 million shares.","Looking ahead to the full-year, we are increasing both our revenue and EPS guidance. On the revenue side, we are increasing our range to $2.84 billion to $2.87 billion, which is an increase of approximately $15 million at the midpoint of the range compared to our previous guidance.","As a reminder, Q4 tends to have the widest range of outcomes given the large role that holiday seasonality plays with both online retail activity for our e-commerce customers and traffic for our large media customers. For the full-year, we anticipate adjusted EBITDA margins of 41% to 42%. We expect 2019 non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 28% to 29%.","Moving on to CapEx. Full-year, CapEx is expected to be 20% to 21% of revenue. And included in our CapEx spend is roughly $100 million of onetime costs related to the buildout of our new headquarters. Excluding this spend we project the full year CapEx to be at the high end of our long-term model of 16% to 17% due to increased network build-out in anticipation of more significant OTT traffic in 2020.","Moving on to EPS. We are increasing our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share range to $4.23 to $4.30 for the full year 2019 which is up $0.14 at the midpoint compared to our previous guidance. Our guidance assumes a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 16% to 17% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 165 million shares.","In summary, we are pleased with our performance of the business in the first half of 2019 as well as our ability to again increase our guidance for the full year.","Thank you. And Tom and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Brandon Nispel from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Pardon me, Brandon, please check your mute button.","Brandon Nispel","Sorry. Yeah, it was on mute. Can you guys update your guidance in terms of the CDN revenue growth and the Cloud Security revenue growth for this year? Then maybe if you could also just break down what the enterprise security is with the new business that would be great? Thanks.","Ed McGowan","Yes, so this is Ed. I'll take that. So for the cloud security business, we had previously guided the mid-20% range. We now take that up to mid to high 20% range. And the CDN will still be flattish for the year. So in enterprise security, so we don't break out enterprise security as of now. That's still a pretty small percentage of our total security revenue. As it gets more material we'll break that out.","Brandon Nispel","And then I guess a second follow-up. Has -- you announced some new agreements with two of your IPC customers. Can you just help us understand maybe the change in those agreements? And then any update on your thoughts in terms of the new streaming services that are coming in 2020? Thanks.","Tom Leighton","Sure. So with the giants, the Internet platform customers I talked about having two customers that renew. This is pretty standard. It's really just a contract that comes up for renewal. We're just negotiating pricing. I talk about how we expect to see those customers decline in Q3, but I do expect that group of customers to grow from Q3 levels into Q2. We will pick up a little bit more share with one of them and we expect to see pretty strong seasonality in Q4 with the rest of them.","But again, that's pretty normal. So as you think about that group that's customers the contracts come up for renewal we'll have the price down generally we get more traffic. But again, we'll be down $4 million roughly in Q3 and then up again in Q4. And in terms of the new streaming services, so I guess the best way to talk about this one is we talked earlier about how we had a number of customers that we're renewing in Q2, Q1 and Q2 that were large consolidations of the marketplace some of whom have announced new streaming offerings.","The good news is that's now behind us. So we've renewed all of those customers. And we talked a bit about updating our CapEx to build out anticipation for what we expect to be some increase in demand.","It's really hard to predict exactly how successful these launches will be. We'll have to wait and see. Tom and I talked about, being cautious here. And making sure that, we build out and advance.","So to the extent there is volume, we're there to take as much volume as we can. And to the extent that it doesn't pan out our core traffic is growing so we can just grow into that additional CapEx.","So I think we're really well prepared for it. We'll give you an update certainly on our Q4 call, as we start to see some of this traffic come online in Q4. And we'll get a better sense of what the next year looks like.","Brandon Nispel","Great, thanks Ed.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Sterling Auty","Yeah, thanks. Hi guys. Wanted to see if you can give us an update on, what's the early progress and traction with Janrain or now the Akamai Identity Solution?","Tom Leighton","Doing well and grew the quarter. It's still early days. We're integrating it with our Bot Manager Solution, to provide a more comprehensive capability. And understanding really who is logging in, making sure it's the person we expect.","Managing the user's data, in a secure way, so it can't be stolen, but I would say, early days, and looking positive.","Sterling Auty","And then, one follow-up on the media side, I think there is a comment about gaining share in some key customers. Is there some additional color that you can give us on that front?","Ed McGowan","Yeah. Sure Sterling. Yeah during the quarter we actually and with some of our U.S. customers were able to pick up additional share. In the Media space, the share shifts based on number of factors.","One of which is better performance. And the Media team's done a great job of really focusing with some of those large customers, on improving performance specifically for the use type that they have, whether it be live video, or video that's on various devices, so that we can pick up some additional share. So we were pretty happy to see that, that part of what put us over the range for the quarter.","Sterling Auty","All right, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Heather Bellini","Great, thank you so much for taking my question. I had 2 if I may. First one was going to be, you obviously mentioned the growth with the Internet Platform Customers on that CDN side.","I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about, the trends in the business ex-the big 5. With that segment being down, I think it was 2% year-over-year this quarter and down 2% last quarter.","Is there anything you can give us color on, about how we should expect the balance of that business ex the big 5 to trend? And then, just had a follow-up on, the Janrain, question. Was wondering who you're typically seeing in competitive RFPs with them?","And if there's any update on, revenue contribution if it did better than your expectations for the quarter. Thank you.","Ed McGowan","Yeah. Heather, I'll take the first one here on the business excluding the giants. So yes you're correct it was down, 1% or 2% this quarter. And that was as expected. We had talked about earlier, how we have some major customers on the media side that were we were renewing in Q1 and Q2.","So that has is as expected. And given they were kind of getting into a seasonally, low quarter expect that to be flattish. You probably increase 1% or 2% in Q4 with our strong seasonality.","But I think another way to look at it is, what is a catalyst that can potentially drive that business higher and I think as we look at 2020, you've got a number of factors whether it's the an even year where you have more traffic associated with things like the Olympics, the presidential Olympic -- the presidential election excuse me.","And you also have a number of OTT offerings. So in that business where it's primarily driven by traffic, traffic growth offsets, your pricing is decline that's essentially the math there.","So, when a year where you see accelerating traffic, that's when you start to get into a bit of acceleration in growth. So that's what we'll be looking for.","Tom Leighton","Yeah. And in terms of Janrain, the large majority of our prospects were competing with a homegrown solution, or do-it-yourself. And the challenge they're seeing is they grow their business of scaling the homegrown solution, getting performance out of it. It can be hard to use and security is a big deal.","And you're dealing with very personal user data. And so security is really important there. When we do see a competitor come into the account typically it would be Gigya, we'd see and occasionally Okta.","Okta really works more on the enterprise side of the house. But they do have some capability on the consumer side. And I would say, most often it's a do-it-yourself solution that the customer has. And the revenue question, yeah our revenue there is in line with expectations.","Heather Bellini","Great, thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Tim Horan for Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Tim Horan","Thanks guys. Tom any more color on edge-based compute? Do customers understand how unique your infrastructure is? And are they starting to utilize it or maybe what applications or just any other color? When it might really start to take off? Thanks.","Tom Leighton","Yeah. We've been supporting edge compute in various forms for almost 20 years. At our Edge World Customer Conference we talked a lot about our new Edge worker solution which gives them even greater capabilities over and above Edge side and includes in cloudlets.","And we also demonstrated -- our new IoT Edge Connect solution which has message broker support -- MQTT support and also compute at the Edge in the IoT model. So there's a lot of interest in that. I think the interest will increase more especially as you see more IoT applications out there. There was a lot of buzz among our customers as talking about the IoT applications they're working on.","Clothing companies or sneaker companies talking about putting sensors in your shoes or clothes. Our airline customers are sensing when you get to the airport so they can update you automatically on your flight. Merchandisers tagging items for sale so they can keep track of it and have automated checkout. So -- and I think 5G is going to help enable a lot of these applications that people are talking about now.","And that -- Edge compute is a big part of that because you have to do a processing of data sometimes at a massive scale, latency can make a big difference especially with gaming consoles or automobiles when those are the devices that are on the Internet of things. And I do think people are really starting to realize just how important our Edge platform is. And not just for delivering content, but doing compute and certainly for security.","Tim Horan","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Sanjit Singh","Thank you. This is Sanjit Singh for Keith. And congrats on the great security results this quarter. I actually had a question on the OTT business. I was wondering if you give us a sense of how your typical OTT deal is structured in terms of are those typically single source, dual source or triple sourced. And then in terms of thinking about how is revenue contracted if that going to be a pure function of subscribers or are there sort of minimum contracts associated with some of these streaming services that are being launched in the coming months?","Ed McGowan","Sure. So I'll take that one, Tom. There really is no typical deal they're all pretty unique. Most customers in the large OTT space do use multiple source whether they do it themselves or have multiple CDNs. Your typical contract if there is such a thing it really depends. I mean, typically we'll sign-up for anywhere from one year to two years contract length volume based pricing based on the traffic that comes over the network when it comes into delivery. All of our other services whether its security, professional services et cetera are priced in a different manner.","And in terms of the, I guess, the volume commitment that can vary as well. And that also is a factor in terms of the unit pricing. In this world, we're trying to get as much share as you possibly can given the fact that we've got the most amount of capacity and we've got capacity in all the right places around the world. We typically do pretty well in a multi-CDN environment in terms of getting share. That's basically the way those OTT contracts work.","Sanjit Singh","Understood. Then maybe a follow-up question maybe on the topic of taking share. I think for a number of years now what we're used to is when big contracts come up for renewal that gives an opportunity for Akamai to take share. But that results in a little bit of a revenue headwind. I mean in the near-term are there any initiatives, I think, you guys described this a little bit at the investor meeting a couple of months ago, the initiatives to sort of smooth that cadence out. I think you have zero coverage out there, but what are the things that could be done to maybe create less of a revenue headwind when some of these contracts can't get repriced? And anything that can be done on that side of the house?","Ed McGowan","Yes, great question. So I think one of the things that we've seen and the Media team has done a great job here of selling security. It was a vertical where we didn't have a lot of security penetration. And we've seen enormous growth in our security business across many sell verticals within the media space whether it's your OTT video space, your publishers, your gaming customers et cetera. ","So what does that fills in some of the hole in terms of the revenue decline. Because obviously, you'd take a price decline and then traffic will ramp over time. Generally, as I talked in the earlier question around commitments sometimes getting larger commitments to get guaranteed share is a way to also offset some of the revenue declines.","Sanjit Singh","Got it. Appreciate it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Colby Synesael from Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Colby Synesael","Great. Thank you. Just looking at the difference in growth rates across the different geographies. Obviously, the U.S. has been much slower for some time now relative to various international geographies. Is the slower growth in the U.S. really just a function of the maturity of the business model in this market, or is it really a reflection of just a greater level of competition that you're seeing? And I'm speaking ex the big 6.","And then secondly as it relates to the big 6, I had in my notes that you were expecting one price renewal in the second quarter. I could have had that wrong. And I think you said that there were two. Just what that is that the backdrop, are there any other large big six price renewals that you are anticipating for the remainder of this year? Thank you.","Ed McGowan","Why don't we take the last question first, so in terms of the price renewals, we had talked about -- we actually didn't call out the big six price renewals. And the reason we didn't do that was given the fact that there's only six customers, so we don't want to single that out. What we had talked about was, there were a number of consolidations, we talked about the beginning of the year that were up for renewal in Q1 and Q2 so there was one remaining in Q2 and that is now done. So we're done with that. As far as the question on the big 6, what I would say is, any activity that we anticipate in the big six has been factored into our guidance. I don't want to get into specifics of additional timing around revenue but I did talk about declining revenue this quarter related to the renewals we did in Q2 and then in Q4 we expect to grow.","In the U.S., the question around U.S. growth, just couple of things to keep in mind with the U.S. growth rate. This is the area within the Web business where we have the most pressure from a macroeconomic standpoint with our U.S. commerce retail vertical, which is a pretty significant vertical for us so that's put some pressure on the U.S. growth. This is also where those renewals I talk about in Media sit as well where you've got some price pressure we have to go through here in the first half of the year. So that's also put some pressure on our growth rate as well.","And I just if you look at some compares last year in Q1, we had the Olympics in Q1 of last year, which did not repeat this year as we saw some softness in Q1. And then also we had a very strong Nominum quarter in Q1 of last year which didn't repeat in Q1 this year and has been tread in line with what we expected here in Q2. So those are some of the factors that you have to take into consideration. Now I know you said you excluded the giants, but the giants are in the U.S. So anytime we see some pressure there, you'll see our total company U.S. growth rate decline a bit.","Colby Synesael","Great. Thank you very much, Ed.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brad Zelnick from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Brad Zelnick","Excellent. Thank you so much for taking the questions. I've got two. First, what's giving you the incremental confidence from three months ago to tick up your CapEx into the back half of the year ahead of the OTT traffic you're expecting next year? And while I don't expect you'll provide guidance for next year, how would you frame the opportunity you're playing for in CDN? Perhaps your view of what the dollar market growth opportunity looks like?","Ed McGowan","Yes, hey Brad. Yes, I don't want to provide specific guidance. The only reason I don't want to do that is just that it's somewhat out of our control the user adoption. Obviously, very, very powerful brands, which gives us confidence to say that we believe that there'll be some significant traffic to gain. We have good relationships with all the players that are announcing OTT offerings. We can't control the timing, we can't control the user adoption. So it's hard for us to sit here and say that there's a big number because it becomes somewhat binary. If I call out a big number in traffic for next year for one or two of those and it doesn't show up it's hard to make it out.","So we'll update you in Q4 and much better view of guidance on revenue. On the CapEx side, it's a more simple calculation for us. As we look at planning out for our network build we've got a core business is growing fairly nicely from a traffic perspective. And strategically we want to be positioned to be able to take as much traffic as possible. If these services do take off and are widely successful, we are in a much better position because we have the largest network. We have the most capacity. We have capacity in the right locations. So strategically it makes sense for us to do that.","As I mentioned, if we're wrong and the traffic doesn't really materialize, we can grow into it and take our CapEx down for next year so. Now as we talked about it as a team we thought it was the right bet to make to position us for that growth. And again, I just don't want to speculate right now until we start to see some of that traffic exactly how big that will be.","Brad Zelnick","That's fair and I appreciate the color. And Ed it's good to hear today's commentary recommitting to 30% operating margins in 2020. But as we look beyond 2020, how do you think about the margin potential of the business? And is there any reason Akamai can't get back to the mid-30s type op margins where it was a decade or so ago?","Ed McGowan","Yes, we're not going to give guidance beyond 2020 or a 30% operating margin. We also always want to operate as efficiently as we can and there are certainly scenarios where the margins could increase beyond 30%. But we're not going to give any comments on that today.","Brad Zelnick","Fair enough. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from James Fish from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","James Fish","Hey, guys. Thanks for the question and awesome quarter. One thing as I look at your Q3 guide for the top line, you're guiding down sequentially and yet Akamai has really never been going -- has never had a sequential decrease from Q2 to Q3. Can you just help us bridge that?","Ed McGowan","Sure. So one of the items is the fact that you have the giants, the Internet Platform Customers, excuse me, that are down will be down about $4 million sequential so you take that into consideration. Now the other thing is the FX headwinds, we're expecting at least another $1 million of headwind there. That's something just to dig in a little bit on the FX side, you've got about 40% of our business is outside the U.S. and not all of that is in non-U.S. dollar now maybe of that is. And we've got if you think about our major currencies, you've got the euro, the yen and the pound as the three big ones. And there's obviously a lot of pressure, especially in the pound. So, some FX headwinds there.","And then the other thing, if you remember from last Q3, we had the World Cup. So that added some extra dollars into Q3 of last year. So you factor all that together, you can see why we're still guiding to at the midpoint down slightly at the high end roughly flat.","James Fish","Got you. And then one more for Tom probably, maybe could you talk about how the new online gaming streaming services that are coming out, can you about how Akamai can monetize on that traffic, and what needs to be done from a tech perspective in order to deliver that traffic with nearly zero latency given the nature of online gaming?","Tom Leighton","Well, yeah, you'd have to be delivering it from the Edge that's where we're located. So, we're in good position to help with that. And I think we have a great relationship with a lot of the gaming companies. I think in terms of Google's service, they probably do it themselves.","We've really been having discussions about that capability for probably over a decade now with some of the world's largest gaming companies. And the challenge, I think, for them is the economics. In terms of who's paying for the CPU, who's paying for the bandwidth, who's paying for the co-lo.","Now, Akamai can certainly handle the streaming with very low latency and at scale, and do a really good job of it. So if this does take off, that's a source of increased traffic for Akamai, which is a good thing.","James Fish","Great. Thanks. Great quarter, guys.","Tom Leighton","Thanks.","Ed McGowan","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Mahaney from RBC. Your line is now open.","Mark Mahaney","Great. Two questions please. I know a couple have already asked about Janrain, but just to nail the point down. You're still expecting about $20 million in revenue from that this year, and the contribution in the June quarter was roughly $4 million to $5 million. Is that correct?","Ed McGowan","That's correct, Mark. It was about $5.5 million for the quarter, and we're still expecting approximately $20 million for the whole year.","Mark Mahaney","And then Tom, you had mentioned 5G early on. And maybe paint that picture a little bit more -- with a little bit more detail like, when do you think that could become material in the field, and when you think it could be material? Like I get the Akamai pitch of you need have to servers at the Edge, and there -- this really could open up a new era of even more intense applications and we're realizing today, and IoT is probably getting to the forefront of that. But when do you think you can actually come through for Akamai in terms of material new wins or more business with existing customers? Any more color on that would be appreciated. Thank you.","Tom Leighton","Yeah. I think it'll be gradual. And to coincide with the gradual deployment of 5G around the world, basically the way to think of 5G is it increases the throughput at the last mile and it decreases the latency. Now increasing the throughput, and also it gets more people connected.","Now doing that increases the demand for traffic, and that's just existing business growing faster because of 5G. Having in addition, the decreased latency and the better scale in terms of how many connections can be supported, does help to enable IoT kinds of applications, and that's where I think you can see things that maybe we haven't even thought about yet in terms of IoT.","To this point IoT has been a little bit of a buzzword. And I think just judging from what I see in the customer base, that's going to start to get more real. And you need to take advantage of that low latency that means you got to have servers at the Edge where Akamai is. And so, we're in a great position, especially with our IoT Edge Connect platform to support those applications at scale with low latency and to offer Compute at the Edge.","So, I think it will be not all at once. It will be sort of a steady growth both for our organic business and for new applications in our IoT Edge Connect platform, that's now just a question in early days.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff van Rhee from Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open.","Jeff Van Rhee","Great. Thanks. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. A few for me. On the retail commerce side of the business, could you talk about the dynamics in that space, particularly the competitive landscape? And then, just some thoughts maybe on how you see growth rates trending over the next few years.","Tom Barth","Well, there's certainly a lot of competition in the CDN space, and always has been. I think the fundamental change is that our customer's under pressure, from Amazon in particular and that puts them in a harder position. And so that decreases their business and put pressure on our revenue as really a flagship vertical for Akamai. They still need our services. They still need the best performance. They really need security and they want that of course as a packaged capability and that helps us.","And that's why I think our churn is incredibly low. So despite the fact they're under pressure, we do have some of them going bankrupt. We see very little loss to any of the many competitors that are trying to get some of that business. A very, very high percentage of the major retailers out there use Akamai. And I -- every indication is that that should continue, but their businesses are under pressure. And that puts our revenue under pressure.","Tom Leighton","If I could just add something on this in terms of your question around growth, Tom mentioned the pressure will still continue on the core business on the delivery business. But the Web team's done a great job of going in and selling security similar to what I talked about with the Media team and should see some of these price declines our security revenue in the commerce space is growing, which is great. So taking the pressure on the acceleration business, but augmenting some of that in the security side.","Jeff van Rhee","Got it. Great. And then on the enterprise side, just can you talk about the sales motion close rates as you develop that sales org? Just maybe some color as to how that organization has matured what still needs to be done?","Tom Leighton","Yeah. We have a advanced technology group that they have expertise on the enterprise security side of the house. And they've worked with the reps on our existing accounts and new prospects. So it's -- I would say a typical sales motion for a new capability. It's early days for zero trust.","You're now talking to enterprises who manage their enterprise security one way for a long, long time. There is the notion of the moat around the castle perimeter defense and it doesn't work anymore. And it's going to take them some time to really change, and so we're seeing early major enterprise wins, which is great. And we're growing -- the bookings are increasing year-over-year.","And I think there will come a time in the not-too-distant future where we really see very strong growth here. Already the major analysts are out there zero trust is the way to go I gave some quotes during my prepared remarks. And Akamai is clearly one of the early leaders with this capability.","Jeff van Rhee","And just one last one if I could. Any update on the blockchain initiative both timing and the scope?","Tom Leighton","No particular update. We're really excited about our partnership GO-NET our joint venture with MUFG. And their goal now is to be offering this as a service in Japan in early next year. So we're about a year out from commercial adoption, and so far so good.","Jeff van Rhee","Good. Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Alex Henderson from Needham. Your line is now open.","Alex Henderson","Great. Thanks. I was hoping you could spend a little bit of time unpacking the 20% constant currency growth internationally. Is that a function of security uptake? Is it a function of share? Is it the higher traffic volumes internationally? Can you break those down and maybe rank order what the drivers were?","Ed McGowan","Sure. So as we look at the growth outside of the U.S. the nice thing is that both EMEA and APJ are going in double-digits. Asia in particular we're really seeing strong growth really across everything you talked about. We're seeing some pretty interesting initiatives in the media side. We're picking up lots of traffic. And with security we're really seeing great growth across both EMEA and APJ and across many different countries.","If you remember a number of years ago, we started to make investments in our sales force and grew our sales force outside of the U.S. and that's really starting to pay dividends for us. So it's a number of factors.","I think one of the things in terms of competing in the marketplace making that large investment in our go-to-market, our services and our support organization have 24\/7 support to something that really does help differentiate us in the marketplace. Also, our investments in the countries, where a lot of these companies operate, and where some of their end-users are also separates us in the marketplace. And we're finding really good growth in a number of countries across the world.","Alex Henderson","So can you rank order those factors share gains, volume, security uptake? What was the largest driver?","Ed McGowan","I would say, it's probably a combination of traffic growth and security.","Alex Henderson","Great. And could you do something similar for where the upside was within the security business. Obviously, security was very strong and accelerated. Where was the upside and was the growth evenly distributed across the product lines?","Ed McGowan","Sure. So great question. We did expect to see strong sequential growth quarter-over-quarter, but this was stronger than we had originally modeled in. Part of that is related to some comments we made earlier last quarter around our bookings and that the majority of our bookings now are coming from security sales both to existing and new customers. And our services team did a great job of getting a lot of these customers, revenue generating earlier than what our model would suggest. So we had more a month's worth of revenue in the quarter.","Also our Web Division had an acceleration in year-over-year growth rate across many verticals. I mentioned the commerce verticals were seeing very nice growth, but also across financial services public sector high-tech, so great participation across a number of verticals.","Also, to Tom's earlier point in his earlier remarks, we've got strength across multiple products and we saw a great quarter-over-quarter growth in Bot Manager, Kona Site Defender and Prolexic, also Janrain added up quarter-over-quarter about $1.5 million. Compare our Q1 results to Q2. So, really just strength across the board both here in the U.S. and also outside the U.S.","Alex Henderson","So the upside was across the board then? I thought Janrain was in line for instance.","Ed McGowan","Yes, Janrain was in line about the same. If you look at sequential growth quarter-over-quarter, as I started saying, we expected to have pretty strong sequential growth. Just wanted to outline what that was and show that a lot of the growth came from our core security across many different verticals, both divisions, and from getting customers who had signed up over the last quarter or so, revenue generating faster than we expected.","Alex Henderson","Great, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Turits from Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Michael Turits","Hey, everybody. Good afternoon. One question on CDN and one question on Security. So, on the CDN side, we understand that it's an odd year, so traffic down, or traffic lower growth. And we also understand that you had some renewals on pricing. But you said you're taking share on a traffic basis. Cisco says about 29% IP traffic expected this year. You guys are flat. That's a pretty big delta. As you move into next year and you get past the price down on the big six, do you expect that that delta will narrow and will have less of a pricing impact and you'll have revenue growth closer to volume growth?","Tom Leighton","Yeah. I don't know that you get traffic growth directly in line with revenue growth. And the reason for that is that you have staggered renewals throughout the year. I think, the way to think about the math is, if you look at taking a unit of delivery and a price per unit as prices decline, there's a certain amount -- depending on how you model it. You would need to get just to be flat.","So, really the way to think about it is, as you go into 2020 or any year where you have line of sight to more traffic, the question becomes does that traffic accelerate at a rate that is greater than your expected price decline? So we will have the number of renewals next year like we always have. Some of our contracts too have volume discounts. As you push more traffic there can be lower unit rate. So rally the way you think about it, the question you need to think about here is, will we see enough traffic from these new OTT initiatives? Things like the Olympics, Presidential Election that will offset that price decline.","The good news is we've gotten some of our larger customers repriced here. So that, again -- I think it's possible we're really just going to see how successful these launches are as they come to market.","Ed McGowan","Also, and you reported the Cisco traffic stat, and in fact we're growing our traffic a lot faster than that.","Michael Turits","Right. And then, on Security, one of the things that you showed, one of the booths at the conference was the launch, the product at the -- the roadmap for the launch of Secure Web Gateway. Can you give us an update on that? And how directly once that gets launched do you plan to go up against Zscaler?","Tom Leighton","Yeah. So that's on track, Enterprise Threat Protector 3.0 with full suite capabilities later this year, and that will go up against Zscaler. And we already compete with Zscaler with not only Enterprise Threat Protector but Enterprise Application Access, and we are competing very successfully.","Michael Turits","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Lee Krowl from B. Riley FBR. Your line is now open.","Lee Krowl","Great. Thanks for sneaking me in, guys. I normally hate asking innings questions, but I think it's relevant just given how much progress you guys have made on the bundling front with some of your e-commerce and web customers. So, could you maybe talk about the inning, what innings we're in with being able to bundle the Security Solutions with CDN across the customer base?","Tom Leighton","I'd say it's very relatively early days. We do talk a lot about protect and perform and in fact when you buy Kona Site Defender that comes with Dynamic Site Accelerator. Really just all works on the same Akamai platform. We're processing all the requests to provide the Security on KSD, and so just by the fact of we're processing where there is network, you're going to get faster delivery. And if you buy Bot Manager, that of course rides on top of Kona Site Defender.","And so when you want these Security services, you get some basic delivery and acceleration with that. I think the bundling is very important. Gives us a real edge in the marketplace. It makes it really challenging for a web customer to want to go to another provider that not only will their -- service their applications slow down, but they won't have security.","Also makes it challenging on that side of the house to split traffic because in fact we've had a couple large performance, customers want to try to use two vendors, and if you only have half your site secured, you're not secure at all. And then they come to the switch back to use Akamai because they need the security. And we're pretty unique out there in terms of having these dual capabilities. And the best part is, it's all one platform, all on one service. And so, there I would say, viewing us today, as I talked about before, we're not just a great CDN. We have that, but we're a market leader by far in terms of security.","Lee Krowl","Got it. And then, just my second question. Last couple quarters, you've had a nice tailwind from the gaming vertical. In your prepared remarks, you kind of seem to fall off the growth drivers. So just kind of your thoughts on the gaming vertical specifically and maybe your expectations for the second half?","Ed McGowan","Sure. So we had a very strong quarter in gaming in Q1 and came off a very strong year in 2018. Gaming can be somewhat seasonal, not necessarily based on the calendar, but based on when new games come to market. So Q2 was a lighter quarter in terms of gaming traffic for us, not because we lost any share, but with more just kind of a light -- lighter gaming quarter in general. Hard to predict when and how popular games will be, but again I don't think there's anything to be concerned as to where a lighter schedule.","Lee Krowl","Got it. Thanks for taking my question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Will Power from Baird. Your line is now open.","Charles Erlikh","Great. Thanks guys for taking the question. This is actually Charlie Erlikh on for Will. I'll just ask one quick one. Could you talk a little bit about the growth split between the new and existing customers, maybe particularly how the new customer acquisition has gone since making some of these go-to-market improvements in the last year or two? Thanks.","Ed McGowan","Sure. So still the majority of our business comes from our existing customer base. The sales organization does a great job of selling additional capabilities into that base. We have been very pleased and we've seen a consistent return on our new customer acquisition. We don't break it out specifically, but we have seen some pretty good traction. And as I mentioned earlier, we've been leading with securities, so a lot of those customers are coming on as security customers.","Charles Erlikh","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Rishi Jaluria from D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open.","Rishi Jaluria","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Two quick ones. First wanted to start on live video the record I think you said with the concurrent viewership at India-New Zealand match is as painful is that memory might be really impressive. Just help me understand, what's driving some of this international traffic growth and maybe thinking from a financial perspective given that a lot of the viewership for these types of things might be in emerging markets, should we expect that to be a little bit of a drag on ARPU, or is that less sensitive from kind of a pricing perspective and then I've got a follow-up on the zero trust side.","Ed McGowan","Sure. I'll take the last part of that question in terms of the size of the traffic. One of the things as you go into some of these emerging markets you mentioned cricket, there's been some forces in the market that have enabled much better quality video access to millions of users and that's a great trend for us. In terms of the price sensitivity, we've talked about before in the Media market, really it is a pretty efficient market around volumes. So we don't notice anything specific relative to emerging markets having lower prices because of our emerging markets or what not it really is a function of volume.","And what's driving those volumes is you've got lots and lots of people consuming media, the teams have done a good job of gaining some customers in some of these countries outside the U.S. that are big traffic pushers you think about cricket not a big support here in the U.S. but very big internationally. We tend to go after whoever has rights for a live video. And like I said earlier we've got the best platform the best technology and capacity in the right places. So good business for us.","Rishi Jaluria","Got it. Thanks. That's helpful. And then just on the zero trust side, I mean I think we all get that it's a big opportunity. And clearly, the way the talk is going when it comes to security. Can you just maybe help us understand or remind us your kind of differentiation on the zero trust side just given that every single security vendor out there says they have something in zero trust? Thanks.","Tom Leighton","Yes. It's started to become kind of a buzzword. So everybody says they got it even though they don't. With Akamai's solution, we do access at the application layer instead of the network layer. And that's a big differentiator because at the traditional approach of doing it at a network layer, once you're in, you pretty much can go everywhere. Now there's a lot of folks that will sell extra equipment to do network segmentation. But you still have the same challenge and then you get even more overhead.","By doing it at the app layer, which we do as a service not -- we're not selling boxes like a typical approach then we can sit in between the device and the user and the application just the same way that we do for public facing applications. And we can bring Kona Site Defender to bear.","So we authenticate it really is the user that they really have access to this particular application not just to the corporate Internet and then we make sure that they don't ever touch the enterprise application or data directly. Everything comes through us and we scrub it and we defend it. And that just isn't done today and nobody has that capability out there. We're unique in being able to do that because there is no real competitor to Kona Site Defender. Never mind bring it to bear to enterprise applications.","And then you have our Edge platform with the massive scale which is really important for the large-scale attacks. And you have Bot Manager, which we can bring to bear to understand really what is it that entity that is coming to access the application.","And also where is that entity going otherwise as we can catch for example HVAC systems that are exfiltrating sensitive corporate data because we're monitoring everything that the devices do inside an enterprise to make sure it's safe. So it really is a unique solution and very different than all the other folks that are talking zero trust.","Rishi Jaluria","Great. That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you. ","Tom Barth","Operator, we are have time for one more question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ken Talanian from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Ken Talanian","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. You mentioned getting guaranteed commitments as a way of offsetting the revenue decline. Just wondering if you could describe how that's trended over the past year what you're thinking about for the back half to the year? And then 2020 in particular around the forthcoming OTT launches?","Ed McGowan","Yes. So we're not going to give specific guidance for 2020. But in terms of how it's going with the revenue commitments it varies by customer. What that does it enables us to one have more confidence in going out and building ahead of plan. You know customers vary from customer-to-customer in terms of how much they're willing to commit. Sometimes we get a percentage of traffic, sometimes its $1 commitment et cetera. But it's always something that we try to get as part of our sales when we can.","Ken Talanian","Okay. And then just curious if you could highlight the primary drivers of the margin upside rank order those and what do you think might drive upside the back half?","Ed McGowan","Yes. Sure. So you're talking about the margin upside for the quarter we just delivered correct?","Ken Talanian","Correct.","Ed McGowan","Yes. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks part of that is just our operating -- operational efficiency. And I talk a little bit about how we -- we're starting to see some good returns from our procurement function. We enhanced what we said some procurement function, but we really enhanced that and we're starting to see some fruits of our labor there. And just in general we're investing in efficiencies in IT for scaling our G&A operations and managing our headcount more effectively. That's we experience turnovers.","Ken Talanian","Okay. Great. Thanks very much.","Tom Barth","Yeah, great. Thank you, Ken and thank you everyone for joining us this evening. In closing, we will be presenting at some Investor Conferences and events throughout the quarter. Details of these can be found on the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. Thank you for joining us and have a wonderful evening.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program.

My name is Derek, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] At this time I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Natalie Temple, Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Natalie Temple","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Akamai's Investor Conference call to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2011 financial results. Speaking today will be Paul Sagan, Akamai's President and Chief Executive Officer; J.D. Sherman, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Benson, Senior Vice President of Finance. Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. ","Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on February 8, 2012. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances.","As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the News & Events portion of the Investor Relations section of our website. Now let me turn the call over to Paul.","Paul L. Sagan","Thanks, Natalie, and thank you all for joining us today. Akamai posted record revenue in Q4 with our largest quarter-over-quarter revenue growth ever. Financial highlights for the fourth quarter include: Revenue of $324 million, a 14% year-over-year increase and a 15% increase over the third quarter of 2011; and normalized EPS of $0.45, up 13% from Q4 of last year and up 32% sequentially. For the full year, we grew revenue to $1.16 billion, up 13%. We generated normalized EPS of $1.52, an increase of 6% over 2010, and we continued to generate strong cash flow, with full year cash from operations of more than $450 million. I'll be back with some additional comments on what we're seeing in the market. I'll also have a few comments about our new product rollouts in 2012 and the planned transition we announced today in the role of CFO with Jim Benson taking over from J.D. Sherman after we close the books on 2011. But first J.D. and Jim are going to review our 2011 results in detail and look ahead to the start of 2012. ","J.D.?","J. D. Sherman","Thanks, Paul. With Q4 revenue of $324 million, up 14% year-over-year and up $42 million or 15% sequentially, we exceeded the high end of our guidance with solid growth across the board. Our commerce vertical increased 20% compared to last year and 25% sequentially, driven by a significant increase in online shopping activity. We typically experience strong online retail and advertising seasons in Q4, but this was the best holiday season in company history. Enterprise, our fastest growing vertical, once again grew 23% year-over-year against a very strong Q4 of 2010, and grew 6% sequentially. We also saw revenue growth accelerate in the high-tech vertical, which grew 9% compared to Q4 of 2010 and 10% sequentially. This was driven by adoption of our cloud infrastructure solutions, and these solutions now make up 55% of our sales in the high-tech vertical. ","Revenue from our media and entertainment vertical grew 11% year-over-year and 17% sequentially as we saw traffic growth accelerate in the quarter. And public sector revenue grew 3% year-over-year and declined 2 points sequentially due to the timing of some of our custom projects. Across all our verticals, cloud infrastructure solutions grew 20% over Q4 of 2010 and now make up 58% of our total revenue, up from 55% last year. International revenue growth accelerated from Q3 levels on a constant currency basis. Foreign exchange was a slight benefit compared to Q4 of 2010, but a $3 million negative impact on revenues on a sequential basis. Revenue from outside of North America grew 11% sequentially and 15% on a year-over-year basis. And we saw accelerated growth in Europe and all major economies outside the U.S. except Japan, where we continue to face macroeconomic headwinds. ","Revenue from North America grew 13% on a year-over-year basis and 17% sequentially. During the fourth quarter, sales outside North America were 28% of total revenue, that's down 1 point from the prior quarter, primarily due to the strong U.S. commerce season. And resellers represented 19% of total revenue and that's consistent with the prior quarter. Our cash gross margin for the quarter was 79%, consistent with last quarter and down 2 points from the same period last year. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 68% for the quarter, up 1 point sequentially and down 2 points from last year. Our GAAP operating expenses were $142 million in the fourth quarter. These GAAP numbers include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets and stock-based compensation. Excluding these non-cash charges, our operating expenses for the quarter were $109 million, up $9 million from Q3 and up 8% on a year-over-year basis. ","Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $148 million, and that's up 14% from the same period last year and up about 21% from Q3 levels. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 46%, up 1 point from the same period last year and up 3 points from the prior quarter. For the fourth quarter, total depreciation and amortization was $44 million. And this includes $35 million of network-related depreciation, $4 million of G&A depreciation and $4 million of amortization of intangible assets. And net interest income for the fourth quarter was $2 million. ","Moving on to earnings. GAAP net income for the quarter was $60 million, or $0.33 of earnings per diluted share. As a reminder, our GAAP net income includes several primarily noncash items, including: $21 million of stock-based compensation, including amortization of capitalized equity-based compensation; and $4 million from amortization of acquired intangible assets. We're including GAAP taxes in our normalized earnings, and that tax charge was $28 million based on a full year GAAP tax rate of 35%. Our normalized net income for the fourth quarter was $83 million. That translates to $0.45 per diluted share on a normalized basis, up 13% from Q4 of last year, and up 32% from Q3. Our weighted average diluted share count for the fourth quarter was 183 million shares. With our solid fourth quarter results, we finished the year with $1.16 billion in revenue, an increase of 13% over 2010. Full year GAAP gross margin came in at 68%, down 2 points from 2010 and cash gross margin was 79%, also down 2 points from the prior year. ","Full year GAAP operating expenses were $493 million. These GAAP numbers include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets and stock-based compensation, and excluding these noncash charges, operating expenses for the full year were $395 million. Our full year adjusted EBITDA was $525 million, up 11% from 2010 and full year adjusted EBITDA margin was 45%, down 1 point from the prior year. GAAP net income for the year was $201 million, or $1.07 of earnings per diluted share. This GAAP net income included $69 million of stock-based compensation expense, including amortization of capitalized equity-based compensation, and $17 million of amortization of intangible assets. Excluding these items, our normalized net income for the year was $285 million, or $1.52 of earnings per diluted share. That's up 6% from 2010. This number includes a full year GAAP tax charge of $106 million based on a full year GAAP tax rate of 35%. ","Cash generation was very strong. Cash from operations from the fourth quarter were $136 million and for the full year, we generated $453 million in cash from operations. We spent $76 million in share repurchases during Q4, buying back just under 3 million shares at an average price of $26.38. For the full year, we spent $325 million buying back 12 million shares at an average price of $26.45. Coming into 2012, we had $130 million remaining in our share buyback authorization. ","Capital expenditures in Q4, excluding equity compensation, were $47 million and for the full year, capital expenditures were $183 million, or 16% of revenues, in line with our model. At the end of Q4, we had over $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on the balance sheet. Finally, days sales outstanding for the quarter were 56 days. Overall, the company performed very well in Q4 and this is an exciting time for Akamai. This is a great team, and I'm proud of what we've accomplished over the last 6 years as we grew to over $1 billion in revenues. At the same time I'm looking forward to a new challenge in a very different role than I've played here at Akamai. I'm also very pleased to be turning the reins over to Jim Benson, who I've worked with for the past 2 years now as my Senior VP of Finance. I'm confident that this will be a seamless transition. ","And with that, let me turn the call over to Jim to talk about our Q1 guidance. Jim?","Jim Benson","Thanks, J.D. It's been a pleasure working closely with you, and I look forward to following your example of professionalism and business leadership in the years ahead. As J.D. said, our business performed very well in Q4, with accelerated growth for both our cloud infrastructure solutions and our content delivery solutions. With $42 million in sequential revenue growth, we recorded our largest quarterly revenue increase ever. And while it's too early to call it a trend, we did see very promising traffic growth in Q4 for our media solutions. For Q1, we do expect to see a normal sequential revenue decline due to seasonality. Perhaps a bit more pronounced than in the past due to the exceptionally strong Q4 we experienced in 2011. We also expect foreign exchange will be a headwind, with an expected negative sequential impact of about $1 million based on current spot rates. Coming off of our record Q4, we are expecting Q1 revenues of $305 million to $313 million or 11% to 13% growth. As a reminder, this guidance excludes the impact of the pending Cotendo acquisition. We expect cash gross margins to be roughly flat with the prior quarter, and GAAP gross margins to be down 1 to 2 points sequentially, given the normal seasonal revenue trends. We expect Q1 operating expenses to remain roughly flat with the prior quarter as normal Q1 items, such as the annual payroll tax reset and sales training expenses roughly offset the Q4 expenses driven by year-end commission and bonus accruals. As a result, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins to be about 43%. We also expect to record a higher tax charge based on a GAAP tax rate of 38% to 39%, or taxes of $25 million to $29 million in Q1, due primarily to the expiration of the federal R&D tax credit. This rate change will have roughly a $0.02 impact on normalized EPS for the quarter. As a result, we expect normalized EPS of $0.36 to $0.39 for Q1, assuming a fully diluted share count of roughly 183 million shares. ","On CapEx, we expect to spend about $50 million in the quarter, excluding equity compensation. Overall, we are extremely pleased with the momentum we have coming into Q1. We remain optimistic about the growth potential and markets for our solutions. That said, we are maintaining our practice of providing guidance only 1 quarter ahead. We are also looking forward to closing the Cotendo transaction, potentially as soon as this quarter. We'll talk more about the financials associated with Cotendo when the deal closes, but we expect the transaction to be roughly neutral to 2012 normalized EPS. ","Finally, today we announced the acquisition of Blaze, a provider of front-end optimization technology with a small team in Ottawa, Canada. From a financial perspective, we don't expect the acquisition to have a material impact on revenue or profit in 2012. We look forward to updating you again on our next earnings call. ","Now let me turn the call back over to Paul. Paul?","Paul L. Sagan","Thank you, both. Before I provide some commentary on the year ahead, I would like to thank J.D. for 6 years of dedication to Akamai. When he joined us from IBM, his goal was to help us scale the business to capture the growth opportunities we saw in front of us. And he met that goal, and helped Akamai to grow to well over $1 billion in annual revenue. Now he wants an opportunity to help run an early-stage technology business. He'll be leaving us after he signs the 10-K for 2011 to join HubSpot. We wish J.D. well, and we'll miss him. But we're confident that he'll be leaving us in good hands. Which brings me to Jim Benson, who many of you already know from IR meetings over the past year. Jim joined us from an accomplished career in high-tech finance at HP, Compaq and DEC. He's been helping J.D. to run our finance organization for 2 years, and I'm confident he's going to pick up the CFO mantle without missing a beat. With such a strong Q4 and end of the year, we believe we're well positioned to take full advantage of the market opportunities for growth ahead of us. Over the past year, you've heard me talk about the hyper connected world and what that means for both Akamai and our customers. There's tremendous opportunity for organizations of all kinds to build and expand their online businesses to provide instant access to applications and content anywhere and on any device. Our clients are providing an unprecedented user experience, one that's personalized, impactful, relevant, high performing and secure to employees, customers, partners and other stakeholders around the globe. As recent headlines make very clear, doing business online faces increasing security risks. Our customers are reporting an increasing number of attacks directed at their web properties. From 2009 to 2011, the number of distributed denial of service attacks that we investigated on behalf of our customers more than tripled. Perhaps most alarming, hackers are employing new method to combine network and application era attacks to bring sites down and it's harder than ever to defend against these new forms of attacks. Akamai's cloud-based web security solutions leverage our massively distributed platform, providing new ways to protect an organization's online presence. Our approach to web security is designed to not only absorb high-volume attacks for our customers, but also to keep attack traffic as far away as possible from a customer's data center. This solution is designed to enable client sites to stay up and their web applications to keep performing. This year, we're rolling out enhancements across nearly all of our product lines. This week, we brought together our entire worldwide sales organization for a preview and training. One of the new services we highlighted is a next-generation web security product that provides a sophisticated layer of defense against malicious online activities. It will be released to the market next quarter. ","We built momentum in the web security market last year that we believe will continue into 2012. We increased sales of web security solutions by 149% in 2011. While security is generally the #1 concern of CIOs doing business online, site performance is also still critical to them. And so you'll see us continuing to invest resources to build even better performance optimizing cloud services throughout 2012 in addition to security enhancements. We believe that one of the most promising new areas is a technology called front-end optimization. Earlier today we announced the acquisition of Blaze. We're excited about the prospects of integrating Blaze's unique cloud-based technology with ours and incorporating it into our next-generation Dynamic Site Accelerator solution. During Q4, we announced that we entered into an agreement to acquire Cotendo. Together, we'll continue addressing the acceleration complexities of the cloud and mobile environments. The Cotendo deal could close as early as this quarter, pending standard regulatory approvals and we're looking forward to having another extremely talented team join Akamai. ","Partnerships are also helping us to expand the reach of our capabilities and bring Akamai to new markets. This quarter, for example, we're looking forward to announcing general availability of the Akamai-Riverbed solution. Through this partnership, we believe we will be able to offer clients a better way to ensure that SaaS applications are accelerated and optimized wherever they are accessed, in the public cloud, or private network, to provide a consistent user experience anywhere. We've been testing the solution with 10 global data customers since late last year, and these tests have been showing exceptional performance improvements. We demonstrated some of these test results at our Investor Summit in December. For those of you weren't able to join us, I encourage you to watch the replay, which you can find on the Investor Page of our website. In particular, the demonstration showed a reduction in the download time of a local file using Office 365 from 14 seconds to 1 second. We reduced the upload time from 45 seconds to less than 2 seconds. We think our customers will find the results very compelling. ","Another area of investment for us is in the mobile arena, where we are rolling out a new product this year called Mobile Accelerator. This embraces the shift in consumer behavior toward mobile computing over smartphones and tablets. This solution includes device detection and protocol optimization capabilities that reduce page load times and packet loss. We believe we're helping customers unlock new revenue sources through innovation that removes the complexities of connecting increasingly mobile world, while improving online performance. That's our strategy across Akamai's entire lineup of cloud infrastructure solutions. To enable our clients to offer secure and higher performing sites and applications, reaching any user, on any device, anywhere around the world. It's also key to our strategy for our content delivery media solutions. It wasn't long ago that video on the Internet was more like an interesting science project, dominated by user-generated content. Many said the Internet would never really compete with TV and while we're not quite there yet, the industry is rapidly moving in that direction. A perfect example was last weekend. Television's largest event migrated for the first time to the Internet, with the Super Bowl being streamed live on the website of our partner at NBC Sports, and delivered exclusively over the Akamai HD Network. It was interesting to see the complementary nature of a compelling online video experience paired with a live TV broadcast. We saw more than 2.1 million unique users, a record for a live event for a single broadcaster. These were end users participating in an interactive, personalized experience unlike anything they've ever had before, and we believe this is a great indication of where media is heading rapidly. ","Broadcasters and content owners are exploring new ways to engage their audiences through initiatives such as UltraViolet, TV Everywhere. We're rolling out of the second-generation of the Akamai HD Network this year with enhanced security capabilities to help our media clients succeed in these initiatives and others, and at the same time to protect their assets, while reaching the widest possible online audiences. All of these trends in cloud computing, online web security, mobile and media require a full suite of solutions that address the challenges of moving mission-critical businesses on to the Internet. So with all the opportunities in front of us, we are very positive about the investments we've been making in new product capabilities and about Akamai's prospects for growth in 2012 and beyond. Now J.D., Jim, and I will take your questions. Operator, the first question please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","First question will be coming from the line of Scott Kessler from S&P Capital IQ.","Scott H. Kessler - S&P Equity Research","A couple of questions. You talked about acceleration in some of the verticals, particularly high-tech. Can you speak to what might have driven that? Obviously, I would imagine that it didn't necessarily have to do exclusively with a strong holiday shopping season, and I have a follow-up.","Paul L. Sagan","So one of the nice things about the quarter and the really positive surprise was that we saw strength across the board. We thought it would be a good holiday season. It was an exceptional holiday season, and so commerce was very strong. But as we mentioned, we saw some acceleration in media volumes. We saw acceleration in the software and SaaS delivery market. And so there was just a very strong Internet ecosystem economy, which we hope will set us up well for 2012 as well.","Scott H. Kessler - S&P Equity Research","And the follow-up I had, it seems pretty obvious that maybe you're looking a little bit differently in terms of your balance sheet and your financial flexibility in that you've announced 2 strategic acquisitions over the last couple of months, and I guess I'm wondering how you think about both the balance sheet and use of cash, particularly as M&A plays perhaps a greater role in your priorities going forward?","Paul L. Sagan","Sure. Well our goal is to return strong growth and shareholder value to our investors. And we want to use our balance sheet whenever possible to strengthen the company and we said for a long time that we would continue to be opportunistic about acquisitions to fill holes faster in our product portfolio and to try to grow the company more quickly. You've seen us some years do a number of acquisitions, some years not and so I think we're a disciplined buyer. We have a roadmap across our divisions of things that we want to add to our portfolio, and we're always making that make-or-buy evaluation and in this case, we found 2 terrific companies that we thought would help us grow the business, and that's why we went the M&A route and in the future we'll continue to look. We do have a great balance sheet and it allows us to be opportunistic and to move when we need to.","J. D. Sherman","I would just add to that, that we used our balance sheet really, flexibility, in 2 ways last year. One is with the share buyback. We started the year at $1.2 billion in cash. We basically used our free cash flow to buy back shares last year when it made sense, it was opportunistic. And of course with that strong balance sheet, we were also able to make a cash acquisition of Cotendo and then a smaller one with Blaze. So it does give us a lot of flexibility and we'll be opportunistic both in terms of returning it to shareholders via buybacks as well as acquisitions.","Operator","Your next question will be coming from the line of Mark Kelleher from Dougherty & Company.","Mark Kelleher - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division","I wanted to ask, focus on the value-added services, the cloud services. Was there anything that particularly drove the strength in the quarter? You mentioned networking was up 149% year-over-year. Has that become a meaningful part of that? Wonder if you could just talk about the different elements within that part of the business.","Paul L. Sagan","Oh, secure -- it was really demand for security products, so we talked a lot about providing a different layer in a security in-depth philosophy of web-based security from the Akamai cloud. And that was the strong growth we saw and interest in security products last year. I'll let Jim make some additional comments, if you'd like.","Jim Benson","Yes, and we had very good signings in our cloud infrastructure solutions, and we had very good momentum in our cloud infrastructure solutions, in particular in our DSA product line, which tends to seasonally do very well in Q4 because of the online commerce season. So we had growth as Paul mentioned across the board, but we continued to see momentum in the cloud infrastructure solutions in particular.","Mark Kelleher - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just one quick follow-up. The legal settlement, what was that about?","Paul L. Sagan","Legal settlement. Oh, I'm sorry, yes, that had to do with a dispute that we had brought against somebody. I can't comment on the details at all. We obviously excluded that from our normalized earnings. It went down in major.","J. D. Sherman","And that was not -- that was not connected to our patent litigation. No, it was not.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of David Hilal from FBR.","David M. Hilal - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I guess I wanted to ask Paul or J.D. on the go-to-market with both Blaze and Cotendo, and so specifically for Blaze, is that going to be embedded in DSA, or is it a separate product or separate pricing? And then similar for Cotendo, maybe you can just talk about what the product looks like, whether it's separate, bundled into other things? And the opportunity to sell those into your install base.","Paul L. Sagan","Sure. Let me take them in reverse order because we're not going to make any specific comments on Cotendo until that deal is closed. We like a lot of their capabilities. We like their team. We think it brings a lot to Akamai, but I won't comment specifically there until we close that. Now in terms of Blaze, which is already closed, we'll be embedding those, that capability across our dynamic site capabilities. We'll be announcing new product availability in dynamic site acceleration and mobile acceleration, and we'll be using front-end optimization capabilities where it makes sense. Just to help folks understand, this is the idea that the sites are now effectively created in the browser and that's very different on different kinds of devices, so there's this ability to create optimization in this front end where the user is across devices, and Blaze has very interesting cloud-based capabilities. There are a lot of people who say they're in the front end optimization space or web content optimization space, but often they are a single point of failure solution or a data center solution or a box solution, and we don't believe are scalable. What we really like about not just the team at Blaze and their expertise was their design, and our belief was we could embed it in our massively distributed platform and bring it to bear a number of products. I won't to jump the gun and announce pricing or how the bundling is done. That will be done by product marketing and rollouts. But you can assume that over the next couple of years we believe front-end optimization will be important and taking what Blaze has done and building on it should be important to those -- that product suite.","Operator","Your next question will be coming from the line of Gary Powell from Wells Fargo.","Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just had a couple of quick ones. So there's a very nice acceleration in revenue growth, particularly in the media and entertainment vertical. Can you just give a little bit more color as to the driver there? And then broadly speaking, how do you think pricing in the competitive environment in the CDN space will look in 2012, relative to 2011?","Paul L. Sagan","Well that's the age-old question that the answer doesn't really change much. The pricing environment has been quite consistent. I'd remind everyone that our goal is to drive the cost and the price down on the delivery of volume content, because that's how our customers can afford to bring more long form media online. The pricing environment in the second half of last year and Q4 was very consistent with what we've seen for years, so I expect it will be similar this year. Our goal is to drive even more cost out of the business so we can help our customers do more online, so no fundamental change there. Last year, don't expect it. This year -- and the acceleration really came from I think our customers feeling better about their ability to bring more media online and profit by doing so, probably a little bit of recovery in the economy, a little bit of recovery in the ad market, which is how a lot of this content is effectively monetized online by our customers. And so they brought, I think, more content online, and we saw the volumes always increase, but we saw that rate of increase tick up a little bit. Again, we don't want to say that it's a giant trend, but it is something that we expected would happen. We saw it happening in Q4 and I think that helped the growth on the content delivery solution side, and I think that's a good data point.","Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got it. That's very helpful. And then just as a quick follow-up, you touched on it here. Can you just provide details as to what you're doing to control co-location costs, and how we should think about that item or component of your gross margin going forward?","Paul L. Sagan","It's true. Jim?","Jim Benson","Yes, I can cover that. I mean, there's a couple of things that we're doing in particular for co-location costs, but the driver of co-location costs obviously is the server print -- footprint that sits in the data centers, and so there's a lot of work that we're doing around improving software enablement to get more throughput out of the servers. There's also work to be done on the hardware side as well, that hardware becomes more efficient as we introduce new servers into the data centers as well. So both of those areas are what's helping us focus on co-location costs and make sure that we manage it appropriately.","Paul L. Sagan","I think we have the ability to continue to drive the cost of delivery down significantly going forward. It's sort of invisible out there, because a lot of it is the -- effectively take advantage of Moore's Law, and a machine is not a machine year-over-year, and the incredible efficiency that we can drive out of our own software development or changes, physical changes, in those boxes. And so our goal is to never have a larger footprint than necessary, but to make that footprint more efficient every year, and that's a big focus on our network and platform side.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Jennifer Swanson from Morgan Stanley.","Jennifer A. Swanson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I just want to drill on a little bit. Paul, you made the comment, I think you touched on this, but in terms of the reacceleration in traffic growth, I know that is something that you talked about a couple of years -- a couple of quarters back as something you had expected. Should we think about the acceleration through Q4 as basically the -- what you were talking about a couple of quarters ago, but with some conservatism playing out kind of in-line with what you hoped it would be? Or were there other drivers that caused that to happen either faster or more dramatically than maybe you'd anticipated a couple of quarters back as sort of the hope -- how should we think about that reacceleration, relative to your expectations a couple of quarters ago?","Paul L. Sagan","Jen, I think we -- if you step all the way back, it's clear to us and to most people that we're going to see content move online and quality improve, and I think we are starting to see that. Q4, there's a lot of seasonality in there. So we're always nervous to put 1 point and call it a trend, and there's got to be some seasonality built into that and we had -- we'll have some of that naturally, so it'll be interesting to see how it plays out in the -- in quarter by quarter. The only thing I know really for sure is that I would expect that to happen over the next several years, but it's hard to call quarter-by-quarter at this point.","Jim Benson","Yes, and I think the Super Bowl is a great example of what can be done, and what we've seen with these inflection points over time is, it's a combination of the economics, the cost of delivery married to the monetization capability. And the other is just what's possible from an experience, and we now believe that you can deliver reliably an HD quality movie that shouldn't rebuffer during the time people watch it. Or a sporting event that frankly, people said well -- and I used to hear this all the time, well the Internet's great, but the Super Bowl will never go on the Internet. Well it just did, and it was a great experience, and a complimentary experience to television, and so I think that distributors, content providers, broadcasters are all going to look at that and say, \"It actually enhanced the audience and created new opportunities to make money.\" It didn't cannibalize, and I think that, that will also drive more media online and that'll be good for our Content Delivery business.","Jennifer A. Swanson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then just turning a little bit, it sounds like pretty much every business did see some strong acceleration in the quarter. The one that looked maybe like it decelerated little bit was the Enterprise business, and that's been such a strong performer over the last few quarters, so it's still a good result, but maybe a little bit of a deceleration there. Was there anything that changed in that business or that we should be thinking about there?","Paul L. Sagan","No, we saw very strong growth in Enterprise as you mentioned. I think last year we had a very, very strong performance in the Enterprise segment, so the comp is a little bit tougher for that area, but it still is our fastest growing vertical, and so we're very pleased with the growth in the Enterprise vertical, and in particular with our EPS solutions.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Mark Mahaney.","Mark S. Mahaney - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","In terms of the international sales, you disclosed that yet acceleration in all the regions except for Japan. Can you just remind us how material Japan is do you as an end market, and then just talk probably about the international growth. It seems awfully lumpy. It's nice to have that acceleration, but it seems like it's a lot more uneven in terms of its year-over-year growth in international. Is that just the way those markets work for you? Or is there something you can do to kind of not necessarily perfectly manage the growth, but get it more consistently in that upper teens level?","J. D. Sherman","Yes, I think this is sort of work -- weave my way back to those thanks a lot, by the way, first of all. I think it's a bit small -- the markets are smaller, so just small numbers move around a little bit more, so you have a little bit of that phenomenon and of course currency moves around. So that probably describes some of the choppiness that you see with our overall international revenue. Roughly speaking, international is 28% of our revenue, about 2\/3 of that is Europe, and about 1\/3 is Asia-Pac and Asia-Pac is dominated by Japan, so it's a pretty large market for us. And it's one that we haven't seen a lot of growth this year and has been somewhat of a constraint on our growth outside of Europe. I was really, really pleased to see the growth in Europe accelerate in the quarter, and we've also got emerging markets which are still a relatively small part of our overall European -- our international revenue portfolio, but they're growing 40 -- in the 40% range. So I think if we get a little bit of stability in the big markets, the product announcements that we have coming out, the investments that we've put in there, we're pretty optimistic about the ability to grow outside of the U.S. faster than we're going to grow inside the U.S.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Two questions. First, when you look at the sequential decline for the first quarter, you mentioned the seasonality in the fourth quarter. What is it that you want to see, if there is anything in particular, before you're ready to call the improvement in volumes and business and VAS a trend?","Paul L. Sagan","Well, the volumes have increased. It's the rate of increase and we'll just have to watch that over a few more quarters and decide if we think it's really an inflection point in video, and in our cloud infrastructure services, we have seen very strong growth last year, Q4 was great results. I'll be looking at how we're doing in our Dynamic site, in security and in mobile solutions this year, as we go forward and try to forecast how we're going to do.","J. D. Sherman","I think that when we talk about it for -- a Vice President has to have 3 points to call it a trend, the CFO has 2 points and the CEO has to have 1 point, so I'm not quite ready to call a trend yet. So maybe Paul is, but...","Paul L. Sagan","No.","J. D. Sherman","No. And I need 3 quarters. They want 3 quarters. So I guess that's as scientific as we can get. No seriously, there's a very strong back half of the year, very strong bookings, great communication with our customers. We're going to be rolling out either enhancements or entirely new offerings in every major category of our product sets this year from site acceleration, mobile, web security and media delivery, and I think that our customers are focusing on more and more how they're going to grow their businesses online, and we're talking to them about the kinds of suite of solutions and a platform that they need.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","With that, with the new offerings and how you're interacting with your customers, what changes have you finalized to the sales structure to optimize that go to market for 2012?","J. D. Sherman","We're not changing the structure at all. We're continuing to make investments in growing sales offices in regions where we see opportunity, opening new offices opportunistically where we see additional opportunity but the Enterprise, vertically our industry aligned structure that we've had for a number of years under the direction of the global sales services and marketing leadership I think is really working for us, and our goal is not to upend that or, if you will, fix it. I think it's working well.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Colby Synesael from Cowen & Company.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Just a few questions. First off, I wanted to get an update on the products you didn't mention. Number one, the Ericsson product as well as the license of CDN. Wondering if you could comment on where those are. And then also, you keep on talking about product enhancements. I'm just curious, when we think of mobile, when we think of security even, I guess, the new Blaze acquisition, are these going to be new products with new revenue opportunities? Are these essentially improvements to current solutions to help further differentiate your versus your competitors, but don't necessarily lead to potentially new revenue?","Paul L. Sagan","Well, our goal with whatever we bring out is I believe, is to drive new revenue for the company. In some cases they will be next generation products, in other cases they will be wholly new products and in both cases I think they give us opportunity to go to our customers and do more and get paid more. That's at least what we try to earn every day with them. In terms of those other 2 areas, I'm very pleased with the partnership with Ericsson, which we said was going to do joint development across a number of products. We're not ready to announce those today, but I'm very pleased with the collaboration and the work and the -- some of the actual field-testing results that we're seeing, but we are not ready to make product announcements yet. And in the area of working with our network partners, also very encouraged by some of the work that we have going there. As we said on the last call, we now have more formal network relationships than in the history -- any time in the past history of the company. They are more interested in how to drive more traffic efficiently across their network and work with us. We think that, that has opened up new opportunity to create a new kind of relationship, and even potentially a new revenue stream for us. We're not ready to make those announcements formally as new products yet, but we continue to work in that category and I'm very optimistic about that as well. But you'll just have to watch this space across those 2 categories for formal product announcements this year.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Paul have you -- am I right to think, though, that you guys have talked about launching those in the back half of 2012 but just were not exactly sure when?","Paul L. Sagan","No, I haven't made a formal statement about that.","Operator","Your next question will be coming from the line of Michael Turits from Raymond James.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","First on the -- on high-tech services. This is the best quarter you guys have had in a long time there. Can you give us any more granularity on -- you gave us the breakout of what percentage of it was, I think, you said SaaS-based, as opposed to probably software delivery, I forgot exactly how you characterized it, but maybe just to tell us a little bit more about exactly what that business is that is the SaaS-based portion, and what the growth rate is there and then I have a couple of follow-ups.","Paul L. Sagan","Yes, I think I'll take that. That so -- the -- the SaaS base of the cloud infrastructure solutions, I think, are about 55% of that vertical and we had very, very good momentum in that area. And as we talked about in the past, that you mentioned the software download business being the other business. That business is not the business that we're expecting to grow. That business was actually okay in the quarter. That business tends to be lumpy based on customers that do software downloads. So we had a reasonably good quarter there, but the real big driver in that was our SaaS solutions.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Any sense of the comparative growth rate, what the SaaS is growing?","Paul L. Sagan","I don't have that off the top of my head, no.","J. D. Sherman","Overall, Michael -- overall our cloud infrastructure solutions grew 20% and I'm pretty -- I'm confident that the cloud infrastructure solutions within the high-tech group grew faster than that. Just another point of reference, I think last year in Q4, the percentages were -- it was less than 1\/2 of the revenue of the high-tech group was on cloud infrastructure solutions, so we've really seen that turn this year. We've talked about that being an important sort of milestone for that vertical and I think we are turning the corner there.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","All right. And then back to the income statement, we did 46% EBITDA margins, which is the long-term target this quarter, but your guidance is 43%. Any sense of what you need to do in order to get it to 46% in the near-term versus the long-term and then similar question, similar thing just on tax rate, is that 38%, 39% good for the year?","Jim Benson","Yes, I'll cover that. So I we talked about kind of a long-term model of having kind of EBITDA in the 45% to 47% range. So certainly, 43% in Q1 reflects a continued investment in the business, and I think Paul talked about some of those areas that we're going to continue to invest in those areas that we think are going to fuel product innovation and go to market for the company to continue to grow at the rates that we know the market opportunity is there for us. So I think what you're seeing is here. In the short-term it might bump around, around 43%, but we believe that we're going to be well within the long-term model of 45% to 47%. Now as far as the tax rate, I'm glad you brought that up, because I covered it briefly in my remarks and I want to make sure I clarify for folks that -- so not to get into a tax course, but the -- there is a federal R&D tax credit that was -- has basically expired in 2011 and from an accounting perspective, you cannot record the benefit for the R&D tax credit in the future years until it's reinstated. We don't know whether it's going to be reinstated, so what we've done, from an accounting perspective, is we've assumed that it will not be reinstated. And as I mentioned, that has roughly a $0.02 impact on our gross, so that takes us from roughly a 35% to 36% tax rate, to a 38% to 39%. Does that help?","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Yes, it sure does. So we could say it to just assume that for the year and forget the benefit at the annual taken.","J. D. Sherman","Exactly, exactly.","Paul L. Sagan","And not to get on a political soapbox, that's clearly a problem that we've seen year after year, and it would be nice for everybody if we just knew, but that's unfortunately not one of the things that Washington seems to be able to figure out.","Operator","Next question is coming from the line of Ed Maguire.","Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I had a question about -- more broadly about volumes in the media and entertainment group. Last year, it was at -- it had been less predictable at points for you, and I would like to know if you feel that, that the, I guess, the pace or the variability of volumes is more predictable? And a follow-up to that is I knew you had renewed a number of very large M&A contracts at the end of 2010 and some of those are coming up and should be coming up sometime in the middle of this year for renewal. Have you had any discussions with customers there, and do you anticipate any changes there?","Paul L. Sagan","Okay. And Ed, well, as they say on the radio, we'll take your calls off-line because it sounds like you're on a cell phone and you were warbling in and out. On the M&A volumes, it was a strong quarter. We continue to be optimistic that more and more video is going to move online. The drivers there continue to be finding the audience with the right quality and the right content and the right monetization. And I think the producers and distributors are more optimistic about that than ever. I'll let Jim comment on renewals, but we continue to work well with our customers.","Jim Benson","Yes, I mean I think I've -- I think we've said it before, that it's true last Q1 was kind of an anomaly where we had 8 of our top 10 renewals occur, and renewals recur every quarter. And the expectation is that that's going to happen every quarter, we're going to see renewals.","Paul L. Sagan","It will be pretty well spaced out, last year was an exception.","Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay, and one final question on the security business, I know the -- and the denial of service has been getting a bit of attention, but could you provide a little more granularity in terms of which services you're seeing the most traction?","Paul L. Sagan","Sure. So DDoS is one clearly that's been higher interest because of the headlines in the last 6 months, but also our WAF or Web Application Firewall product that allows filtering rules to be put out at the edge of the Internet embedded in our cloud as opposed to in your datacenter is another. And then as I said, we'll be making another announcement about web security in the first half of this year, which I think will be of interest to a lot of our customers as well.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Aaron Schwartz.","Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Maybe I'll try that -- the volume question at slightly a different angle, I mean, it seems you're certainly optimistic in some of the things you're seeing here in Q4. I know you don't want to get too much into the guidance around 2012 but directionally, if you look at the rate of change from 11, I mean do you expect that to sort of increase or sort of stay level in terms of the rate of the volume growth?","Paul L. Sagan","We're very pleased with what we saw in the second half of last year. We've said those were good data points, particularly in Q4. I'm not going to characterize it anymore going forward, except to say that we think our customers are optimistic about what they can do online and are really looking at the monetization opportunities, but I'm not going to try to guide on volumes beyond that.","Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then related to the strong M&A performance here in the quarter, was there anything abnormal in terms of burst or overage fees? And if there was, I think you've billed that in the January period, if I'm correct there. I was just wondering if you could comment on that.","Paul L. Sagan","There was nothing out of the ordinary besides bursting our overage fees.","J. D. Sherman","Yes, the one thing, when you get to the M&E contracts, that's not the old-style contact where you have a monthly commit and then bursting. They tend to be based on usage. So we recognize revenue as the customers use, deliver the gigabits or hit the megabits per second. So it's not the traditional bursting approach. It's as the customer's traffic grows, our revenue will grow. And what we saw in Q4 was a nice acceleration in the rate of volume growth off of Q3, back to Paul's point. One point does not a trend make, and we're not going to call much beyond Q1 except to say that long-term, we all believe that there's a huge opportunity to see a tremendous amount of volume growth on the Internet.","Operator","Your next question is coming from Rob Sanderson.","Rob Sanderson","A question on the product pipeline, a lot of interesting cloud infrastructure products you talked about at your investor summit. And can you just sort of give us some sense of how that sort of looks over the next few quarters? And which offerings are sort of more -- you're more optimistic or more maybe material? And qualitatively, how many for those might be in terms of installed base or upgrade opportunity or whatever you can do to help was think about the great pipeline you have here?","Paul L. Sagan","Sure. Well I think first of all, in this recurring revenue model, we're not making the quarter on the last hour by shipping boxes or licenses as we need to get people signed up and on the platform then recognize the revenue ratably on a monthly basis across the year or more, hopefully years of their relationship with us. I think one of the significant things around the effort in our products and development group is that they're rolling out either enhancements or new products in every division, which gives us the ability to go back to our customers and ask for our fair share of their spend on IT and Internet and cloud. And I think we have the ability to go back and do better in all of those categories because the enhancements that we're going to be able to rollout, or the new products across the board. So we're very optimistic, and we'll be able to actually talk to them about these and sell most of them in the first half of this year.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Tim Klasell.","Tim Klasell - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just a question following up on the media and entertainment segment. Seems like the gross margin overall held in well despite the growth in that segment. Is there anything specific within that segment that's doing well in terms of the cloud services?","Paul L. Sagan","As far as the M&E segment? How we are doing in the cloud services?","Tim Klasell - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes, I mean, if there are any cloud services specifically within M&E that are growing and kind of helping the gross margin overall.","Paul L. Sagan","I mean, there certainly are. I mean, in particular that we -- our DSA and RMA products tend to be sold as the M&E segments pretty well. They continue to make good traction in that area, but -- you were talking about gross margins, and our gross margins kind of -- just want to make sure I understand your question.","Tim Klasell - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes, just the overall gross margin despite the kind of growth in the M&E segment kind of returning to a higher rate, I think, gross margins.","Paul L. Sagan","Yes, I think that the -- I think we talked about that, our mix of business between kind of values -- our cloud infrastructure solutions and the volume solutions was fairly consistent from Q3 to Q4, and so you're seeing similar gross margins as a result of that. The mix didn't shift dramatically. We actually saw a little bit of a lift in our volume solutions Q3 to Q4 from, I think, 3% growth in Q3 to 6% in Q4. So -- but the mix didn't really change.","Operator","The next question will be from Philip Winslow.","Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just wanted to focus back on pricing a little bit. I know you all didn't want to comment about the sort of -- what you're kind of expecting for pricing for the rest of 2012 but when you look at Q4, and I guess at least the first sort of 5 weeks here of 2012, do you see sort of significant changes from sort of normal declines year-over-year versus what you saw kind of Q4 and the first part of last year? And also just in terms of CapEx, I know you guys gave CapEx guidance for Q1, but what's the range that you're kind of thinking about for this year as a percentage of revenue?","Paul L. Sagan","I'll take the pricing part, because I tried to be very clear and declarative. Before, we saw a very consistent pattern. Last year, we expected. This year, our goal is to continue to drive cost out and to be able to pass some of that along to our customers so they can drive more volume, and I don't expect a change in that pattern, and I'll let Jim talk to you about --","Jim Benson","On CapEx, we expect to sit stay within our long-term auto range of 13% to 16%.","Operator","A question coming from the line of Ben Rose.","Ben Z. Rose - Battle Road Research Ltd.","I apologize if the question has been asked, but is there an update on the joint development effort that you're making with Ericsson?","Paul L. Sagan","That question was asked, and what I said was no product announcements today, but very pleased with the collaboration with them and I'm very optimistic that we can do some interesting things together over the next couple of years.","Operator","Last question will be from Richard Fetyko.","Richard Fetyko - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Just curious on the headcount growth in the 2011 period, and what do you expect in 2012. That's it.","Paul L. Sagan","So I think we had headcount growth of roughly a couple hundred people in 2011 and as I mentioned before, our expectation is we're going to continue to grow and invest in the business, so you can continue to see us grow in headcount. I don't have a specific number that I'm going to share, though. But we continue to hire, and we continue to look primarily for engineers and great salespeople. And we expect to end the year with more people that we started with. All right, thank you all for calling. J.D., good luck. Please stay in touch. Jim, welcome aboard to this role. And Jim and I look forward to updating all of you again in another quarter. Thanks for dialing in. Bye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today's conference.

My name is Kim, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] We will conduct a question-and-answer session toward the end of the conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to Natalie Temple with Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Natalie Temple","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Akamai's Investor Conference Call to discuss our third quarter 2012 financial results. Speaking today will be Paul Sagan, Akamai's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Benson, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.","Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.

A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the News & Events portion of the Investor Relations section of our website.","Now let me turn the call over to Paul.","Paul L. Sagan","Thanks, Natalie. Thank you all for joining us today. Q3 was Akamai's best quarter ever. We delivered record revenue of $345 million, up 23% from the same period last year, making it our fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating revenue growth.","The top line was strong across all key verticals in all major geographies and for both cloud infrastructure and content delivery solutions. Gross margins also expanded in the quarter, sequentially and year-over-year. Further, we grew the bottom line even faster than revenue, generating normalized EPS of $0.43 per diluted share, up 26% from Q3 of last year. Finally, we had another solid quarter of cash flow generation with $141 million of cash from operations in the quarter and $384 million year to date. I am extremely pleased with the company's performance and the team's continued execution.","I'll have more to say in a few minutes about the trends we're seeing in the marketplace. But first, let me turn the call over to Jim for detail on Q3. Jim?","James Benson","Thank you, Paul. As Paul just highlighted, we had a great third quarter. Revenue came in above our guidance range at $345 million, up 23% year-over-year and up 4% or $14 million sequentially, our best Q2 to Q3 sequential growth ever with solid growth across the board.","Fundamentally, we saw a continued strong performance in our cloud infrastructure solutions, which grew 22% year-over-year, and we saw acceleration in our content delivery solutions, which grew 23% year-over-year. This growth was aided by the timing of significant software releases that have historically occurred in Q4, as well as some onetime sporting events and the completion of some large custom government projects. Overall, cloud infrastructure solutions made up 58% of our total revenue in the quarter.","Turning to our key verticals. Media & Entertainment was our fastest-growing vertical, benefiting from particularly strong traffic and revenue growth for some of our largest, most strategic accounts. In the quarter, Olympics was a 2-week marquee event for us, demonstrating the potential of HD video over the Internet scale. Broadcasters around the globe leveraged our HD Network to deliver a high-quality interactive experience and relied on our Kona Security Solutions to protect their websites from attacks. Revenue from our Media & Entertainment vertical grew 26% over Q3 of last year and 7% sequentially. This was a particularly strong performance in what is generally a seasonally slower quarter driven in part by the large traffic-related events I just mentioned and was a key driver to our revenue overachievement.","Revenue from our enterprise vertical grew 22% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. This growth were driven by company's leveraging the reliability and performance of the Akamai Intelligent Platform as they shift their content and applications from private data center environments to hybrid and public clouds.","Our commerce vertical grew 21% over Q3 of last year and 4% sequentially. Commerce customers continue to show strong demand for both newer products introduced in the last year like security and mobile solutions, as well as our flagship Web acceleration solutions.","High tech revenue grew 17% year-over-year and was down 1 point off a robust Q2. Growth in the quarter was driven by strong software download volumes and Software-as-a-Service providers adopting more of our cloud infrastructure solutions.","Finally, Public Sector revenue was up 20% from Q3 of last year and was down 4% from a very strong Q2. Q3 revenue benefited from some large custom projects that were completed within the quarter.","Turning to our geographies, sales outside North America represented 29% of total revenue in Q3, up 2 points from the prior quarter. This revenue grew 9% sequentially and 22% year-over-year despite currency headwinds.","Foreign exchange was roughly neutral on a sequential basis but had a negative impact of about $6 million year-over-year. Excluding the impact of currency, revenue growth outside North America accelerated from Q2 levels, growing 30% year-over-year. Both the EMEA and Asia Pacific markets were strong contributors to this quarterly growth. Revenue from North America grew 23% year-over-year in the quarter and was up 2% sequentially. Resell has represented 22% of total revenue in the quarter.","Turning to costs. We were extremely pleased with our continued execution on managing cost of goods sold and gross margins within the quarter. Our cash gross margin was 81%, up 1 point from the prior quarter and up 2 points from the same period last year. GAAP gross margin, which includes depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 68% for the quarter, up slightly from the prior quarter and up 1 point from the same period last year. These gross margin results were better than the guidance we provided for the quarter driven partly by our revenue overachievement but primarily by the ongoing platform efficiency initiatives of our network operations and engineering teams.","GAAP operating expenses were $155 million in the third quarter. These GAAP numbers include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation and acquisition-related charges. Excluding these charges, our operating expenses for the quarter were $122 million, up about $1 million sequentially and in line with our expectations for the quarter.","Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $157 million. That's up 28% from the same period last year and up 9% from Q2 levels. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 45%, better than our guidance, and up 2 points from the prior quarter and from the same period last year.","For the third quarter, total depreciation and amortization was $53 million. These charges include $43 million of network-related depreciation, $5 million of G&A depreciation and $5 million of amortization of intangible assets.","Net interest income for the third quarter was about $1.5 million.","Moving on to earnings. GAAP net income for the quarter was $48 million or $0.27 of earnings per diluted share. As a reminder, our GAAP net income includes several noncash or nonrecurring items, including $25 million of stock-based compensation, including amortization of capitalized equity-based compensation and $5 million from amortization of acquired intangible assets.","Taxes included in our GAAP and normalized earnings were $33 million, based on an estimated full year GAAP tax rate of about 40%, approximately 1 point higher than our guidance range. Including these tax charges, our normalized net income for the third quarter was $79 million. That translates to $0.43 per diluted share on a normalized basis, up $0.09 from Q3 of last year and consistent with Q2 levels and even better than our guidance range. Our weighted average diluted share count for the third quarter was 181 million shares.","Now let me review some balance sheet items. Cash from operations for the third quarter was $141 million. Year to date, we have generated $384 million of cash from operations or 39% of revenue. At the end of Q3, we had over $1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on the balance sheet. Capital expenditures, excluding equity compensation, were $60 million, at the low end of our guidance range. This number includes both investments in the network, as well as capitalized software development.","During the quarter, we spent $37 million on share repurchases, buying back just over 1 million shares at an average price of $31.50. Since the beginning of the year, we have spent $112 million buying back almost 4 million shares at an average price of about $31.","And finally, days sales outstanding for the quarter were 59 days.","In summary, Q3 was strong by all measures, with very robust revenue growth and margin expansion. As we look ahead to Q4, we are forecasting another strong quarter with revenue in the range of $373 million to $385 million. This represents 15% to 19% year-over-year growth and sequential growth of 8% to 11%, a slightly more modest Q3 to Q4 growth rate than we've seen historically. As I mentioned earlier, Q3 was aided by the timing of significant software releases that have typically occurred in Q4 during the holiday season.","The online holiday shopping season plays a large role in our fourth quarter performance, and the strength of this year's online retail season will primarily drive where we land for the quarter. At current spot rates, foreign exchange should be about a $2 million benefit on a sequential basis and about $1 million negative impact on a year-over-year basis.","We expect fourth quarter gross margins to improve from Q3 levels with cash gross margins of roughly 81% to 82% and GAAP gross margins of roughly 70%. We have continued to find ways to make our network even more efficient while taking advantage of our scale. These are critical factors in our ability to deliver gross margins at these levels.","Q4 operating expenses are projected to be up $14 million to $16 million from Q3 levels, driven by typical year-end expenses and continued investments in the business. We expect EBITDA margins to remain flat with Q3 levels at 45%.","We expect to see normalized EPS of $0.48 to $0.50 for the quarter. At the midpoint of this range, this represents 9% year-over-year revenue -- year-over-year EPS growth. This EPS guidance includes taxes of $34 million to $38 million based on a full year GAAP tax rate estimate of roughly 39%. This is lower than the full year rate we have accrued for in Q3 as we expect the federal R&D tax credit to be reinstated in Q4. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of 182 million to 183 million shares, up 1 million to 2 million shares sequentially.","On CapEx, we expect to spend $60 million to $65 million in the quarter, excluding equity compensation, putting us at 16% of revenue for the full year.","With our third quarter results and fourth quarter guidance, we are expecting full year revenue growth of about 18% to 19% and EPS to grow 15% to 16%.","We are looking forward to seeing many of you at our annual Investor Summit in Cambridge on December 12. We plan to share more details about Akamai's growing portfolio of cloud-based solutions, the underlying technology and the opportunities they present.","Now let me turn the call back over to Paul. Paul?","Paul L. Sagan","Thanks, Jim. Given our very positive outlook for Q4, we're looking at an incredibly strong 2012 with revenue growth accelerating over last year, improved gross margins and a solid bottom line expansion.","At the beginning of this year, we outlined the 4 major trends that we thought would drive significant short and long-term growth opportunities for our business. We told you we were investing to expand Akamai's capabilities in the areas of cloud computing, Web security, mobile services and online media because our customers were looking to us to help them capitalize on these very trends. Those investments, coupled with our relentless focus on managing our network operations, has paid off. We believe they've positioned us extremely well to benefit further as those 4 trends continue to reshape the industry.","Just this month, I spoke to many of our clients at our Annual User Conference, and their feedback validated that we've been focusing on helping them solve the right problems. We also heard loud and clear that we're at the beginning of another major shift in how businesses interact with their customers online.","The ways in which we all use the Web have gone far beyond the basic PC and browser. Businesses no longer want people to just visit a site. They want to deliver a meaningful and engaging Web experience, uniquely tailored to individual customers no matter where they are or how they're connected. There are major challenges to overcome to ensure that, well, say, a customer on a 3G smartphone has an equally engaging experience as a user on a WiFi-connected tablet.","To address these challenges, we recently introduced Aqua Ion, a dynamic service that combines internal innovation with technology from our acquisition of Blaze and Cotendo. Aqua Ion is designed to remove the complexities inherent in delivering content to end users across multiple browsers, devices, locations and networks. Optimizing Web experiences across a wide range of end-user situations is critically important to success in today's hyper-connected world.","But optimizing the Web experience only addresses one of the challenges CIOs are facing. This past quarter, Web attacks made the headlines almost daily, and I don't believe anyone thinks that, that's going to change anytime soon. The damage these attacks can do both financially and in terms of reputation is potentially devastating. And our customers are more concerned than ever about the risks.","This past summer the London Olympics and Paralympic Games were a perfect example. Prominent events like these aren't just about high-performance online delivery. They're about uninterrupted high-performance online delivery. Realizing that high-profile websites make for high-profile targets, The London Organising Committee took advantage of Akamai's Kona Security Solutions to protect their sites and their applications from hackers intent on bringing them down.","Beyond security, this year's games, already a highly viewed television event, attracted the largest aggregate online audience ever for a sporting competition. So this was a great example of how online videos are maturing and becoming the way more and more content is being consumed. With our support for the online initiatives of 22 different broadcasters around the world, we saw that viewers were watching across a variety of connected devices while they were watching on their television sets to enhance the traditional TV viewing experience.","Another recent example of this multiscreen phenomenon is the presidential debates. This is where audiences were viewing and interacting with realtime commentary through social media and news outlets while watching the debates live on TV. The opportunity is for our customers, is for them to engage audiences in new ways. But this creates new challenges to prepare content and have it ready for a wide variety of devices and network conditions. Producers either have to meet the audience's higher expectations or risk having the audience turn away.","So to address this, we introduced Akamai's Sola Media Solutions portfolio. This cloud-based offering, including new transcoding and video stream packaging capabilities, provides customers with a powerful but easy-to-use platform for online media workflow storage and delivery. The introduction of Sola Media Solutions plus Aqua Ion and Kona Site Defender are just 3 of the latest product rollouts from Akamai that we delivered in 2012.","We told our customers that we would make enhancements in every one of our solution lines this year, and we have delivered on that promise. Part of our continuing effort to enhance our product portfolio includes integrating strategic acquisitions. We've completed 3 this year, FastSoft being the most recent following Blaze and Cotendo. We believe the FastSoft technology will help us to realize additional efficiencies in our network.","At the same time that we've been driving cost savings in our operations and enhancements to our product lines, we've also been expanding our global footprint to find, sign and retain new clients. We've opened new offices this year in several go-to-market theaters, now giving us a total of 39 regional offices, to better meet the needs of our global customer base and to provide more top line growth outside the United States.","These are exciting times at Akamai. We executed very well on both the top and bottom lines in the third quarter. We're innovative in introducing new products designed to help make the most of the trends driving online business. And at the same time, we're expanding our go-to-market efforts worldwide to capture the opportunities that we believe are unfolding right in front of us.","So thank you for joining us today. It's a pleasure to report these results. We look forward to seeing many of you at our Investor Summit in December. Now Jim and I would be pleased to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, the first question, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Okay. Your first question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe with Morgan Stanley.","Jennifer A. Swanson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So since I'm limited to one question, I'll try and lump 2 together as a way around it. Just drilling into the strong performance in the Media & Entertainment business, I was just sort of looking back, and I think that's the strongest growth that we've seen from you all in that space over the last 4 years. So sort of one is this has been sort of a model business historically in terms of the growth rates, and we seem to be at a level now that, that's consistent with where we've seen peak growth in the past. So how are you thinking about the trajectory going there forward? Is that something that we could see start to cycle down again? Or is there something more durable this time around? And then two, related to that, and looking at some of the cost initiatives, I think having above normal and many -- and coupled with CapEx at the low end of guidance, is not the thing we typically hear from you all. So if you go through some of these initiatives on the cost side, is that reducing the capital intensity of the volume business or the content delivery business? Or was there just mix specific in this quarter that maybe that was a little bit less of a relationship than it has been historically?","Paul L. Sagan","Okay, great. Great, one question weaving those together. So I think what we've seen is strong growth in rich media online, both pure video, longer form, higher quality and then the 2 screen phenomenon driving particularly gaming, social around news and sports. And that's creating whole new use cases that just weren't there before. And while it's too soon to call this as a trajectory over multiple years going forward, we're very encouraged by what our customers have been doing and telling us about their plans for doing more online with video and rich media and particularly using applications and multiple devices to enhance the user experience. And consumers seem to love it and seem to be doing more. So it's been a very strong driver for us, particularly as we head into the holiday season this year. I was really pleased, I think we were all really pleased about being able to drive this kind of growth, not just in the cloud infrastructure services, which performed extremely well, but in media and continue to drive better bottom line performance, really, wherever you looked across the balance sheet. And you are right in picking up on something: It's been this ongoing effort to drive efficiency in our network through better software, better management of the hardware and effectively, over time, trying to drive down the capital intensity even of the content delivery business, which as you know, has a higher capital intensity than the cloud infrastructure services. You've seen some of the benefits of that work. It paid off even faster than we expected this year so far. Things like FastSoft ought to help us drive more of those kinds of benefits going forward. So we're just very pleased, and the team's going to stay very focused because we think we can continue, not necessarily always at that same rate and pace, but to make the operations even more efficient across the entire set of products.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mark Kelleher with Dougherty & Company.","Mark Kelleher - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division","I was wondering, you typically touch on the pricing dynamics over on the CDN side. Typically, you're seeing 20% year-over-year declines. I was just wondering if you could kind of touch on that. Maybe there's some gross margin effect that, that is not -- that's getting a little better. And then connected to that, maybe a few words on the relative growth expectations between the cloud and the CDN. It's been pretty steady as a percent of revenue on both sides for many quarters. Do you ever see one side kind of elbowing out the other side?","Paul L. Sagan","Sure. So we always hold off on the pricing declines so that you can ask that question because I know everybody is always dying to ask us the question. I think we've been managing that well. I think that, that environment has been very consistent. And we didn't see a major change there. So the benefit in the improving margin you're seeing is, I think, in the teams' work here. They much more efficiently utilized our assets and our resources and make the most of the software we deploy and then the CapEx and the operating costs. In terms of long-term growth opportunities, I think what you've heard me say is I think these are both great markets to be in. I do think the overall spend on corporate IT as corporations move more and more of their computing to hybrid cloud environments, both for consumer and business-facing applications, is just an enormous market; overall, a bigger opportunity worldwide, even than online media. We have the opportunity to execute in both, and that will have some -- help determine, to some extent, which grows faster. When you've got both of them growing as balanced as they have been this year, that's the best possible situation. Really, the cloud infrastructure business, which today is close to 60% of our business, basically didn't even exist 5 years ago or a little bit before. So it's come from behind to this strong position. I'd like to see them both growing in the future, but I certainly wouldn't mind if cloud infrastructure grew even faster over time because I think it would just recognize across mobility, across cloud and across security the wallet share that's available for us to tap into.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Rob Sanderson with ABR Investment Strategy.","Rob Sanderson - ABR Investment Strategy LLC","A question for me is on just the distribution of these contracts that you've lost. So last I checked, you have about 4,000 customers. Like Paul just finished saying, IT is an enormous market. I think Oracle has like 380,000 customers. I think cloud, security, mobile, certainly applicable to a broader audience as we move forward here. How do you -- it seems like there's a great opportunity and also there's a great challenge for the organization. How do you really scale up and grow from 4,000 to something substantially larger than that?","Paul L. Sagan","Well, I think the first answer is just as cloud and Internet-based computing grows, more and more organizations will increase their budget to the scale that they would be buying the kinds of solutions that Akamai offers, and that just takes a little bit of time. The other has been our effort to build our partner ecosystem to allow for far more feet on the street, if you will, through partners and resellers. You've seen some of those announcements this year where it's effectively click to deploy Akamai capability through partners and channels without ever having to talk or touch an Akamai person. You'll see more of that over the coming years because I think that there's a great opportunity to grow both our business outside of North America because it's only -- it's a little under 30% now and to grow our channels and partner business because that only stands at about $1 and $5 today. So I think we're doing some of those things. I think there's a lot more opportunity, particularly as you have more and more people in the ecosystem offering solutions to take people to the hybrid cloud environment, they look to services like Akamai to give global reach and capability that partners can't do on their own. And I think that those are ways that will drive customer growth even beyond the great customer set that we have today. I also think that we've not been focused solely on numbers of customers. It's been size and quality. And I don't think we're fully penetrated in most of the accounts that we're in today. So one of the things that we try to do is we broaden the product portfolio such as with the introduction of the Kona Site Defender security suite this year, is to be able to go back where we have trusted relationships and try to grow our share in those accounts of IT spending where it makes sense.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of David Hilal.","David M. Hilal - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Paul, I wanted to talk about Kona and your efforts in security. I know you had recently changed the pricing mechanism, which we had understood kind of under the old way. Maybe it was a little bit of a roadblock in getting customer adoption. I guess how has the new pricing structure helped in that effort? And I think a year ago or so, I think you quoted about 300 security customers, and I was hoping you can maybe update us there.","Paul L. Sagan","Sure. I think some of those updates will wait for our Investor Day. But I think the key is, first, explaining the problem the customers are dealing with and then how our product has changed. In the past, we certainly did some bespoke security work, particularly around DDoS protection for some customers going back a long way. That's one of the ways we developed the expertise that we have, as well as in the last couple of years, a Web application firewall capability. What we did this year was combine them in a product with a unified interface and reporting and metrics in Kona. And it provides customers with DDoS protection, as well as the Web application firewall capabilities. The pricing dynamic that you talked about, I think, was the comments I've made in the past where for DDoS alone, we would protect you for a little bit of money, but if you got hit, you'd get a bill for all of that traffic. And sometimes, that was an awfully large bill, and customers said, \"And that wasn't traffic I even wanted to happen.\" We would say, \"That's not our problem. What are we going to do about the bill?\" It's not a good customer conversation because there's such a widespread understanding now that people need protection from distributed denial of service attacks. We've been able to come in with a pricing dynamic that's effectively much more like an insurance premium across a broad customer set so that for the people who get hit because of our scale and our economics, we can absorb that traffic without an unexpected cost to the customer. And so it's a much more affordable solution. I don't consider it a cheap priced solution and it's very sophisticated, especially when you marry the Web Application Firewall capabilities, but at least it's a known price to the customers who are adopting it. In terms of the numbers, we're certainly above where we were at the beginning of the year when we started. I'm not sure exactly which number you were using before when you quoted that. That was probably the total of people who bought one point solution or another, clearly not the number that had bought Kona a year ago because it's only been out this year. We'll give you some more updates on that and the addressable market opportunity as we see it in a couple of months or 1.5 months in Boston if you join us then.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gray Powell with Wells Fargo.","Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So digging into the cost of goods sold line, co-location fees as a percentage of revenue has been declining nicely this year. I have to imagine that happened again this quarter. Should that continue going forward? And how should we think about the other component of cost of goods sold being with in-service-related fees trending?","James Benson","Sure. I'll take that, Paul. So you're right, we've talked about it in past quarters. And we continue to do a bunch of things to drive our co-location costs down. One, making sure that our servers are in kind of not the most expensive facilities. We've moved also at the areas of metered power because power is a huge component of our co-location costs. We've made very good progress there. We continue to look at the network and make sure that where we've made software updates in different areas so the service that we have on the network we get more throughput out of. We're ensuring that we buy new servers that have higher throughput. So there's a bunch of -- there's a bunch -- there's a large play book of activities that we're using to drive co-location costs down, and we believe we can continue to do that. You mentioned bandwidth. Again, we continue to benefit, as the rest of the industry benefits, with the cost of bandwidth going down over time. So certainly, we get the kind of buying leverage for being a huge buyer of bandwidth. So we continue to be able to drive bandwidth prices -- bandwidth costs down as well. So as far as -- these initiatives, we're going to continue going forward. And I would expect that there's a bunch of things. It depends upon what traffic volumes do and a bunch of other things. But those initiatives, we believe, are going to allow us to continue to manage our network costs very well. Probably the last area is it's important to note that the other area that's in our cost of goods sold is we've talked about the pace of innovation, and the pace of innovation that the company has actually seen in the wave of product introductions that have taken place over the last year. A lot of that is driven by the fact that we actually capitalized this innovation through capitalized software development. So what you're seeing in our cost of goods sold is you should see a larger percentage of our cost of goods sold start to become related to internal software development that once we introduce products gets depreciated and would be included in cost of goods sold. So in general, there's a bunch of things going on between bandwidth that we're driving down, co-location that we're driving down and continued product innovation that will really introduce new costs that probably -- at a greater pace than we've seen historically.","Paul L. Sagan","And the only thing I would add to that is that one differentiator for Akamai as an engineering and software development company is there are lots of things that we do that are unique to Akamai to make, if you will, the same footprint, more productive, more efficient every time we can roll out major changes in our software. So we are very focused on those kinds of benefits that are things that we can control and do that we don't believe others can do as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Serge [ph] Auty with JPMorgan.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","For the last couple of years, you've preached to us that no single event is moving the needle. So it's kind of ironic that you finally have one here with the Olympics. So I guess my question would be, can you give us a sense of what it contributed? And maybe an add-on would be since you had the Cotendo acquisition, can you give us a sense what organic growth was in the quarter?","Paul L. Sagan","Yes, I'll take the first half. I think there are a couple of important points that -- we're trying to explain not only we made the guidance, we jumped way over it, and it was a whole bunch of things. The Olympics was one that was even bigger than we expected. Some software delivery was bigger. Growth across the board, every geo, including EMEA, doing well. You put all those things together and you get that explanation. The other piece about the Olympics, which was really interesting, was that it was a media and a security event. And so we were able to sign up so many broadcasters and do so much business because it wasn't just a video delivery of that, it was a 2-screen interactive event with a huge security threshold. And so you put the power of the platform together, and that was a terrific win for us and demonstrated, I think, where a lot of the world of online media is going. But it alone does not explain why we did so well. It's all of those things together. And then I'll let Jim comment on sort of the organic growth versus acquisition.","James Benson","Okay. Yes, I just want to make sure that we're clear in what we're trying to message. We certainly saw a strong performance in the Olympics. Obviously, Olympics is a multiple-week event versus some other events. So we've certainly got some benefit from that. But as Paul said, there were a bunch of things. And one of the things very notably that I mentioned is the timing of very large software releases that historically had happened in Q4 that actually happened earlier and occurred in Q3. So we had strong growth across the board, across the company, but we saw particularly strong growth in software releases that occurred in late Q3 that historically have taken place in Q4. I also mentioned that we had a very robust Public Sector performance with some custom projects that completed within the quarter. So one of the ways to look at it is that I mentioned in our guidance for Q4 that we're guiding kind of -- we're guiding to a slightly lower sequential growth Q3 to Q4. Some of that is driven by the fact that seasonally, some revenue that occurred in Q4, actually, we received some of that in Q3. One way to look at it is, if you look at Q3 and Q4 combined and kind of look at the half and say, what has been the growth half 2 versus half 1? If you look at our guidance at the midpoint, we're growing kind of from half 1 to half 2 about 10%, very consistent with what we've grown over the last few years, about 10% from half 1 to half 2. So some of it is the timing of when these things happen. But again, a very strong Q3 performance across the board. We've got a little bit of a lift from some things that historically we get in Q4, but we're expecting a very strong performance again in Q4.","Paul L. Sagan","And then the organic question was the second piece.","James Benson","So I think organically, our sequential growth was if you look at the benefits that we get from Cotendo, I mentioned before that Cotendo was about a $2 million a month run rate. So you pull that out. You're talking $6 million. We had a currency headwind of $6 million. Our organic growth is exactly the same as our growth including acquisitions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney.","Mark S. Mahaney - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just one quick question. A brief update on the CEO succession plans?","Paul L. Sagan","Don't have one for you. I said I wouldn't give regular updates. The board has a thorough process underway. And when it's concluded, they will make an announcement. I want to remind you that I said I would complete the job and deliver on our expectations. I think we're doing that. In fact, I think we're doing a little better than that. And when the board is ready to announce the next phase, we'll send you that announcement. But I don't have it for you today.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Fetyko with Janney Capital.","Richard Fetyko - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","On the international growth, which accelerated and is growing faster than domestic, just curious what you're seeing and what regions are particularly strong. And are these markets typically a few years behind in terms of the U.S. maturity, and therefore, do you expect these markets to grow faster than the U.S.?","Paul L. Sagan","Sure. I'll take that. So I think we talked about this in the past. We've continued to make investments in our go-to-market resources in the U.S. as well but more specifically in our international markets, both EMEA and APJ, because there's huge untapped market opportunity for Akamai. So we've made investments there. I think what you're starting to see, is you're starting see some of those investments pay off. We had strong growth in EMEA. We had strong growth in APJ. We had strong growth in our emerging markets. So we have pretty much strong growth across the board. Certainly, we're not immune to some of the economic kind of headwinds that are taking place in Europe. So some of the Southern economies of Europe are not growing as fast as other economies. But in general, we're seeing very solid growth in the international business, and I think it's really driven by, one, the investments we're making; and two, just the market opportunity and really the offering that Akamai has. In many cases, these offerings can actually help customers lower costs through offloads of their infrastructure. So actually, it's a very compelling value proposition for even economies that are struggling from a macroeconomic perspective.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","You added, I think, 230 employees in the quarter, if my math is right. And just looking back through my model, it looks like that's the most you've ever added in the company's history. Just curious where those employees are going in terms of divisions and geographies. I imagine some of them are to help with that international go-to-market strategy that you're referring to, but any more additional color would be helpful.","Paul L. Sagan","Sure. You're absolutely right that, as I mentioned, we continue to invest in the business. We added over 100 employees in Q2. We added over 200 in Q3. And the specific area that we're adding them in is, I mentioned go-to-market, but we're also adding a significant number of resources in our R&D and engineering organizations. As we continue, there's huge market opportunities that we believe we need more engineering resources to basically build and develop the solutions that we believe the market is really looking for. So the growth that you saw, the roughly 230 headcount was largely in our go-to-market area, but it was also in the kind of our engineering area. And in particular, for our go-to-market area, it's -- yes, there was some in international, but it's international, U.S. And in particular, it's sales resources and also services resources that go along to support our sales force.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Breen with William Blair.","James D. Breen - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I also just want to ask a quick question on the international side. I think what started a lot of the growth in CDN or helped accelerate it was the increase in smartphone penetration here in the U.S. and mobile data in general. We're starting to see that more internationally, but those levels are still pretty low. What's your view on some of the assets internationally in terms of data centers and fiber and how that growth is continuing? Do you think the right assets are being put in place to help you really accelerate there over the next couple of years?","Paul L. Sagan","Sure. So I want to clarify something there because maybe I misunderstood you or there's a misconception. Certainly, smartphones are driving all sorts of new use cases. But mobile, particularly cellular usage, isn't driving nearly as much data because the bandwidth isn't there as broadband connections. So that actually hasn't been driving most of the content delivery growth. Often, those complex applications to mobile devices, including the Bring Your Own Device to work, is growing -- driving the demand for some of our acceleration in cloud infrastructure services as much or, frankly, I think more than the content delivery solutions. What drives a lot of the growing demand for the content delivery solutions is the growth of video, particularly broadband video. And certainly some of it is to smartphones, at least when they're on WiFi, and software and application delivery and updates on a global basis. I'm not sure if you mean third-party assets. If you do, please jump in and correct me. If you mean Akamai assets, we now have more network relationships worldwide than in the history of the company. Our network is as broadly deployed as ever. I think the strength of our network relationships is as strong as I've seen it in a long time because networks recognize the value of having Akamai technology inside makes their performance to their end-user subscribers better. And it actually reduces their costs and some of the CapEx that they'd have to deploy on their own and then frankly not even get paid for having deployed. So I think that certainly, broadband infrastructure continues to grow. In fact, outside the U.S., it's often better than in North America. And we continue to follow the growth in usage in most corners of the world and are increasing our footprint and the kinds of services that we're offering. And so the answer a couple of questions back, I do think there's a lag in the adoption of some of these services, which gives us opportunity to actually have even more growth internationally. And then there's really some markets that are, in some use cases, advancing ahead of the U.S. because they're either more broadband, higher speeds or mobile -- faster or higher growth of mobility there already. And we're trying to mine those opportunities, sometimes even ahead of some of what we see here in North America or the U.S. specifically.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sameet Sinha with B. Riley.","Sameet Sinha - B. Riley & Co., LLC, Research Division","My question was regarding fourth quarter guidance. I know you mentioned software downloads ahead of the third quarter. We had iOS 6 and Mountain Lion. But Windows 8 launches in the fourth quarter. I think that could be one of the key drivers. Also, what -- in terms of the efficiencies that you are working on, Jim, I mean, could you give us -- help us think about -- I mean, are you 10%, 20%, 30% through looking at other products, the infrastructure and everything to wring out these efficiencies?","Paul L. Sagan","So this is Paul. Let me take it. We're not going to comment on any specific client software. Certainly, some got delivered in Q3 that historically might have dropped in Q4. But you're right, there's more software delivery potential coming in Q4 from a number of our long-standing clients across PCs, devices and gaming businesses as well. And we're very excited about that. And it's part of what's embedded in the guidance that, I think, says Q4 should be strong and it's going to be a terrific year. The nice thing about the efficiency goals is as long as we stay focused on them, and have now for close to 15 years, we never get to the end of the list of things that we can do. So we just keep raising the bar every year on the team and ask them to go back and wring more efficiency out. And part of the reason we can do that is that the hard work gets better and faster, and the capabilities grow, including the multi-core devices that we're now deploying that didn't exist a few years ago. So I think there's more that we can do. It's on the roadmap. FastSoft brings us even more, and that's not deployed yet. So I think there's a lot more efficiency that we're going to be able to drive in the next few years. And while I don't know what we'll be doing beyond that, we've never run out of new ideas, particularly as the hardware continues to advance. So I think we need to stay focused on it, but our goal will be to raise the bar on that every year to help us continue to be very profitable.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Kessler with S&P Capital IQ.","Scott H. Kessler - S&P Equity Research","So a lot of my questions have been asked and answered. But I did want to ask, it seems that your patent infringement lawsuit against Limelight was recently revised, to some extent at least. And I'm wondering if you could remind us why this is potentially important to the company.","Paul L. Sagan","Sure. Well, as you know, that's gone on a long time, and it's hard to predict its final outcome. But yes, we got what we thought was the right, but it was a terrific ruling from our point of view in the appeals court in Washington. That case is not done, and we know these things can take a long time and take a lot of twists and turns. But the fundamental thing is that we believe that this is an innovation shop that we invent new things that those are of shareholder value and that we need to not just try to commercially exploit these in the good sense in Akamai's services for which we can get paid, but we need to defend the value of those things when we think other people are stepping on them or transgressing our shareholders' rights. And so that's why sometimes we wind up in court when we don't think we can get appropriate protection another way. I won't go into the details of that case. One, they are too lengthy for even an all-day call, I guess. And it's hard to know exactly how they will come up. There have been twists and turns. But we were very pleased that the Court of Appeals, we think, saw it the right way. And we're optimistic that as long as we're patient, we will prevail, and that will accrue to the value of our shareholders.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Aaron Schwartz with Jefferies.","Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","You provided some color on how you think about COGS going forward here and also talked about sort of the hiring on go-to-market and engineering. If you see a continued, maybe, mix shift to cloud infrastructure, would you expect sort of more of an OpEx mix as well? I mean, would you expect more of your costs to shift down to the OpEx line? I'm just wondering if you could provide some color on how you think about the model longer term?","Paul L. Sagan","Sure. I think we've talked about it a little bit before, but let me kind of clarify a little bit. So we obviously have our content delivery solutions business, which is kind of a lower gross margin business but a lower OpEx business. And then we have our cloud solutions business, which obviously has higher gross margins, but it also has a higher operating expense. So as the company continues to innovate and build out our suite of solutions, not just the content delivery but more specifically in the cloud solutions area, you can expect that the OpEx investments that we're going to need to make are going to increase. And so you can expect we're going to continue to make investments in R&D. We're going to continue to make investments in go-to-market at a greater pace for that part of the business. Now that part of the business, because it has higher gross margins, will have a little bit higher EBITDA. And actually, it has a lower CapEx structure, so it actually has higher free cash flow from a company. So you can continue to see as we shift more of our business to cloud solutions, if the mix shifts that way, you can expect that you'll see kind of a higher operating expense percent. But you'll see, hopefully, a lower CapEx percent and maybe a stronger free cash flow percent, maybe, in the kind of the model we talked about is in the low 30s.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ed Maguire with CLSA.","Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","This quarter, you were at a number of events focused on the mobile opportunity, and I was wondering if you could just address the partnership with Ericsson and the expectation that mobile content delivery can become a really meaningful part of revenues rather than just kind of a strategic direction.","Paul L. Sagan","Well, I think it's already one of the things that's driving this whole shift from deliver the site to ensure the Web experience, and a big piece of some of the technology acquisitions we've done this year and the rollout of Aqua Ion is around improving that experience. And that's especially to mobile devices, whether they're smartphones or tablets and whether they're on cellular connection, 3G or 4G LTE or on WiFi and make sure that those work in every case. And so we already think that there is a strategic imperative and a payoff for what we're doing. Beyond that, we think that there's a new opportunity to partner with hardware and solution providers inside wireless networks because they have their own particular challenges. They were not built for data. Ironically, they're new networks, and they weren't built for data. They were built for voice. So they were built for narrowband applications to talk to -- between 2 people, and that's actually now what people want to do on these devices most of the time. And so we think that there's opportunity, long-term opportunity, to create new solutions and create new revenue streams. But already, we believe that it's strategic, and we're seeing the value in things like the Ion release and what we're doing for mobile interaction optimization and better performance to a site or to an application over a mobile device, whether it be a smartphone. And our customers are already buying for that reason. So I think we're seeing the benefit even as we do the long-term development and product testing of some of these in-network or network provider solutions that we think long-term have additional benefit for us as well.","Operator","The next question comes from line of Michael Turits with Raymond James.","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Van Rhee with Craig-Hallum.","Jeffrey Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division","I guess one clarification. As you commented to looking at the growth rates and that we should look at H2 versus H1 and historical patterns being the norm, if I look back at the years that followed you and then I compare that to the description you're giving of the various segments of the business, this doesn't feel like the typical H2 to H1. It feels like you've got a lot of separate factors that are accelerating here. So can you just kind of reconcile the 2 as to why on one hand, it should be typical, and on the other hand, it sounds like from the commentary, things are getting better than they normally would be here?","Paul L. Sagan","Well, I think, I mean, certainly, if you look historically, look half 2 to half 1 for the last, say, 3 to 4 years, we have grown half 1 to half 2 roughly 10%. And that's effectively what we're guiding here at this midpoint. I think I shared with you that I think seasonally, when you see things, what we've seen this quarter is that some things that maybe in some years happen in Q4 actually happened in Q3 this year. So the reason I tried to provide some color around half 1 to half 2 was to just give some color maybe to our Q3 to Q4 sequential growth being a little bit lower than it's been historically. For sure, you are right, we are seeing very strong growth and very strong demand for our cloud solution. You can see that we've grown them consistently for the last couple of quarters in the low 20s. We saw a very significant acceleration in the content delivery part of our business in Q3. As I mentioned, some of that growth acceleration was aided by the things that I mentioned. But for sure, I think Paul mentioned this earlier, we're seeing very healthy growth across the board, across most of our customer sets. But I think you have to make sure that you balance that with the fact that some of what aided Q3 were the software releases that I mentioned, these custom government projects that I mentioned and just I'd say to a smaller extent, the events that I mentioned. But in general, we're very pleased with the performance of the business. I don't want you to have a takeaway that we think the business growth is slowing down because it's not. We still think there's significant demand. It's just a matter of timing between quarters.","Paul L. Sagan","Yes. I think what you're seeing is very strong growth, which you're identifying, and we're just trying to explain why we think that people build their models out. If there's any question about what's going on between 3 and 4, it's only a little bit in timing. But we expect a very strong quarter as I think our guidance indicates. The piece that's hardest for us and why we always have a little bit bigger range in Q4, and we just don't know is, our customers anticipate a very strong commerce season. It's driven Q4 growth every year to be ahead of the other quarters. Last year, it was exceptional, particularly as we were really fully recovered or recovering even faster out of the recession of a couple of years before when really spending was really, really slow. And last year, we grew 15%, Q3 to Q4, driven by what, really, we don't have insight into today. That doesn't just -- that doesn't start for a few more weeks. We just don't know exactly where the commerce season will go. And yes, it could provide even more upside than we've built into the model. But based on what we can see and try to estimate these accounts, that's how we've called it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chad Bartley with Pacific Crest.","Chad Bartley - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","I definitely understand what you're saying about the timing issues, Q3, Q4 from a sequential perspective. But one follow-up on year-over-year growth. So you talked about earlier on the call, 4 straight quarters of accelerating growth. It looks like for Q4, adjusting for acquisitions, adjusting for currency, you're looking for year-over-year growth to decelerate. So I'm curious, what's driving that? Is it a particular segment, particular vertical...","Paul L. Sagan","It's just really the wraparound of really an unbelievable Q4 last year just when everybody was saying, \"Where is your growth going to come from?\" And the total growth last year was 11%. You saw it start in Q4, and we jumped 15% quarter-over-quarter. You're just seeing the wraparound to that exceptional Q4 last year. But we're coming close at the high end of our guidance to close to doubling the growth rate we had year-over-year. So we've had 4 straight quarters of growth. You're seeing us wrap around to the single biggest jump we have had. And so we're expecting a great Q4. We're just sort of reminding you that compared to last year's jump, Q3 to 4, it's a little hard to duplicate even though we're very bullish on how we think the year is going to go.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Donna Jaegers with D.A. Davidson.","Donna Jaegers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","One just quick question, I guess. On the software downloads, those are in the high tech vertical? Or are those in entertainment? Can you give us some magnitude of how much that added to the quarter?","Paul L. Sagan","Yes. I mean, so obviously, we've put customers in each one of our verticals. And so we have some customers that really represent their high tech customer and a media customer and a commerce customer. We only put them in one vertical. So we happen to have software download activity. It's primarily in our high tech vertical. We also have customers that also drive software download activity that's also in our M&E vertical and other verticals.","James Benson","Think of a gaming company, for example. That's really a media and entertainment company, but what we're doing for them -- or one of the things we're doing is delivering their game.","Operator","Your next question and your last question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Unknown Analyst","This is Zach [ph] for Phil. Could you just comment on any pricing trends you're seeing in M&E versus commerce, anything you've seen in the last few quarters or you expect to see going forward?","Paul L. Sagan","Very stable environment, same kind of long-term trends, particularly in M&E, around volumes. So we think we have that well measured. And same kind of trends and stability in commerce that we've seen as well. There we're certainly seeing, along with enterprise, strong uptake of our new security suite, which I think is a premium product and is reflective of the value we're getting in the market. So we're very pleased overall with how we're doing with pricing on the top line and then profitability on the bottom line.","Thank you all for calling in. I'm pleased to report these results, and we'll be back in another 3 months to report on how the commerce and fall season turned out.

My name is Derek, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Natalie Temple of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Natalie Temple","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Akamai's investor conference call to discuss our second quarter 2012 financial results. Speaking today will be Paul Sagan, Akamai's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Benson, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.","Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view as of July 25, 2012. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances.","As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the News and Events portion of the Investor Relations section of our website.","Now let me turn the call over to Paul.","Paul L. Sagan","Thanks, Natalie, and thank you, all, for joining us today. Akamai performed extremely well in the second quarter across all of our key financial metrics. We delivered record revenue of $331 million, up 20% from the same period last year and our third consecutive quarter of accelerating year-over-year growth.","We grew the bottom line even faster than revenue in the quarter, generating normalized EPS of $0.43 per diluted share, up 23% from Q2 of last year. We had another very strong quarter of cash flow generation, with $150 million of cash from operations. This cash generation puts us back over $1 billion in cash and equivalents, even after completing 2 significant acquisitions earlier this year.","We continue to see strong demand across all of our key verticals and markets, importantly with more applications and transactions moving to the Internet. Sales of our cloud infrastructure solution accelerated 22% on a year-over-year basis. Revenue, profit and cash flow performance in the first 6 months of the year all set records for Akamai.","I'll be back in a few minutes to talk about how our solutions are helping our customers adapt to the biggest trends driving IT. But first, let me turn the call over to Jim for details on Q2. Jim?","James Benson","Thank you, Paul. As Paul just highlighted, we had a great quarter. We saw continued strong performance in our content delivery solutions and accelerated revenue growth in our cloud infrastructure solutions.","At the same time, we began to realize significant benefits from improvements we are making to scale our network operations, resulting in higher-than-expected gross margins in EBITDA for the quarter. We did all of this while continuing to make key investments back into the business to better enable customers to move more and more of their mission-critical business to the Akamai cloud, securely and efficiently.","Since the beginning of the year, we have released 7 new products, entered into several important new partnerships, accelerated key go-to-market initiatives and successfully completed 2 acquisitions, while at the same time, maintaining strong profit margins.","Diving into the details of our second quarter results, our revenue was $331 million, coming in above our guidance. This was up 20% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. As Paul noted, this represents the third consecutive quarter of accelerating revenue growth, with revenue growth accelerating in every vertical and every geography during the second quarter, exceeding our expectations.","Cloud infrastructure solutions growth, accelerated to 22% year-over-year, made up 58% of our total revenue. And in terms of brand-new customers to Akamai, over 75% purchased a cloud infrastructure solution.","Turning to our verticals, Media & Entertainment delivered healthy growth in the quarter, with revenue growing 19% over Q2 of last year and 4% sequentially. We continued to see strong traffic growth, building on the trend that began last fall. Our commerce vertical grew 21% over Q2 of last year and declined 1% sequentially in what is typically a slower seasonal quarter for eCommerce.","We saw excellent growth year-over-year from continued demand for our dynamic site acceleration solution as well as solid early traction for our security portfolio. Revenue from our enterprise vertical grew 18% year-over-year and 5% sequentially, as companies continue to shift their content and applications to the cloud and leverage the security and performance of the Akamai Intelligent Platform.","High tech continued its strong start to the year in Q2. Revenue in this vertical grew 18% year-over-year and 4% sequentially, driven by higher software download volumes. We also continued to see traction among Software-as-a-Service, or SaaS providers, that migrated to our cloud infrastructure solutions.","Finally, Public Sector revenue was very strong, growing 23% year-over-year and 18% sequentially.","Much of this performance was driven by several custom projects that were completed in the quarter for different government agencies.","Turning to our geographies, sales outside North America represented 27% of total revenue in Q2, down 1 point from the prior quarter. This revenue grew 1% sequentially and 11% year-over-year, despite currency headwinds. Stronger dollar had a negative impact on our revenue of about $1.5 million sequentially and $5.5 million on a year-over-year basis.","Excluding the impact of currency, revenue growth outside North America accelerated from Q1 levels, growing 17% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. We saw accelerated growth at all of our major European and Asia-Pacific markets.","Revenue from North America grew 23% year-over-year in Q2 and was up 5% sequentially. Resell has represented 21% of total revenue, flat with the prior quarter.","Turning to costs. We were extremely pleased with the performance on cost of goods sold and gross margins in the quarter, with cash gross margins of 80%, up 1 point from the prior quarter and flat with the same period last year. GAAP gross margin, which includes depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 68% for the quarter, consistent with both Q1 and the second quarter of last year.","These results are better than the guidance we provided on gross margin earlier in the quarter. Our network operations and engineering teams have been heavily focused on implementing a number of hardware and software initiatives designed to manage our global network more efficiently.","These projects provided early benefits in Q2, positively impacting our gross margins. And we believe they will allow us to continue scaling our network, going forward, without increasing COGS at the same rate.","GAAP operating expenses were $157 million in the second quarter. These GAAP numbers include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation and acquisition-related charges. Excluding these charges, our operating expenses for the quarter were $122 million, up $10 million from Q1 and roughly in line with our expectations for the quarter.","Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $143 million, that's up 13% from the same period last year and flat with Q1 levels. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 43%, better than our guidance range of 41% to 42%, down 2 points from the prior quarter and down 3 points from the same period last year.","For the second quarter, total depreciation and amortization was $50 million. These charges include $40 million of network-related depreciation, $5 million of G&A depreciation and $5 million of amortization of intangible assets.","Net interest income for the second quarter was about $2 million.","Moving on to earnings. GAAP net income for the quarter was $44 million or $0.24 of earnings per diluted share. As a reminder, our GAAP net income includes several noncash or nonrecurring items, including $28 million of stock-based compensation, including amortization of capitalized equity-based compensation and $5 million from amortization of acquired intangible assets.","We are including GAAP taxes in our normalized earnings, and the GAAP tax charge was $26 million, based on an estimated full year GAAP tax rate of about 39%, approximately 1 point lower than our guidance range.","Based on this full year tax rate, our normalized net income for the second quarter was $78 million.","This translates to 43% -- $0.43 per diluted share on a normalized basis, up $0.08 from Q2 of last year and up $0.02 from Q1 levels. This was above our guidance range coming into the quarter as the increased revenue growth and effective management of our network combined to drive a very positive result on the bottom line.","Our weighted average diluted share count for the second quarter was 182 million shares. Now let me review some balance sheet items.","Cash from operations for the second quarter was a record $150 million. Year-to-date, we have generated $242 million of cash from operations or 37% of revenue. At the end of Q2, we had just over $1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on the balance sheet. Capital expenditures, excluding equity compensation, were $56 million, below our guidance range, due primarily to the timing of some network investments that shifted out of the second quarter. This number includes both investments in the network as well as capitalized software development.","During the quarter, we spent $67 million in share repurchases, buying back 2 million shares at an average price of just under $31. Since the inception of our share repurchase program, we've spent $558 million buying back a total of 20 million shares at an average price of just over $27.","And finally, days sales outstanding for the quarter was 57 days.","Rounding out the first half of the year, Q2 provided us with another strong quarter of growth for both cloud infrastructure and content delivery solutions. We believe we have very strong momentum as we head into the back half of 2012.","In our view, the very healthy signings we've seen for our cloud infrastructure solutions demonstrate the value Akamai can bring to enterprises that want to realize the benefits of doing business over the Internet. In addition, traffic growth accelerated once again for our content delivery solutions, in part due to our strong presence with social media and gaming customers, as well as our traditional strength with online media clients.","Looking forward to Q3, we expect revenue in the range of $332 million to $342 million. Midpoint of our revenue guidance translates to 20% year-over-year revenue growth. At current spot rates, foreign exchange should be about a $2-million negative impact on a sequential basis and about $7.5-million negative impact on a year-over-year basis.","We expect gross margins to remain relatively stable with cash gross margins in the range of 79% to 80%, and GAAP gross margins, which include equity compensation, in the range of 67% to 68%. Q3 operating expenses are projected to be up a couple of million dollars from Q2 levels and we expect EBITDA margins to come in at about 43%, consistent with Q2 levels.","We expect to see fully taxed normalized EPS of $0.40 to $0.42 for the quarter. At the midpoint of this range, this represents 21% year-over-year growth. This EPS guidance includes taxes of $27 million to $30 million, based on a full year GAAP tax rate in the range of 38% to 39% and also reflects a fully diluted share count of 180 million shares.","On CapEx, we expect to spend $60 million to $65 million in the quarter, excluding equity compensation. For the full year, we expect CapEx to be within our model of 13% to 16% of revenue.","Overall, we are very pleased with the performance of the business in Q2 and the momentum we have heading into Q3.","Now let me turn the call back over to Paul. Paul?","Paul L. Sagan","Thank you, Jim. As most of you know, we believe there are 4 major trends driving business online and fueling great potential for Akamai: cloud computing; mobility; online video; and a need for much stronger Internet security.","Businesses of all types have an unprecedented opportunity to use the Internet to drive growth and accelerate innovation, returning to cloud computing to achieve greater agility and reduce costs. We're implementing mobile strategies to reach customers, employees and partners in dramatically new ways and are finding greater opportunities to attract viewers and generate significant revenue at delivering interactive video.","We've been seeing this in virtually every industry we serve and in all key geographies where we operate. Same time, enterprises are facing many new challenges with their online initiatives.","Business leaders know that providing foresight or application performance can do real damage. Not properly securing an online application or data may lead to real losses, and failing to scale capabilities to meet rising demand can disappoint existing customers and new prospects alike. That's where Akamai comes in.","Our expanding and unique portfolio of solutions is designed to help our customers overcome these challenges and deliver a consistent, protected and dynamic experience for users across virtually every device, geography and application.","Turning to security. This is one area where we can address these real business problems. Of this quarter, we had 74 new security signings. Now providing our security solutions over 250 Akamai customers, and over 20% have already purchased more than 1 security product to defend their web properties.","The new Kona Site Defender provides a robust, sophisticated layer of web security from Akamai's global cloud to defend against a range of security threats, and we do it without sacrificing performance of a client's site or application. In February, we've already signed up more than 40 customers for this new service. Beyond security, while CIOs understand how adopting cloud computing can cut costs and improve flexibility and agility, we're also worried about the very real possibility of decreased performance and application availability in hybrid environments.","Akamai is addressing these concerns with solutions designed to improve the way enterprises are both delivering and consuming cloud services. We recently introduced Akamai Terra Cloud Catalyst for cloud service providers who are interested in offering their customers an optimized experience. This technology makes it easy for Infrastructure-as-a-Service, Platform-as-a-Service and hosting providers to add the power of the Akamai Intelligent Platform to their offerings.","Customers of leading providers such as Rackspace, HP and others are already experiencing the benefit of Akamai's performance improvements embedded in the solutions they are consuming every day.","For individual businesses and SaaS providers delivering applications over the public Internet, we recently launched Akamai's Terra Alta service. Customers of this solution now have a simple way to integrate Akamai technology into their existing IT operations, resulting in measurable improvements in the way their users experience online applications around the world.","Since its introduction in late March, Terra Alta has also been well-received.","And turning to mobility, all of our customers face user demands to deliver content and applications to an ever-increasing variety of mobile devices. Just having a mobile site or application isn't enough. Users want the same experience they get from their fixed line connection. They expect high performance and will quickly abandon a mobile site if their expectations aren't met.","But we have a multi-pronged strategy to help our customers deal with a particular demand of mobile users and applications. We introduced Aqua Mobile Accelerator last quarter to help customers overcome specific issues they encounter from latency and packet loss over cellular networks. And we're encouraged by early interest in this new offer.","We also worked with Ericsson last quarter to introduce their Smart Cloud Accelerator solution, which embeds Akamai technology in Ericsson's SSR 8000 family routing gateways. Just last month, we announced that we'll be working with Qualcomm to optimize delivery to mobile devices that are built on the Snapdragon chipset.","We think there are even more opportunities to help our customers with mobile applications and content and we expect to continue to introduce new capabilities in this important arena.","And for video, we've been able to find even more effective and efficient ways to support the delivery of dramatically increasing volumes on wired and wireless networks. A great example of this phenomenon is the 2012 London Olympic Games kicking off this week. I predict the games will attract at least 1 billion online viewers. Once again, Akamai is supporting many of the world's major broadcasters as they prepare to stream an unprecedented amount of video from London.","Across the board, from cloud computing to media and from mobility to online security, this is a very exciting time for our business. And I couldn't be more pleased with how Akamai is performing now and I'm very excited about our future plans.","Thank you, again, for joining us today. Jim and I would now like to take your questions. Operator, the first question from the queue, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The first question is coming from the line of David Hilal from FBR.","David M. Hilal - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I got two. First, Paul, you talked quite a bit about the security offering and the increased traction there, which is great to see. I specifically wanted to dive into the Riverbed and QUALCOMM partnerships. And I don't know if there's any qualitative or quantitative you can share with us there on how those 2 are going?","Paul L. Sagan","What's the second question? We'll just take them both.","David M. Hilal - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","The second question is for Jim. So on margins, you guys put together a good quarter in margins, and that guide for Q3 looks pretty good too. I'm specifically talking about the EBITDA of 43%. And so after a couple of years of margins eroding, do you feel like now you're getting more efficiencies out of the infrastructure, where we should view margins as flat or possibly up? I guess, really what I'm asking, what is kind of your margin outlook, not just for the next quarter, but over the next year or 2? Do you think we stabilize, go higher, go lower?","Paul L. Sagan","All right. I might just take them both in reverse order, okay? So I think what you're seeing on margins is tremendous work by our software teams and our network teams to find unique and proprietary ways in our network and our software to drive significantly higher throughput, greater efficiency with the same great performance our customers expect. And that we're seeing earlier dividends than we expected, which is why we overachieved so well on margin. We think there's more to come as we develop it. We're not going to give you long-term guidance. You know we don't do that quarter-by-quarter. We've given you expectation for CapEx for the year and for margin in the near term. So let me just say, we're very pleased with what we're seeing out of the efforts and the renewed focus that we brought to COGS. And I think that there's more to gain there over time. At the same time, we're going to invest in innovation, so we're going to balance the 2 very well but maintain a very profitable business. On the other -- partnerships, the Riverbed partnership we announced about a year ago. About a quarter ago, we said we were now selling. We're starting to close deals, so I'm very pleased with the early signings. It is an enterprise solution sale, so that's usually not a transaction to close, but we're pleased with what we're seeing, and we're actually signing now full contracts with customers for that new solution. So we're pleased with the early in-market results. And the Qualcomm announcement was very recent, and that's a technology partnership to try to work collaboratively with one of the leading technology providers in the cellular space to effectively embed some of our technology in their chips. As those gain traction in the marketplace, it will allow us to bring to our customers even better performance for content and applications on devices that use those chipsets. We think that's very exciting. As I said, mobility requires a multi-pronged strategy. There isn't a single magic bullet. What you see is the breadth of our technology capabilities, the breadth of our customer relationships allowing us to partner at many places in the ecosystem, even ultimately down to the chip in the devices themselves to bring really unique solution to improving performance, which benefits everybody, benefits the end users, benefits the handset manufacturers. It benefits the network, which is really important because they're trying to figure out how to drive more capacity in a very expensive environment. And it benefits our customers, who are looking for the highest-performing way to reach their customers. So we think working with that broad ecosystem is going to be key to our leadership position in that aspect of web performance.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Mark Kelleher, Dougherty & Company.","Mark Kelleher - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division","I wanted to just go back to gross margins a little bit. You did talk about the operating benefits you've been getting. Maybe you could address the pricing dynamics that you saw in the quarter? What was that doing to gross margins, both on the CDN and the cloud side, and maybe tie that into what you're seeing in competition?","Paul L. Sagan","The market has always been competitive. We've always talked about the need to drive high-value solutions that our customers will pay for. We're continuing to see the same kind of competitive dynamic that we've traditionally seen and the same pricing dynamic. I think what you're seeing is effectiveness of the team to innovate and bring new high-value solutions that our customers are willing to pay for across cloud, infrastructure solutions, particularly now security, as well as media, which is really reflected by the accelerating traffic that we've been seeing there, which is our customers bringing more content to market and relying more on Akamai to deliver. So I'd say the general atmosphere is consistent with what we've seen, and I think the overachievement on the top and the bottom line has been really, really good execution by the teams here, working with our customers to deliver products and our network partners to drive capacity up and cost down in large part through huge innovation in our own software.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Turits, Raymond James.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just really strong acceleration on the cloud side. Is there anything that you can tell us about what in particular was stronger in terms of products on the cloud side, what drove that reacceleration versus last quarter? And then also, you had a full quarter of Cotendo. If you can give us any feel for how much contribution that made and how much that might've been cloud versus content?","Paul L. Sagan","Well, most of Cotendo is on the cloud side. We said that once that was integrated, we wouldn't be breaking it out, and they've been integrated and that process has gone very, very well. What you're seeing is across the board, the products that I talked about. Security is the newest area we've been in, but the Terra products, both, that we sell direct to our customers improved application, performance; and to the service providers that allows them to provide Akamai optimization to their customers, particularly now with the Cloud Catalyst product that allows people to add our capability seamlessly through other people's portals and other people's selling motions, allowing us to grow there. So I think you see a combination of innovation of new products like security catching on, as well as really good infield motion of direct selling and improved channel management or partnering capabilities to drive strong results there as well. And the Cotendo team contributed with a good customer base, good functionality and we're continuing to add there on the development side to build, we think, a strong pipeline of products to come in the coming couple of years.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And just one other question in a completely different direction. A couple of years ago, about 1.5 years ago now, you had that synchronization of a bunch of media contracts coming up for renewal all at once it -- has that -- have those cycles smoothed out now or could you...","Paul L. Sagan","Yes, Michael, I think we've answered that one every quarter. Yes, that was a onetime. They recycled themselves on different rate and pace, and that effect was 1.5 years ago now.","Operator","Next question is from Sterling Auty, JPMorgan.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Since 2008, it looks like if you're successful in the next quarter, this would be the second time that you've kind of made that trip to 20% revenue growth. My question is do you feel like there's enough drivers now to make this higher growth rate more sustainable? And what visibility do you have in that sustainability?","Paul L. Sagan","Well, I think there was a global meltdown in the middle, and that one was out of our hands. I don't mean to be flip, but there are externalities that are way beyond our ability or anyone's ability to fully predict or plan. We've been very pleased with what we've seen over the last year. We gave you guidance for the quarter and then for the year on CapEx. We're not going to go beyond that. I will say that I think that the forward trends are continuing in providing us opportunity around cloud, around mobility, around video and security. Those continue, and frankly, even in the soft spots around the world like Europe, we're still seeing strong demand for those kinds of services there that we're not immune from the global recession. Somebody said, \"Congratulations, you're immune.\" No, maybe we would do better if the economy was thriving, but we have products that are value to people who are continuing to move their businesses online even in tough economic times, and we think that they're catalyst for a strong growth for us, but I'm not going to give you a long-term growth projection.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Maybe one follow-up would be -- you're talking about cloud was growing 22%, but just -- I want to make sure we're clear and we're on the same page. Are you saying -- is cloud incorporate all of what we used to call VAS or can you give us some commentary or quantitative figures in terms of...","Paul L. Sagan","I'll give that to Jim.","James Benson","Yes, what we call cloud infrastructure solutions, we previously called value-added solutions. And as Paul said, they did grow 22%. Michael had asked the question around the impact of Cotendo. What we -- we're still not going to break Cotendo out separately because we've embedded it in the rest of Akamai. But we did share last quarter that Cotendo was a little less than $2 million a month, just as a frame of reference. But if you adjust for Cotendo and for constant currency, we grew cloud solutions 22%, regardless. So it was a very strong cloud solutions quarter.","Operator","Your next question is from Jen Swanson Lowe, Morgan Stanley.","Jennifer A. Swanson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I just want to follow up a little bit on Cotendo and also on the Blaze acquisition, which are both important acquisitions. And I know people have asked about the financial impact, but just curious more on the business impact. How has that integration been going? Where do you think you are in the process? And what are sort of the benefits maybe that you're starting to see from those 2 acquisitions?","Paul L. Sagan","Sure. Well, Cotendo brought revenue and customers, and we've done well so far, integrating customers across our network to our suite. There's still a process to go. We said that beginning to end, that could -- that would take about 18 months, so we're clearly not through it. But we've made good progress and we're on or ahead of planning the same with integrating personnel and starting to move people off of integration as much to new things. Very encouraged by what we're seeing out of the capabilities at the development center in Israel and we have ambitious plans to ramp up hiring there. There's great engineering capability, including on the security side. And as we do more in cloud security, we'll be looking for more -- to build out more expertise in that office and other places. And then we will be announcing or just subtly moving functionality from Cotendo into some of our cloud infrastructure. Our product Blaze, for those people who maybe didn't follow us closely, was an FEO or front-end optimization technology. Again, a great engineering team integrated it to Akamai. They didn't bring revenue and a large customer base. They've brought a really important functionality to further improve the performance of websites. We've not made any product announcements with that technology, but we're really pleased with that now that it's under our roof. And over the next few quarters, we will be making product announcements in that area that we think are significant as well.","Jennifer A. Swanson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then just as a second question, not necessarily related but following up on Sterling's question earlier around the sustainability of some of the trends you're currently seeing in your business. I think 3 quarters ago, when you started to see this inflection in traffic growth, you were reluctant to label it as a new sustainable trend and kind of cautioned that, that can be cyclical. Now it's my impression as the tone seems a little more confident around the duration and stability of that increase in traffic. Are you -- is it -- do you have more confidence there that that's a sustainable trend versus cyclicality in the traffic business? And what are sort of the things that you're looking for to make that determination?","Paul L. Sagan","Well, historically, the cycle go on for a little while. They're not 1 or 2 quarters, especially if you can hold constant for sort of economic turmoil. We've been really pleased with what we see. We have some visibility in it from our customers. We think the drive to more media, video, particularly online, because of the ability to drive high-quality, both the fixed line and wireless environment is important and with high quality and high security. So we believe it will continue to grow. We've been pleased with what we've seen for the last few quarters, but it remains the hardest piece to predict. Long term, we think the long-term trend is going to be more video over-the-top. Again, the majority of TV viewing in the home is old-fashioned TV, so there's lots of opportunities to grow the delivery of video, particularly high-quality video. So I think you've seen us be increasingly optimistic about it just because we've got more data points on a steeper curve. But I don't think that's a space that will ever give you really long-term specifics on because it is a little cyclical. But right now we're certainly in a good part of that curve.","Operator","Next question is from Ed Maguire, CLSA.","Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could just comment on -- going back to the Cotendo acquisition. Just discuss, you had a number of different partnerships, how the rationalization of the products and partners is working? And also, to follow up on that, you'd mentioned that the Riverbed partnership is tracking well and Ericsson is expanding your mobile footprint into -- along into Qualcomm partnership. How -- could you discuss how that go-to-market is tracking as well? That's 2 questions in 1.","Paul L. Sagan","Sure, Ed. So as I said earlier, very pleased with the integration of Cotendo, including how we're working the product into our portfolio and maintaining the existing customer base they brought over and then selling new things to those customers as well. I'm very pleased so far with the tracking of migration of partnerships and resellers throughout the world. That's gone very well. The others, obviously, some of them are technology partnerships like the one we announced recently with Qualcomm and technology plus go-to-market with Riverbed. I think what you're seeing is an overall theme. Akamai sits in the cloud. In many ways, we were the original and largest. And so as the world moves to cloud computing, hybrid environments and providers look to join that ecosystem and grow, we're just a logical partner because we are so complementary. We're complementary with hosting providers who want to now provide a cloud model. We're compatible with people who are trying to make mobile work better as part of the overall solution for people who want to bring sites or applications online. And so we've invested in being a better partner back, how do we embed some of our technologies, something that 5 years ago, we didn't do, embedding Akamai technology in other people's products. And we also didn't embed their technology in our products, and these partnerships are examples of both, more of the technology in one place talking to our network or vice versa. And we think that over time, this will also raise the value of our services and drive new revenue opportunity. Some will be more immediate in terms of the joint product like Riverbed opportunity. Other will simply enhance the value of our products and theirs, like what we're trying to do. With Qualcomm and in the case of Ericsson, you have some of both. Now in the wireless space, particularly when you're talking about carriers, getting those embedded and rolled out takes a while. It's not exactly a set of operators who necessarily move quickly, which is why we've taken a long-term view. But we're making a long-term bet that mobility will be increasingly important and that our customers will look to us to help them as part of an overall solution. If we do that well, they'll want to do more with Akamai. If we don't, we won't be as valuable, and that's why you see us doing these kinds of things, and if you will, kind of spreading our reach and our ability to work with more and new kinds of entities in the ecosystem of the Internet.","Operator","Next question is coming from Colby Synesael from Cowen and Company.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Great, I have 2 questions. Paul, I think in recent conference, you've mentioned that in the future, Akamai could actually be a security company that sells CDN services. Obviously, security, it sounds like it's pretty important to the company's long-term future. Was there -- curious if you could try to quantify for us how big security is at this point and maybe kind of expand on what you meant when you made those comments? And then the second question that I have has to do with your headcount ramp. You guys added about 115 employees. It seems like a decent amount. I know you added more last quarter, but I think part of that was for Cotendo. Curious where those employees have been deployed in the company and maybe more specifically, how you're changing some of your go-to-market strategy as it relates to the sales team?","Paul L. Sagan","Sure. I think my comment, and I think you quoted me about, correctly, was really about how big the opportunity is for security in the cloud. And my general point was that if we really executed well with security -- cloud security offers like Kona Site Defender, years down on the road, people might actually think about us as a cloud security company who also did delivery and performance because the opportunity is that big. I didn't mean to imply that we were going to be the whole market or that cloud security would replace traditional security in-depth layers. I think with the rising threat level, that's not going to happen, but I do think this sort of -- if you think of secure the device, secure the perimeter now, secure the cloud as the emerging area, we have the opportunity and are now taking an early leadership position and secure the cloud, secure outside the perimeter because effectively, your firewall is becoming so virtual anyway in a hybrid environment. And so we're pushing hard. You see us talking about the opportunity, very strong sale. It's still a relatively small part of our cloud infrastructure business today, which gives us lots of room to grow, lots of room to penetrate existing customers and then to go, frankly, we can now sell the solutions to people who aren't Akamai customers and they don't even have to buy any other Akamai services to get started if they want us to do some cloud security for them first. So we think it's a great way to add to existing accounts and to go get new ones. We're very excited about security. Long way to go before you start referring to us as a security company first, and I think we've got a lot to prove. But the early steps there, I think, have been well executed. I'm very pleased with what the team has done. I'll let Jim talk about the headcount ramp, and obviously, the things to remember in terms of summer hiring and acquisition and other things that go into the mix.","James Benson","Right, and -- so you're right, we added a little over 115 -- I think we added 115 people in the quarter. We added more than that in Q1, but remember, I think you were referencing it, that was also including the Cotendo and Blaze acquisitions, which were by themselves over 100 people anyway. So in the areas in particular that we're specifically targeting is we're going to continue to build out our go-to-market resources. That's what we did in Q2. We'll do more of it in Q3. The other area, in particular, that we're going to be focusing on adding resources is in the R&D area to continue to drive product innovation. And we talked about the -- I mentioned in the opening remarks that we announced 7 new products already in the first half of the year. We expect to announce more products in the second half of the year and beyond, and we're going to continue to add engineers to fuel that pipeline.","Operator","Next question is from Aaron Schwartz from Jefferies.","Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just a quick follow-up and one question for me. But you announced a sales management hire earlier this week. You announced one in Europe earlier this year. It does seem like with your diversification with new products and new verticals, there is some change in the overall go-to-market, which you just alluded to. Are there sort of structural changes in the operations below, any sort of detail you could give us on sort of how you're architecting this internally to take advantage of all the new product you have out?","Paul L. Sagan","Sure. We've moved to a theater model with the Americas, with EMEA and APAC and we've appointed 3 senior sales leaders, 1 person in Asia Pac who's already deployed there in a different role. Someone with great experience in enterprise solution selling, a former Akamai executive who has left and then was working for IBM who rejoined us. And then just this month, the appointment of a Head of America -- the Americas region for us as well. I think what you're just seeing is growth and sophistication of the go-to-market effort under a very, very strong leadership provided by Bob Hughes, who has the worldwide responsibility for sales. But also, services and marketing and really all of our forward-facing initiatives in the field. And so you see him building out a team with theater responsibility so that we can be in-market, in-language, fully responsive to what our customers need. Because in the world of the cloud, there's no down for maintenance, there is no hours you're closed. Day and night, 7 days a week, people are using our network to make their business run. And we have to be responsive where they are and so you are seeing us grow the capability of our team, driving more sophisticated management deeper into the field for greater responsiveness, and frankly, authority in the field and putting it in the hands of some really seasoned executives. And I think you're seeing in the accelerating growth and the tremendous results, particularly the cloud infrastructure services. So you're exactly right to pick up on it. It's deliberate and I think it's paying off extremely well, and those 3 leaders are very strong. Obviously 2 have been here for a while, 1's been here for about 1.5 weeks. Still trying to figure out Akamai acronyms, but we're very enthusiastic about their potential. You said you have one other question, I think, for Jim.","Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","No, that was actually it. I was just wondering on the sale side.","Operator","Next question is from Richard Fetyko, Janney Capital.","Richard Fetyko - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Just curious how you factored in Europe and what's going on in Europe into your guidance? What consideration did you give it?","Paul L. Sagan","So I'll take that. So we actually -- interestingly enough, we actually had a really good quarter in Q2 across all of our markets, as I mentioned. We actually had a good quarter in the European markets as well. Certainly, there's a little bit of caution in the -- kind of the southern countries of Europe, but we saw growth there. I think our value proposition, even in a difficult market, is still very compelling. So while we may not have the opportunity as plentiful in Southern Europe, we still believe, in general, the European market in total, the northern markets, the central European markets are going to grow very well for us. The Asia-Pac markets are going to grow well for us. So we believe that we have significant opportunities to grow, both in Europe and Asia-Pac, as Paul had outlined.","Operator","The next question is from Ben Rose, Battle Road Research.","Ben Z. Rose - Battle Road Research Ltd.","A question for Jim. Could you talk a little bit about the impact of co-location costs this quarter and perhaps where you think those costs will be going in the next quarter and beyond?","James Benson","I think Paul highlighted a little bit around -- just in particular, you were trying to provide a little overview in particular what we're doing to drive our network costs and network scale. And really, what that is, is that's allowing us to drive scale in our co-location costs. So we're doing things on the pricing front with co-location costs, so pricing in the sense of making sure that we're located in the right-priced co-location facilities, not necessarily the most expensive ones. And we continue to drive software efficiencies that allow us to get more throughput out of our servers, therefore, we don't need to add incremental co-location costs, nor do we need to add going forward as much incremental CapEx because we'll get more throughput out of the servers that we have. So in general, we're executing very well against that playbook and we think that that's going to continue going forward.","Operator","The next question is from Gray Powell, Wells Fargo.","Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just had a quick one. Really, in the last few days, it seems like there's been increased concern on enterprise spending trends, with even AT&T and Digital Realty making some cautionary comments. Obviously, you guys are a little bit different and doing much better, but can you just give us a sense as to what you're seeing from your enterprise customers over the last month or so? And the comfort level you have with visibility on the vertical?","Paul L. Sagan","So far, it's been very positive, and as we said, we were ahead of expectations in every vertical and every geo. We certainly see customers being cautious about spending. But they are pushing forward on most of their Internet initiatives. They see the future to save money in other areas is by going online and to drive future growth in online initiatives. And the most efficient place to be is in the cloud with an application online, reaching users with the data they need, whenever, wherever they want it. Frankly, if you don't do that, you're not competitive in virtually every industry in the world now. So even though there is caution and even though everyone is trying to spend less in aggregate, we see their willingness to spend on Internet initiatives particularly around security and performance. And so I guess, we could speculate that we'd do even better if the economy globally was in great shape. But with it in bad shape, and that's not a good thing, that's just the fact, we're continuing to do extremely well and beat our own projections so far. So we've been very pleased.","Operator","Your next question is from Rob Sanderson, ABR Investment Strategy.","Rob Sanderson - ABR Investment Strategy LLC","Questions related to products. Just -- I mean, can I throw back one of your answers to an earlier question and see if it's a fair characterization? So really, the acceleration in cloud infrastructure driven by all of the above, but it kind of sounds like -- obviously, Kona Site Defender is doing very well and Terra Alta is driving some momentum. Maybe the mobile accelerator Cloud Catalyst and cloud steelhead are still on the com with a good start. Is that a good way to think about it?","Paul L. Sagan","I didn't track everything you put in there. Obviously, things like Riverbed are new. Mobile is fairly new, but we're selling that direct and we've had very strong uptake. It's only been out for a few months. We're not going to break out numbers on every one. We give you the aggregate number, then we're giving you some highlights, where we think we\u2019re seeing some important changes like security. But I think the overall theme -- rather than put your words back in my mouth, let me say what I think I was trying to say, which is we just think that there is a string of innovation you're starting to see that is targeted at the opportunity for growth in the cloud infrastructure space. We're going to continue to improve the products we've brought out and we've got a roadmap for more things to come across every product suite in the next year, 1.5 years, and we're going to push really hard to develop and bring those to market. We think there's more opportunity in all 4 areas of cloud, video, security and mobility. And if we can keep bringing out things that our customers need, short of another total economic meltdown, we're going to be able to find demand in the market for them.","Rob Sanderson - ABR Investment Strategy LLC","Could I follow up on Cotendo, just the cross-sell opportunity? I know you've got a number of customers there. Could you remind us how to think about the nonoverlapping customers they bring in? And obviously, you've got this great portfolio of products that I'm sure you're preparing to sell there.","Paul L. Sagan","Yes, most of our customers don't overlap. They -- we can't up-sell them until we move them to our network, that's an 18-month process overall. We are moving customers over, have been already for a while. It's going to take 18 months to complete. That has a bell curve, obviously, a few in the beginning and some stubborn ones at the very end, the bulk in the middle. And then we'll get to know them and offer them more things out of our portfolio. So I think that we can sort of think of it as not a full 18-month opportunity because at the end, you're just in the long tail. But a year or more of good opportunity to slowly introduce that customer set to new products, either make the first contact and move them over or on renewals and to sell them things like Kona as we go. And we'll mine that opportunity really probably for the next 1 to 2 years and then try to bring them even more things from our portfolio. But just understand, as soon as we move them over, we don't think of them as Cotendo customers. They're Akamai customers serviced by Akamai people. And we look at what are they taking today and what else could we offer them.","Operator","Your next question is from Jeff Van Rhee, Craig-Hallum.","Jeffrey Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Paul, 2 very brief questions for you. Number one, on the security front, can you talk to the percentage uplift on ARPU that you're seeing so we have a sense of magnitude from some of the more mature security users? And second, on the network efficiency, can you put a number roughly on what percent of the efficiency benefits we've seen so far?","Paul L. Sagan","On the first, we're not going to get into pricing in ARPU on individual products. But these are, particularly the new services, premium products for which we're getting significant revenue and they're good margin products. On the network, we've got a roadmap of changes to come over the next 18 months. They tend to come kind of they're lumpy as you develop new capabilities and then deploy it on the network, so it's not a smooth sort of week-over-week progress. They are sort of step function there, but we have a good roadmap of things that we're going to continue to drive efficiency. Frankly, I -- as we've been doing this on an ongoing basis for years, I couldn't -- I can't quite break it down as sort of a percentage complete as you phrased it. I understand what you're asking, I just don't know how to answer the question that way.","Operator","Your next question is coming from Donna Jaegers, D.A. Davidson.","Donna Jaegers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","On the manage CDN service that you guys were offering the carriers, is that launched in the market now and can you make any comments on it? And also on Verizon's move to their own CDN, does that have any impact on you guys at all? Are you helping them?","Paul L. Sagan","So I'll say on the last one, they are still a great reseller partner. I don't think it has any implications there, so no impact to date. I think on the other question, there are sort of 2 components. The MCDN or managed CDN. We've been doing that for a while to provide specific solutions to network operators. We continue to offer that. That's a bespoke opportunity and we think we'll see some growth there. The new area is really, the OCDN or Operator CDN where we can allow operators to deploy our technology, that we could provide a software, they can deploy it on their own hardware if they want to. They can manage it on their own for some functionality. They can then federate with us if they want global capabilities or let us operate even more advanced services. We're now in some trials with customers, very good conversations. But that is not -- we did not expect that to be a significant revenue producer. This year, we see that as a very important strategic long-term opportunity. We now have a team built out and a leader for that business group and I'm encouraged by their early progress, but that is a long-term initiative.","Operator","The final question is coming from the line of Chad Bartley, Pacific Crest.","Chad Bartley - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask on Cotendo, I know you're not going to talk revenue, and that's fine. But can you remind us which revenue segment, at least at this point, that, that is benefiting? Is it enterprise? Is it technology?","Paul L. Sagan","It's primarily -- well, there is -- it's in the cloud infrastructure services. It's site acceleration and some additional services that improve the performance of sites and applications. But most of that revenue has moved into the infrastructure services bucket that did not have a media or a video offer.","James Benson","And I think specifically, if you're asking which industry verticals that they operate within, it's pretty much across all of them. So as Paul said, it's kind of augments the capability that we had and they -- their customer base sells pretty much across all the verticals that we're in. Probably the light -- mostly in commerce, enterprise and high tech, probably to a little bit lesser extent, in the media vertical.","Paul L. Sagan","Thank you, all, for calling in. We look forward to talking to you again in another 3 months. Bye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."],"545":["Akamai Technologies, Inc.

And welcome to the second quarter 2018 Akamai Technologies, Incorporated earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Thank you very much and good afternoon and thank you for joining Akamai's second quarter 2018 earnings conference call.","Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Benson, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.","Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on July 31, 2018. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances.","As a reminder, we'll be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found in the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of akamai.com.","And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. Akamai delivered excellent results in the second quarter. Revenue was $663 million, up 9% over Q2 of last year, with continued very strong performance for our Security products and continued improvement in our Media and Carrier Division.","Q2 non-GAAP EPS was $0.83 per diluted share, up 34% year over year. This, very strong result, was driven by our solid revenue growth, the impact of the cost reductions that we made in the two prior quarters and a lower tax rate.","EBITDA margins in Q2 improved to 39% and non-GAAP operating margins improved to 26%. We expect further improvements in margins by the end of the year as we realize the benefits of projects underway to improve our operational efficiency. And we're continuing our work to find a path to achieve non-GAAP operating margins of 30% in 2020, while maintaining investment in the development of new products intended to fuel our future growth.","Our Security portfolio was, again, the fastest-growing part of our business with Q2 revenue of $155 million, up 33% over Q2 of last year. We've been very pleased with the performance of our Security business, which has received accolades from several leading analyst firms over the last few months. In April, Frost & Sullivan recognized Akamai for market leadership in bot risk management and in May they recognized us for market leadership in holistic web protection.","In June, Forrester ranked Akamai highest among all competitors in web application firewalls and we were the only company to receive Forrester's top score possible for zero-day attack capabilities. Also in June, IDC issued a new vendor profile of our Security capabilities that said Akamai has had the strongest and broadest Edge security offering for quite some time. And all this comes on top of Gartner's recognition last year of Akamai as a leader in its Magic Quadrant for Web Application Firewalls.","Our Security products were an important contributor to the revenue in our Web Division in Q2. Overall, Web Division customers generated $351 million in revenue in the second quarter, up 11% over Q2 of last year. This is a little lower than what we'd like to see from the Web Division. And as we talked about during our Analyst Day last month, we've taken several steps to drive a stronger growth rate going forward. Most notably, we've added new leadership in Global Web Sales, increased our inside sales and sales development functions to drive new customer acquisition, simplified our pricing and packaging bundles for multi-product sales, focused effort on accelerating customer adoption of our mobile solutions, and we're improving our ability to cross-sell our new products into the existing customer base.","We continue to see strong traction for our new products in Q2, including mPulse, Image Manager, Bot Manager, Enterprise Threat Protector and Enterprise Application Access. Revenue from our new products exited the quarter with an annualized run rate of about $170 million, more than tripled the run rate from Q2 of last year.","Revenue for our Media and Carrier Division in Q2 was $312 million, up 8% over Q2 of last year. This much-improved performance is a result of our successful integration of Nominum and the work that we've been doing to improve our traffic share in the top 250 global media accounts.","Traffic growth on the Akamai platform continued to accelerate in Q2 with especially-strong growth in our OTT and gaming sectors. Downloads of the new Fortnite game set a record for a single video game release with over 22 terabits per second of traffic delivered for a single customer at the peak. I think it's worth noting that this customer moved from one of the world's largest cloud platform providers to Akamai in the months leading up to the release. Not just because of our scale and global reach, although that's really important when you have a game of this size and an audience of this magnitude, but also because we achieved a five times reduction in error rates, which provided a much better experience for their end users.","We also set traffic records for streaming the World Cup. Akamai served 55 broadcasters from around the world during the tournament and there were several days when our total World Cup traffic exceeded 20 terabits per second.","To put this amount of traffic into context, 20 terabits per second is more than 10 times the aggregate border capacity of some major countries. On the other hand, it's not hard to imagine that the demand for online traffic someday could grow to a 1,000 times this amount. Delivering traffic at scale is very hard to do and it's something that the Akamai Edge platform is uniquely good at. That's because we place our servers in thousands of locations close to end users, well beyond the bottlenecks in the core of the Internet, where cloud data centers are typically located.","The competitive takeaway of the Fortnite traffic I mentioned earlier and the well-publicized failures of two of the world's largest cloud platforms during the World Cup provides strong proof points as to why we believe that Akamai's unique architecture is so important and also why we think it will become even more critical as traffic levels on the Internet increase.","In summary, I'm very pleased with our results in Q2. We continue to see very strong performance in our Security portfolio, improvement in our Media and Carrier Division, improvement in our margins and very strong growth on the bottom line.","Before turning the call over to Jim, I'd like to mention that Akamai has a significant milestone coming up in the next month. August 20 will be the 20th anniversary of our founding. It has certainly been an eventful 20 years, as we've grown from the early days as an MIT startup to become the world leader in content delivery, application performance, and cloud security. And I want to thank all our employees for their sustained track record of innovation and hard work and also our customers for their partnership and trust.","We've accomplished a lot together over the last 20 years, but I really do believe that the best is yet to come. In part, that's because I believe that Akamai's current business is very well positioned to benefit from major market tailwinds, as large volumes of media move online, the scale and sophistication of cyber attacks grow, and more applications move to mobile devices, where near-instant performance is the expectation.","I'm also excited by our progress in the development of an entirely new generation of services to support our customers' future needs in the areas of blockchain, the Internet of Things, and zero-trust security architectures. Predicting the future is never easy, but as I look forward to the next 20 years, I see very bright prospects for Akamai and our shareholders.","With that, I'll turn it over to Jim to review our financials and guidance for the rest of the year. Jim?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone.","As Tom outlined, Akamai delivered strong second quarter on revenue, margins, and earnings. Q2 revenue came in at the high end of our revised guidance range at $663 million, up 9% year over year or 8% in constant currency, and up 10% in constant currency if you exclude the six large Internet Platform Customers. Notably, this is the second straight quarter of double-digit revenue growth outside the Internet Platform giants.","Revenue was solid across most of the business, highlighted by continued robust growth in our Security Solutions from both of our divisions and another quarter of strong traffic and revenue growth acceleration in our Media and Carrier Division. Revenue from our Media and Carrier Division customers was $312 million in the second quarter, up 8% year over year or 7% in constant currency, and up a healthy 12% in constant currency excluding the large Internet Platform Customers.","Revenue from the Internet Platform Customers was $44 million in the second quarter, unchanged from Q1 levels. Q2 revenue outside these Internet giants was strong across all geographies and industry verticals, exceeding our projections for the quarter.","Traffic growth accelerated for the fourth straight quarter and was particularly robust from our video delivery and gaming customers. And as Tom mentioned, we also had several notable events in the quarter that contributed to the strong traffic and revenue growth, with soccer and cricket events seeing record-breaking online audiences.","Our Media and Carrier Division management team remains focused on capturing more traffic share and improving the quality of delivery for the top 250 media customers that account for most of our traffic and revenue.","Because of these efforts over the past year, traffic growth continues to accelerate and we have seen the associated revenue acceleration that we expected when we initiated these actions.","Moving now to our Web division, revenue for this set of customers was $351 million, up 11% year over year or 9% in constant currency. This growth rate came in a little bit below what we expect for this business due to some pricing compression within our delivery-based performance solutions.","We are confident in the Web division growth strategy we outlined at our Analyst Day, specifically focusing on expanding the portfolio through new product development and acquisition, selling additional solutions into the installed base, simplified pricing and packaging bundles for multi-product deployment, and implementing go-to-market enhancements that we believe will accelerate new customer acquisition.","And as Tom highlighted, we continued to see strong uptake in our new product areas in the first half of the year, namely Image Manager, Digital Performance Management, and Bot Manager, as well as strong growth in our core Kona and Prolexic cloud security solutions. We believe continued execution in all these areas will enable low double-digit revenue growth in this division.","Turning now to our results for our Cloud Security Solutions, second quarter revenue was $155 million, up 33% year over year or 31% in constant currency, and yet another quarter of tremendous revenue growth and customer adoption for our Cloud Security Solutions globally. We're particularly pleased with the recent uptick in Security Solutions purchased by our media customers.","Entering the third quarter, our Cloud Security business now has an annualized revenue run rate of roughly $640 million and represents nearly a quarter of our total revenues. We believe security continues to present a significant growth opportunity for us, and we plan to continue to invest in this area, with a focus on further enhancing our product portfolio and extending our go-to-market capabilities.","Moving on to our geographies, sales in our international markets represented 38% of total revenue in Q2, up 1 point from Q1 levels. International revenue was $250 million in the second quarter, up 21% year over year or 18% in constant currency, driven by continued strong growth in our Asia-Pacific region. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact on revenue of $5 million on a sequential basis and a positive impact on revenue of $8 million on a year-over-year basis. Revenue from our U.S. market was $413 million, up 3% year over year and up 6% excluding our large Internet Platform Customers.","Moving on to costs, cash gross margin was 77%, consistent with Q1 levels and up 1 point from the same period last year and in line with our guidance. We are pleased with our continued execution on our platform efficiency initiatives. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 64%, roughly consistent with Q1 levels and slightly below our guidance, as we introduced more capitalized software projects onto the platform throughout the quarter.","Non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $248 million, slightly below the low end of our guidance and down about $11 million from Q1 levels, due to continued traction with our operational efficiency efforts and the restructuring benefit from our first quarter reduction in force.","Moving now to profitability, adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $262 million, up $6 million from Q1 levels and up $40 million or 18% from the same period last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in as expected at 39%, a 1 point improvement over Q1 levels, primarily due to the strong revenue achievement and the additional operational efficiency gains I just mentioned.","Non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter was $170 million, up $3 million from Q1 levels and up $25 million or 17% from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 26%, up 1 point from Q1 levels and at the high end of our guidance range. I am very pleased with the margin expansion we have seen as a result of our ongoing efficiency efforts, and we believe our continued hard work can drive further operating margin improvements.","Capital expenditures in Q2, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $102 million and below the low end of our guidance for the quarter, primarily due to the timing of some planned network investments and facility projects that shifted into Q3.","Moving on to earnings, non-GAAP net income was $143 million or $0.83 of earnings per diluted share, coming in $0.02 above the high end of our guidance range, driven by slightly lower operating expenses and a lower tax rate. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $33 million based on a Q2 effective tax rate of 19%, which equates to a year-to-date effective tax rate of 19.5%. This tax rate is roughly 1 point lower than our guidance due to a higher mix of foreign earnings.","Moving on to our GAAP earnings, there was a large and noteworthy item excluded from our non-GAAP results but impacting our Q2 GAAP results that I'd like to provide some color on. We were proud to endow the Akamai Foundation with a onetime $50 million grant in the second quarter.","The associated $50 million charge is classified as an operating expense in the G&A line of our GAAP P&L. We believe this onetime endowment is important for several reasons, because it, one, solidifies our ongoing commitment to support STEM initiatives for underrepresented population in the technology industry today. Two, enables consistency in charitable giving from one year to the next, regardless of fluctuations in economic cycles or annual profits. And three, is reflective of our values and we believe initiatives like this have a very positive impact in employee recruiting and retention efforts. And lastly, it resonates with investors' corporate responsibility expectations.","Factoring in this onetime GAAP-only item, GAAP net income for the second quarter was $43 million, or $0.25 of earnings per diluted share.","Now, I'll review our use of capital. In May, we closed a $1.15 billion convertible debt offering concurrent with a $500 million revolving credit facility, further strengthening our balance sheet for additional strategic flexibility. We believe these cost-effective transactions will support our overall operating cash requirements, as well as previously-announced capital return initiatives, while at the same time maintain our ongoing strategic flexibility to be opportunistic with M&A.","We continue to focus on the importance of returning capital to our shareholders. During the quarter, we spent $166 million on share repurchases, buying back roughly 2.2 million shares. As I mentioned last quarter, we plan to spend our current share repurchase authorization of $750 million by the end of 2018.","Given our strong balance sheet and cash generation, beyond 2018, we intend to continue our share repurchase activity but at a lower spend level and with the objective to offset dilution from our equity compensation plans and, at times, to opportunistically repurchase more shares depending upon business and market conditions. As always, our overall aim is to deploy our capital to achieve favorable returns for our investors in a manner that we believe is in the long-term interest of the company and our shareholders.","In summary, our Q2 top and bottom-line results met or exceeded the high-end of our guidance. We continue to see a robust pipeline of innovation across the company and we believe we are making good progress on our operational efficiency and margin expansion efforts.","Looking ahead to Q3, we are expecting another solid quarter on the top and bottom lines. As we outlined at our Analyst Day in June, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the last several months continues to negatively impact our revenues. In fact, these foreign exchange headwinds have worsened by couple-million-dollars just since that event. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact on Q3 revenue of over $6 million compared to Q2 levels and a $5 million impact year-on-year.","Taking into account these foreign exchange headwinds, combined with typical summer traffic seasonality, which has historically resulted in sequential declines in our Media business, we are projecting Q3 revenue in the range of $656 million to $668 million.","At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of roughly 78% and GAAP gross margins of 65%, both up from Q2 levels. Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $249 million to $254 million, up modestly from Q2 levels and reflecting the seasonality of our annual merit increases. Factoring in the cash gross margin and operating expense expectations I just provided, we anticipate Q3 EBITDA margins of 39% to 40%, consistent to slightly up from Q2 levels.","Moving now to depreciation, we expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $93 million to $96 million. Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margins of 25% to 26% for Q3, roughly consistent with Q2 levels.","And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q3 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.80 to $0.86. This EPS guidance assumes an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of roughly 20%. This guidance also reflects a fully-diluted share count of 169 million shares.","On CapEx, we expect to spend $115 million to $125 million, excluding equity compensation in the quarter. This is an uptick from Q2 levels, primarily due to facility build-outs in Bangalore, Costa Rica and the early phases of our new Cambridge headquarter building. We expect increased facility-related spend for our new Cambridge headquarters to continue into Q4 and 2019.","Looking to the full year, we are anticipating revenue of $2.68 billion to $2.705 billion, up $5 million from the low-end of the range, EBITDA non-GAAP operating margins of 39% to 40%, and 25% to 26%, respectively. And factoring in these revenue and margin levels in a non-GAAP effective tax rate of roughly 20%, we anticipate non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.26 to $3.38 for full year 2018. And at the midpoint, this is an increase of $0.07 from our prior guidance.","As a helpful reference, we will post our Q3 and full year 2018 guidance ranges on the Investor Relations section of our website after this call.","In closing, we are very optimistic about the opportunities ahead for Akamai. We are confident in our ability to continue innovating to drive further revenue growth, while at the same time driving margin and earnings expansion for 2018 and beyond, which we believe will add significant shareholder value over both the near-term and long-term.","Thank you. And Tom and I would like to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Brad Zelnick of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Brad Alan Zelnick - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. I wanted to ask specifically on the Media Division relating back to the pricing actions and contract restructuring in Media from a year ago concentrating more on the top 250. Where are we in terms of the benefit? How much longer should we expect that that lasts? And how much of the traffic this quarter would you describe as being more event-related versus predictable and ongoing?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Good question, Brad. So, as we talked about, for the last several quarters, we really initiated a much more aggressive posture around going after traffic share, and that began in late Q2 of last year. And as you can imagine, some of that meant opening up contracts earlier, some of it meant that we applied some more creative pricing for contracts that were coming up for renewal. But I would say, largely speaking, that we'd anniversaried a lot of that and so you're going to have renewals every quarter, but most of the actions that we were going to take we've already taken over the last year. So, I think what you're in for now is a continued focus on us maintaining traffic share and, obviously, there's new customers to be had and where we can grab more traffic share from customers, we're certainly doing that. But I would say the bulk of those actions are completed and now we're back into business as usual, which is basically ongoing renewals that happen every quarter.","Brad Alan Zelnick - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks. That's helpful. And I just had one more follow-up on the Web Division, where you've spoken about several initiatives to help drive growth into double-digits going forward. And some of them seems like go-to market and go-to-market leadership, some of them seemed around pricing and packaging. Can you maybe just expound a bit more on pricing and packaging and innovation? What specifically is there to be done and how do you think that that's going to play out?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. Let me offer some comments and then if Tom has anything else he can offer. Obviously, what we have been doing and we shared this at the Analyst Day, company's done a fantastic job of introducing new products and developing new products. And so we've already been doing a fair amount of that. We talked about the new products that we've introduced in the last 18 months, actually have generating an annualized revenue run rate now of almost $170 million, so there's been a lot of work on, call it, the development side.","And you're right, there's certainly been work on the go-to-market side, because if you got to develop products, you have to sell them. The sales force has done a very good job of selling these products into the installed base. We have more work to do there but I'd say good early signs.","And the comments around pricing and packaging are less about we're going to do something like on the Media business, where we effectively went in and we creatively priced to grab more traffic share. The Web Division is not about traffic share. The Web Division is about bookings.","What we mean by that is packaging offerings that we can bundle some our solutions around Security and Performance and other areas in a much simpler way for customers to consume, so they can buy multiple products from Akamai as opposed to buying individual products \u00e0 la carte, bundling products to make it easier for customers to buy more of our portfolio so there's more creative things that we're doing there which makes \u2013 they're really more packaging and promotional-related activities, really to introduce the customer to more of what Akamai has to offer.","And, Tom, I don't know if there's anything else you'd add.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","No, I think you characterized it well, and our ability to package together the world's leading Security capabilities with the world's leading Performance is very powerful, and that helps us retain and grow the Web customer base.","It's the person who owns the website needs it to be secured, needs it to be fast. And if they can go to one vendor and get the best of both, that's just an incredibly powerful combination.","Brad Alan Zelnick - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks very much for the color.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Turits of Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good evening. First of all, I'd like to congratulate Akamai and, of course, Tom and the founders on that 20-year anniversary. I hate to admit how many of those years I've actually been following the company, but it's a big number. Anyway, congratulations.","Two questions. One, maybe you could parse for us the drivers of the traffic acceleration in the quarter. How much of it do you think was wallet share versus organic customer growth in traffic? And where do you think that \u2013 do those trends continue or do those both flatten out at this point?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. I think it's both. We are, I believe, increasing traffic share and you can see that from the rate of traffic growth, which has accelerated now for four straight quarters, well beyond any published estimates of Internet traffic growth, and that means that we're gaining share. And we see that at times when there's big events when companies turn to Akamai, of course, to do that and in the cases when they don't, there can be failures and other things happen, poorer quality, which helps Akamai gain share.","At the same time, there is more viewing online. When you look at the aggregate traffic levels for events like the World Cup, far more viewing online than four years ago. You look at the big gaming downloads, like Fortnite, much larger traffic levels than you would see for gaming downloads even a year ago. So, it's a combination of both. The tide is rising as a whole and there's the potential for a lot more of that as we've talked about and I think we're gaining share at the same time.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","So, it sounded, Jim, like you were saying that you were going to focus on maintaining share. So, of that component of acceleration that had to do with more share gains, should we be less focused on that at this point?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. Obviously, as you can imagine, for customers that multi-source, we're always looking to maximize our share. So where there's a chance to maximize more share, we're certainly going to do that. So we're not content maintaining share with a customer that is splitting their traffic. We've made a fair bit of headway on that, and we'll continue to work on that with customers. I don't want you to think that it's job over, that maintaining share is what we're looking for. We're always driving to maximize as much share.","What I was trying to imply is that, the work that we began late last Q2, we've largely gone through most of those customers and we've made great traction, and that traction actually is now manifesting itself in the performance that you're seeing that the revenue growth outside of the Internet Platform Customers grew 12% in the Media and Carrier Division. This is really a function of what we said was going to happen when we embarked on these efforts, and so we executed well and we're actually seeing the benefit of that now in revenue acceleration.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Tom. Thanks, Jim.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. I think in your remarks you noted that you continue to be interested in potentially bolting on via M&A to the Security business, both from a technology and a go-to-market perspective. I was just wondering if you could add some more color around what you're thinking potentially from a go-to-market, obviously, not companies but what exactly it is you're looking for. My understanding is those types of companies are relatively expensive. Should we be preparing for a transaction that could ultimately end up being dilutive to the company in the near term?","And then secondly, as it relates to the Web division, you mentioned a lot of different initiatives you're doing to improve the trajectory of revenue growth. When do you think we'll start to see that show up in the numbers? Thanks.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","So in terms of M&A and Security, that's an area where we're always looking for acquisitions. We've done several over the last few years. You are correct that often companies that we would look at have pretty wild valuations sometimes and you're not going to see us do anything foolish. So when we make acquisitions, we're very disciplined, and we've been really happy with the acquisitions we've done, particularly in the Security space.","Now in terms of boosting our go-to-market presence, I think that's of more interest on the Enterprise Security side, and it's a factor that we think about when we look at potential acquisitions. That said, we're getting very good traction now with our Enterprise Security sales. Q2 was very strong there and growing. So it's not something that it's a have-to-do, but if we can find an acquisition that makes sense financially, can add product capabilities for our customers, having an improved go-to-market presence is just a plus there.","And, Jim, do you want to take the second question?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Colby, I think obviously the Web division is a bookings-driven business, as we talked about at the Analyst Day. And so it's a business that is going to take a while to move up or down, to be frank. We're just a tick below the double digits that is our objective for this division. So it's very possible you're back to double-digit growth in Q3, to be very frank. I think we're going to be in that range of high single digits to low double digits here in the near term.","I think all the efforts that we outlined between adding more products, penetrating more of these products into our installed base, better packaging and pricing, enterprise license agreements, and one thing we didn't really comment on specifically, at least in the Q&A, is really making a concerted effort to do more in new customer acquisition. We've done a very good job as a company of selling more into our installed base. We have work to do around new customer acquisition, and we saw some early progress on that in Q2. And certainly, our new Web Sales leader, Scott Lovett, this is a big priority for him to get the new customer acquisition engine moving. And I think all those areas are going to really be the catalyst that drives the company to maintain double-digit growth in the division.","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. You talked about in the Web Division seeing some pricing compression and then all the offsets you had against that. Could you spend a little bit of time on that pricing compression? What are the drivers of that? Is that cyclical, structural, competitive, and the likelihood of that pricing compression staying there for the foreseeable future? Thanks a lot.","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","It's a good question. I think we talked about the \u2013 in the Web Performance product area before that certainly when offerings come up for renewal, customers always expect the price of technology to go down, and it's varied based on customers that push a lot of traffic versus customers that don't. It varies based on customers that see a lot of value in the performance sensitivity of their traffic. And so it's not new.","I would say what's heightened is there are certain industry verticals. A notable industry vertical where pricing pressure is pronounced is in commerce or retail. As you can imagine, that's an industry phenomenon that there are some large disruptive players in the retail space, and many of our customers are competing with them. And when they're looking at their P&L, they're looking at areas that they can go reduce costs. And so we've not seen really any increase in churn.","As a matter of fact, churn is actually at a low for the company. So we're not losing customers at all. It's just in the Web Performance space there are certain verticals, with retail\/commerce being a big one, that customers are very, very price sensitive because their business models depend upon being competitive against some of these large players.","And so I don't expect that to abate, to be frank. I think we're going to continue to see that. I think the strategy that we've been embarking on is the right strategy, which is new product penetration, broadening your products, and then penetrating your products into the installed base and actually getting more traction on new customers. So that's really the recipe for improving performance. I don't think you're going to see the Web Performance area, though, abate as far as the pricing competitiveness.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, thank you, Jim. And congratulations, Tom. That's a hell of an accomplishment; 20 years. Thank you.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great, thank you. I just wanted to follow up on Mark's question a little bit in regards to the pricing pressure that you mentioned in the Performance Solutions Group. I was just wondering. How do we think about the level of price declines you saw in the quarter versus, say, the average over the last three to four quarters? And how do we think of the headwind going forward and how do we think about the headwind to revenue in the second half 2018 and looking beyond in 2019? Thank you.","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","To follow on to what Mark said, I would say that you've probably seen an uptick a bit here over the last, call it, six to nine months. But as I said before, the Web Performance products, we've always had that depending upon the nature of the customer. And so you can view it as it's already in our run rate, so the fact that we grew about 9.5% in constant currency in Q2, I don't expect it to worsen in the sense that I think it's already embedded in the run rate. I think the work we have ahead is to continue to make traction in the areas that I outlined. Those traction in the areas outlined, we've already made traction in those areas...","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay.","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","...are really going to be what is the catalyst to get us to maintain double-digit growth.","Is Web Performance going to get worse? I don't think it's going to get worse. I think we're seeing pricing sensitivity with particular verticals. I think that that will remain, and I think the areas that we're doing \u2013 and I think some of the pricing and packaging is a good way to offset that, where you can sell your Web Performance product, you can sell Digital Performance Management, you can sell Image Manager, you can sell Security, a lot of the things that Tom talked about that actually make you much stickier with customers and actually allow you to maintain more value with those customers, the entire \u2013 all the solutions that's you're selling them.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay, so you don't see it spreading beyond the retail customers, is that what you're saying? Or are you saying the level of pricing for everybody as the pricing pressure has gone up a little bit across-the-board?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","No. As I said, it's more pronounced in certain verticals and I specifically commented on the retail vertical because I think it's a notable vertical where we're seeing it. But I think, in general, the price of technology comes down, customers expect better value for the offerings that they get and so what we're doing is we are accommodating that but, at the same time, we are leveraging, selling them more products, and so we're able to retain more value with the customer and actually have more products when the sales cycle is completed.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks, good afternoon. My question, Tom, is on the U.S. business. It's been underperforming low-single-digit. The overseas business is outperforming. What are your thoughts on what might be the catalyst or fundamental drivers for reaccelerating growth in the U.S. business? Thanks.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Well, of course, the U.S. business includes the giant platform, cloud platform companies, which helps depress the growth rate there. And we made a lot of investments overseas and particularly in APJ, have a lot of success, overseas revenue growing at a very good clip. There's a lot of people and major businesses there, a lot of potential to grow further. And, Jim, would you like to add anything to that?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","No, I don't think so. I do think that what you outlined is right, that we made a lot of investments. We're getting traction in the overseas market. I think the U.S. market grew kind of outside the Internet giants, I think we said it grew in kind of the mid-single-digits. I think we can do better than that, Vijay, to be frank. And I think that, obviously, there's some work to be done there. As Tom said, the overall growth is impacted by the giants but some of the area that we've seen slowing in the Web Division has come from our kind of U.S. market, and there's a lot of work to try to improve on the growth rate in the U.S.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. A quick follow-on, Jim, in terms of OpEx efficiencies. Anything we could expect on that front through year-end, like any consultant activities, cost-cutting initiatives? Thanks.","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, it's ongoing, right? So there's work that we've been doing. We did a restructuring in Q4 and another restructuring in Q1. We've seen the benefit of that. We saw it over the last couple of quarters.","There's a bunch of areas we're going to drive further efficiency. I think I said in the last call that this is a company that we're not in any level of distress, we want to make sure that our operational efficiency actions are very measured and that we're doing things that allow us to better scale costs going forward. This isn't just reducing cost. This is about being able to scale cost as the business grows.","And so, there's a bunch of areas that we've done that with. We outlined some of them as areas around facilities that we've closed, there's some third-party spend reduction initiatives. We have had a consultant in to help us identify areas, so that work is underway. We're kind of at the first phase of that effort and now we're in the next phase, which is trying to go operationalize these actions. Operationalizing these actions means standardizing processes in certain areas, automation in certain areas. And as I mentioned at the Analyst Day, we'll probably make some investments here in the near-term. So, we're going to see margin expansion for the company throughout this year and you'll probably see modest margin expansion in 2019 but it won't be significant in 2019 largely because we're going to make some structural investments that are going to help the company better scale.","But I think we're on a good path. I think the work that we're doing is very measured, very responsible, and really keeping in mind making sure that we take the right actions while, at the same time, investing in the areas that are going to drive revenue growth for the company.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Very helpful.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from James Fish of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","James E. Fish - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions here. I guess just maybe how much is OTT traffic now as a percentage after this quarter? And can you just clarify what the pricing discount of OTT traffic is compared to sort of the average Internet traffic that hits Akamai's network today?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. OTT traffic is the largest source of traffic for us, and it's approximately half of our total traffic. The pricing depends on the volume of traffic from any given customer. And the major broadcasters and media folks tend to push a lot of the traffic and they would get the most competitive and lowest pricing per bit because of the volume discounts.","James E. Fish - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. And then, maybe just to go back to some prior questions here, just on the comments around the Web pricing, that was primarily due to essentially the cloud service provider competitors? Or was that due to any private competitors out there like a Cloudflare, Fastly?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Well, no. As Jim mentioned, the customers themselves demand lower pricing. That's very common in technology. Some of the customers themselves are under competitive pressure from cloud giants. And we always had a wide variety of competitors. You have the cloud giants, some of them have been in the business of delivery now for over a decade. You've got start-ups and you've got the CDNs that have been in business for well over a decade. So, a wide variety of competitors there, and I don't think there's been any fundamental change in that landscape.","James E. Fish - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.","Hey, guys. This is actually Ugam Kamat on for Sterling. So, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned about traffic which is accelerating and OTT and others being really streamed across your network. And in the past you had mentioned that when traffic accelerated, it takes about six to nine months before it actually manifests into revenue. So, seeing this particular traffic acceleration in 2Q and if it is secular, should we think about that revenue in the Media should actually grow at a healthy clip after two or three quarters?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. This is Jim. Really what we're referring to is when we go through a pricing renewal with a customer, which is effectively we began late Q2 last year and aggressively going after share, when you do that and you're repricing a customer, the comment about six to nine months is usually when you reprice a customer and you drop prices for them to a certain magnitude, it usually takes six to nine months to see revenue acceleration from that.","So we're already seeing that. It's not necessarily a case where traffic accelerates and then you see revenue growth. It's really coupled with the renewal but we're pretty bullish in the Media business that we've done good work. Obviously, the Media business is certainly more variable than the Web Division set of customers because it's traffic-based and traffic is not linear.","Secular trends would suggest traffic is going to continue to grow rapidly but from one quarter to the next traffic grows more rapidly due to more gaming releases or less gaming releases, sporting events or less sporting events, things of that nature, less seasonal viewing in the summer, more seasonal viewing in the winter. So, I think, in general, the Media business, there's a lot of things that drive traffic volumes and we're very bullish about the prospects of traffic volumes long-term.","Quarter-to-quarter, you're going to see variability and we're pretty optimistic in the near-term from the actions that we've taken that we're doing all the right things, which is focusing on the right set of customers, trying to maximize share. And one thing that I want to make sure didn't get lost is one of the things that the media sales team did a great job of in the first half of the year is selling Security now to our Media customers, where I would say we've done a good job in the past of selling Security to our Web customers. They've done a very good job now of not just selling Media products to Media customers but also selling our Security products to Media customers. So, again, they're buying more of the portfolio. So good progress in Media overall.","Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.","Thanks. That's helpful color, Jim. And just as a follow-up, you mentioned about the renewals, so let me hit on that. So, any of the top six Internet Platform Customers that are expected to come up for renewal this year that we should expect should drive down the pricing for the next two quarters or something?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. We don't comment specifically on renewals every quarter. As you can imagine, 25% of our customers roughly renew every quarter. That includes these large Internet Platform Customers. So, there's nothing notable here in the near-term, but just understand that these large customers renew on a periodic basis and there's nothing imminent here.","Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.","Awesome. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from James Breen of William Blair. Your line is now open.","James D. Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking the question. Just looking at the guidance when implies for the fourth quarter, what gives you confidence on the cost side in terms of moving EPS and the margins up a little bit higher range? And then, secondly, if I missed it, just talk about the buyback in the quarter and how much stock you bought back. Thanks.","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. On the Q4 margins, Jim, as you can imagine, some of what it's going to be is the seasonally you get a big increase in revenue Q3 to Q4. So we'll probably see based on our guidance the implied Q4 sequential growth is I think roughly 6%.","All the work we're doing on operational efficiency, you're not going to see 6% growth in operating expenses. You're not going to see a 6% growth in our cost of goods sold. So, you're going to get some natural lift just because of seasonality of more revenue combined with the operational efficiency actions that we're taking, so that's going to really be the catalyst.","I would say Q4 margins are going to be higher than probably the run-rate leap exiting the year, because, obviously, you don't see the same growth Q4 to Q1. But what gives us confidence is the actions we're taking, we have good line of sight to them the back half of the year. We have good confidence that we're going to have a solid Q3 and a strong Q4 based on the guidance. So, we feel pretty bullish about that.","And on the buyback, I think we spent about $166 million in buyback for Q1. I think we spent about $20 million in Q1. So, we spent, call it, $190 million or so for the half and we'll spend the remainder to achieve our $750 million in Q3 and Q4.","James D. Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC","So, there's just over $500 million left in the buyback. And then just one question on the guidance. What kind of assumptions are you making around FX as you're looking toward the full-year guidance? Thanks.","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","So something I made on FX is that I think I'd share with you guys at the Analyst Day what the impact was. And from the Analyst Day to today, for the full year, FX has worsened by about $3 million to $4 million, a couple million dollars in Q3, a couple million dollars in Q4. So call it the total from the last time we guided it, we provided you a guidance I think at our Analyst Day in June towards it by about $4 million.","James D. Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Excellent, thank you, guys, for taking the question. I hate to beat a dead horse here, but I feel like I lost the thread on what you guys were trying to get across on the Web business. So you called out that the Web business performance was worse than expected. But then you're saying that the competitive environment hasn't really changed, so that's not a part of it, that new solutions, a lot of that that goes into Web Performance guys, are selling really well and they're ahead of your expectations. But the answer is packaging and pricing. So can you just pull it all together for us? What's the main message that you're trying to give us in terms of what's been negatively impacting the Web Performance business and what's going to change on a going-forward basis?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","I think you got the points right there, and it's good to keep in mind that we've got a lot of the revenue in the Web Division is performance, and there's traffic delivery sensitive. And so that's where you see the price compression, which is a natural phenomenon. And really important to remember, and Jim mentioned this, that our churn is very low. And in Q2, in fact, it's one of the lowest quarters we've had in a long time. So it's not a situation where we're losing customers to any kind of competitor out there. There's just natural price pressure against the delivery products in the Web Division for those customers.","Now, you also noted very correctly we're doing a great job with the new products and selling those, ramping the revenue from that up quickly. We're doing a fantastic job on the Security products, growing well over 30% and now at a pretty significant amount of revenue. And so that is driving the growth of the division and becoming an increasing part of the product mix, which is why we're optimistic about the future of Web Division growth, while we're dealing with some of the natural price compression in the delivery-based products in the division. Jim, do you want to add to that?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","I think you outlined it well. We weren't trying to imply, Keith, that there isn't competitive pressures in the business. As Tom outlined, there are. I think the question that someone asked is are we seeing this from the large cloud platform players. And I think what Tom was trying to outline is we see competition across those guys, startups, and then CDNs that have been around for a while. So we're seeing it in that space and we're seeing it notably in verticals that are particularly price sensitive given some of the industry dynamics.","And so it's really a combination of all those factors that you're starting to see maybe more pricing compression in that business than maybe we've seen in the past. And again, we outlined all the things that we have been doing and will continue to do to drive the business forward so that we can maintain double-digit growth in the Web Division.","Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it, that's helpful. And then, Jim, one for you. In terms of the EPS guide, I think we added $0.06 between the Analyst Day and today, despite the fact, like you're saying, that FX is moving against you guys a little bit. Can you pinpoint for us where the increased efficiency is versus the Analyst Day come into that EPS line?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","We're probably going to do a little bit better on gross margins than what we had outlined at the Analyst Day. We're continuing to do \u2013 I highlighted that in my comments about continued progress around the platform efficiency initiatives. So we'll probably do a little bit better on gross margins than we had outlined. And again, we continue to drive very purposefully operating expenses.","So probably notably cost of goods sold and then, call it secondarily, efficiencies within operating expenses. In particular, just making sure that areas that we're investing in are pretty prescriptive, and then the areas that we're scaling back on, whether they be third-party spend in other areas that you get more visibility to that every day as you go through inspecting that in more detail.","Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. And, Tim, if your phone is on mute, please unmute. And our next question comes from Sameet Sinha of B. Riley. Your line is now open.","Sameet Sinha - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Yes, thank you, a couple questions. So let's talk about the traffic acceleration (56:12) acceleration. As you had indicated previously in response to a question, as traffic accelerates, revenue starts to accelerate. So would you say that these are annual contracts? I'm just trying to figure out. At what point do you break even on these contracts? Obviously, you don't for the first couple of quarters.","And my second is on the topic of performance, where you've seen the pricing pressure. Can you help us think about the exposure that you have in the retail segment? I guess that's retail and e-commerce, you pointed that out. I imagine it's probably a big piece, but can you help us think about what sort of exposure you have there?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Sameet, you broke up a little bit, to be frank. I think I got the two questions, I believe, which is you were wondering about traffic and revenue acceleration and the contract period that we have with customers. It varies. There are some customers that are annual. There are some customers that are multiyear. There's no one equation that I could give you that ties traffic and revenue acceleration with the contract cycle.","I can tell you that certainly when we go through pricing renewals, we have traffic in mind when we're giving them a price point, and we have value in mind around what the margin profile is that we're looking to garner from a customer over the period. And we're not just looking necessarily at the year if they happen to have an annual contract. You're looking at a customer over multiple years because you want to make sure you are the provider of choice, not just for their current traffic but going forward.","So I can't really give you an equation there other than to say you're starting to see progress in the Media Division. You're starting to see growth acceleration. It grew 4% in Q1. Media and Carrier grew 7% in Q2, so we're making very, very good progress. And as I said, the Media business has variability to it, so sometimes you have to be careful when you try to build an equation into it because a lot of things can affect traffic.","And relative to performance pricing, there's not much more I can offer than what I already shared, which is it is a fact that the Web Performance delivery products, as Tom outlined, we are seeing some pricing compression there, and we outlined some of the things that are driving that. It depends upon the vertical. It depends upon the customer. It depends upon the type of traffic that is being served, whether it's really performance-sensitive traffic or whether it's traffic that is maybe less performance-sensitive. So all those variables come to play.","I think it's fair to say that the Web Performance business is not like the Media business in some regards. There's certainly a more bookings-oriented business that does have a traffic component to it. But it certainly is something that the customer values based on the performance acceleration that is being given for whatever their traffic profile is, but there's not much more I can offer on performance pricing other than what I had already provided.","Sameet Sinha - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Van Rhee of Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open.","Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Great. Just two left from me. I guess just one, Jim, on the CapEx side for the year and into next year you commented about the Cambridge facility. Just maybe a little expansion on how much of an upward bias that's going to put, what the numbers are around the Cambridge facility, and what kind of upward pressure that means next year.","And then, second, within the Web Division as well you commented on the cross-sell as one of the key initiatives. What's the key metric that you're watching there that we should sort of use as the yardstick to see if you're making progress on the cross-sell?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","So, on the CapEx front that we've just begun, so the Cambridge \u2013 actually, the CapEx uptick in Q3 is not just our Cambridge headquarters. There's actually some work that we're doing for Bangalore, which is a large center for us, in Costa Rica which is another large center of excellence for us. But relative to headquarters, in particular, we're just at the early phases of the project and it will continue throughout 2019. You'll actually see the bigger impact on CapEx in 2019 and it will grow.","Our CapEx as a percent of revenue model is about 15% to 17%. We'll be a little bit above that, more than likely, in 2019 as a result of the Cambridge headquarter building. I don't want to provide a specific number because there's a range that that could be and there's a bunch of things that could affect that. But the way you should think about it is it will probably be a bit above the high-end of our long-term model but it's only one-time. It will go down again in 2020.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. In terms of the second question, customers that buy more than one product is really important for us. We do a lot better in those accounts of course. And, for example, customers that would buy an acceleration product and then combine it with Image Manager, Digital Performance Management, one of our Security Solutions for example. the Kona Site Defender platform or the Prolexic platform. We're now packaging those together. And then as we go forward, as I mentioned, we're starting to get some pretty strong traction with our Enterprise Security products and we'll probably talk a lot more about that on the next Street call, but that will become a factor as well.","We're also looking at Enterprise license agreements where you get the whole package and we've had some really outstanding recent success there. So, it's the keeping track of what the customers are buying in aggregate and obviously it's beneficial for us when customers use more of the Akamai platform and they buy some of our other market-leading capabilities.","Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Operator, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from Brandon Nispel of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Brandon Nispel - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, great. Thanks for squeezing me in. I'm curious, how would you guys characterize growth from your existing customer base over the last year versus maybe new customers in the last year? Is there anything that you can quantify for us? I know you had mentioned Epic Games as a new customer. And on a housekeeping basis, what was the contribution from Nominum in the quarter? Thanks.","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","So, it's hard to give you a specific on growth from existing customers versus new. I would tell you that we've done a better job over the last couple years in aggregate in selling more to our installed base set of customers. That's fair.","We're working hard to get more of the new customer traction and actually that's much more of a Web Division phenomenon that even though we certainly are acquiring new customers in Media. That is a less customer acquisition intensive kind of division. We've had some notable wins there, obviously, Epic being one.","So, in the Web Division, we've actually made good \u2013 we've made good progress. It's been an area that we struggled in in the past. We made very good progress in the second quarter and we're optimistic that some of the go-to-market change that's we made are going to show continued new customer improvements in the back half of the year.","And relative to Nominum, we're not specifically calling out what the revenue contribution is. We've kind of embedded those offerings into our core offerings with our recursive DNS business. So I think that what we said at the time of the acquisition was that the business was a $30 million to $40 million annualized business. So you can kind of generally think that's roughly the contribution that you're getting on an annual basis.","Brandon Nispel - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks, Jim.","Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Okay.

These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.","The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on April 28, 2015. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial measures during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of our website.","With that, let me turn the call over to Tom.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. Q1 was another strong quarter for Akamai and a great start to the year on both the top line and bottom line. Revenue in the first quarter was $527 million, up 16% year-over-year and up 20% when adjusted for foreign exchange headwinds. Our strong revenue results continued to be driven by solid performance across all of our geographies and all of our major product lines, with especially rapid growth from our Cloud Security Solutions. Non-GAAP EPS for the first quarter was $0.61 per diluted share, up 5% year-over-year and up 12% when adjusted for foreign exchange headwinds. I'll be back in a few minutes to talk more about the progress that we made during the first quarter and the opportunities that lie ahead.","But first, let me turn the call over to Jim to review our Q1 financial results in detail and to provide the outlook for Q2. Jim?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As Tom just highlighted, Akamai had a strong first quarter, with solid performance across the entire business. Q1 revenue came in just above the midpoint of our guidance range at $527 million, up 16% year-over-year or up 20% if you adjust for foreign exchange headwinds. Media revenue was $242 million in the quarter, up 12% year-over-year or up 16% on a constant currency basis. These growth rates are particularly strong when you consider our very strong Q1 of 2014, which benefited from several large software and gaming releases as well as the Sochi Olympics. Traffic and revenue growth was solid across all geographies and most of the customer base, with continued strength in our largest and most strategic accounts. We are pleased with the continued strong performance of the Media business and remain bullish on the secular trends for this business going forward.","Turning now to our Performance and Security Solutions. Revenue was $245 million in the quarter, up 21% year-over-year, or up 25% on a constant currency basis, with balanced performance across all of our geographies. Within this solution category, we saw solid growth across all major product lines. And as Tom mentioned, we continued to see strong growth in demand for our Cloud Security Solutions. To help provide increased visibility into the performance of our Cloud Security Solutions, we're going to start reporting revenue on a quarterly basis. Cloud Security Solutions revenue was $55 million in the first quarter, up 82% year-over-year or up 87% on a constant currency basis.","Finally, revenue from our Services and Support Solutions was $40 million in the quarter, up 12% year-over-year, or up 16% on a constant currency basis. New customer attachment rates for our enterprise-class professional services and enhanced customer support continued to be healthy during the quarter.","Turning now to our geographies. Revenue growth continued to be solid across all our major geographies. Sales in our international markets represented 26% of total revenue in Q1, consistent with the prior quarter. International revenue was $138 million in the quarter, up 7% year-over-year, or up 21% on a constant currency basis. Currency fluctuations continue to weigh on growth rates and had a negative impact on revenue of over $17 million on a year-over-year basis and over $8 million on a sequential basis, as the dollar continued to strengthen throughout the quarter. On a constant currency basis, we saw solid growth in both our Asia-Pacific and EMEA markets.","Revenue from our U.S. market was $389 million, up 20% year-over-year, with solid performance across all solution categories. And finally, revenue through our channel partners represented 26% of total revenue in Q1, up one point from the prior quarter.","Moving on to costs. Cash gross margin was 78%, down one point from the prior quarter and consistent with the same period last year and in line with our guidance. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 68%, down two points from the prior quarter and down one point from the same period last year, also in line with our guidance. GAAP operating expenses were $236 million in the first quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related charges, and other nonrecurring items. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $189 million, down $4 million from the prior quarter and at the low end of our guidance due to some planned hiring that shifted into the second quarter.","Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $223 million, down $8 million from Q4 levels and up $20 million from the same period last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 42%, down one point from Q4 levels and down three points from the same period last year and in line with our guidance. GAAP depreciation and amortization expenses were $70 million in the first quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation associated with stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of capitalized interest expense. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP depreciation was $61 million, up $4 million from Q4 levels and roughly in line with our guidance.","Non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $163 million, down $12 million from Q4 and up $4 million from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 31%, down two points from Q4 levels and down four points from the same period last year and in line with our guidance.","Moving on to other income and expense items, interest income for the first quarter was roughly $3 million, up slightly from Q4 levels. Non-cash interest expense related to our convertible debt was roughly $5 million. As a reminder, this non-cash expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results.","Moving on to earnings: GAAP net income for the first quarter was $78 million, or $0.43 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $111 million, or $0.61 of earnings per diluted share, and coming in at the midpoint of our guidance range.","For the quarter, total taxes included in our GAAP earnings were $42 million, based on an effective tax rate of 35%. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $54 million based on an effective tax rate of 33%. This tax rate is one point higher than our guidance due to a revised full-year 2015 tax rate projection that takes into account the negative impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar on projected 2015 foreign earnings.","Finally, our weighted average diluted share count for the first quarter was 181 million shares, consistent with Q4 levels and in line with our guidance.","Now, I'll review some balance sheet items. Days sales outstanding for the first quarter was 59 days, up three days from Q4 levels and up one day from the same period last year. Capital expenditures in Q1, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $123 million, slightly below the low end of our guidance for the quarter, primarily due to some planned Q1 facility and network capacity investments shifting into Q2. As a reminder, this CapEx number includes capitalized software development activities.","Cash flow generation continued to be solid. Cash from operations for the first quarter was $100 million. During the quarter, we spent $63 million on share repurchases, buying back roughly 900,000 shares at an average price of just over $67. At the end of Q1, we had approximately $371 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. Our balance sheet also remains very strong, with roughly $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at the end of the quarter. If you factor in our convertible debt, our net cash is approximately $825 million.","As we've discussed in the past, we believe the strength of our balance sheet and cash position is an important competitive differentiator that provides us the financial flexibility to make key investments at opportune times. We took advantage of this to purchase Xerocole in Q1 and Octoshape at the beginning of Q2, all cash deals that we believe position us well for further innovation. As always, our overall goal is to deploy our capital in a manner we believe is in the best long-term interests of the company and our shareholders.","In summary, we are pleased with how the business performed in Q1. We continued to execute well, delivered strong revenue growth, managed network cost effectively and made the investments in the business that we believe are necessary to build the foundation for sustained long-term growth.","Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect to see continued foreign exchange headwinds from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most currencies. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact on Q2 revenue of $3 million compared to Q1 and $22 million compared to Q2 of last year. As we guide for Q2, we are expecting another strong top-line quarter, with Q2 revenues in the range of $532 million to $547 million. This range represents 17% to 20% year-over-year growth adjusted for foreign exchange movements over a very strong second quarter last year, which included notable high-profile live events like the World Cup matches.","At the high end of this guidance range, this growth rate is consistent with our Q1 growth rate, even with the full quarter wraparound effect of the Prolexic acquisition. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of 77% to 78% and GAAP gross margins of approximately 67%. Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $200 million to $205 million, up from Q1 levels as the business absorbed a full quarter of the Octoshape and Xerocole acquisitions and as we continue to make head count and infrastructure investments across the business. Factoring in the various items I just mentioned, we anticipate Q2 EBITDA margins of 40% to 41%.","And as I have been messaging, looking beyond Q2, we expect to operate the company in the 40% to 41% EBITDA range for the foreseeable future. However, EBITDA margins will be heavily dependent on revenue performance, possible M&A, increased platform capacity in anticipation of greater demand for our over-the-top video delivery services and continued foreign exchange movements. To provide some color on the foreign exchange point specifically, at current spot rates, we expect to see a negative impact on our EBITDA margin of one percentage point year-over-year.","Moving on to depreciation, we expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be $64 million to $65 million, up from Q1 levels due to increases driven by our Q1 and planned Q2 network and facility build-outs, as well as the completion of several large software projects. Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 28% to 29% for Q2. And with the overall revenue and expense configuration I just outlined, we expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.55 to $0.59. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $49 million to $52 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of 33%, consistent with Q1 levels.","This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of roughly 181 million shares. On CapEx, we expect to spend approximately $108 million to $113 million in the quarter excluding equity compensation. The elevated levels of CapEx are primarily driven by our desire to increase our capacity to stay ahead of anticipated traffic growth on the network. For the full year, we are expecting to be at or slightly above the high end of our long-term model for CapEx as a percent of revenue, primarily driven by network expansion that we anticipate will continue throughout the year. Of course, the revenue benefit from network build-out tends to trail the expense by one to two quarters.","In closing, we accomplished a great deal in Q1 and remain confident on our ability to execute on our plans for the long term.","Now let me return the call back over to Tom.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Jim. It's great to see such a solid start for Akamai in 2015. Our financial performance attests to the soundness and sustainability of our business strategy. In Q1, we continued to make progress on the four grand challenges faced by our customers: delivering video over the Internet with high-quality, scale and affordability; providing near-instant performance for websites and apps on any device anywhere; securing websites and data centers from cyber attacks that aim to disrupt their online operations, corrupt their data, or steal sensitive information; and scaling enterprise networks to securely handle new cloud workloads with agility and affordability.","At the recent National Association of Broadcasters Meeting in Las Vegas, I met with several of our large media customers to discuss their requirements for addressing the growing demand for over-the-top or OTT content. These broadcasters are looking to Akamai for delivery solutions that will meet their need for scale and affordability, as well as the expectations of online viewers for high quality. The potential for explosive growth in online video traffic presents Akamai with substantial opportunities, and it is the reason why we are continuing to invest in network build-out and media technology innovation.","We recently closed the Octoshape acquisition, which is expected to augment our technological and operational capabilities to deliver a high-quality media to broadcast-size audiences. We believe that the Octoshape technology will further improve the quality and reliability of our live and linear streaming services, and that it will provide us with an end-to-end broadcast-over-IP service that aligns well with our media customers' roadmaps. Delivering high-quality video over the Internet at scale is much more complicated than most people realize. As broadcast TV moves online and IP subscription or pay-per-view models become mainstream, the expectation is that the quality and reliability of video delivery over the Internet will be comparable to that of traditional delivery mechanisms such as satellite and cable. This is very hard to achieve given that the Internet was not designed to handle such use cases at large scale.","The multiplicity and rapidly expanding ecosystem of devices, operating systems, browsers, video players, encoders, DRM technologies, ad insertion methodologies, video formats, and carrier equipment make the problem even more challenging. If any component in the ecosystem has an incompatibility with another component or if any component gets overloaded, even for an instant, then there is the prospect of millions of end users suffering through a poor viewing experience. And this is just for the landline Internet. The problem gets harder still when we need to deal with the inherent capacity limitations of cellular networks. Cellular networks were designed to handle voice communications, which consume a factor of 100 to 1000 less bandwidth per user than video.","The shift of mainstream viewing to IP has barely begun, and yet already, you can see reports of traditional delivery approaches failing to keep up with the increasing demands for quality and scale. When video gets congested at network peering points, the result is often degraded picture quality and painful re-buffering. Akamai's video delivery services are designed to manage all of these challenges for the world's leading broadcasters and content providers. Our unique approach of streaming content through servers in thousands of locations close to end users allows us to bypass congested peering points, resulting in a much better viewing experience for end users. And our large and very talented media R&D team is constantly working to ensure that our platform supports the myriad of devices, operating systems, browsers, video players, encoders, DRM technologies, ad insertion methodologies, video formats and carrier devices.","Looking forward, we believe that the recent acquisition of Octoshape will further accelerate our efforts to develop and deploy the next generation of video delivery technology. The combination of Octoshape and organic Akamai capabilities positions us well in comparison to our competitors and do-it-yourself efforts when it comes to scaling and securing the Internet for our video customers.","Our tremendous scale is achieved in part through close cooperation with the world's leading carriers. We locate our servers in over 1,350 networks, and we are forming much deeper relationships with the largest carriers. Today, I am very pleased to announce a new strategic partnership with China Unicom, one of the largest cloud computing service providers in China. Our partnership is with China Unicom's cloud division, which has agreed to complement its own cloud services with Akamai's full product suite of media delivery, Web performance and cloud security offerings.","As you might imagine, we are seeing increased demand for delivering content to Chinese Internet users from global customers. Coupled with the agreement we signed last June with China Telecom, our new relationship with China Unicom allows us to improve the performance, scalability and cost effectiveness of our China CDN offering for our global customers. The vast scale and distributed nature of our platform also gives us significant advantages over the competition when it comes to security. Scale has become critical for security as typical attacks now contain tens or hundreds of gigabits per second of malicious traffic, more than enough to overcome the traditional defenses of even the most well-equipped data centers.","Of course the need for security is not limited to our media customers. Enterprises across the board are concerned about the security of their Internet operations, and they are turning to Akamai for help. We believe that our flagship Kona Site Defender and Prolexic Routed Solutions are differentiated not only by their scale and sophistication, but also their ability to preserve performance in the face of large-scale attacks. Since launching Kona Site Defender three years ago, our quarterly revenue from all our security products has grown from near zero to over $55 million in the first quarter of 2015. Going forward, we plan to continue scaling our Kona Site Defender and Prolexic Routed businesses and we're also investing in the development of new security products.","At the RSA conference last week, we introduced two new managed cloud security offerings, Managed Kona Site Defender and Kona DDoS Defender. These new offerings are designed to provide customers with 24x7 monitoring and attack support through Akamai's globally distributed security operation centers, or SOCs. Leveraging our cloud security intelligence and security experts at five locations worldwide, the Akamai SOCs provide an integrated security model that can help organizations respond to the latest attacks with shorter response times and higher mitigation quality.","We're also working on the development of future Enterprise Security Solutions that will be designed to detect and prevent phishing, malware and data exfiltration attacks on corporate employees and infrastructure. The Xerocole acquisition that we closed in February provides a first step in this direction with their advanced recursive DNS technology. By combining our security intelligence with Xerocole technology, we are working on solutions that will block malicious entities at the DNS layer. There is much work still to be done, but we expect to have the first generation of our Enterprise Security Solutions in the market in 2016.","In summary, 2015 is off to a strong start, and I'm very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for Akamai. We believe that our continued investments in product innovation, sales capacity, platform capabilities and overall scale are laying a solid foundation for our future growth. Thank you for your time today.","Now, Jim and I will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The first question comes from the line of Steve Milunovich. Please proceed.","Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Good afternoon. You seem pretty excited about the potential for over-the-top. Could you \u2013 I know it's very early, could you size this potentially significant financially? And are these potential customers that you've not really done any business with before? Or have you been in maybe small parts of them and have a much bigger opportunity going forward?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. There's \u2013 as you may know, there's a lot of buzz right now about over-the-top and new video models emerging. This presents us with a lot of opportunity, and that's why we're increasing our investment in our media technologies and our platform scale. I think it's really hard to predict how much TV viewing will move over-the-top. The industry experts are trying to figure that out as well. And I think we'll have to see over the course of the next year just how big of an impact that is. Now as you know, we do a lot of business with most of the world's major broadcasters. And I think there's the opportunity to increase that business, and maybe in some cases, there'll be entities that don't do a lot of business with us, but the large majority of the world's major broadcasters already heavily use Akamai's services for their Internet content.","Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC","And then, I also wanted to ask about the RSA conference. What was your experience there? And do you feel like you're getting some real traction and getting fairly well recognized as a security brand?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, I think we're actually making good progress there. Our revenues have grown dramatically. We have two products that are viewed as really very capable of defending against the large-scale DDoS and application layer attacks, and they're unique in their capabilities with both the scale and sophistication, but also the ability to preserve performance of websites and apps and data centers that are under attack. A lot of the traditional solutions just get swamped with the volume of today's traffic. And even when you engage them, performance degrades substantially. So I think we are getting to be more recognized as a security player; still a lot of work to do there, but we're making progress.","Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Vijay Bhagavath. Please proceed.","Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Recently picked up coverage....","Tom Barth - Head-Investor Relations","Vijay?","Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, hi. Recently picked up coverage on Akamai. A question I hear from our clients is, how do you channel-check this company? So give us some metrics and observation points to dig into, into the field to get a better sense of how the company is doing in cloud security, media delivery, web performance? What are the metrics we need to look into in the marketplace? That would be very helpful, thanks.","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, certainly, we've tried to provide a handful of information in our business. One, we're providing a breakout now of our security business, so you can see our security business is growing and compare that to other cloud security companies. We certainly provide how the media business is growing and some of our other businesses. I think one thing that you can look at \u2013 you can certainly \u2013 people can follow the news. And the first question around over-the-top is a good question. I think there's a lot going on relative to the grand challenges that Tom talks about. Video over IP at scale is but one. There's a lot of buzz, you're starting to see announcements from companies developing over-the-top programming content. That is kind of a proof point. Those \u2013 the big customers that not all of them, but many of them are Akamai customers that we're poised to benefit as more and more of video content moves online.","So some of it is listening to what we're talking about, following the trends that we outline the business, and then I think following the general industry around what's happening in the media ecosystem. You can listen to other companies talk about where they're rapidly changing and evolving media ecosystem, hard to find companies that aren't talking about their concern about security and attacks. Certainly, we have solutions that can address some of them, not all of them, but we're certainly bolstering the portfolio with that. So I think you got to look at our portfolio, and you got to look at the industry and kind of what's going on. And I think we're providing proof points. We provide a little more content annually at our Investor Summit because we can provide \u2013 we have you there for several hours \u2013 and we're able to kind of go through it in more detail.","So since you're new to covering Akamai, I would encourage you to go to the IR website and listen to a replay of that. And we'd be happy to have a follow-up conversation with you on anything else that you'd like to understand.","Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Excellent. And a quick follow-on if I may. Recently, we are hearing media reports of the major TV syndicates and the program producers following Netflix's lead, doing live streaming on the Internet \u2013 some using 4K video. Would that be potential business for Akamai, these major TV content producers doing live Internet streaming? Thank you.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, that is a potential business for Akamai. We are in that business today. We don't see many people streaming at 4K yet. We do support 4K, but we do see the quality levels increasing. So whereas a typical stream might have been done at a few megabits a second, now it's moving up towards 8 megabits a second or maybe a little bit more. But yeah, that's all potential business opportunity for Akamai, which is why we're investing in this area.","Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good luck.","Tom Barth - Head-Investor Relations","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Mike Olson. Please proceed.","Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Hey, good afternoon everybody. Just one question for me, could you update us on what percent of your customers are on an Akamai security solution today? And I guess what you think, it's probably hard to say, but what you think that penetration within your existing customer base could be, say, over the next three to five years? And then also, if you have it, what percent of customers using a security solution are also using another Akamai product or service?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So I think we have, I think, a little bit over 1,750 customers that are leveraging one of our security solutions. We have, roughly speaking, 5,400 customers. To your question around penetration, we actually think all customers could have the benefit of our security solutions. So our expectation is over the next three to five years, we certainly should be able to get \u2013 not that everyone is going to buy them, but I think that every single one of our customers, I think, is viable to covering one of our security solutions. And relative to customers that buy both security and other offerings, I would say that we still have customers that buy only security, especially those companies that came from Prolexic, so it's an upsell opportunity for us to sell them Web Performance Solutions. But in many cases, customers buy both Web Performance and Web Security.","Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","All right. Thanks very much.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of James Breen. Please proceed.","James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking the question. Just a couple questions. Jim, one, on the currency side, you guys obviously had certain assumptions about currency when you gave guidance on the fourth quarter call. Just wondering how currency got worse throughout the first quarter. Just to get an apples-to-apples with where consensus was versus the number you reported. And then secondly, maybe for Tom on the strategy side, there's been a lot of talk about Level 3 and their agreement with Verizon in terms of sharing some of the CapEx on the interconnect side. Just wondering how you see that impacting. It seems like this would be beneficial to overall traffic, and just wondering how specifically it impacts Akamai. Thanks.","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. On the Q1 FX versus our earnings guidance, I think we guided early February, it's about $1.5 million impact from the time of our earnings guidance to the end of the quarter. It was $3 million Q4 \u2013 I'm sorry, $7 million Q4 to Q1, but since our earnings guidance, it was about $1.5 million.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And on the second question, both Level 3 and Verizon resell Akamai services. They both have CDN efforts that compete with us, and I don't see any impact to their recent agreement on Akamai services.","James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. And then just one follow-up to that. You announced today or Rackspace announced that you guys were enlarging the relationship you have there. Could you just give us a little bit of color on that? Thanks.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, this is enabling Rackspace users to have the benefit of Akamai content delivery services with a click. So it becomes very easy to use Akamai in the connection with Rackspace's Cloud. And as part of our effort in general, we're trying to make our services easier to use and more broadly accessible, and this is a great step in that direction.","James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe. Please proceed.","Jennifer Swanson Lowe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. Maybe this is a question for Jim. I think when you had given the guidance for Q1 initially, one of the things you'd mentioned was that there was a number of larger contracts that had come up for renewal and would have a greater impact on Q1. To the extent that, though you've seen those contracts come up for renewal and now we're sort of seeing it in the numbers, I was just curious if there's any color there on how those renewals went and if there was anything notable in terms of the competitive dynamics in those renewals, pricing dynamics, anything on that front?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. That was a good question. You're right. We had guided in Q1 because the growth rates for media, we were projecting they grew at 23% in Q4, and we were signaling that they weren't going to probably grow at those growth rates because of, one, a very strong Q4 on the traffic side; and, two, we were having a few more large customers renew in Q1 than normal. But the renewal process, you're right, it's embedded in the results and the renewals came out as expected, so nothing notable as far as it being kind of better or worse. They were as expected. And we're pretty bullish on 16% revenue growth, off of what we think was a pretty tough compare for Q1 of 2014. As you recall, in Q1 of 2014, we had a lot of large gaming and software releases. We also had the benefit of the Sochi Olympics. So for the business to grow at 16% with kind of that activity going on, we're pretty pleased.","Jennifer Swanson Lowe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. And then just one more from me. I noticed that a couple weeks ago, there was some news out of you all about some leadership changes and some hires that you made in APJ. Just wondered if there was \u2013 clearly, you mentioned all geographies did well in the quarter, but just curious what sort of precipitated the additional hiring or additional focus of leadership in Asia.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we see tremendous potential for growth in APJ. You have a lot of the world's most important companies there. The majority of the world's population is there, a lot of end users coming online, so a lot of potential growth for us, and we are building out our strengths and experience and our management team there. And so that's why you would see those announcements.","Jennifer Swanson Lowe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini. Please proceed.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. Thanks. This is Shateel Alam (37:30) filling in for Heather. Sorry, I didn't know the carrier reseller. I guess did the momentum with carrier resellers continue this quarter? Is there any indication that this channel will kind of see similar growth to what occurred last year?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, we had very strong growth in our carrier channel again. It's our strongest kind of growing component of our channel business. I don't think it's going to grow at the rates that we saw in 2014. One of the things that we had mentioned last year was Q4 \u2013 2014 had a little bit of the benefit for a couple of large channel partners. We were ceding them with some business that was with Akamai Direct that we transitioned to them. It's really helped bootstrap their business going forward. So we had a little bit of higher growth rates in 2014, but very, very strong growth rates in Q1, and again, the fastest-growing component of our channel business.","Unknown Speaker","Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Michael Turits. Please proceed.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good evening. Obviously, as you pointed out, 16% constant currency growth in media, often tough comps when you look at renewal. Any thoughts \u2013 is that kind of a decent enough baseline assumption of mid-teens growth on a real basis, even though we don't have tough comp?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Are you talking about going forward, Michael?","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yeah.","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I mean I think as we talked about that the media business can have variability from quarter to quarter because of gaming releases, software updates, things of that nature. But I think what we've said consistently is, we expect the business to grow in the mid-teens kind of on an ongoing basis. There's going to be some quarters and some years, it grows well north of that. There'll be some quarters and some years where it grows a little bit less than that. But we believe it's going to be a strong mid-teens grower kind of long term. And I would say that, again, some period, it's going to be faster than that, some period, it's going to be lower than that.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks. And then on the P&S side, so Security looked really strong, right, $55 million I think after you did $140 million and change for all of last year. So it looks like a big acceleration even 4Q to 1Q. How is the rest of the Performance business because if you backed the Security out, then that growth looked significantly slower?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I mean if you just do the math on it, you know, kind of in that Performance and Security category that the other non-security businesses grew about 14%, which is consistent with what they grew in Q4, again, pretty solid growth that, as you can imagine, the Security is the new offering for the company. It's been a new offering for a while. I think with the Prolexic acquisition, there's been a lot of training and, I would say, focus from the sales force for selling security. And one of the things I had shared is that in addition, as we've been building out the sales force, the sales force also sells media. And so, I think what you're seeing is that the sales force sells the myriad of our solutions. I think we're seeing a little bit stronger growth in media and certainly in security. I think the Web performance growth rates are pretty good, but I think that certainly the Web performance growth rates, I think, are being impacted by maybe the focus more on the security space for now.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks very much, guys.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow. Please proceed.","Sitikantha Panigrahi - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. This is Siti Panigrahi for Phil. Just looking into your gross margin, this was slightly down from Q4, but in line with what you guided. You talked about earlier all the network optimization and grooming that you have been doing. Just wondering if you could give some color in terms of color in terms of collocation and bandwidth expenses that you are seeing this quarter and how should we think about going forward?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I mean we're very pleased with the gross margin performance. I think what tends to happen sometimes in Q4, Q4s tend to be seasonally our strongest revenue quarters, and so sometimes you tend to see margins uptick. Last year, we had gross margins of around 78%. I think we're probably going to have gross margins in the 77% to 78%. We're not that tight within a point. So we're very pleased, as you can imagine, that we've been building out more on the platform. We built more out in Q4. We built more out in Q1. We're signaling we got to do more in Q2. You can expect that when we're doing that, we're increasing in particular collocation costs for that build-out. We're seeing bandwidth costs that obviously increase with the level of traffic growth. But if you look at it in aggregate, having gross margins of 77% to 78%, we're very pleased with that.","Sitikantha Panigrahi - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And one follow-up on the CapEx. Last quarter, you talked about CapEx guidance. You were higher than what you guided, but you were expecting 2015 guidance to be in line with like around 16%. But now, you're expecting now up on the high-end of your long-term guidance. What has really changed in between, and what's really driving CapEx at this point?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, well, to be clear, we were a little bit lighter in Q1. We didn't signal in Q1 that were going to be kind of at 16% in revenue for the year. Our range is 16% to 18%. And what I'm saying is that, I think we're going that 18% or maybe a little bit higher than that. And I think what we're seeing is we're signaling that we are doing more network build-out. We did some in Q1. We're going to do more in Q2. And you can expect that that is in anticipation of traffic demand. And there is a lag between building out the network and monetizing it from a revenue perspective. The lag tends to be maybe a quarter or two. And what we want to make sure we're doing is we want to make sure we're building up the network to support the most aggressive traffic growth expectations. And we have found that if those traffic growth expectations don't materialize, we grow into it in the following quarter.","So it's a low-risk proposition for us. And what we're doing is we're building out for what we think is going to be traffic growth in the back half of the year and we'll see if that occurs, but if it's a little bit less than what we expect, we'll just dial back CapEx thereafter. So I think you're going to see us go through a period of increased network build-out. And I think you should view that as a bullish sign from the company around what we think is opportunity ahead.","Sitikantha Panigrahi - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","All right. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty. Please proceed.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Jim, I think you just answered my question with that last comment, but I'm going to ask it anyway. Media was the big driver relative to people's expectations last year. You mentioned in the first quarter you didn't have the gaming updates, the software updates and the Olympics. So I was going to ask is growth kind of tapped out here in terms of that side of the business and even maybe even in Security and Performance and what are going to be the incremental drivers to maybe drive a re-acceleration on a constant currency basis off of what we saw, especially on the media side?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, I think you heard the tail end of it that we're \u2013 actually, we're quite bullish on all the businesses. But media in particular, the traffic build-out that we're signaling is we're definitely signaling some bullishness that we have on the traffic side. We'll see, again. As I said, we build out in anticipation of what we think is an aggressive traffic demand so that we're there for our customers should they need us. If we fall a little bit short of that, it will be just a quarter thereafter that we kind of lower our cap expectations.","But we are very bullish about the prospects for security. So I think you're going to see continued growth in the security space. There's a lot of opportunity as well with Web performance. We're not nearly penetrated on Web performance with customers that, in particular in the international markets, there's a lot more opportunity. Certainly have opportunities in the U.S. as well, but we're pretty bullish on all the areas that \u2013 I think there's secular tailwinds for the company both in media, with more content moving online. I think there's opportunities in security and there's opportunities in Web performance. I think what you're seeing us do is we're investing to capitalize on those opportunities.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","But for the second half that you made the comment on specifically, is it winning more customers? Is it more content from existing customers? What specifically is that driver that you're building out ahead of?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I'm not going to provide guidance beyond the second quarter. I did signal kind of just so that people have an awareness of where we're heading so that it is not a surprise. I think you can expect that it's a combination of both. It's customers that we currently have and it's customers that we expect may move to the Akamai platform and that's what we're bullish about.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of than a Sameet Sinha. Please proceed.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hello?","Operator","It appears that question was cleared from queue. The next question will come from Gray Powell.","Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I just had a couple, if I may. How should we think about the EBITDA and operating margin profile in your security business this year given that it's growing substantially higher than the company average and the investments you're making?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We don't disclose the EBITDA and operating margin of each one of the individual businesses. I think you can expect that the security business is in early-stage growth where we're investing more rapidly than we're seeing in revenue growth, so you can certainly see the security business is early-stage. And you can expect that we're going to continue to invest in that. We're going to invest in build-out of the network to support what we think is growing demand there. We're going to invest in more security engineering capability, more security sales capability. So we're going to continue to invest in \u2013 it's certainly one of the areas of significant investment for the company.","It probably is worthy to note beyond security though, your comment about EBITDA, because I'm sure it's going to come up as a question, so I'm guiding 40% to 41%. I know we've joked about it on other calls, that I've been signaling this for a while. This is certainly something that we're guiding here for Q2. And I certainly signaled that that is the intent of the company to operate in the 40% to 41% range in the foreseeable future. I did outline a few areas. Obviously, M&A is a variable that may affect EBITDA margins longer-term, depending upon M&A activity that \u2013 whatever that company's profile is.","Foreign exchange, depending upon what happens with foreign exchange, we have a little bit of a natural hedge, but it's certainly, as I mentioned, it's EBITDA erosion. So if foreign exchange continues to see the dollar strengthen, that will obviously have an impact on EBITDA margins, that is somewhat out of our control. And I'd say a third area is, we signaled more network build-out. I would say if we start to see a \u2013 maybe an inflection point and the need for us to build out faster to support our customers, we will do that. And that may have an impact on EBITDA margins. So those are things I would say, as I sit here right now, I think we're going to operate in the 40% to 41% range. But those are variables that could affect it, higher or lower.","Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. Got it. I guess maybe the point I was trying to get at and it's not really a 12-month or 18-month question, but at some point, it's probably fair to assume that your security business is not going to have this, like, hyperbolic growth rate that'll kind of slow down and be more like in line with the company average. And then when that happens, do the margins in the security business tick higher and that naturally give you some kind of a benefit down the road? That makes sense?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think you can expect that the maturity business scales that the growth rates will slow from, let's face it, we've had growth rates over 100%, some of it benefiting from the Prolexic acquisition. But certainly, yeah I think you can expect in the near term, it's going to grow well north of the company average because even with the Prolexic acquisition anniversary occurring, but our expectation again, we've talked about the company model that our desire and ambition is to grow to $5 billion by the end of 2020. It requires a 17% growth rate. We think that there is opportunity for 17% growth rate really in all of our businesses. I think media has that opportunity to grow like that. I think the performance businesses have that opportunity; I think security does.","So, I think there are a lot of \u2013 each one of our businesses individually have a lot of room left to grow. So, even though security growth rates, certainly once you go through an anniversary will slow, I think you can inspect that we are not nearly tapped out as far as opportunity in that space.","Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Understood. Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jeff Van Rhee. Please proceed.","Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Great. Thank you. A couple questions, guys. First, I guess with the commentary about China Unicom just gets me down the path of the focus in APAC with some of these new relationships, does that meaningfully influence the CapEx outlook? Namely, is the CapEx increase in particular geographically focused? And then the \u2013 my second question was around security, and if you could just give us a sense of where you think the core technologies that you plan to add to the portfolio are going to come from? I mean, obviously, there's going to be some organic, some acquired, but you believe \u2013 what would be the predominant sort of the bulk of the newer technologies there? Where would they be likely to come from, either the acquired side or the homegrown?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. As we develop major new carrier relationships, typically that will be followed with some CapEx deployment to take advantage of those relationships. I don't think any one in particular as a big swing per se, so I wouldn't worry about that in particular. Obviously, China is a very important market, and so we are going to be working on the relationships there and expanding deployments.","In terms of security, we develop a lot of the core technologies ourselves. We also look at partnerships. And as you know, M&A, we did acquire Prolexic last year. As I talked about earlier today, we acquired Xerocole. Now, Xerocole, I don't think was positioned as a security company with their recursive DNS technology, but that is an important component, technology component for us as we develop our Enterprise Security Solutions that we plan to bring to market next year. So as we go forward, you can expect sort of more of the same that way. There'll be a lot of organic development. There'll be partnerships. And potentially, we're always looking for companies that have good technology that we can bring to bear for the benefit of our customers.","Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Great. If I could, just one last quick one. On the Enterprise side, I didn't hear any update along the front of Cisco and more of a, I guess, a general enterprise update. So can you give us just a sense of the penetration success there relative to expectations thus far?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Cisco is still in the early stages, so there has been customer adoption. There's a strong pipeline. I don't expect material impact on our revenues this year to Cisco \u2013 with the Cisco relationship, but there's a good road map in place and we hope that there'll be success in the marketplace that will start to really have a help to us in 2016.","Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael. Please proceed.","Colby A. Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. Can you guys hear me?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We can.","Colby A. Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Just wanted to go back to the two transactions that you made, the one in the first quarter and the one that just closed in the second quarter. I realize that they're small, but I was wondering if you can give us any financial detail in terms of were they generating revenue, and to the extent they are, I would assume dilutive to margins. If you can give any color because it does seem when I look at your second quarter guidance that your revenue is basically in line with expectations. Your margins are a little bit softer than anticipated. I'm just curious how much of that might have to do with the M&A.","And then by second question, and it goes back to I guess what Gray was asking as it relates to EBITDA margins. I think you've historically said \u2013 not historically, but in your Analyst Day, set expectations on a go-forward basis for 40% to 42%. You're now saying 40%, 41%. I appreciate FX is a 100 basis point impact at least in 2015. But as we go into those outer years, would you expect that the margins do continue to kind of creep back up toward that 42%? Just trying to get a little color there. Thanks.","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. On the M&A front, both Xerocole and Octoshape had very little revenue. That was really not the purpose of those acquisitions. Those were kind of technology acquisitions and people-related acquisitions. They were quite \u2013 they had a little bit of revenue, but I would say not material to even comment on. I think we commented in the press release. Both copies combined had roughly 50 employees. So just do general math on that, you can probably \u2013 it's probably a $3 million sequential increase, $3 million to $4 million on spending. They certainly didn't have, obviously, the margin profile that Akamai does. So they're slightly dilutive, not very material, but slightly dilutive to Akamai. And on the EBITDA front, I'm not moving off the 40% to 42%; 40% to 42% is our long-term model.","What I'm suggesting to you is that we're going through a period here where we're probably going to be operating the company at the lower end of that. And some of that, I think, is based on some upon some investments that we think are going to pay dividend. You know, one of the areas that we talked about is we are doing a little bit more in the way of network build-out, and so I think that is going to pressure EBITDA margins in the near term. And we probably shouldn't dwell too, too much on EBITDA margins by themselves because I think you need to look at the financial model of the company in aggregate that if our media business starts to explode on revenue and it has an impact on EBITDA margins, I'm not going to be unhappy with that. I mean, that's a business mix phenomenon that we'll deal with that \u2013 and so I think we just want to make sure that we're agile in responding to what we believe is traffic demand.","And that's really what we're doing. And I think what I'm signaling is that we're probably going to operate at the lower end of our kind of range. And we'll see what happens as far as kind of the ecosystem for media. We'll see what happens with the overall macroeconomic environment with foreign exchange. And we'll see what happens relative to M&A for the company. But I would say based on what I shared at the Investor Summit, I do believe that is the right long-term model for the company.","Colby A. Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. Very helpful.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Greg McDowell. Please proceed.","Rishi Jaluria - JMP Securities LLC","Hi. This is Rishi Jaluria dialing in for Greg McDowell. Thank you for taking my questions. Two quick ones. So you broke out the security business separately this quarter, which is very helpful. Do you anticipate that we'll see any seasonality in this business that we see with the company as a whole?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I don't know if you'll really see seasonality. I think what you might see in the security business sometimes is that because there can be very high-profile attacks that you read about in the media, sometimes when that happens, you do see an uptick in our security business because customers need to be protected immediately, and they'll turn to us to help them immediately. So you might see some, I wouldn't call it seasonality, but you might see an uptick if in fact you start to see some significant high-profile media events that occur. But I think in general, it's a subscription revenue business, and that's the way it will operate. It doesn't necessarily have spikes based on traffic usage or things of that nature.","Rishi Jaluria - JMP Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And then just one quick follow-up. You talked about FX headwinds on revenue for the quarter. I was just wondering if you could tell us what sort of impact did FX headwinds have on Q1 in terms of EBITDA and EPS.","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, you can think that, as I mentioned, it's about a one point EBITDA impact year-on-year. So you can have a general flavor of what the flow-through is of that. Our EBITDA is 40% to 41%. The flow-through is probably closer \u2013 on the FX line is closer to 50%. So you can take that $22 million that I mentioned and then you're probably going to see an $11 million flow-through from a foreign exchange perspective. And obviously, that will flow through to earnings as well.","Rishi Jaluria - JMP Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ed Maguire. Please proceed.","Edward Everett Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. I just got a question about the over-the-top opportunity, whether that involves a new set of customers and new relationships. I mean, are they \u2013 is the growth and opportunity that you see coming from existing customers, or are you expanding? Does this expand actually your base of customers that are going to be doing a lot of business with you?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, it has the potential for both. But as we talked about previously, the large majority of the world's major broadcasters are already sizable Akamai customers. So I think probably a lot of it is from customers that exist with us today, but would be doing new things with us as they move TV content over-the-top.","Edward Everett Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Great. And just regarding hiring, which I think that slipped a bit from Q1, could you provide a bit of color on where you're investing at least in field sales and how you expect your hiring plans to track throughout the year? Thanks.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, we added about a little over 300 people in the quarter. We've been hiring \u2013 you're right. We've been hiring in sales, we've been hiring in services, we've been hiring in engineering. So hiring has been pretty pervasive in the company, and it's focused in kind of two specific areas. One, it's hiring to enable us to grow and it's also hiring to enable us to scale as a company. So we're hiring in all those areas. And you can expect that we're going to continue to hire throughout the year. I think you're probably going to see us hiring and our spending maybe grow more in line with revenue growth, kind of longer term, but we have been going through a period of hiring and spending, growing faster than revenue. That will kind of continue for a kind of short period of time. But I think that they're going to see it level off and grow more in line with revenue.","Edward Everett Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Sameet Sinha. Please proceed.","Sameet Sinha - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Yes. Thank you very much. A couple of questions. It's been about six months since you launched the newer versions of Ion product to your sales team. Can you talk about the penetration there and the opportunity? I know you kind of indicated that the focus is more on security solutions, but in terms of the adoption rate? Second question would be in terms of mobile. What sort of strategies or technology approaches are you pursuing and which of them do you think will come out the winner? Do you have any initial sense of which one you would adopt?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. So we've had good adoption on the new Ion product line. As you know, there's Ion Standard, which is really focused on excellent performance, ease of use, and on the mobile environment. Ion is all about providing excellent performance in a variety of use cases, where the user may be and how they're connecting and what device they're using. And then Ion Premier, which is really the ultimate, all the technologies we have designed to make a really fast and reliable experience for the end user.","There's a lot of mobile technologies that we are developing. In fact, if you look at the Investor Summit presentations, we list several of them and talk about them there, so you can get a lot more technical detail, but things: front-end optimization, adaptive image compression, the Shadow Protocol, which we developed for decreasing the frequency of communications of mobile devices and suppressing the headers, so less back-and-forth there. So, there's a variety of things we do to try to optimize the experience and get around the inherent bottleneck of lack of capacity and high latencies in cellular environments.","Sameet Sinha - B.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I'd like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, please begin.","Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Thank you very much, and good afternoon, and thank you for joining Akamai's first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Benson, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on May 2, 2017. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances.","As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of our website. Also please note that all growth rates references will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted.","And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. Akamai performed well in the first quarter with solid growth on both the top and bottom lines. Revenue in Q1 was $609 million, up 8% year-over-year; our strongest year-over-year growth rate in several quarters. Non-GAAP EPS for the first quarter was $0.69 per diluted share, up 5% year-over-year.","Our strong results were driven by our Performance and Security Solutions with revenue growth of 18% over Q1 of 2016. These solutions accounted for over 60% of our overall revenue in Q1 and they contributed very attractive margins. As we discussed at our recent Investor Summit, the EBITDA margin profile for our Performance and Security Solutions has been about 50%. And this figure includes the substantial investments we made last year to innovate and bring compelling new products to market. For example, Ion 3.0, which we launched last month, dramatically improves the mobile experience for end users. For a customer like ZALORA, an Asian fashion retailer, mobile performance is critical because a significant amount of their business comes from mobile users. With Ion 3.0, ZALORA performance was 225% faster over cellular and 250% faster over Wi-Fi. That has translated into higher sales for them and a better experience for their customers.","Through our recent acquisition of SOASTA, Ion is now complemented with two exciting new products: mPulse and CloudTest. These innovative solutions will provide our customers with the ability to measure, validate, and improve the business impact of their websites and applications. For example, Lowe's use the full suite of SOASTA capabilities to correlate site performance with sales and then drive e-commerce sales to over $1 billion through increased traffic and conversion rates.","On the security front, scale has become critical as typical attacks now contain tens or hundreds of gigabits per second of malicious traffic, more than enough to overwhelm the traditional defenses of even the most well-equipped data centers. To address this expanding threat, we launched Kona Site Defender 5.0 and Web Application Protector in Q1. The new version of Kona Site Defender includes protection for API end points to help secure websites, mobile infrastructure and other API-driven requests.","Web Application Protector is designed for the mid-market, providing customers with low touch and virtually maintenance-free protection from the most common DDoS and Web application attacks. We also launched Bot Manager 2.0 earlier this quarter. The new version of Bot Manager features enhanced bot detection and mitigation, along with advanced policy enforcement capabilities. This summer, we expect to further enhance Bot Manager to include innovative machine learning capabilities to better stop account takeover attacks. This technology was obtained in part through our recent acquisition of Cyberfend.","We're also planning to bring new enterprise security and networking products to market this year. Our vision for these products is to secure, optimize and accelerate the enterprise network as a service in the cloud. We're doing this by utilizing the power of the Akamai platform to support new services that are simple to understand and easy-to-use, allow customers to try before they buy, allow for a land and expand sales motion, and to create synergies with the rest of our product portfolio.","For example, at our recent Investor Summit, we demonstrated our new service for securing access to enterprise applications. Enterprise Application Access, or EAA, leverages software obtained through our recent acquisition of Soha Systems. It addresses the growing need for businesses to more easily and securely manage application access for a growing mix of users with different risk profiles without poking holes in the enterprise firewall. EAA is easy to deploy and simple to manage. Customers can implement it in minutes and then take advantage of Akamai's other performance and security solutions for all their internal applications.","At the Investor Summit, we also demonstrated another exciting new offering called Enterprise Threat Protector or ETP. ETP is designed to protect enterprise employees and infrastructure against phishing, malware and data exfiltration attacks by providing a cloud-based recursive DNS service to block access to malware sites and data exfiltration botnets. It's currently in beta with 17 customers, all of whom are able to self integrate and use the product to block malware that evaded their other security systems. ETP is expected to launch this summer.","Branch Accelerator is also now in beta. For users in the branch, their enterprise connectivity to the Internet may not be sufficient to support video or downloads without impinging on their ability to do other kinds of work. Branch Accelerator puts Akamai's software in or near the branch office to provide caching, enforce quality of service and ensure protocol optimization, all with the goal of improving branch performance. Our enterprise business is just getting started, and I expect significant growth ahead as we ramp up and launch these new products.","Next, I'd like to talk about our Media business. As we discussed in our analyst calls over the last year, our Media business continues to be heavily impacted by the do-it-yourself efforts of six of the largest Internet platform companies. Our Q1 revenue from these companies was $51 million, a 29% decrease over Q1 of 2016. Traffic from our other media customers has continued to grow at a rapid rate, but at a slower pace than we've seen historically. As we discussed in the past, media traffic growth rates are highly variable over time and depend on a variety of factors.","Pricing in the media sector remains aggressive, but the rate and pace of price declines continue to be in line with historical trends. The net effect of all these factors is that as we look forward to the rest of 2017, we believe that the revenue growth rate for our Media business will continue to be below the growth rates we've historically seen and that the growth rate for Akamai's overall revenues and margins will continue to be impacted as a result.","That said, I want to be very clear that I believe Media is a good business for Akamai and that it has a very bright future. Over the longer term, I believe that the impact of the large platform companies on our Media business will lessen and that the business overall will return to historical levels of performance. One of the reasons for my optimism is our OTT business. A recent study predicts that over-the-top viewing will exceed traditional broadcast viewing within five years. Even if this prediction is only approximately correct, there is the potential for a very large amount of video traffic to move online and Akamai is very well-positioned to benefit as a result.","At last week's National Association of Broadcasters, or NAB convention in Las Vegas, I met with executives from several of the world's leading media companies, and they were all talking about the growing demand for OTT content and how Akamai solutions can and do meet their needs. At NAB, we demonstrated two new products that dramatically improve the OTT experience for viewers: Media Services Live and Media Acceleration.","Media Services Live was recognized with two awards in the convention. Streaming Media named it as one of six Best of NAB winners. And TV Technology presented Media Services Live with a Best of Show award. Media Services Live features breakthrough technology designed to eliminate the large latencies that are typical with Internet streaming, resulting in a viewer experience that is comparable to or better than traditional broadcast TV. We recently used this new solution to deliver nearly 100 million live video streams for a major sporting event with a 100% ingestion success rate and greater than 99.99% availability for viewers.","In addition, we recently launched our new Media Acceleration capability to more efficiently communicate between end-user devices and the Akamai network, thereby providing a much higher-quality video experience for viewers. When Media Acceleration was used for a recent major sporting event, we achieved 72% fewer video start errors, 24% less rebuffering, 23% more HD viewers and 25% more 4K viewers. Better quality video, like HD and 4K, requires higher and more consistent throughput to end-users, which is an area where Akamai excels. Across the world, media companies have come to appreciate that it is very difficult to replicate our ability to deliver online video with broadcast-level quality, scale and security.","It's also our belief that Akamai is leading the competition in inventing what's next while improving on what's now. That's always been our heritage. So while today's viewers are consuming live streams over IP, we're anticipating what's coming next: virtual and augmented reality delivered seamlessly anywhere in the world over wired and wireless networks with virtually zero latency. That's the future of the digital media experience, and Akamai is already working hard to enable it.","In summary, I'm pleased with our Q1 results and I'm even more excited about the opportunities that lie ahead as enormous volumes of video move online, billions of devices get connected, cyber attacks explode in size and sophistication, and enterprise networks undergo a massive change as they turn inside out. I believe that Akamai is uniquely positioned to solve the challenge faced by companies across the world as they try to cope with these major technology shifts. Personally, I'm as excited as ever to be at Akamai. I remain confident in Akamai's future, and even though I'm already a large holder of Akamai shares, I'm happy to announce today that I'll be continuing my personal stock buyback program through a 10b5-1 plan that will purchase $1 million of Akamai stock every month for the rest of 2017.","Now let me turn the call over to Jim for a more detailed look at the quarter and then we'll answer your questions. Jim?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As Tom highlighted, Q1 was another solid quarter for Akamai with both revenue and earnings coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Revenue in the first quarter was $609 million, up 7% year-over-year or up 8% in constant currency, and up 13% if you exclude our six large Internet platform customers.","Revenue from our Performance and Security Solutions was particularly strong, coming in at $369 million, growing 18% year-over-year and was the driver of delivering to the high end of our guidance in the quarter. Performance and Security Solutions contributed over 60% of our total revenue in Q1. We are very pleased with the continued revenue diversification into our highly differentiated, higher margin and more stable subscription model offerings. Within this solution category, we saw solid growth across all major product lines with particularly strong growth continuing in our Cloud Security Solutions. First quarter revenue for our Cloud Security Solutions was $110 million, up 37% year-over-year.","Our Security business now has an annualized revenue run rate of $450 million. We are pleased with the continued strong growth and execution of our Cloud Security business, led by our flagship Kona Site Defender and Prolexic offerings and our continued portfolio expansion into new areas, like bot management and Enterprise Application Access. And we plan to further broaden our performance, security and enterprise offerings where we see substantial long-term growth potential. And our recent SOASTA acquisition, which closed in early April, is a good example of extending our market-leading Web acceleration offerings into the natural adjacency of Digital Performance Management focusing on cloud application monitoring and testing and aligning performance to business value.","Turning now to our Media Delivery Solutions, revenue was $187 million in the quarter, down 9% year-over-year and up 3%, excluding our large Internet platform customers. This revenue growth rate was lower than the past several quarters and below our expectations, driven by a moderation of traffic growth throughout the quarter in our Americas region and within our gaming vertical, most notably. It is important to note that while the pricing environment in the Media business remains highly competitive, aggregate price per bit declines remain roughly within historical norms.","As we've discussed in the past, the drivers of the Media business, namely traffic volumes and price, can lead to revenue variability from period to period given the timing of customer renewals at lower price points; the size, timing and delivery mechanism of software and gaming releases; as well as the adoption of social media and video platform capabilities. And while Media growth rates have moderated more than we expected in the near term, we continue to remain bullish on the longer-term secular growth trends for our Media business, particularly in the OTT area, as more video content moves online. Finally, revenue from our Services and Support Solutions was $53 million in the quarter, up 15% year-over-year.","Turning now to our Q1 revenue results by customer division, revenue from our Web Division customers was $305 million, up 15% year-over-year. We continued to see solid growth in this customer base, particularly with Cloud Security offerings. Revenue from our Media Division customers was $285 million in the quarter, up 1% year-over-year and up 11%, excluding the impact of the large Internet platform customers. This growth rate was lower than 2016 levels driven by the moderation in media traffic that I mentioned earlier. Finally, revenue from our emerging Enterprise and Carrier Division customers was $19 million in the quarter, up 24% year-over-year.","Moving on to our geographies, sales in our international markets represented 33% of total revenue in Q1, up two points from Q4 levels. International market revenue was $203 million in the first quarter, up 19% year-over-year or up 21% in constant currency, driven by continued strong growth in our Asia Pacific region. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact on revenue of $4 million on a year-over-year basis and $2 million on a sequential basis. Revenue from our U.S. market was $407 million, up 2% year-over-year. The large Internet platform customers who are based in the U.S. continued to weigh heavily on the U.S. market growth rates.","Moving on to costs, cash gross margin was 77%, consistent with Q4 levels and the same period last year. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 66%, down 1 point from Q4 levels and consistent with the same period last year.","GAAP operating expenses were $288 million in the quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related charges and other non-recurring items. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $228 million, down seasonally from Q4 levels, but above our guidance range, driven by higher commissions and performance incentives as well as increased recruiting-related spend associated with an uptick in hiring activity. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $241 million, down $6 million from Q4 levels, due to seasonal revenue declines, and up $7 million from the same period last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 39%, down one point from Q4 levels and down two points from Q1 last year and within our guidance range.","GAAP depreciation and amortization expenses were $87 million in the first quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation associated with stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of capitalized interest expense. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP depreciation was $75 million, up slightly from Q4 levels and in line with our guidance. Non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $165 million, down $9 million from Q4 levels from the seasonal revenue declines and up $1 million from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 27%, down one point from Q4 levels and down two points from the same period last year and within our guidance range.","Moving on to other income and expense items, interest income for the first quarter was $5 million, up slightly from Q4 levels. Non-cash interest expense related to our convertible debt was roughly $5 million. As a reminder, this non-cash expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results.","Moving on to earnings, GAAP net income for the first quarter was $81 million or $0.46 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $120 million or $0.69 of earnings per diluted share and at the high end of our guidance, driven by the strong revenue achievement. For the quarter, total taxes included in our GAAP earnings were $34 million based on an effective tax rate of 29%. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $49 million based on an effective tax rate of 29%. Finally, our weighted average diluted share count for the first quarter was 175 million shares, unchanged from Q4 levels and down 2 million shares from Q1 of last year.","Now I'll review some balance sheet items. Days sales outstanding for the first quarter was 58 days, up four days from Q4 levels and down two days from the same period last year. Capital expenditures in Q1, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $94 million and at the midpoint of our guidance. Cash flow generation continued to be solid with cash from operations of $143 million in the first quarter. Our balance sheet also remains very strong with roughly $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at the end of the quarter. If you factor in our convertible debt, our net cash is just under $900 million.","During the quarter, we spent $72 million on share repurchases, buying back roughly 1.1 million shares. As we discussed in the past, we believe the strength of our balance sheet and cash position is an important competitive differentiator that provides us with the financial flexibility to make key investments at opportune times, including the repurchase program. Over the past five years, we have lowered the company's share count by over 7 million shares or 4% while also spending nearly $1 billion in strategic acquisitions, thereby deploying capital in areas that we believe are in the best long-term interests of the company and our shareholders.","In summary, we are pleased with how the business performed in Q1 and we remain confident in the long-term prospects of profitable growth for the company. Before we look ahead to Q2, I wanted to spend just a minute on our recent Investor Summit.","For those of you that joined us in person or via the webcast, the themes we shared this year were the same as in prior years. There has been a level of consistency in what we've talked about every year, the favorable market trends, the uniqueness in differentiation of the Akamai platform, the leadership position we maintain and the very rapidly changing and evolving cloud ecosystem and a tremendous amount of innovation we've seen across the business and new product adjacencies as well as continued enhancements within our existing core offerings. Innovation is alive and well across all the divisions, and we believe it will be a key enabler for accelerating growth back to double-digits for the company.","The fundamentals of our business remain strong. We're continuing to innovate rapidly. And while our investments in new adjacencies will pressure margins in the near term, we believe they will drive significant future top-line and bottom-line growth. As I said at the Investor Summit, we are committed to balancing both top-line and bottom-line over the long term. And I certainly believe that if we continue to execute, we will remain a compelling investment proposition for investors.","Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect Media growth rates to continue to moderate from Q1 levels and within Americas gaming vertical, most notably. While it is also possible that Media growth rates moderate in the back half of 2017 as well, we remain bullish in the medium- to long-term growth prospects for this business, especially the potential for an increase in the amount of video traffic that could move online. Factoring in the anticipated moderation of Media growth, we are expecting overall Q2 revenue in the range of $597 million to $609 million. At the high end of this range, year-over-year growth would be 8% in constant currency, consistent with Q1 levels and up 2 points from Q2 2016 levels.","At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact on revenue of $6 million compared to Q2 of last year and a positive impact of $3 million sequentially. At these revenue ranges, we expect GAAP gross margins of 65% and cash gross margins of 76%. Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $235 million to $241 million, up roughly $10 million sequentially at the midpoint. This increase is driven partly by our continued investment in new product innovation, service delivery enablement and platform scaling and partly from absorbing our recent SOASTA acquisition. Factoring in the cash gross margin and operating expense expectations I just provided, we anticipate EBITDA margins of roughly 37%.","And while we are not providing specific guidance beyond Q2 during this call, we want to be transparent about our plans to continue to make investments in the business throughout 2017 in the areas outlined earlier even while the Media business experiences a near-term moderation in revenue growth. We believe these are important investments that will enable us to drive accelerated, sustainable, long-term double-digit top and bottom line growth. We are confident we can manage the company within our 37% to 39% EBITDA model, while we may go through some quarters where EBITDA margins fall slightly below these levels, possibly even in the second half of 2017. As I've said in the past, our ability to maintain EBITDA margins within our stated ranges is heavily dependent on revenue volumes, possible M&A and needed investments in the business.","Moving now to depreciation, we expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be $77 million to $79 million. Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 24% for Q2. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.59 to $0.61. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $42 million to $44 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of 29%. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of 174 million shares.","On CapEx, we expect to spend $110 million to $115 million, excluding equity compensation in the second quarter. This is an uptick from Q1 levels, primarily due to some planned facility and IT upgrades as well as continued expansion of our Secure Delivery Network and Prolexic scrubbing capacity.","In summary, I am very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for Akamai and our ability to execute on our plans for the long term. Thank you, and Tom and I would like to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our first question is from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Thanks. Hi, guys. I think the first question that really jumps to mind is the Investor Summit wasn't that long ago and it really feels like there's a change in tone around the Media business. When did that become apparent? Was it apparent earlier in the quarter and you just wanted to focus on the high level of the investment summit (sic) [Investor Summit] (28:54) or is this something that you were expecting better volumes at the end of the quarter type of thing?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah, let me start with, we are very bullish on the Media business. So that has not changed. Nothing has changed about what we believe are the growth prospects for the Media business. Relative to our Investor Summit is that what we did see is that we did see traffic growth moderate, as I mentioned in the Americas region in particular and very notably in our gaming vertical and it moderated throughout the quarter.","So it was relatively strong in January and then it moderated in February and then it moderated further in March. And that was really the driver of kind of, I would say, missing our internal expectations. But I'd say we are very, very optimistic about the Media business long-term. And as we said to you guys before, the nature of the Media business is it does go through periods where traffic spikes, traffic softens at times. But over the long-term, we think this is a very good business and it will be a very good grower for the company.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then maybe one follow-up question. Can you help us parse maybe the data this way? You give us the geographic and we see the North America weakness in the comments that you made. But if you were to split the platform, the big six out from that, what did North American growth look like, just so we can kind of go to the non-big six in North America to understand what's happening there.","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yes. Well, you got to be careful because the Americas also includes our Media customers as well as our Web customers. I think Americas' growth, if you exclude the large Internet platform customers, was roughly 10%.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from James Breen of William Blair. Your line is open.","James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks. Just a couple questions. One, the guidance for next quarter. As you look at that number, approximately SOASTA closed in the beginning of the quarter and I think you had said to be about $20 million of revenues. Is that included in that guidance number just comparing that relative to where consensus is?","And then on the big six, you obviously saw pretty good absolute step down in the first quarter from the fourth quarter and the third quarter last year. Is there anything in there that's seasonal in that? And then as you see think about your largest customers now, how big are your top two or three customers as a percentage of revenue? Thanks.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","So I think the large Internet platform customers for the most part came in line with what we expected in Q1. They do seasonally drop Q4 to Q1. That Q4 seasonally is a large quarter for all \u2013 actually, all of our large media customers in particular. So the step down there was not unexpected, pretty much in line with what we thought.","Those customers now represent about 8% of our revenues. So the good news is that as we go through this, the diversification of the company's revenue, as I mentioned in the Investor Summit, we are much better diversified from a customer perspective; we're much better diversified from a product category perspective; and we're much better diversified from a geography perspective. So I think the health and diversification of the company's revenue is much better now than it has been.","And I think relative to the giants and maybe what we expect them to do kind of longer-term, I think as we've said before, we do expect a further deceleration with two of those six. And we expect them to further kind of decline as they serve more of their traffic themselves. So nothing there has really changed and what we've seen here is very much in line with our expectations.","James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC","And then just on the guidance side, so that guidance will include some portion of the SOASTA revenue since the deal closed in April?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yes. Yeah. As I said, we're not going to guide specifically on SOASTA's revenues and margins. I said at the Investor Summit that SOASTA probably will generate, call it, roughly $20 million for the remainder of 2017. It could be a little bit less than that. But what you're going to have in the first quarter with SOASTA is, as you know, with purchase accounting, we're going to take a very large deferred revenue haircut. So the revenue in the second quarter will certainly be less than and it will be in the third and the fourth quarter. So it's not that material. We're going to embed that in our Web performance business and we're going to report that within our Performance and Security category.","James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC","And just, finally, just as you look across the division, it seems as though performance and security continue to perform well. So really the weakness we're seeing is mainly in the media side. Around that gaming vertical, is it multiple players? Is it one or two players that you're seeing having the most pressure? Thanks.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","There's a lot of competition in media and I would say especially when it comes to software downloads, which is where the revenue comes from the gaming vertical. And as the traffic shifts more towards updates that can be done in the background as opposed to a new game where you're sitting there waiting for it in real time, well, that means performance matters less, means pricing is lower, and competition is even stiffer. And we've talked about that before. And I think that's part of what we're seeing here. But there's lots of competition in media, particularly for software downloads and especially if it's in a background kind of mode.","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yes. And, Jim, your comment about Performance and Security, it continues to be a very strong growth for the company. The 18% growth in Q1, last year it consistently grew kind of in the high-teens. So what you see here really is just a little softening in media growth kind of in our Americas region and in the area that we mentioned. Again, this tends to be the nature of the Media business. And I think we've gone through these spells before where media surges and you start to see media accelerate. So it's not uncommon to go through these periods.","But I believe we're optimistic about the long-term growth potential, not just for OTT, but also within gaming. That as gaming becomes more and more latency sensitive and performance sensitive, as you see more and more things like AR and VR that, I think, that all of a sudden, the differentiation for Akamai becomes more and more apparent. So we're bullish about the prospects for media. I think we're going to go through some near-term slowing in media, but optimistic about the long-term for media.","James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Terrific. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Will Power of Baird. Your line is open.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","We'll move to the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Great, guys. Could you give us maybe some color on your Media business percentage where you think you have kind of fairly differentiated services that are not as commodity like we're seeing on software here? And Jim, maybe just give maybe a little more clarity what you're seeing on the guidance on the Media side, how much it'd be down sequentially? Maybe I kind of missed that. But it seems like I'm having a tough time getting to that type of overall revenue guidance that you're providing for the second quarter. Thanks.","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. I'm not sure what else to tell you about the guidance. We don't guide necessarily by product category that our media products were about 3% growth kind of excluding the large Internet platform customers. And our Media Division customer growth was about 10%. So we expect that to further moderate to the areas that I mentioned, which is in the Americas and notably within gaming.","We do expect to have continued strong growth in Performance and Security, continue to expect to have good growth within Services. So I think what you're going to see here in the guide is you kind to do it at the midpoint. At the midpoint, you're going to see a further moderation of media growth rates and that's really kind of what it's all about.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","And on Media, can you maybe give us some color on what do you think is more commoditized versus where you have more for a differentiated product? I mean, I think some of your OTT video was fairly unique in terms of quality and scale. Where you're at, at this point, in the business?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. No, I think you characterized it well. At one end of the spectrum, you've got background software downloads, which is not performance sensitive, and that's the best opportunity for competition. Obviously, pricing lower there as well. The other end of the spectrum, you've got live and linear OTT where performance is very sensitive, and it's very challenging to deliver high quality at scale. And you see the great work that we're doing there with the kinds of awards we win at NAB.","We're the go-to player for the major events that you watch online and traffic growing well there. And I think really key for us is to see OTT adoption continue, even better if it accelerates, quality levels to improve as broadcasters move more content into the higher-quality formats, HD and someday, 4K. Those are all very good areas for Akamai.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Siti Panigrahi of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Siti Panigrahi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Just switching to Security business. Security this time grew around 35.5% year-over-year. That's a deceleration from last year of 47% and even Q4 of 41%. I'm wondering, for the remaining of the year, I know you don't guide, but are you expecting any kind of new product that's coming in contributing, because if I look at your 2015 to 2016, it decelerated from 49% to 44%. But as you look 2017, what's your expectation in terms of trends and contribution from the newer products?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. Well, let me start and then I can have \u2013 Tom can talk a little about the products. I think you're right that the growth rates in Security were in the kind of the high-40%s and then the low-40%s and now they're in the high 30%s. This is a business that is now a annualized run rate of $450 million. Five years ago this was just a idea. So this business is growing very, very rapidly. Its growth rate on a percentage basis is lower because it's on a much, much bigger base. So we're very, very positive about the Security business and our execution in the Security business. And you've got to remember, this is all subscription model offerings. This is not license model. This is literally a subscription model business that now is approaching $0.5 billion. So Tom can talk a little bit about the product categories, but there's a lot going on there.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yes. I talked about in the prepared remarks that we have the new version of Kona out now, and that includes now protection for API end points. And the way to think about that is for your mobile apps where as you have more mobile apps deployed, the attackers are now going after those and we have a really unique capability to very nicely defend against those.","You have the new version of Bot Manager, and that manages the response given to the automated entities that are coming to your websites and apps. There's a wide variety of those. I guess, price scrapers and account takeover attacks being maybe the worst there. And as I talked about with our new machine learning capabilities to be deployed this summer and then the next version of Bot Manager, we're very excited about that because that'll provide even better capabilities to stop the people trying \u2013 checking stolen IDs, and there's a ton of stolen IDs out there today.","Then on the enterprise side, we're really just getting started in the market. There's two security products there. We're in the market selling Enterprise Application Access today. That was released in Q4. And we're in beta now with Enterprise Threat Protector, and that will become more generally available this summer. So there's a lot of new activity and products and innovation on the security side of the house and I'm very optimistic for continued very strong growth rates in our Security business.","Siti Panigrahi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Colby Synesael of Cowen. Your line is open.","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. Maybe just a follow-up on that last question regarding the Security business. I'm just curious, do you feel that your security products in aggregate are growing at market rates or potentially above? And to that point, what's the ability to sustain that? It looks like \u2013 well, it shouldn't look like. When I look at the new product that are coming out, I'm just curious, are those \u2013 in the security segment \u2013 are those anticipated to sustain the glide path, if you will, in terms of deceleration in growth that we're seeing? Or is there risk of a more prominent step down?","And I guess, the reason I'm asking this is that with the Media business being weak or weaker than anticipated, obviously, the Security business has really been what's supported that. And it's difficult I think for all of us to really explicitly quantify exactly what that growth deceleration is going to look like. I think any color that could help us in that regard would be helpful.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. Let me start with that. It depends on who you want to compare to, but I think for most all choices our growth rate in our security solutions is very strong compared to the competition. The traditional competition there is we have box providers and that just doesn't cut it anymore when you have the scale of attacks being so large that you can easily overwhelm the data center defenses. In fact, you can't afford to buy enough boxes to defend yourself against the large-scale attacks.","In addition, we're now, as we talked about, just getting into the area of enterprise security. And just so I'm clear about that, almost all of our revenue today comes from what I would call web security or application security, and that's defending websites and defending web apps against things like DDoS attacks or site takeover attacks, that kind of thing.","With our new enterprise line, we're now going to be defending enterprise users and the enterprise network against attacks like phishing attacks, malware attacks, attacks where maybe some device has been infected in the enterprise. The bad guys have gathered up all the internal data and now they're going to exfiltrate it. And we're going to be stopping those kinds of attacks.","So really it sounds like security still and it is, but it's by our different capabilities and in the long run, a much larger market for us. So I do think that we have every opportunity to maintain a very strong growth rate in our Security business as it gets larger. We don't provide forward-looking guidance. We will keep you advised on how the new enterprise line is doing once it gets some critical mass. But I'm very optimistic about the future, very strong growth of our security products.","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","I guess, maybe just one other question. You made three acquisitions in the second half of 2017: Concord, Cyberfend, and Soha. I think you mentioned that ex FX and ex the top six customers, growth was 13% year-over-year. Can you give us like what's the organic growth? Is it fair to assume maybe 1% or 2% of that was a result of those acquisitions?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","No.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","No, because Concord was just a handful of people with technology we really like, a very small acquisition. Cyberfend has not yet been integrated. As I talked about, we'll be releasing capabilities with the next version of Bot Manager this summer with Cyberfend technology. And Soha, we're just getting started their (46:23) sales.","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Colby, there was really no revenue for any of those. Those were more technology tuck-ins. There's certainly some revenue that comes with SOASTA, as I mentioned, but the first three that you mentioned really were more of technology capability acquisitions.","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thanks. Our next question is from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. Yeah, hi, Tom, Jim. I have a question on your overseas business and also back here in the States. The strength you're seeing overseas is a bit counterintuitive. I mean several equipment suppliers we track have noted weak demand trends especially in Europe. So is emerging markets primarily driving the strength you're seeing overseas? And then back here in the States, any of your big media customers kind of indicating to you they've increased their OTT programming volumes through the Akamai network heading into the back half or into next year? Thanks.","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yes. No, you're absolutely right about the international growth, that the growth rates are very different in the European markets than the Asia Pacific markets. And I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we're seeing very, very strong growth in the Asia Pacific markets. We are not seeing nearly the same level of growth in the European markets, but we have pretty good growth rates also in Europe. They're not the same as in Asia Pacific, but I'd say international growth rates at 21%, heavily fueled by Asia Pacific with decent growth in EMEA. And that's probably not uncommon. We certainly have more opportunity in our Asia Pacific markets where we're not nearly penetrated. And you could take the OTT question.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yes. I think when you talk to the leading executives, I think they are more bought in than ever that a lot of the video content is going to move over the top. And I think the approach they're taking now is to try lots of different vehicles. A typical broadcaster might have their own OTT offer for their content and they might participate in several aggregated packages. And I think at this point, they don't really know which ones will be the most successful. So I think they're trying a variety of alternatives with the idea being that one way or another, a lot of the content is going to move online. And they don't want to get caught short making the wrong bet, so they're trying lots of the alternatives.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Kelleher of D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.","Mark Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Want to get back to the media side. Is there a steady-state level of revenue for Internet platform customers? Or does that go right to zero? Does that $51 million level out somewhere?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","I mean, I think at the end of the day, it's tough to tell what's going to happen with the Internet platform customers that we certainly know that two of them have an intention to serve more of the traffic themselves. So as we said over the last couple quarters, we expect those two customers to continue to serve more traffic themselves which means less traffic will be served by Akamai.","I think it's more difficult to call some of the other large Internet platform companies. Many of them have a culture of wanting to do more themselves. They do a lot with us today. I think it's really a matter of the use case and the capabilities that we possess. And if the capabilities we possess match the use case that they have and they don't have that capability, then we will continue to grow with them.","So the reason we ring-fence them for you is because I think that investors have their own views of what's going to happen with those large companies. And I think it's difficult to call. I think that what we've tried to kind of provide some guidance on for you is that our expectation is they will continue to decline kind of over time here. So I don't know if they're going to go to zero, but I'm not sure we're ready to call that yet. But we expect that they're certainly going to continue to go down.","Mark Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.","And as a follow-up to that, if your other media customers are a little \u2013 the gaming sector are little slower, where do you stand with capacity utilization? And can you pull back on CapEx because you've got less media revenue to support?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","To be clear, media traffic is growing at a substantial rate. So we are continuing to build out. And of course, OTT traffic is growing at a substantial rate. So it's not a situation of underutilization. It's just that the growth rates, as a percentage, are less than they were before, of course, led by the largest platform companies.","Mark Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.","So you're not adjusting your CapEx for short-term weakness?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","No, I think we always plan our CapEx in alignment with where we believe traffic growth is going to be. And I think, as Tom said, traffic is still growing very rapidly; it's just not growing as rapid a pace as we had projected. So, yes, we will dial CapEx in alignment with our revised projections, but we need to continue to build out as traffic grows and we don't have CapEx just for our Media business that while our Media business is certainly the most CapEx intensive that we do build our CapEx, as I mentioned, with our rapidly growing Security business, we're building out more attack capacity for Prolexic. And so there is a level of investment that's going on in CapEx. Even though security is not heavily CapEx-oriented business, it does have some CapEx.","The other thing is, as we continue to make investments in R&D, we're going to capitalize more R&D, which is basically new product incubation. So there's a bunch of areas of CapEx many of which will continue to grow. Our expectation is that we'll manage CapEx and align it with traffic and revenue projections.","Mark Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.","All right. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Turits of Raymond James. Your line is open.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good evening. I have two questions. So first is on a comment about EBITDA margins possibly dipping down in the second half below 37%. Is that just a function of lower topline? Or is it higher expenses?","And then the second question is, given the what sounds like a worse at least medium-term market on the gaming side, do you feel like you're still in a position to get Media back to double-digits and the company back to double-digit overall by 2018?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. I'll take those and then Tom may, if he has anything else to offer. So we're not guiding necessarily, Michael, for the back half. I did signal that because I think you know that EBITDA is a function of a lot of things, revenue and volumes being the most notable. And as I mentioned that there are important investments that we believe we need to make that are in the best interest of the company and our shareholders long-term, which are investments in some of the enterprise areas, some of the security areas, some of the areas that we mentioned that are going to be very significant we believe top line and bottom line growers. And so we don't want to curtail investment there.","And so my caution for the back half was more that we're going to continue to make investments, and should you continue to see a top line moderation in Media, and again we don't know whether that's going to be the case. I think we're really talking about Media in particular. I was just being cautious that if we do dip below 37%, I wanted to make sure that people realize our intention is to manage the company to 37% to 39% EBITDA. There may be a quarter or two where you go through something lower than that, but we'll manage it back accordingly. And I forgot what your second question was?","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Double-digit growth?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. So we certainly have the expectation that we're going to return to double-digit growth in 2018. That's still where we believe we can be. You're right with the moderation in media that I don't believe this moderation in media is going to be a long-term phenomenon. So we may be going through a spell here for the next couple quarters where media growth softens. But, as you know, we've been through these periods before and then media growth roars again. So I think there's enough opportunity in media that we can get media growing again and get the company back to double digits.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Hart of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.","Michael Hart - Guggenheim Securities","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. There have been a bunch of questions about the Media Division, but I'd like to throw in just one more. This quarter we saw the media customer revenue growth outperform the Media Delivery product growth for orders of that trend (55:46). And wondering does that mean that your customers are buying Performance and Security offerings more than buying traditional Media Delivery offerings. And if that is the case, can you provide some more color on what solutions those customers are purchasing Performance and Security products for?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. I would say that the media customers are certainly buying Performance products, especially Security. But they would not be buying more of that than the media products. The large majority of the Media Division revenue comes from our media products. And the large majority of the revenue is from those that have the most media to deliver. The largest several hundred customers would comprise a lot of the revenue. And those folks are big names. And so they really care about their brand. They are big targets for attack, and they care a lot about our security solutions. And so that is why you see the Media Division or the customer revenue for our media customers be growing at a higher rate than the media products per se.","Michael Hart - Guggenheim Securities","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Thank you. This is Sanjit Singh for Keith Weiss. Thank you for taking the question. If we take a step back, what would we have to see in terms of the growth rates that you're seeing in the business that would cause you guys to maybe dial back on the investments? Is there a certain level of growth that you want to sustain? Or what would you have to see to cause you guys to potentially pare back on the incremental investments on the Enterprise and Security side?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, I would say that we manage the company as a portfolio and we look at all the investments that we want to make in product areas and what we believe kind of the return on investment is going to be for each one of them.","And as Tom said in his prepared remarks, that our Performance, Security, and Enterprise offerings, have 50% EBITDAs even with the investments that we've been making. And so the Media business goes through spells like this, and what ends up happening is when the Media business goes through a softening, it does pressure near-term margins for the company. I can remind you of a couple years ago when the Media business was growing significantly. You see margin expansion happen very, very rapidly. That's a bit of the nature of the Media business. And so it wouldn't be wise for us to curtail investments in the business because of some short-term disruption in Media growth rates. I don't think that would be in the best interest of our shareholders or the company.","Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. No, we certainly saw that in 2014 when the Media business was growing north of 20%. So definitely your point's well taken there. If I can just sneak one more on the Media business. If we could get more explicit on the sources of competition, to what extent are you seeing incremental competition from the public cloud providers, AWS, and that cohort versus your (59:11) competitors and then maybe potentially more of the private guys, more of the private Silicon Valley startups? Is there any one group that's being more aggressive than the other?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","No. I think when it comes to that Media business, it's aggressive across the board with the entities that you just talked about. And it's been that way for a long, long time. In fact, one group you didn't mention that you would have three to five years ago is the carrier. The carriers were aggressively competing with us three to five years ago or in the past and now they're mostly standardized on Akamai's capabilities. But I think we'll continue to see competition from startups, from the traditional players, and from the cloud providers. And we fare well against the competition, especially in situations where quality matters.","Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah, hi. Thank you for the question. I actually had two of them. One was related to OTT. And I was just wondering what's the potential for the players that are trying to get big in OTT to generate the same problem down the road that you're having with the big platform providers today where the biggest companies who get all the subs end up investing to do this themselves. Like, what are you hearing from them? Is there anything you could share with us to help maybe mitigate those fears since OTT is one of your drivers that you're holding out?","And then the second thing was just your comments about the carriers. In particular, can you share with us with the transition to these unlimited data plans and people forcing if you use those to go from HD to SD quality and obviously, the size of those files then becomes smaller. How do we think about that having any positive or neutral or negative impact on the growth that you're seeing through the network? Thank you.","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Okay. The first question on are we worried about the big broadcasters as they start their own services and grow and so forth, doing more themselves? I don't think so. I think it's going in the other direction. Generally speaking, those folks are taking, doing less in-house maybe than they did before. I think they've recognized this is not their core area of expertise and doing more outsourcing going forward. So I don't see that's an issue.","Obviously, these giant platform companies, most of those guys spend billions of dollars a year in infrastructure. And they're just at a different scale where it becomes possible for them to think about spending hundreds of millions more, trying to do some content delivery.","So I don't see that being an issue in terms of OTT going forward. If anything, it's going in the other direction. With the carriers, I think we're seeing actually the quality levels for video increase as opposed to a scenario you're describing where it would decrease.","And there's competition there and their users, the end viewers, demand the higher-quality video as you get better devices into the home, I think just the opposite happens. You get higher quality levels and we see the carriers already experimenting with sort of super-high quality, which means more traffic. So that, I think, it's more likely to go that way then to lower quality levels.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Van Rhee of Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.","Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my question. A couple of them from me. First on the gaming side, it seems to me the shift to background updates has been happening gradually. Was there a specific event or a specific customer that drove what seems to be a bit more \u2013 it feels like the messaging is that this was a bit more sudden than I would perceive sort of the gradual shift to play out as. Any color there?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","I don't think there's any specific customer. And like you say, this shift has been taking place. And it's having an impact on traffic growth. So it's not one event, no. I think it's been a trend in the industry.","Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Okay. And then with respect to the Ions or the acceleration side, have you seen on renewals pricing \u2013 how would you describe pricing on renewals around Ion and acceleration pricing trends now, say, versus 12 months, 18 months ago?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","I think when you come to a renewal for the same product, they always want to lower price. On the other hand, maybe there's more traffic, which helps. And the best part is we've got a lot of new products. There's Image Manager, there's Bot Manager, there's the next generation of Ion focused on mobile, the next generation of Kona, again, focused on mobile. So there's more to bring to bear in the account, which helps us hold price or grow revenue in the base. And so we are seeing revenue growth in the base of customers with our Performance and Security products.","Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","And how about the actual net customer count growth?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","We don't actually report customer count. We have done that for some time. So really not much to comment there.","Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Okay. And then, I guess, just one last one. Just a clarification. You commented on expenses being a bit above the expectations on the back of higher commissions and more aggressive hiring. Both seem a bit counterintuitive given the business trends. Can you just expand a bit on those?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Well, actually, we performed well in Q1. So it shouldn't be surprising that commissions then would be a little bit higher. And relative to my comment about getting recruiting related spend that as I mentioned, last year was a period where hiring was a pretty low period for the company. And our expectation is we're going to step up hiring a bit more this year and so we incurred more kind of recruiting-related spend in the first quarter than we expected, which means we moved a little bit faster than we thought we could. So those are really the two big drivers.","Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Thank you, Jeff. So, I think, operator we have time for one more. I know we are running little bit long. So want to be cognizant of that. So maybe we will take one more question.","Operator","Yes, sir. Our last question is from Brandon Nispel of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Brandon Nispel - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. I guess, one more on the Media Solutions category. Can you give us the split between gaming, video, social and software downloads? And then what are your expectations for some of the new services coming out? I mean, Hulu, potentially Comcast products, potentially Verizon product. For those companies that already have a CDN capability, would you expect that traffic to continue to go to you guys or would they have that traffic on their own platform or it might be a hybrid of both? Thanks.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Okay. So I'll take those. A lot of the business is video and a lot of it is software downloads. Now gaming, most of the gaming business today is software downloads, just in the gaming vertical. We don't give out the splits, but both are significant sources of traffic and revenue for us. On your comment around Hulu, Comcast and Verizon, the answer is it depends.","With Comcast, they have their own delivery mechanism for their own networks. So to get to their own subscribers, they may use their own delivery network. We also have many Akamai Edge servers within the Comcast networks. So we deliver a lot of content to Comcast users as well. Same with Verizon. Verizon has a competing offer, but we deliver a lot of content within Verizon's network. You take a Hulu, that's more of a direct aggregator of content and that's a situation where Akamai would be in a good position to deliver their content.","And even in cases where there's a big content provider that maybe is in the same parent company with a big network, even if they have their own capability to deliver in their network, you might well see us doing the delivery of the content for that content provider. Generally speaking, there's a couple of exceptions. But generally speaking, a lot of the video delivery that's done, especially live or for-pay content, we'll be doing that today.","Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Okay. Well, thank you, everyone. In closing, we will be presenting at a number of investor events in May and June in both the Americas and in EMEA and details of these can be found on the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. So thank you for joining us, and have a wonderful evening.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participation in today's conference. This concludes your program. You may now disconnect.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time.","I would now like to turn the call over to Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Akamai's fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Benson, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.","Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on February 6, 2018. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances.","As a reminder, we'll be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of our website.","And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. Akamai delivered strong results in the fourth quarter, driven by the continued rapid growth of our Security offerings and the strong seasonal performance of our Web Division customers.","Overall, revenue in Q4 was $663 million, $7 million above the high end of our guidance range, and up 8% year-over-year as reported. Non-GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.69 per diluted share, $0.04 above the high end of our guidance range, down 4% year-over-year as reported, and up 1% when adjusted for foreign exchange and the dilution associated with the acquisitions of SOASTA and Nominum.","For the full year, revenue was $2.5 billion, up 7% over 2016. Non-GAAP EPS for 2017 was $2.62 per diluted share, down 3% year-over-year as reported, and up 1% over 2016 when adjusted for foreign exchange and the dilution associated with the acquisitions of SOASTA and Nominum.","We were particularly pleased to see the year-over-year revenue growth rate from our Web Division accelerate to 17% in the fourth quarter. The improvement was primarily driven by strong demand for our new products, including Digital Performance Management, which came from our SOASTA acquisition, Image Manager, and Bot Manager Premier. Hundreds of customers are now using these products with the strongest adoption coming from the verticals such as travel, hospitality, retail, and finance. And it's not hard to see why. With our new Digital Performance Management products, our customers can discover how to optimize their websites and applications for maximal performance, make sure their site infrastructure has adequate capacity, and track in real-time the business gains that are provided by Akamai's acceleration services.","With Image Manager, our customer's images are automatically modified in the Akamai cloud to help optimize performance, cost, and the end user viewing experience. And with Bot Manager Premier, our customer's content is protected against the wide array of bots that are causing unnecessary and expensive load on their infrastructure, or even worse, attempting to steal sensitive data and\/or break into end user accounts.","The combined revenue from these new products grew eightfold over the prior year and is now approaching a run rate of $100 million per year. As you might imagine, we're very pleased to now be realizing the payoff of investments that we've made over the last few years in the acquisition and development of these new products.","Our new Enterprise Security products, Enterprise Application Access and Enterprise Threat Protector, also performed well in Q4, with the number of units sold nearly doubling over Q3 levels and more than tripling over Q1. It's still early days for these products, but we believe they're well-positioned to benefit from the changes that are taking place in the area of enterprise network security.","Many security experts believe that it's no longer safe for enterprises to rely on our corporate firewall to protect their sensitive applications and data. We now live in a world of zero trust, where enterprises need to protect against the enormous damage that can be caused by a trusted insider when they click on the wrong link.","As Forrester recently wrote, the idea of a corporate perimeter becomes quaint and even dangerous in today's world. It's now just too easy to circumvent traditional enterprise defenses, which is the key reason why there are so many disastrous data breaches. To be safe today, you need novel products like Akamai's Enterprise Application Access and Enterprise Threat Protector.","By deploying these products in combination with our industry-leading web security products like Kona Site Defender and Bot Manager, we believe that Akamai could now provide the same level of protection for internal enterprise applications that we do for consumer-facing applications, and at a lower cost than using traditional and less effective data center-based security solutions.","We're also making good progress in our Media business. Although media revenue was down slightly in Q4 due to price reductions during renewals for several of our largest customers, our traffic share continues to expand based on the actions that we began taking under new leadership last year. Overall, our year-over-year traffic growth rates exceeded industry averages in Q4, with our OTT traffic growing by about 50% over Q4 of 2016.","As we look forward to 2018, we believe that we've turned the corner in the Media Division, and that Media revenue will begin growing again and improve throughout the year. Looking farther forward, we remain very optimistic about the potential for substantial revenue growth from our OTT customers. We believe the traffic from the delivery of long-form premier video content could increase by a factor of 10 to 100 or more in the future, and that Akamai is very well-positioned as the provider of choice to deliver a significant portion of this traffic. Jim will talk more about our guidance in a few minutes. But because of the work that we've done to improve the operational effectiveness of the Media Division and because of the success that we've been having with our new Performance and Security products, we believe that we'll be able to modestly accelerate our revenue growth in 2018.","And because of the actions that we've taken to improve our operational efficiency, we believe that we'll also be able to expand our EBITDA margins in 2018 from about 36% in Q1 to about 39% in Q4. Overall, we expect EBITDA margins in 2018 to be about 37%, which matches what we achieved in 2017 and puts us on an upward trajectory that we will continue working to improve in 2019 and beyond. And as Jim will explain in a minute, we expect to achieve similar levels of improvement in our operating margins going forward.","As part of our effort to improve operational efficiency, we reduced headcounts in targeted areas of the business, most notably in areas tied to our Media business. Overall, we have removed about 400 positions or 5% of our global workforce in a series of actions that began last quarter and that continued this week. Jim will discuss the charges that we have taken in Q4 and that we plan to take in Q1 associated with these reductions.","It's important to note that while we've made reductions in some areas of the business, we are also investing in areas that can return greater value going forward. In particular, we are planning to grow our lead generation and go-to-market functions in the Web Division, with a focus on new customer acquisition; increase investment in high-value services and support for customers, especially in the area of Security; complete the integration of Nominum and strengthen our partnerships with major carriers; continue to invest in new products, especially in the area of Security; and develop novel technology to help our customers realize the potential of the Internet of Things.","As always, you can expect us to be disciplined with our investments, as we continue to develop the technology that enterprises will need to flourish in the rapidly evolving digital marketplace. And as we've successfully done over the last five years, we intend to continue to diversify the business, both in terms of the customer base and the product set.","Akamai has accomplished a lot over the past five years. Despite the challenges encountered by our Media Division, we've nearly doubled our revenue, growing from less than $1.4 billion in 2012 to just over $2.5 billion in 2017. We've also expanded non-GAAP EPS by over $1 during this period, growing from $1.60 per share in 2012 to $2.62 in 2017. The investments we made have diversified our business from a media-dominated CDN into a leading supplier of web and security services for a broad range of customers, including many of the world's major commerce companies, financial institutions, airlines, and auto manufacturers.","Our Web business has grown to represent the majority of our total revenue, and we've grown our Security business from a few million dollars of revenue in 2012 into the premier supplier of DDoS and web security services, generating well over $0.5 billion in annualized revenue and still growing in over 30% per year.","One of the great features of our business model is the way that each of our products is built on a single global platform, 20 years in the making and massively distributed across thousands of locations inside 1,700 partner networks, close to where all the end users are. This multi-tenant, multi-product platform is unparalleled in the industry and near impossible to replicate. And when combined with our unique software and algorithms, we believe that it provides a fundamental competitive advantage in the marketplace.","While our business and financial improvement are always top of mind, I'm also pleased about the way that we have grown and operated the business. Akamai has received many recognitions over the past several years for being a best place to work and a highly innovative company. But perhaps the most gratifying recognition was made in December, when after evaluating nearly 1,000 of the largest publicly traded companies, Forbes and JUST Capital ranked Akamai in the top 40 and second among all Internet companies for ethical leadership, product quality, and for treating our customers, communities and employees well.","In summary, while I'm very pleased with the progress that we've made, I'm even more excited about what lies ahead. Akamai has tremendous potential for profitable revenue growth in the future, as more video moves online, more business moves into the cloud, billions of devices get connected, cyber-attacks increase in scale and sophistication, enterprises enter a world of zero trust, and the need for our services to make the Internet fast, reliable, and secure becomes more important than ever.","Thanks very much. And I'll now turn the call over to Jim to review our financial results and to provide the outlook for 2018. Jim?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I get into the details, I'd like to provide a framework for today's financial discussion because it will be slightly different than past calls. Namely, I'll be focusing on key financial highlights from the fourth quarter, a few housekeeping items, and end with guidance for Q1 and an outlook for the full year. I will be leaving some of the finance and accounting details, including 2017 full-year results, to the press release and financial statements, all of which can be found on the Investor Relations website.","As Tom outlined, Akamai had a strong fourth quarter, exceeding the high end of our guidance on both the top and bottom lines. Q4 revenue came in well above the high end of our guidance range at $663 million, up 8% year-over-year or 6% in constant currency, or up a healthy 9% if you exclude the six large Internet Platform Customers, representing a slight acceleration for Q3 levels.","Revenue growth was solid across most of the business, with the overachievement compared to guidance, driven by the continued rapid growth of our security services and a robust holiday commerce season in our Web Division customer base notably.","Revenue from our Web Division customers was $355 million, up 17% year-over-year or 15% in constant currency, an acceleration from Q3's growth rate driven by a higher-than-expected uptake or uptick in holiday commerce traffic, strong uptake for our new products, and continued strong adoption for our Security Solutions. We continue to see solid growth and diversification in this division, and our Web Division customers now represent roughly 54% of Akamai's overall revenue.","Revenue from our Media Division customers was $284 million in the quarter, down 3% or 4% in constant currency, and down 1% excluding the large Internet Platform Customers. Traffic growth was solid across both our Internet Platform Customers and our core installed base, with continuing strong growth coming from our video delivery customers.","Our Media Division management team has been focused on capturing more traffic share with the top 250 media customers that account for most of our traffic and revenue. Because of these efforts, which we initiated in the middle of 2017, traffic growth accelerated and exceeded market growth rate in both Q3 and Q4, and we are confident that we will see continued traffic acceleration, as well as the beginning of revenue acceleration in our Media Division customer base heading into 2018. As I've mentioned in the past, when we restructure customer contracts as we did in the second half of 2017, there is typically a six to nine-month lag from the improved traffic growth to acceleration of revenue.","Turning now to our Q4 results for our solution categories, revenue from our Performance and Security Solutions was solid, coming in at $416 million, growing 13% year-over-year or 12% in constant currency, and contributing 63% of total revenues in Q4. We continue to see very strong growth from these products within our Web Division customer base notably.","Within our Performance and Security Solution (sic) [Solutions] category, we saw particularly strong uptake in our new product areas, namely Image Manager, Digital Performance Management from our SOASTA acquisition; and Bot Manager, as well as continued strong growth in our core Cloud Security Solutions.","Fourth quarter revenue for our Cloud Security Solutions was $135 million, up 32% year-over-year or 31% in constant currency. That's up 32% for full year 2017, capping up another tremendous year of revenue growth and customer adoption of our Security Solutions globally.","Entering 2018, our rapidly growing Security business now has an annualized revenue run rate of well over $0.5 billion. As Tom mentioned, we believe Security presents a tremendous growth opportunity for us, and we will continue to invest in this area to further enhance and extend our product portfolio and go-to-market capabilities.","Revenue from our Media Delivery Solutions was $190 million in the fourth quarter, down 3% year-over-year or 4% in constant currency, and roughly flat year-over-year, if you exclude our large Internet Platform Customers. It is worth noting that Q4 is a bit of a tough compare, because it had several large gaming and software update releases. And as I said earlier, we are confident that our traffic share capture initiatives will lead to an acceleration of revenue growth in 2018.","Moving on to our geographies, sales in our international markets represented 35% of total revenue in Q4, up 1 point from the prior quarter. International revenue was $234 million in the fourth quarter, up 21% year-over-year or 17% in constant currency, driven by continued strong growth in our Asia-Pacific region. Revenue from our U.S. market was $430 million, up 1% year-over-year, and up 4% excluding our large Internet Platform Customers.","Moving on to costs, cash gross margin was 77%, up 1 point from Q3 levels and in line with our guidance. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 65%, up 1 point from Q3 levels and in line with our guidance. Non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $269 million, up $24 million from Q3 levels and in line with our guidance.","There has been increasing interest from some investors to understand the components of our general and administrative operating expenses or G&A relative to our peers. While our financial disclosures have always been robust in this area, we've included an additional G&A spend table in today's earnings press release to provide further clarity. This table breaks out costs associated with our administrative functions of finance, purchasing, order entry, HR, legal, IT, and executive personnel, expenses that are typically before the G&A by most companies. The table also identifies costs related to our network infrastructure function, which is responsible for network planning, sourcing, architecture evaluation, and platform security activities, as well as our global facilities infrastructure and depreciation spend. These costs are not reported as G&A by many of our peers. We hope this additional disclosure is helpful. Of course, practice varies in how companies classify certain operating expenses, but adjusted EBITDA and operating income metrics provide consistent comparisons across all companies.","Moving now to profitability, adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $241 million, up $15 million from Q3 levels. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 36%, consistent with Q3 levels and at the high end of our guidance range. As a reminder, our Q4 EBITDA margins are compressed by roughly 2 points due to the absorption of the SOASTA and Nominum acquisitions in 2017. Once we fully integrate and scale these acquisitions into Akamai in first half of 2018, we expect to see EBITDA margins begin to expand.","Non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter was $155 million, up $13 million from Q3 levels. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 23%, consistent with Q3 levels and at the high end of our guidance range. Again, once we integrate our recent acquisitions and execute the next phase of our operational efficiency actions, we expect operating margins to begin to expand through 2018. Capital expenditures in Q4, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $94 million or 14% of revenue, in line with our guidance for the quarter.","Moving on to earnings, non-GAAP net income was $118 million or $0.69 of earnings per diluted share, $0.04 above the high end of our guidance range, driven primarily from the revenue overachievement. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $42 million based on a Q4 effective tax rate of just over 26%. This tax rate is lower than our guidance due to a higher mix of foreign earnings. For the full year, the 2017 non-GAAP effective tax rate was 28%.","Moving on to our GAAP earnings, there are three noteworthy items impacting our Q4 GAAP results that I'd like to provide some color on. First, we recorded a $52 million restructuring charge in Q4, and we expect to record an additional restructuring charge of approximately $15 million in Q1. These charges include workforce reductions of approximately 400 employees or 5% of our total head count, as well as several facility closures.","Also included are capitalized software impairments from decisions to deprioritize certain investment areas that have not achieved the commercial success and return on investment we expected, notably, in our Media Division. We already implemented some of these actions in the middle of the fourth quarter and plan to complete most of the remaining actions in the first quarter of 2018.","Second, Q4 GAAP operating expenses were impacted by a $16 million charge due to the release of a foreign tax-related indemnification asset related to a 2012 acquisition. This charge is offset by a $16 million benefit to GAAP taxes, so there was zero net effect on our Q4 GAAP net income and earnings per share.","Lastly, included in our GAAP taxes this quarter is a one-time provisional $26 million net charge associated with U.S. tax reform, which represents $0.15 of GAAP EPS. This charge, which is excluded from our non-GAAP results, is comprised of a $43 million charge for the deemed repatriation tax on foreign earnings, often referred to as the total charge (00:23:38), which is partially offset by a non-cash net benefit of $17 million related to the remeasurement of our U.S. net deferred tax liabilities because of the lower corporate tax rate. Factoring in these various GAAP-only items, GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $19 million or $0.11 of earnings per diluted share.","Now I'll review our use of capital. We continue to focus on the importance of returning value to our shareholders. During the quarter, we spent $55 million on share repurchases, buying back roughly 1 million shares. For the year, we spent $361 million, more than 90% of our free cash flow, buying back approximately 7 million shares. And over the last five years, we have spent over $1.4 billion, approximately 77% of our free cash flow, and reduced our share count by 11 million shares. We will continue to evaluate our capital allocation strategy going forward, including with respect to returning capital to shareholders.","In summary, we are pleased with how the business performed in Q4 and our momentum as we exited 2017. Before I move on to guidance, there are a few housekeeping items that I wanted to highlight. The first relates to some revenue reporting changes that we'll be making for 2018. As you know, two years ago, we aligned and consolidated our development, product management, marketing, and sales teams into three customer-centric divisions: Web Division, Media Division, and Enterprise & Carrier Division. We have streamlined further, and moving forward, we will be operating and reporting the business under a two-division structure: Web Division and Media and Carrier Division.","Also, we will stop providing a solution category revenue view in 2018, because we no longer manage the business through this lens, and therefore do not believe it as a useful measure in understanding our business performance, especially with the growing overlap between some of our Media Delivery and Web Performance product portfolios.","Instead, we will provide a view for Cloud Security like what we do today and consolidate the remaining solution revenue streams into a CDN other category. These new reporting views will be effective when we report our Q1 2018 results, and we will continue to provide U.S. versus international revenue, as well as revenues for our large Internet Platform Customers.","The second housekeeping item relates to the new revenue accounting standard, ASC 606, which we are adopting effective Q1 2018. The new standard primarily impacts the revenue timing of a few license software customer contracts, a very small component of our revenue, and while immaterial on a full-year basis, may result in modest quarter-to-quarter revenue fluctuations. The new revenue standard also requires that we defer and amortize certain sales commission costs.","It is important to note that the new accounting standard has not material impact to Akamai's historical or projected revenue and income statement. We plan to adopt ASC 606 on a full retrospective basis. So when we report our Q1 2018 financial results in April, all prior periods will be adjusted to comply with the new rules, which should be helpful to investors for comparative trending analysis. The revenue and income statement guidance I provide today is based on these new revenue accounting standard rules.","Moving now to guidance, we have discussed several out of the ordinary items on today's call, including tax reform, restructuring, a new revenue standard, and 2017 acquisitions that are dilutive in the near term and that will impact our 2018 financial results. To help investors navigate the anticipated impact of these items, we are providing both Q1 guidance and some thoughts about the full year on this call.","Looking ahead to the first quarter, we are projecting another solid quarter on both the top and bottom lines. We expect to see the normal sequential revenue decline due to seasonality, perhaps a bit more pronounced due to the particularly strong holiday commerce season this past quarter.","We are projecting Q1 revenue in the range of $647 million to $659 million, and at the midpoint, represent the slight acceleration in year-over-year growth in constant currency. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of 77% and GAAP gross margins of 65%, consistent with Q4 levels.","Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $265 million to $270 million, roughly consistent with fourth quarter spend, as we absorb a full quarter of Nominum cost and implement our planned restructuring actions. Factoring in the cash gross margin and operating expense expectations, we anticipate Q1 EBITDA margins of 36%, consistent with Q4 levels.","Moving now to depreciation, we expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $84 million to $86 million. Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 23% for Q1, also consistent with the prior quarter. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q1 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.67 to $0.70. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $34 million to $36 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of 23%, which is down five points from 2017 levels due to the impact of U.S. tax reform. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 172 million shares.","On CapEx, we expect to spend approximately $65 million to $75 million, excluding equity compensation in the quarter. This range is lower than recent spend levels due to the timing and alignment of network CapEx purchases and planned network deployments that are expected to begin in Q2.","Lastly, and as I mentioned earlier, we plan to take an additional restructuring charge of roughly $15 million, bringing our total Q4 and Q1 restructuring charges to just under $70 million. The next phase of workforce reductions will take effect in late Q1, resulting in a lower operating expense run rate heading into Q2. It is important to note these restructuring actions are being taken to enable some rebalancing of our investments, divesting in some areas, investing in others, and to position the company to meet our long-term goals of continued growth and scale.","And beyond Q1, we have other efforts underway to drive additional operational efficiency so that we can redeploy spend and invest in more areas to fuel growth. These ongoing efforts should lead to growing spend more slowly than revenue growth and generating margin expansion.","Looking to the full year, we are anticipating revenue of roughly $2.67 billion to $2.71 billion, with modest acceleration from the first half to the second half of the year. We anticipate EBITDA and non-GAAP operating margins to expand modestly every quarter from first quarter levels, as we implement both our restructuring actions, fully absorb our recent acquisitions, and reprioritize investments in line with our expected revenue growth.","For the full year, we expect adjusted EBITDA and operating margins of 37% and 24% respectively, consistent with 2017 full-year levels, and on a trajectory of further expansion going into 2019. And at these revenue and margin levels and an expected non-GAAP effective tax rate of 23%, we anticipate non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.90 to $3 for full year 2018. This would be up about 13% year-over-year at the midpoint of the range.","As a helpful reference, we will post our Q1 and full year 2018 guidance ranges on the Investor Relations section of our website after this call. In closing, we are bullish about the opportunities ahead for Akamai. We are confident in our ability to deliver revenue, margin, and earnings expansion in 2018, while at the same time, continue our successful product and customer diversification strategies, which we believe will add significant shareholder value over both the near term and long term.","Thank you. And Tom and I would like to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question is from Michael Turits with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. Really strong quarter, congratulations all around. Can you just talk about two things? One is, what are the things that have changed that have enabled you to significantly increase your EBITDA margin outlook and so you went \u2013 it looks like going down and now flat. And what are the areas that you are deep prioritizing that are behind the charge?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","I'll take that, Michael. Thank you. That's a good question. I think you know, and we've talked about it throughout 2017, that one of the big areas of pressure on EBITDA margins for the company and operating margins for that matter has been the absorption of our acquisitions. And so that's been about a two-point impact on our operating margins and EBITDA margins for the last couple of quarters.","And so, we're beginning to absorb SOASTA more so; Nominum, less so. We've been very much focused on driving operational efficiency across the business. And we've been clear with investors that we intend to operate the company in the high 30s EBITDA margins, and then expanding back to the low 40s going forward. And so this is very much an alignment with what we've been talking about.","Now as we talked about, we took a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter. We implemented some of those restructuring actions in the middle of the quarter. We're going to finish the remainder of those actions pretty much in the first quarter, and so very much in alignment with what we've been saying we're going to do. And I would say the areas that we talked about that I included in my comments, and I think Tom talked about them a little bit as well, is that primarily in the Media area or Media-related area that this is a highly innovative company. And we've been investing in R&D in a bunch of different areas. And when you do that, not all areas end up being as commercially successful as you expect them to be.","And so there were some areas in the Media Division that we decided to scale back on. It's resulted in some capitalized software impairments that we're going to write off. And it's also resulted in some R&D engineers that were working in those areas to leave the business as a result of that. So, I think it's the nature of a highly innovative company. Sometimes you have products that are highly successful, and sometimes, you don't. And I think this is just \u2013 we're scaling back in areas that have not been commercially successful to date.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks, (00:35:31) follow-up.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","(00:35:31).","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","I'm sorry, Tom, my apologies.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","No, that's right. And as Jim noted, I think going forward, you'll see in our Media Division a really intense focus on quality, scale, and the cost of video. We had a lot of projects ongoing in Media, and we've scaled several of those back so that we can focus on what we think is really important for the future of the Media business.","Also in the Enterprise area, as you know, there were several projects there. Going forward, the Enterprise Division or team will be focused on Enterprise Security, capabilities like Enterprise Application Access, Enterprise Threat Protector, enabling enterprises to survive in a world of zero trust. There's other actions that we've taken. For example, we're closing some of our very small offices around the world, and we've got several efficiency-related projects underway.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, great. (00:36:36). Thanks very much, guys. Congratulations.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Rob Sanderson with MKM Partners. Your line is now open.","Rob J. Sanderson - MKM Partners LLC","Yeah, thanks. I'll echo congratulations on the fine results. Since it will be the last time we're talking about solutions categories, I'd like to take apart some of the areas of strength, if we could. You mentioned SOASTA, Image Manager, Bot Manager as areas of new product improvements. But, I guess, how do they line up across the segments? I imagine Bot Managers in Cloud Security, and I'm really trying to dig in to more the Web Performance ex-security, a surprise there. And is it new products related? Are you seeing momentum on old products, older generations of products? Was there some impact from the custom government work that you've done in the past? Just trying to get to the source of the strength, if we could.","And then second question is, Jim, you said something about in the Media segment typically being a 6-month (00:37:42) lag to improve revenue growth from when you see the traffic improvement. Could you sort of walk through the mechanics of that? I'm not sure I fully understand why there would be such a lag when you see the traffic recovery. Thank you.","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Sure. So on your first question that we had tremendous growth in Security, not just in new product areas, but also in our core Security Solutions. So Security grew 31% for the quarter, which is an acceleration from what we did in the third quarter. Relative to the Performance side, as we've talked about, on the Performance side that our Web Division customers tend to buy our high-end Web Performance products, and our Media Division customers tend to buy our lower-end Web Division or Web Performance products, which are more traffic-related. These products have become somewhat interchangeable, which is one of the reasons why we're going to stop reporting it that way.","The best way for you to look at kind of the performance is that the new product areas of Security, Image Manager, Bot Manager, all of them, those tend to be very heavily sold into our Web Division customer base. So when you look at our Web Division customer base growing in the mid-teens, you should think of it as buying kind of those products of the portfolio, our Performance and Security products of the portfolio, not so much our Media products.","Our Media Division customers, while they do buy those products, the predominant product that they buy are our traffic products. And those traffic products could be a Media Delivery product, or those traffic products could be a Web Performance product. So we're not providing it going forward because it's just \u2013 we don't look at the business that way internally and we just don't think it provides a helpful view for investors. Obviously, during kind of Annual Investor Days, we'll give you some color on new product areas and how the new product areas are doing, so you can get an understanding of kind of some of the new areas of innovation in the company and the traction that we're making. I think your second question was related to Media, and...","Rob J. Sanderson - MKM Partners LLC","Yeah. The six to nine months lag on traffic to revenue.","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","The way you need to think about that is when you do a reprice with a customer, you see a reduction in the pricing of the customer right away. And it takes a while for the traffic to grow to a rate, then you eclipse that pricing reduction. And so it's a bit of math on it, that you take a \u2013 you go to a reprice, the price drops immediately, traffic does grow, but it takes a while for that traffic growth to lapse the pricing reduction. And usually it depends upon the customers. Some customers, it could be a quarter. But on average, it's about six to nine months from the time you do a contract restructure.","And as we've been talking about for the last couple quarters, we began a pretty vigorous campaign around going and capturing more traffic share in our top 250 customers, and we made tremendous progress in that, and it's resulted in traffic share increases and traffic growth acceleration both in Q3 and Q4. It hasn't manifested itself yet in revenue growth, but we are quite confident going into 2018 that you're going to see the Media Division turn from, which has been down very slightly, to begin to grow modestly in the low single digits and hopefully improve throughout the year. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Thank you. Next question?","Operator","Our next question is from James Breen with William Blair. Your line is now open.","James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking the question. Just a couple questions on the revenue side. In the Media business, you talked about redoing some contracts with some new customers. Can you just talk about how that give you some visibility into that portion of the business, which traditionally has been pretty volatile? And then secondly, in the Security and Web side, as you're offering these new products, are you seeing into your existing customers that are driving growth? Are you able to enter new markets and increase the customer count from that? Thank you.","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","So on the visibility side, I mean, obviously, we knew customers all the time. Some, of course, we knew more than others. I think it's fair to say in the back half of 2017, we did more contract restructures like we said we were going to. In some cases, we opened up contracts earlier as a result of trying to grab more traffic share with those customers.","And so, I think our visibility is pretty good. I think some of the changes that we've made and that Tom talked about and that we've talked about in the last couple of calls, this very, very specific focus in the top 250 customers and reorienting our sales organization to be very much oriented around the top 250 and less focused on the customers below that has given us, I think, some very good customer visibility into the business. And so I think we feel pretty good about the visibility. We feel very good about the relationships we have with these customers. We feel very good about our ability to kind of maintain that momentum. And Tom, you want to talk about the product areas?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. So the Security products are great for our existing customers. A lot of them have upgraded by adding Bot Manager, for example. They're also good for attracting new customers, particularly in the financial vertical, where I would say that the strong new customer adoption there is driven by Security.","And then as we look to the future with the Enterprise Security products, that opens up whole new verticals for us. So I will be selling those products in the existing base, but I think that gives us a really good chance to increase our customer base. And of course, one of the areas that we talked about we're investing this year is with new customer generation, the go-to-market efforts there.","James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer","Thanks, guys. I guess, two questions, maybe for Jim a little bit more. Do you think you can now keep your head count growing slower than your revenue at this point? I guess, how much operating leverage can you kind of see over the next couple years so that you'd maybe see consistent margin improvement?","And secondly, any more thoughts on maybe the balance sheet on \u2013 I think of all my companies, you're about the most under-levered I have at this point, and it seems fairly suboptimal. I just don't know if you have any updates given a little bit more visibility in the business model. Thanks.","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Sure. So on the head count growth, so I think you can tell from the comments that I mentioned that I think you will see head count growth grow slower than revenue growth based on some of the actions that we're talking about taking. So I think what we outlined today that you're going to see scale in the business and outside of our network cost, that in most of our costs in the company, are head count-related. And so you can expect that the margin expansion that we talked about that we're expecting to have happened through 2018 and hopefully exiting at a better rate outside of 2018 going into 2019 is going to be from better scale, and better scale in areas on G&A, we're going to continue to make sure we make the right investments in R&D and new product areas and make sure we continue to invest in areas on the sales and marketing side to capture the revenue growth opportunities. So, I'm pretty confident that we'll be able to continue to scale.","And on the balance sheet, I would say that I think we've done a pretty darn good job as a company that I talked about the buyback that we've done and how much of our \u2013 we spent of our free cash flow and buying back shares for the company. Also, the cash that we have available, we put to strategic use. We bought two companies last year. We bought SOASTA, we bought Nominum. I think that's a very good use of capital for the company to invest in areas that are going to fuel future growth for the company.","So, I feel pretty good about what we've done. It's certainly an area that we always look at. It's certainly an area that we talked to the Board about on an ongoing basis. So certainly, we were open to feedback in that area as always. But I think that pretty much, we put the capital that we have to use in buybacks and in areas of M&A that strategically help the company going forward.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer","Great. And then just on the guidance. Any assumptions on the FX on the guidance for this year?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, there'll be \u2013 actually, with the recent weakening of the dollar, that there will be an improvement in FX, probably several million dollars versus Q4 levels.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer","And is that in your current guidance, I guess?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yes, it is.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer","Okay.","Operator","Our next question is from Siti Panigrahi with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Siti Panigrahi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just switching to the Security, that was a pretty strong quarter, 31% growth. Just wondering if you could give some color in terms of \u2013 if you see any particular strength on any particular product? And as a follow-up, as we look into 2018, how sustainable is this growth? And are you expecting any new products that, besides Kona and Prolexic, are you expecting any other product to get more traction or contribute significantly in 2018?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yes. I mentioned Bot Manager Premier, which features the machine learning technology that we've got in part from Cyberfend, that is really doing very well. That is, right now, the one way to distinguish between humans and bots logging in to an account. And of course, the bots are being used to see if a stolen password and login is valid across thousands of websites. And a lot of folks use the same login credentials across multiple sites.","In fact, most logins today for a lot of our customers are done by bots trying to crack into accounts. And the Bot Manager Premier catches that and stops it. So that's been a very exciting new product for us with a lot of runway for future growth. Also, our Enterprise products, as I mentioned, are focused around Enterprise Security. And it's very early days for those products, but there is a rich road map to further improve them. And we're excited about combining, for example, Enterprise Application Access with Kona Site Defender to protect internal enterprise applications.","Kona Site Defender, of course, is the industry-leading product for application layer and DDoS defenses for our consumer applications. But you need the same capabilities now inside the firewall, and that is possible by combining EAA with Kona Site Defender.","Also, we're investing in the go-to-market side, so that we'll be in a better position to sell these products, not only internally to the existing customer base, but to generate a much larger customer base. Today, our traditional products really are focused on about a third of the verticals out there in the Fortune 1000. But with the Enterprise Security product line, that \u2013 we can increase that substantially.","Siti Panigrahi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan","Yeah. Thanks. Hi, guys. I wanted to drill in on the comments around the large contract renewals and your confidence in the Media Acceleration. It sounds like you've got good visibility into that acceleration. And I'm wondering, were you able to get, as part of the new agreements, a guarantee of a larger percentage of traffic and that's why you have this new increased visibility?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","I mean, I think it's a combination of things. One, obviously, when you do a contract restructure, most of these contracts are at least a year long, some longer than that. And so you certainly get some good visibility from customers when you contract with them around their expectations. And almost all these contracts, as you can imagine, these customers commit to you for that period of time, and they give you some color around what they expect to do. They don't always commit to that level that they expect to deliver, because they don't want to be in a position where they're not delivering up to their commitment.","But I'd say this is \u2013 what's maybe a little bit different here is that I think that our Media team have been very operationally focused on these top 250 customers. So I think the intelligence that we have with these customers at the time of renewal, and not just the intelligence but also the contract structure that we've put in place, in many cases, incent the customer to push more traffic with Akamai, because the way the contract vehicles work is the more traffic they push with us, the better pricing that they do get. And so, I think we've been smart about some contract structures to be able to secure the share and grow share with the way we price this with customers, so we feel very good and we're quite confident about being able to return the Media Division customer base back to revenue growth in 2018.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan","Okay, great. And then one follow-up, you touched on \u2013 last quarter, you guys benefited in the Media in terms of the focus with the sales force selling more Media products to Media customers. And looking at the performance upside, would you say that we just saw a normalization of those sales behaviors this quarter and that's why we got a little bit more lift in the performance side or was there something else?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Well, I think the performance lift that you got in the fourth quarter is not from the Media Division customers. The lift you got in the fourth quarter was holiday commerce traffic for our large commerce customers. There was a very, very strong holiday commerce season, and the Web Performance business benefits the most from that.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan","Perfect. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeff Kvaal with Nomura. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Instinet\/Nomura","Yes, thank you, gentlemen, very much. There's been a little bit of public discussion about Elliott taking some position in the shares. And I'm just wondering if you wouldn't mind sharing with us a little bit about your thought on that, what you are in discussions with Elliott, what you can, of course, but a little bit of the nature of that back and forth will be very helpful. Thank you.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah, as a matter of policy, we don't comment on discussions with specific shareholders. That said, we welcome the views of all our shareholders in how we can better create value for the shareholder base as a whole. And we've got an active dialogue with many of our shareholders to make sure that their perspectives are heard in the Board room.","Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Instinet\/Nomura","Okay, excellent. I guess maybe I will follow up in a different direction then and say, could you help us understand a little bit about what kind of pricing assumptions you've built into the Media business revenue picture for 2018?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","I think the pricing assumptions are consistent with what we always do, which, obviously, we want to make sure that we have the competitive price points, that the way the Media business works is you got to give customers a competitive price, and then the best performance, reliability and scale wins. And so I think we've worked hard to make sure that the right pricing structure exists for our customers. And I think we're well poised to continue to grab the traffic that's there.","So the Media business is all about, which is the reason why we're focusing on the top 250 customers, is focused on the customer that push a lot of traffic, put the right contract vehicles in place, and then watch the volume grow. And as the volume grows, the revenue growth should grow with that. That's just the nature of that business.","Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Instinet\/Nomura","Okay. So essentially, the pricing environment remains about the same. You're just grabbing a greater share of the traffic is the message?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, it's fair to say it's a very competitive pricing environment. So nothing's changed in that regard. It's still a very competitive pricing environment. So nothing's changed in that regard. But the nature of that business is about providing the right price points. And then with the right price point and the right performance, you'll get the traffic volumes.","Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Instinet\/Nomura","Okay, thank you, gentlemen.","Operator","Our next question is from Sameet Sinha with B. Riley. Your line is now open.","Sameet Sinha - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Yes, thank you very much. Lot of questions about the visibility in Media and I just want to dig a level deeper there. So you spoke about the top 250 customers. Can you talk to us about how many of these customers you have contacted? How many have \u2013 the contracts have been changed? Just want to kind of get a sense for the continued flow from other benefits from these sort of renewals. Secondly, if you can also touch on what are your expectations for your Platform Customers in 2018, clearly, that number seems to have stabilized around $50 million a quarter, just wanted to get your assumptions for next year. Thank you.","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, certainly, from a visibility perspective in Media that we don't disclose the number of contracts that we actually reprice. But I think it's fair to say that based on what we talked to you about, at the end of Q2 and in Q3, that we were pretty aggressive about going into the customer base, where we thought that we could grab more traffic share. And you can expect that we did most of that in the second half.","So I would say, most of that is behind us, to be frank that we've done a lot of that work now. And so we think we're going to be able to reap the benefits from that work in 2018. And relative to the Platform, the Internet Platform Customers, as we talked about in the past, you're right that they've been roughly $50 million a quarter throughout 2017. The dynamics that are going on with those customers are different, so not all those customers are kind of the same that \u2013 I think we can expect for those customers that they'll probably come down modestly in 2018, to be frank. They usually do, Q4 to Q1, seasonally, you see a drop in those customers. And I would expect we'll see that seasonal drop for them this quarter, and then probably stay, call it, 7% of the Akamai's revenues for pretty much the remainder of 2018.","Sameet Sinha - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Hart with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.","Michael Hart - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the question. There's a lot of additional color, which I really appreciate, especially the comments about Image Manager, Bot Manager, and SOASTA reaching $100 million run rate. I wanted to dive in a little bit around CapEx. I know you guided to only spending about 10% to 12% of revenue in 1Q, but there's more coming in the second quarter around the network refresh cycle. I was wondering if you could maybe give a little color kind of where we should think about the CapEx spending over the full year 2018 and maybe longer term. And has your thinking around the level of capital intensity been changed at all by the lower tax rate?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. No, I mean, it's probably important to remind folks that our CapEx really are two big areas and then a smaller area. One is network CapEx and the other is capitalized software. So we spend, call it, between 15% and 17% of our revenue in network CapEx and capitalized software with a little bit in facilities. And so, call it, half of it is in network CapEx and roughly half of it would be capitalized software. And so capitalized software are all the new product area that Tom talked about, Image Manager, Bot Manager, et cetera, that's all the new product innovation that's going on.","So, it's not typical CapEx like many people think of it. It's not physical CapEx in that regard. And relative to network CapEx, I think we've done a nice job of scaling our network CapEx. And you can expect that we'll continue to scale our network CapEx in 2018. There's always a lot of initiatives underway in the company around driving cost of goods sold efficiencies and CapEx efficiencies in the company. And so for the full year, we'll probably spend on CapEx again between 15% and 17% of revenue.","Michael Hart - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Olson with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Michael Olson - Piper Jaffray","Hey, good afternoon. I just had a question related to getting a sense for where the bulk of Security growth can come from going forward. So, as it stands today, is the growth with Security coming more from higher revenue per customer for existing Security customers? Or is it through adding new customers? And I'm sure the answer is some of both. But which would you say is driving more of the growth right now? And then also related to that, what percent of Security customers today are outside of your customer base for other Akamai solutions? Thanks.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah, I would say most of the dollars today is upsell into the existing customer base, but we are also attracting new customers, and I mentioned, especially in the financial vertical, where the first product they buy will be Security. Today, you take the typical Web-wrap (00:59:59) out there selling, and most of the new deals are led by Security. So it's really good as an upsell when we have these new products and really good to attract new customers, and especially, as we start getting traction with our Enterprise Security products, because those appeal to every enterprise, where our traditional product lines, as I mentioned, were more combined to about a third of the verticals in the Fortune 1000.","Michael Olson - Piper Jaffray","All right, thanks. And then a quick housekeeping, are you expecting the fiscal 2018 tax rate to be similar to the 23% non-GAAP rate in Q1?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yes. I think I provided that in the full-year guidance. We expect a 23% full-year non-GAAP tax rate.","Michael Olson - Piper Jaffray","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great, hi. Most of mine have been answered, but one that I just wanted to touch on. You've talked about pricing in the Media business. And I believe you said you expect the pricing trends that you've been seeing to continue. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you've been seeing over the last kind of 6 to 12 months in the Performance business and how are you thinking about pricing trends as you look ahead over the next 12 months? Thank you.","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Sure. I'd say the Performance business that you can expect, Heather, that is also \u2013 it's not competitive like Media, but it's also a competitive business that Akamai has, we believe, the best performing set of products in that area. And so it depends upon the customer that you're selling to for the Web Performance, but not all customers and not all products are the same. And so when you're selling a Web Performance product maybe to a Media customer that's using it for a traffic solution, pricing might be much more aggressive, whereas if you're maybe selling Web Performance Solution to a large commerce customer that really needs to have the highest level of performance and reliability.","And so, the pricing trends kind of differ by those customers. But as you can imagine, every customer, when they come up for renewal, they expect the price of technology to come down; the Web Performance product category is no different than that. But I'd say, it's a competitive area. It's not as competitive as Media, but it's certainly a competitive area, and it depends upon the customer profile.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And then just a follow-up, if I may. The multi-sourcing that has happened in the Media business over the last couple of years, have you seen that start to happen in the Performance business in some of the customer segments?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah, I think only in the low end. As Jim mentioned, where it's just basic delivery, you can see some there. But for a commerce company or a bank or anything like that, it doesn't technically make really sense to do multi-sourcing. If you're just sending out DOM objects, you could do multi-sourcing there. But when you're protecting or accelerating an app or a whole site, you don't tend to see that.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Colby Synesael with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co","Great. Thank you. Two questions, if I may. The first one is part of the review process that the company seems to have initiated sometime in the fourth quarter, are you considering or evaluating an outright sale of the entire company?","And then secondly, as it relates to M&A, you've historically focused on technology bolt-ons or tuck-ins. Is there an increasing focus to look at companies that had more of a go-to-market benefit for Akamai? It seems like you have really great products, but part of what you're lacking is the go-to-market to get into some of these institutions, and I'm wondering if that's something we could potentially see more of in 2018. Thank you.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yes, so of course, we don't comment on rumors. And so I'm not going to say anything there. Of course, our board always operates in the best interest of shareholders. We have a very professional and experienced board. In terms of your second question, yeah, as I talked about, we are investing in growing our go-to-market efforts, particularly around new customers and especially for the new Security products that we've talked about. So there is increased investment there. With M&A, I don't see that there's a fundamental change in our strategy in terms of the companies that we might buy going forward.","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","I think it's fair to say though, Tom, on the M&A front, Colby, that you're right. We have largely acquired companies with technology capabilities. But there were companies, Prolexic being one that did have go-to-market capabilities. So we've done both before. And you can expect in our M&A aspirations that we also look at companies in the M&A realm that can help us on the go-to-market side. But it has to be the right fit for the company, and it has to be the right kind of price point. But you can expect that we're looking at all those things.","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, yeah. Thanks. Yeah, good afternoon. My question is around the U.S. and the overseas operations Tom, and Jim, please join in as well, which is you're seeing strength in your international business versus U.S. Is the overseas strength sustainable? What's driving that? And anything you can do in terms of taking the overseas sales playbook and apply it back into the U.S.? Thank you.","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","No, it's a good question. As you can imagine, these large Internet Platform Customers reside in the U.S. And so they obviously weigh heavily on the U.S. growth rates. And so one of the reasons why you see lower growth rates in the U.S. than outside the U.S. is largely because of them.","Having said that, I think you're absolutely right that we've had very good success in our international markets and in our Asia-Pacific market in particular. And it's always things that our sales leaders are sharing with one another around plays that they've run that have been successful in their particular geography that potentially could work in the U.S., and there's (01:06:32) U.S. play that work \u2013 have worked well in Asia.","So, yes, we're doing that. But you have to be a little bit careful that it's not necessarily because international is growing faster than the U.S. that it's a matter of the U.S. sales force. It's really a matter of that's where the big Platform Customers reside. And if you pull them out, actually, the growth rates in the Americas are pretty good.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Dylan Haber with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Dylan Haber - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a strong quarter. Following up on the last question on international, in terms of the strength you saw in APAC, which markets drove that outperformance? Thanks.","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah. We've had strong growth in actually many other markets. We've had drawn strong growth in Australia. We've had strong growth in Japan. We've had strong growth in Singapore. So it's been pretty pervasive that we've had very good adoption of our technology in the Asia-Pacific market, both in the Media customer base and in the Web customer base. So, we're quite pleased with the execution in the Asia-Pacific market. I mean, I think the other markets are doing well. I think the \u2013 EMEA is also a market that's done pretty well. I think we called out Asia-Pacific because notably their growth rate is a little bit more. But we actually had a very good year in 2017 in our European markets as well.","Dylan Haber - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Will Power with Baird. Your line is now open.","Unknown Speaker","Hey, this is actually Charlie (01:08:11) on for Will. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask about the OTT impacts in the quarter and maybe specifically DIRECTV NOW, which has been growing subscribers at a healthy clip, how impactful was DIRECTV NOW specifically in the quarter? And maybe more generally, how should we think about OTT growth going forward in 2018? Thanks.","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","I mean, I can start and maybe Tom can offer any other color. As Tom commented on his prepared remarks that we had very strong growth in OTT with roughly 50% traffic growth with our video delivery customers, and so that's by far the fastest growing traffic area for our Media business. And we expect to continue to grow at a strong clip.","We don't comment specifically on customers, AT&T or DIRECTV NOW, other than to say that, obviously, they are customers and we have a good business relationship with them. But we really can't comment on specifically anything more noteworthy and relative to the broader trends. I think as Tom talked about that \u2013 we think OTT will continue to have continued, steady strong traffic growth rates in the near term. I think we believe as a company that longer term, there's a huge amount of traffic that's poised to move online. I don't think that's going to be the case in the 2018 fiscal year. I think you'll see steady growth in OTT, but it's a very large, long-term growth opportunity.","Unknown Speaker","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Brad Alan Zelnick - Credit Suisse","Wow, thanks very much for fitting me in, and congrats, guys, on a wonderful performance in Q4. My question for you, Jim, I appreciate that you mentioned in your remarks that the impact from ASC 606 wouldn't be material. But can you bridge us from ASC 606 guidance back to ASC 605 for comparison with Street models?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, it \u2013 literally, Brad, it's handfuls of millions of dollars that one of the reasons we have not provided what I wanted to be able to provide to you guys is an ability to give you a historical restatement of 2017, we have to get our auditors through that before we publish that. But it's very immaterial, Brad. It's \u2013 call it, it's less than 0.5% of revenue for the company. And it doesn't always go in one direction or the other. And so it's handfuls of millions of dollars in the first quarter and not really a notable impact, which is \u2013 I wanted to bring it up because I wanted you guys to know that it's coming. I also wanted to make sure you realize that it's not a material impact from the company's revenue or P&L results for either the quarter or the year.","Brad Alan Zelnick - Credit Suisse","So the commission expense, by deferring it, doesn't end up being a benefit? Do you factor that in...","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","No.","Brad Alan Zelnick - Credit Suisse","...or have an assumption baked into your guidance for it?","James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","No, we do. But again, it's not material. Because all that \u2013 not all of our commission spend is subject to the amortization. It's only the portion of our commission spend that is related to bookings. So our sales teams have revenue plans and they have bookings plans. And a heavy weighting of their commission plans is on revenue and sales reps that are on a revenue plan. The ASC 606 does not affect revenue plan. It only affects bookings-oriented plans. So it's a smaller percentage of our commission spend that's impacted by it.","Brad Alan Zelnick - Credit Suisse","Excellent. Very helpful (01:11:49).","Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Operator, I think we have \u2013 yeah, sorry about that, Brad. So, operator, we have time for, I think, two more questions.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeff Van Rhee with Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open.","Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Okay, great. I'll try to be brief with these two quick ones. Just you talked about the bit growth, referenced the fact that you've outperformed the market. Can you just be specific what did you see as the bit growth for the market, Q3, Q4? And any quantification you can give on share gains? So that's question one.","And then question two, with respect to Enterprise in particular, the go-to-market. You talked about the broader applicability of the products that was referenced to a lot of vertical markets that you might not have addressed previously. Does that suggest more material changes to go-to-market and sales structure going into the year?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Okay. So the published estimates of traffic growth on the Internet are around the mid-20s overall and they get into the 30s for video. So we compare quite favorably to that. In terms of the go-to-market, we do operate a overlay specialist team for the new Enterprise products. And that's an area that we'll be growing and looking at carefully as we head further into 2018.","Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Thank you.","Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Okay. Operator, we've time for one more.","Operator","Our last question is from Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Brandon Nispel - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks for taking the question, guys, and squeezing me in. I was hoping that you guys could comment on what looked to be competitive products to some of your core services. The first is Google Project AMP, and the second is AWS Lambda@Edge. And I'm just wondering, do you view these products as competing solutions to any of your core services?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Well, we have lots of competitors, including the major cloud service providers. So there's just a ton of competition out there. And we distinguish ourselves with the \u2013 our performance, our scale, our reliability, and our security. But there's \u2013 I think we track about 90 competitors across our various product lines.","Brandon Nispel - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And I guess, if I could just follow up. On the Enterprise launch, I guess, what gives you guys some of the confidence that you have in launching the Enterprise-type securities? It looks like Enterprise Application Access seems to be at least copied by at least one other competitor. It looks like Cloudflare put out a competing product in the quarter. So I was wondering if you could comment on that, too.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Yeah, sure. Enterprise Security is going to have a lot of players. You have all the existing companies that sell data center-based security devices that'll be looking to move into the cloud. You have some of the CDNs with some capabilities that are trying to, I would say, try to have some offers there. I think Akamai is really unique. And you look at our capabilities with Kona Site Defender, the massive scale we offer, the massive amount of data we have to be able to understand what's an attack, what's a human, what's a bot, what are the bad entities, we see a large fraction of all the transactions on the Internet. So we have a very good view as to which devices and which entities are doing bad things and which are normal users.","And that's stuff that \u2013 capabilities that Akamai uniquely has, because other companies don't have access to that traffic. So we're in a very good position to know what's good and what's not. And with Enterprise Application Access, the ability to marry that with Kona Site Defender gives incredible security for internal applications, does it very efficiently, at scale, very reliably, and doesn't impact your performance. So I think it's a very compelling and unique offer in the marketplace. Now that said, it's a huge market, and there'll be a lot of players out there trying to grab a share of it.","Brandon Nispel - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks, Tom.","Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","Okay, well, thank you...","Operator","(01:16:06)...","Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc.","...okay, and so I'll just pick it up, operator.

First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time.","[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And I would now like introduce your host for today's program, Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Tom Barth ","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Akamai's first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Benson, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.","Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on April 30, 2018. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances.","As a reminder, we'll be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of our website.","And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom.","Thomson Leighton","Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. Akamai delivered excellent results in the first quarter. Revenue was at record $669 million, up 11% over Q1 of last year. With strong performance across all sectors of the business. Q1 non-GAAP EPS was $0.79 per diluted share, up 22% year-over-year. This very strong result was driven by the acceleration in our revenue growth rate, the impact of the cost reductions that we made in the fourth quarter of last year and a lower tax rate.","EBITDA margins in Q1 improved to 38% and non-GAAP operating margins were 25%. We expect further improvements in margins by the end of the year impart because of the additional cost reduction actions that we took in Q1. And we're continuing our work to find a path to achieve non-GAAP operating margins of 30% in 2020, while also continuing to invest in the development of new products to fuel our future growth. ","Our security portfolio was again the fastest growing part of our business in Q1, with revenue of $149 million, up 36% over Q1 of last year. The strong growth of our security business was driven by our market leading Kona Site Defender and Prolexic Solutions, as well as our new Bot Manager Premier and Nominum Services. Each of these solutions has proven to be highly effective against some very large and sophisticated cyber-attacks.","For example in February, we used our Prolexic Solutions to defend one of our customers against what we believe to be the largest DDoS attack ever recorded deflecting more than 1.3 terabits per second of attack traffic. It's always hard to comprehend numbers this big. But to put it into context, 1.3 terabits per second of attack traffic is enough to overwhelm most data centers and internet service providers. And even many countries internet connections to the rest of the world. It's also more than double the amount of traffic we saw from Mirai IoT botnet attacks in late 2016.","In another example, a few weeks ago, we used our Bot Manager Premier and Kona Site Defender Solutions to defend a large ecommerce customer against one of the most sophisticated bot attacks that we've ever seen. In this case the attacker was attempting to buy out the site's entire inventory during a promotional sales event. So that they could later resale the merchandise at a higher price on the gray market. The attacker deployed a very large botnet to generate 800,000 transactions per minute more than 100 times normal. But Akamai was able to accurately detect and filter out the malicious transaction request and only allow legitimate users into the site to buy the merchandize.","Bot Manager Premier uses sophisticated AI and machine learning technology to analyze the motions and actions on the requesting device in order to distinguish between human neuromuscular signatures and machine generated requests. This technology is especially effective in floating bots that are trying to take over end user accounts.","At the recent RSA conference in San Francisco, a leader at one of the world's largest financial institutions told me that when they deployed Bot Manager Premier, the number of their accounts that were compromised by bots dropped from over 8,000 per month to just 1 or 2 per month, that's not 1,000 or 2,000 per month it's now literally just 1 or 2 compromised accounts per month. And that resulted in tens of millions of dollars in direct annual savings due to the decrease in fraud. As you might imagine they are a very happy Akamai customer.","It's because of such impactful capabilities that the financial services industry is one of our largest and fastest growing verticals. Probably over 500 financial institutions that we service over 400 use our security solutions, including all top 25 U.S. banks and 22 of the top 25 in Europe.","Another key differentiator of our security solutions is the enormous volume of data that we see on our platform. By analyzing and processing this data with advanced AI and machine learning algorithms, we can quickly identify malicious entities and then use that information to protect our customers from a wide variety of attacks.","For example, with the addition of Nominum, we now process 1.7 trillion domain name system or DNS queries per day for over 100 million domains. The DNS name space evolves quite rapidly, especially for domain that are associated with botnets and other malicious activity. On a typical day, we identify 5 million new core domains, many of which turn out to be malicious and we block access to over 1 million malicious domain every day. Thereby helping to keeping our customers and their end users safe.","Our suite of security solutions was an important contributor to the revenue on our web division. In Q1 web division customers generated $353 million in revenue, up 16% over Q1 of last year. Web division revenue was also driven by the continued success of our flagship Buyon [ph] Solution, along with our new Image Manager and Digital Performance Management Solutions. ","Across the company, we now have 1,000 customers using our new solutions. The revenue from these solutions in Q1 was more than triple the revenue from Q1 of last year and is now on a run rate of well over $100 million per year. Revenue for our Media and Carrier Division in Q1 was $316 million, up 6% over Q1 of last year. ","This much improved result is the consequence of the work we have been doing to improve our traffic share in the top 250 global media accounts. In fact traffic growth on the Akamai platform overall in Q1 accelerated over the already high rates that we saw in the second half of last year and it remains well beyond reported industry norms. The traffic growth in Q1 was especially strong in our OTT and gaming sectors.","Akamai has delivered several notable sporting events so far in 2018, including most all of the major sporting events online. In one of the most exciting Akamai set a record for concurrent views of a sporting event with our delivery of the Indian Premier Leagues Cricket match on April 25th. As the exclusive CDN for Hotstar, India\u2019s largest premium streaming platform. We delivered video to nearly 7 million concurrent viewers, 98% of whom were using mobile devices and 89% of whom connected through a cellular network.","We believe this is the model for the future, media companies relying on Akamai for secured delivery of high quality video streams to many millions and someday potentially billions of mobile devices around the world.","In summary, I am very pleased with our Q1 results, it was great to see the continued very strong performance of our security business, which now has a revenue run rate of $600 million per year. The much improved performance and growth of our Media and Carrier Division, the acceleration in revenue growth for the company overall, the improvement in margins and the very strong growth in the bottom-line. ","As I look to the future, I believe that Akamai has tremendous potential and that we\u2019re well positioned to capitalize on significant market opportunities in areas such as cloud security, mobile and web performance management, OTT video streaming and the internet of things.","We are continuing to invest in innovation and new capabilities to drive future revenue growth, while also having the discipline to effectively manage costs and our effort to further expand margins and profitability. We believe that our unique technology, unparalleled edge platform, strong relationships with the world\u2019s carriers and major enterprises, highly talented and hardworking employee base, strong corporate culture and our relentless and personalized attention to customers and partners all provide Akamai with a foundation for a very bright future that creates value for our shareholders, customers and employees.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jim, to review our financials and guidance for the year. Jim?","James Benson","Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I get into the highlights of our Q1 results, I want to start with three quick financial housekeeping reminders. First, as I mentioned on last quarter\u2019s call, we adopted the new revenue accounting standard ASC 606 effective Q1, 2018. We adopted ASC 606 on a full retrospective basis. So on today's financial results, all prior periods comply with the new rules.","And we told you in February, the new accounting standard dose not materially impact Akamai\u2019s historical or projected revenue and income statement. And for clarity on the modest impact of the changes, we've provided detailed reconciliations on the Investor Relations section of the Akamai website. ","The new standard primarily impacts revenue timing of a few license software customer contracts, a very small component of our revenue. And while immaterial on a full-year basis, the new standard may result in modest quarter-to-quarter revenue fluctuations. The new revenue standard also requires us to defer and amortize certain sales commission costs. And as I mentioned on our last call, our Q1 and full year 2018 guidance projections reflected the impact of the new revenue standard. ","The second housekeeping item pertain to some detailed revenue reporting disclosures. As we outlined in the last call, we are now reporting revenue under a two division customer-centric structure, Web Division and Media and Carrier Division. This divisional dimension is the primary lens through which we drive and report the business.","Finally, as we also told you in February, we will no longer be providing a solution category revenue view, because we no longer believe it is the useful measure in understanding our business performance. Especially with the growing overlap between some of our media delivery and web performance product portfolios.","We will provide additional visibility into areas of our business that we believe are important to understand as key drivers of our future growth, which is why, we will continue to breakout our Cloud Security Solutions.","Now, on to our strong Q1 results. As Tom outlined Akamai had a tremendous first quarter, exceeding the high-end of our guidance on revenues, operating margins and earnings. Q1 revenue came in well above the high-end of our guidance range at $669 million, up 11% year-over-year or 9% in constant currency. And up 11% in constant currency if you exclude the six large internet platform customers, an acceleration over Q4 levels.","Revenue growth was strong across the business. With the primary overachievement compared to guidance driven by higher media traffic volumes than we anticipated going into the quarter. We also continue to see rapid growth of our security products across both divisions.","Revenue from our Web Division customers was $353 million, up 16% year-over-year or 13% in constant currency. We remained pleased with the strong growth in this division and the expanded product and customer revenue diversification across the company. And our Web Division customers now represent roughly 53% of Akamai's overall revenue.","Within our Web Division, we continue to see strong uptake in our new product areas, namely Image Manager, Digital Performance Management and Bot Manager, as well as continued strong growth in our core Kona and Prolexic Cloud Security Solutions. ","First quarter revenue for total Cloud Security Solutions was $149 million, up 36% year-over-year or 32% in constant currency. Another tremendous quarter of revenue growth and customer adoption of our Cloud Security Solutions globally. Entering the second quarter, our rapidly growing cloud security business now has an annualized revenue run rate of over $600 million and represents over 22% of our total revenues.","As Tom mentioned, we believe security presents a tremendous growth opportunity for us and we plan to continue to invest in this area with a focus on further enhancing our product portfolio and extending our go-to-market capabilities.","Moving now to our Media and Carrier Division, revenue for this set of customers was $316 million in the quarter, up 6% year-over-year or 4% in constant currency. And up a healthy 8% in constant currency excluding the large Internet Platform Customers.","Revenue from the Internet Platform Customers was down from Q4 levels as expected, while revenue and traffic volumes in the rest of the division was strong across all geographies and industry verticals and significantly exceeds our expectations in the quarter.","Traffic growth accelerated for the third straight quarter and was particularly robust from our video delivery and gaming customers. And as Tom noted, we also had a number of notable sporty events in the quarter that contributed to the strong traffic and revenue growth, each event with record breaking online audiences.","As we\u2019ve highlights on the last several calls, our Media and Carrier division management team has been focused on capturing more traffic share and improving the quality of delivery for the top 250 media customers that account for most of our traffic and revenue. Because of these efforts, traffic growth accelerated and exceeded market growth rates in Q3, Q4 and Q1 and we are now beginning to see the associated revenue acceleration.","Moving onto our geographies, sales in our international markets represented 37% of total revenue in Q1, up 2 points from Q4 levels. International revenue was $245 million in the first quarter, up 22% year-over-year or 14% in constant currency, driven by continued strong growth in our Asia Pacific region.","Foreign exchange fluctuations had a positive impact on revenue of $17 million on a year-over-year basis and $7 million on a sequential basis. Revenue from our U.S. market was $423 million, up 6% year-over-year and up 9% excluding our large Internet Platform Customers, an acceleration from Q4 levels in our Media Division notably.","Moving onto costs, cash gross margin was 77% consistent with Q4 levels and in line with our guidance. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation was 65% consistent Q4 levels and also in line with our guidance. Non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $258 million, down $2 million from Q4 levels and about $7 million below our guidance, probably due to higher software capitalization rates and partly due to early traction from our operational efficiency efforts.","It is notable that we reduced operating expenses in the quarter, while at the same time absorbing the full quarter impact of the recent Nominum acquisition.","Moving now to profitability, adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $256 million, up $11 million from Q4 levels. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 38%, an improvement of 1 point from Q4 levels and 2 points above our guidance range, primarily due to strong revenue achievement and the accelerated traction in operational efficiency I just mentioned.","Non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $167 million, up $8 million from Q4 levels. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 25%, up 1 point from Q4 levels and 2 points above our guidance range. As our margin expansion in Q1 highlights our efficiency efforts have already positively impacted the P&L and we are working hard to drive further operating margin improvements.","Capital expenditures in Q1 excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense were $76 million or 11% of revenue. This was $6 million above our guidance for the quarter, due to higher capitalized engineering expenses and the acceleration of some network build out, given the stronger than expected traffic volumes.","Moving onto earnings, non-GAAP net income was $136 million or $0.79 of earnings per diluted share, $0.9 above the high end of our guidance range and driven by the combination of revenue performance, reduced operating expenses and a lower tax rate. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $35 million, based on a Q1 effective tax rate of 21%. This tax rate is a couple of points lower than our guidance due to a higher mix of foreign earnings.","Moving onto our GAAP earnings, there were a few large and noteworthy items excluded from our non-GAAP results, but impacting our Q1 GAAP results that I would like to provide some color on.","First, as we highlighted in our last call, we recorded an additional $15 million restructuring charge in Q1, bringing our total Q4 and Q1 restructuring charges to $66 million. These charges are related to headcount reductions, facility closures and capitalized software impairments and resulted from decisions to reprioritize certain investment areas that have not achieved the commercial success and return on investment we expected, notably in our Media and Carrier Division.","We implemented some of these actions in the middle of the fourth quarter and completed most of the remaining actions in the first quarter. It is important to note these restructuring actions were taken to enables from rebalancing of our investments, divesting in some areas, investing in others, with a goal of positioning the company to meet our long-term objectives of continued growth and scale.","The second noteworthy item, impacting our Q1 GAAP results was the decision to settle the long standing legal disputes with Limelight. The terms of the settlement include a roughly $15 million settlement fee paid over five quarterly installments, but recorded in full within our Q1 results. This settlement allow us to finally put these disputes and the associated costs and distraction behind us and instead focus most of our efforts on the strategic priorities in the business.","The last item impacting our Q1 GAAP results were some one-time financial and legal advisory services, related to the initiatives associated with our recent collaboration with one of our largest shareholders. Factoring in these various GAAP only items, GAAP net income for the first quarter was $54 million or $0.31 of earnings per diluted share.","Now I\u2019ll review our use of capital. We continue to focus on the importance of returning capital to our shareholders. During the quarter we spent $20 million in share repurchases, buying back roughly 300,000 shares. And just last month, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our current share repurchase authorization to $750 million, which we plan to utilize by the end of 2018.","Given our strong balance sheet and cash generation, beyond 2018 we intend to continue our share repurchase plan to offset solution from equity compensation plans and at times to opportunistically return more cash to shareholders depending upon business and market condition.","As always our overall aims to deploy our capital to achieve favorable return to our investors in a manner that we believe is in the long-term interest of the company and our shareholders. In summary, we are extremely pleased with the revenue acceleration and margin expansion we delivered in Q1 and our momentum exiting the quarter.","Moving now to guidance. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we are projecting another strong quarter on the top and bottom lines. We do expect some currency headwinds from the recent strengthening of the U.S dollar over the last couple of weeks. At current spot rates foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact on Q2 revenue of just over $2 million compared to Q1 levels.","Coming off a very strong first quarter for Media, from several large gaming releases and sporting events, combined with the foreign exchange headwinds, we are projecting Q2 revenue in the range of $658 million to $670 million. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of 77% and GAAP gross margins of 65%, consistent with Q1 levels.","Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $249 million to $254 million, down from first quarter levels as we see the full quarter benefits from our Q1 operational efficiency and restructuring actions. Factoring in the cash gross margin and operating expense expectations, we anticipate Q2 EBITDA margins of 39%, a 1 point increase from Q1 levels.","Moving now to depreciation. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $89 million to $92 million. Factoring in this depreciation guidance we expect non-GAAP operating margins of 25% to 26% for Q2, an increase of roughly 1 point from Q1 level. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.79 to $0.83. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of roughly $35 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of 20% to 21%.","This guidance also reflect a fully diluted share count of just over 172 million shares. On CapEx we expect to spend approximately $111 million to $116 million excluding equity compensation in the quarter. This spend is up over Q1 levels, as we expand our network capacity to support the traffic growth that we were expecting on the platform.","Looking to the full year, we are anticipating revenue of $2.69 billion to $2.72 billion and at the midpoint an increase of $20 million from our prior outlook. At these revenue levels, we anticipate EBITDA and non-GAAP operating margins of 39% and 25% respectively, an increase of 2 points from our prior outlook, driven by the revenue achievement and accelerated traction in our operational efficiency initiatives.","Factoring in these revenue and margin levels and an expected non-GAAP effective tax rate of 20% to 21%, we anticipate non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.15 to $3.25 for full year 2018 and at the midpoint an increase of $0.25 from our prior outlook. As a helpful reference, we will post our Q2 and full year 2018 guidance ranges on the Investor Relations section of our website after this call.","In closing, we are very bullish about the opportunities ahead for Akamai. We are confident in our ability to continue to innovate and add new capabilities to drive future revenue growth. While at the same time drive margin and earning expansion in 2018 and beyond, which we believe will add significant shareholder value over both the near-term and long-term.","We will be hosting our Annual Analyst Day on June 26th, at the Boston Cambridge Marriott Hotel. And we look forward to sharing more details about our business strategy, market opportunities, product vision and our work to find a path to achieving non-GAAP operating margins of 30% in 2020, while also continuing to invest in the development of new products and capabilities to fuel our future growth. If you can\u2019t join us live that will be webcast by the Akamai platform.","Thank you and Tom and I\u2019d take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets. Your question please?","Mark Mahaney ","Okay, great. Thanks. Just two numbers questions, please. At international growth rate adjusted of 14% that\u2019s solid, but that does show this deceleration over the last two years, I think on an adjusted basis like-for-like basis. So any color there on expectations going forward, were there any unusual items that may have depressed that growth rate? Any way to think about that going forward as to the international side.","And then the other numbers question has to do with this revenue from the internet platform customers of about $44 million. There may have been an expectations in the market that that would stabilize around $50 million, you want to talk about if that\u2019s stabilizing currently around these levels as a way to think about what that looks like over the next year or two? Thank you very much. ","James Benson","Sure, Mark. So the first on our international growth. I think we're pretty pleased with the international growth of 14%. You are right that that is lower than we saw on 2017. If you look at Q1 of 2017, we had very strong growth rates in Q1 of 2017 of 21%. So this is coming off of a difficult compare. But we expect that our international growth rates to remain kind of in the mid-teens growth rate. So I think we're pleased with international growth, there is nothing notable to comment there. I think we have strong growth in Asia Pacific. We\u2019ve had steady growth in our European markets as well and we expect that to continue.","And relative to the internet platform customers. You're right, last year, they were roughly $50 million a quarter. But if you recall, from Q4, 2016 to Q1 of 2017 they declined about $8 million. So they do normally decline sequentially from Q4 to Q1. And so declining from roughly $50 million in Q4 to $44 million was in line with our expectations. And we would expect that they'll probably hover in kind of the low and mid-40s throughout 2018.","Mark Mahaney ","Thank you, Jim. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your question please?","Keith Weiss ","Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and very nice quarter. I guess one top-line question and one kind of expense question. On the top-line, it sounds like you guys have really seen the volumes around OTT picking up and very strong and different growing Media traffic ahead of our expectations. Can you talk to us a little bit about the pricing side of the equation on how those kind of negotiations are taking place and sort of where pricing is firming out?","And then on the OpEx side, it sounds like we're most of the way through -- if I'm hearing it hearing most of the way through of executing the restructuring that you guys talked about in Q4 and into Q1. Am I thinking about that right if that\u2019s sort of most of the actions have already been taken. And if you can give us a little bit more detail in terms of where were you able to find sort of good expense reduction that weren't going to be impactful? And more areas like distribution off the table, do you -- are you comfortable that you saw the same kind of distribution capacity going into some of these newer markets?","James Benson","Sure, let me take that. So your first question around the pricing environment in the Media business. As we\u2019ve said for long time the pricing environment in the Media business remains very competitive, so that hasn't changed. It hasn\u2019t gotten kind of worse or better it's just a very, very competitive pricing environment with alternatives that are out there.","And as we mentioned that last year, we saw traffic growth slowing in the first half of 2017 we\u2019ve put a very consorted effort in place to go and drive strong traffic growth and work with customers to tuning contract structures and some of that was through a re-price and some of that was through just a more creative contract vehicle with them to drive more traffic share.","And we specifically signaled that at times it takes six to nine months from traffic growth accelerating to seeing revenue acceleration. And so what you saw in Q1 was exactly what we said was going to happen, which was we saw a traffic growth accelerate in Q3 and Q4 and now we're seeing the manifestation of that effort in revenue growth. So we feel pretty good about the progress that we're making in the Media Division.","And relative to OpEx, yes we took most of the actions were taken in Q4 and we finished the remaining actions or most of the remaining actions in Q1. But I wouldn't say that that is the end of our operational efficiency efforts that I would say that's the beginning of some of our efficiency efforts there is areas that we're going to drive that I will provide a little bit the more clarity on the upcoming Analysts Day and some of those include continued reductions in facilities. ","And then there is some areas that we are going to drive around third party vendor savings and then just driving broader efficiency actions in different areas of the business that we have talked about that we've always done a good job of driving costs out of the network we'll continue to do that.","So what you'll hear from me in June is I will outline kind of some of our ideas around what's the work we think we can drive to try to find a path back to operating margins of 30% and obviously it\u2019s going to be a glide path. But I would say we're very, very pleased with the traction that we made in Q1 you saw margin expansion, we haven't seen margin expansion for many quarters.","We are guiding to have margin expansion happen in Q2 and margin expansion for the full year. So we are pretty pleased with the progress that we're making both from a top-line and on efficiency to drive margin expansion.","Keith Weiss","Excellent, Thank you","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Olson from Piper Jaffray. Your question please. ","Michael Olson","Hey, good afternoon. I had two questions if I could, on the first one, I wanted to ask another on OTT maybe just slightly different from the previous question essentially is the OTT inflection point really starting to show itself now for Akamai\u2019s Media business or is it kind of still early days for OTT? ","And then second, with a more favorable environment for use of international cash, et cetera do you see Akamai getting more aggressive on the M&A front? And if so I'm sure you can't say specifically, but what kinds of add-ons from a high level could we expect you to be looking at? Thanks. ","Thomson Leighton","Yes, I don't think we've seen a huge inflection points in OTT traffic, I think there is strong and steady growth and as we talked about, we are certainly growing our market share there. We are growing at a much faster rate in terms of the traffic and that's impart because of the focus of the top 250 media customers impart because of the quality levels, we can deliver or impart because of our unique scale. So there is a lot of reasons for that, but I'd say it\u2019s early days compared to where this can ultimately go. ","In terms of M&A I will let Jim talk about the cash, but our approach to M&A I think is the same as it's been. We're interested in companies that have technology that we can embed in our platform, bring to bear for the benefit of our customers, may be an important product adjacency, for example Prolexic, Cyberfend is another example there. So the kinds of things that we've been doing in M&A I think is what you'd see us continue to do in the future and Jim would you like to talk about cash?","James Benson","Yes, I mean, we have $1.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet, we're a significant generator of free cash flow. So we have a strong balance sheet and a cash flow to be able to do M&A and you\u2019ve seen us do that. And as Tom said that those are areas we're going to continue to look at. And as far as our cash profile most of our cash is in the U.S. And so we're not in a fit position, where we have to repatriate a bunch of cash that\u2019s sitting offshore. Most of our cash is actually in the U.S.","I think we have roughly $200 million of cash offshore. So we're in a good position to continue to execute against the priorities of the business and M&A is certainly an area that we're going to be active in looking. And as we've seen and we have told you in the past we are active shoppers but disciplined buyers. We did two acquisitions in 2017 both product adjacency areas or one very much a product adjacency area and one kind of somewhat in our sweet spot with recursive DNS, but improving our security capability. So, you should expect that we're going to be continue to be active there.","Michael Olson","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Bhagavath from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.","Vijay Bhagavath ","Good afternoon, congratulations again from my end. My question to you Tom is, you do have live events that kind of perturb traffic mix and also growth rates as you know and then. So even if you look at the current results, how would you pass live versus non-live? And when I'm coming from is this helps us understand the sustainable growth rate in media delivery with or without live event? Thank you.","Thomson Leighton","Well, as we talked about before, live events when you have a lot of them can be helpful in boosting overall revenue, but the majority of OTT traffic and revenue is on demand and linear as a component there as well. So, live events are exciting, you see a lot of new technology there, you see the new traffic records take place there. They\u2019re very important to a lot of the big media companies, they generally trying Akamai there because of the scale and the quality in our help getting a really good event to take place. But the lion share of the revenue is the day-to-day, the video on demand. And that\u2019s an area we put a lot of effort into as well.","Vijay Bhagavath ","And my quick follow on would be on Enterprise Security, $100 million of Enterprise Security revenue, just for example, the reasonable target in terms of modeling. How would you look at enterprise security as contributing to your overall security business? Thank you.","Thomson Leighton","Well, as we talked about it's early days for our Enterprise Security products, their Enterprise Application Access and Enterprise Threat Protector. We think there is a very bright future for enterprise security offerings and for success it will be well beyond $100 million in revenue. We now are up to 100 customers, so very early days there. Very pleased to see the traction that our roadmap and viewpoint is having with customers around the notions of zero plus and future of enterprise networking and security. But still early days there, but optimistic in terms of the future. ","Vijay Bhagavath ","Perfect, congratulations again.","Thomson Leighton","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi from Wells Fargo. Your question please.","Siti Panigrahi ","Hey, thanks for taking my question. Just on the security side, that's pretty strong accelerate to 36%. Just wondering, how much was the contribution from Nominum in this quarter? And also when do you expect some kind of meaningful contribution from products like Enterprise Application Access, I mean the -- and Bot Manager? Or also like how much was the contribution from the Bot Manager? Just trying to understand the Prolexic and Kona versus the newer product contribution?","James Benson","Yes, we continue to have strong growth in call the core security business kind of excluding Nominum that we've been growing that in the high 20s and you kind of have a similar growth rate this quarter. Nominum was about $10 million I think of revenue in the quarter, we had a good Nominum quarter. So, Nominum was certainly a contributor.","But as Tom has talk about that, we're doing well in security across all of the product categories. So, we're doing well with Kona Site Defender, we're doing well with Prolexic and we're doing particularly well on some of the new product areas Bot Manager being one, Tom talked about it in the last call, talked about it again now that Bot Manager actually is becoming a meaningful contributor for revenue in the security business.","So, we're very bullish about the security business that I'd say the growth rates that we\u2019ve seen here, we think we can continue to grow the security business in the high 20s, low 30s for the reminder of the year. So, we're pretty bullish about the opportunities in security both this year and beyond.","Thomson Leighton","Let me just add. Nominum is important to us for beyond just the direct revenue and of course the carrier relationships. Because of Nominum, we now see an enormous number of the DNS transactions. And we're in a unique position to identify the botnets and malicious activities close to real-time.","And that's really useful for making our other security products where we're selling directly to enterprises be a lot stronger in terms of identifying malicious activities in particular Enterprise Threat Protector, which we can now leverage the data and the knowledge about the bad entities in Enterprise Threat Protector. So there is indirect benefits as well as it really as you go forward I think in cyber security the access to the data being able to process at a near real time we have the latest in AI and machine learning capabilities gives us a great leg up on potential competition.","Siti Panigrahi ","That\u2019s great color. Just a quick follow-up, how much was the SOASTA contribution this quarter in Q1?","Thomson Leighton","I mean, we are not going to -- we don\u2019t break those amounts separately that\u2019s SOASTA get sold across both of our divisions, I don\u2019t recall the exact amount for SOASTA. But I would say that across all of the new product areas SOASTA being one of them.","As Tom mentioned, the new product area that we\u2019ve launched within the last kind of 12 to 15 months now are well over $100 million annualize run rate. So we\u2019re very pleased with the innovation that you\u2019ve see in the company, some of it come through M&A, but a lot of it is come through just organic innovation that we\u2019ve driven that is now becoming a meaningful contributor to the Akamai revenue stream.","Siti Panigrahi ","Perfect, thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick from Credit Suisse. Your question please. ","Brad Zelnick","Excellent and congratulations on a great quarter guys. I think I have got one for Tom and one for Jim. For Tom, some of your smaller competitors just recently in the last quarter or so introduced the ability to run code at the network edge, is this something you need to offer to be competitive and how do you think about that opportunity? ","Thomson Leighton","Yes, we\u2019ve done that for a long time, really long time. Now as we -- and we continue to work in that area particularly as we support non-HTTP protocols, as we support containers at the edge for IoT, kinds of services. But that\u2019s not a new thing. I think some of the applications coming in IoT are pretty exciting that we\u2019ll probably talk more about that at the Investor Day. ","Brad Zelnick","Appreciate the perspective. And Jim, as we look at the actions that you took last year to capture more traffic share in Media, they are clearly paying off, you have now seen accelerated traffic growth the last few quarters. But how should we think about the duration of that benefit, you talk about a focus on the top 250 accounts, have all of those accounts been restructured and or is there still some way to go like that we get to a point where you anniversary the benefit. How do we think about the timing and duration benefit?","James Benson","Yes, I mean, you are always new on customer, I\u2019d say the majority of the customers that we thought to kind of reprice we have already done. We did in the back half of last year and a little bit in Q1. But you got to remember that what drives the Media business is traffic volumes. And so, yes, there is an element of anniversarying kind of agreements, but what you want to drive in the Media business, because the media is about traffic and price. So if you want the customer on the platform and you want the customer to push as much traffic volumes as possible. So do you that through giving them the price point and delivering the best performance and quality.","And so, by doing that, we believe we\u2019re in a good position, focusing on these top 250 customers and also focusing on maybe new emerging customers that we think are going to be big traffic pushers. And just making sure that again they have the right price point and they have the right contract structure in place. And we think the combination of those two things are going to allow the Media business to continue to grow.","Now as we\u2019ve said in the past the Media business is variable because the nature of traffic is variable. We had a good quarter this quarter, we had a good quarter in Q4 and in Q3. Some of this quarter it was stronger across the board, but some of this quarter as I mentioned, we had a very, very strong gaming quarter, there were some gaming releases in the quarter.","We had a very strong quarter as Tom mentioned around video delivery, some of that video delivery growth that was really strong came from these major sporting events that we mentioned. And while they are not by themselves a huge contributor to revenue, they do contribute especially large sporting events like the Olympics the last couple of week time period.","So, we are pretty bullish on the Media business, on a long-term if you look at this thing over a multiple kind of years, this has proven to be a consistent revenue contributor and we think that actually the recovery we have seen here and the focus that we have are going to continue to fuel growth in the Media business going forward.","Brad Zelnick","Thanks very much and congrats again.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sameet Sinha from B. Riley FBR. Your question please.","Sameet Sinha","Yes, thank you very much. I am going to have two questions here. So, first one, in terms of cost savings, Jim can you help us think about the initiatives that you put into place in Q4, Q1 you will obviously have some savings because you're not mitigating against Limelight anymore? And then also if you can add, one of the arrangements you had with your activist investor was to hire a consulting firm to look more into these. Can you help us think -- can you tell us whether you -- it\u2019s already been done where it's in the process or if they are in the process of kind of giving their recommendations?","And my second question is, you have spoken about OTT, gaming I guess sports is part of OTT or video. So this -- I think this should be a good growth driver for the next couple of years, can you help us think about long-term what other applications are used cases are there that can leverage your network so we can get a kind of good sense of what are the growth drivers longer term?","James Benson","Well, I will let Tom comment on the second one. But on the cost savings again kind of similar question to the gentleman that asked a few questions before, we took some action in Q4, we took some further actions in Q1 again the employee actions are largely behind us. The actions are certainly much, much more that though that there is actions we are taking around a bunch of different areas.","And I mentioned facilities being one, third-party vendor savings being another. We're going to continue to drive those areas, in additional to areas around driving more costs out of the network, being able to scale better on the network. And I would say relative to some of the announcements that we made in March with the settlement with Elliott that effectively what we talked about was that we were going to form a finance community for the company for the Board that was going to oversee the work we're trying to drive to find a path or see if we could find a path to drive operating margin to 30% in 2020.","One of those things was to identify see if we can get a third-party consultant to help us. We have already made a selection on the consultant they have not yet begun they're going to begin this month. And so the work and the progress that we've made to-date is largely been driven by the actions and initiatives we took, really beginning in Q4 continuing in Q1, I think the work that we're going to do going forward are what are the areas that we can be smart about driving and scaling the business without doing anything that doesn't impact revenue growth.","We want to make sure we're making the right investments in the business to fuel growth for the company. We have talked about a lot of areas already in the call, new product innovation areas that are fueling the growth for the company, making revenue much more diversified for the company, revenues much more diversified now by customers, it's much more diversified now by product. ","We think that's important for the long-term. And we're going to continue to make those investments, while we're trying to drive initiatives that drive scale for the business and we think we can do both.","Thomson Leighton","To your second question, we're just in the beginning with OTT and online gaming. We talk about some of these events that have still single-digit million concurrent viewers, tens of terabits a second of traffic, teens really. And those numbers can grow by one to two orders of magnitude so huge potential future growth there.","So it's not the kind of thing that I think about OTT and gaming I am saying okay, that\u2019s done. We're just at the very beginning there and there's a lot of innovation that still we are working on to be able to deliver at enormous scales and make that be affordable, make it be really high quality and secure.","In terms of things that are totally different and in the future, I think IoT is a very exciting area as billions of smart devices get connected probably not communicating using ATTP, but need to communicate you need real time command and control, data aggregation alerting these are things that Akamai is really good at. Having compute at the edge close to the device again something that Akamai is really good at. And we are probably be talking more about that at our Investor Day in June.","But that's an area that I think we have a great future in, but really, really early days and an area that we're investing in.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Tim Horan from Oppenheimer. Your question please.","Tim Horan","Thanks, guys. Two questions, on the cloud based real time multiplayer games, how well designed or equipped is your network to handle that? And do you have many competitors there? And then secondly, on the security side, maybe complicated question, but you have a bunch of security products, but is this the maybe half of the potential products that you could have in security or a quarter of the potential products. So just trying to get a sense of how much can you expand that portfolio of service offerings that you have in security side. Thanks.","Thomson Leighton","Sure. In the multiplayer game today with our gaming business the revenue is primarily derived from handling the software downloads and updates to the devices that's the large majority of the revenue. I think as you look to the future actually handling the metadata around the games is a very interesting challenge especially as this gets done more in the cloud and maybe less on individual devices, that\u2019s an area that we're certainly exploring.","Whether we've actually be delivering the video for a game where it\u2019s not being generated locally. I don't know we certainly have that capability that would come down to the economics. But all of the controller infrastructure associated and again this has to do with the Internet of Things as a whole. Gaming is one example of that that's an area where we've got I think a lot of value to add. ","In terms of the security products, I would say for defending websites and applications against denial of service attacks and application layer attacks we're really doing a great job there, pretty unique in being able to offer the end-to-end solution that really works. Now of course, the bad guys are always upping their game and that's I think why our Bot Management Solution is being so successful today. Because it really can stop the account takers. And that has enormous value to a lot of our customers. ","So there is a lot of work to keep up and doing that and staying ahead of the attackers. Now a whole new area where we're just entering is in the Enterprise Security. And that's blocking malware, protecting the enterprise, employees and data, it's enabling Enterprise Security in a world of zero trust, you just can't rely on your firewall anymore and you can't trust the entities inside the corporate network.","That is a transformation of enterprise networking and security that is just starting. And I think that is an enormous future market, you just see all the damage being caused today by the data breaches. Clearly, there is no end-to-end solution there today that really you can rely on or you wouldn't be having all these data breaches. And that's an area, that we think overtime, we can have a comprehensive solution.","Today, we're just in the first products to help combat that, it's an area we're making investments towards being able to really support an enterprise as they move beyond the traditional notion of a firewall and to protect them in a world of zero trust. And that has very large, I think a very large potential in market. ","Tim Horan","And just lastly on the clarify on the volumes. Are you back to kind of peak volume growth levels you were three, four years ago. Do you think you can get back there or maybe just a sense of where you all where be troughed out to where you were at peak a few years ago? Or kind of where you think that can go?","Thomson Leighton","You mean the traffic growth levels?","Tim Horan","Yes.","Thomson Leighton","Yes, no our traffic growth has accelerated substantially and is at a very strong cliff now and well ahead of other reports you can see about traffic growth. And especially in OTT, which is where we're putting a lot of effort. So I think we're very pleased to see our traffic growth rates.","Tim Horan","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Breen from William Blair. Your question please?","James Breen","Thanks for taking the question. Just can you talk about in terms of the growth in customer base? Is the growth coming from existing customers or are you adding new logos? And have you changed, how you go to market whether it's with the direct sales force or through channels that has helped in terms of the acceleration of revenue? Thanks. ","James Benson","Yes, I mean, I would say that you can -- most of the growth that we're seeing is from our existing customer base. We've made good progress on the new customer area. Actually from a new customer bookings perspective we actually had a strong quarter in the first quarter that I think we talked to you guys in the past that we've been tuning the go to market model to try to drive better new customer penetration. And I'd say early days just we're making some traction in that area, I think we have more work to do.","That\u2019s notable in our Web Division where generating new customers is really important to drive growth not just through expanding with existing customers, but landing new customers. And we announced I think it was maybe just a few weeks ago that we brought on a new leader for our Web Division to run sales Scott Lovett, who has tremendous experience in driving both new customer penetration as well as kind of land and expand models.","And so we are happy to have him as part of Akamai driving kind of the Web Division activities. And we are pretty bullish that we will make progress both in new customer penetration and in existing customer kind of penetration of our existing offerings.","James Breen","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your question please?","Heather Bellini","Hi. I just had a follow-up on the seasonality of the Media business, which the quarter saw much better seasonal trends than you normally see in a Q1. I guess, I'm wondering if you could share with us how we should think about the seasonality trends for this segment as the rest of the year shapes out. And how much of that uptick in better seasonality as a result of those fine tuning of the contracts that you mentioned? Thank you.","James Benson","Hey, good question. You're right, we actually had a great Q1 relative to kind of seasonal pattern, usually see seasonally Q4 to Q1 the Media business softens a bit. And I think all the efforts that we put in place over the last several quarters you're starting to see the benefit of that and you saw that manifest itself Q1. And that was including kind of the internet platform customers coming down. So very, very strong kind of results.","Now we talk about a lot of them that I think in general we have made good traction across all of our verticals, we had a particularly strong gaming quarter, I think as we talked about in the past the gaming releases don't happen linearly throughout the year. So we had a good gaming quarter in Q1, continued good quarter around OTT. For sure the sporting events did have some contribution. So is an element a Q1 that more sporting events happened this Q1 and typical, you don't have an Olympics every year that being maybe one example.","But as far as the seasonal patterns through the year, I think, you'll probably feel a little bit Q1 to Q2, maybe a little bit less seasonal that usually I think media grows sequentially Q1, Q2 pretty significantly, but because of the strong Q1 you won't see as much of that. The summer will be typical, you will see patterns in the summer where Media from Q2 to Q3 will kind of go down in volume just because there is less consumption of content in the summer months.","And then you'll see in Q4 a big uptick from Q3 to Q4 relative to the holiday season, the holiday season doesn't affect just commerce, but it also affects our Media business as well. So call it maybe a little bit less seasonal Q1 to Q2, typical seasonality Q2 to Q3 with it coming down and then a big Q4.","Heather Bellini","And then just a follow-up, is the World Cup a bigger revenue event for you guys than the Olympics typically? ","James Benson","No, no, it isn't. And actually the World Cup straddles Heather over two quarters. And so. it\u2019s actually the funny part of it is it all depends upon the team to be very frank as far as viewing and who is winning. And so to some extent it depends upon that, but it is -- it doesn't drive the same level of traffic volumes, it does as part of the international markets in particular they tend to be bigger consumers of the World Cup in the U.S. market.","And so you'll see that a bit, but it is -- it doesn't have the same impact to say in Olympics.","Heather Bellini","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Your question please.","Sterling Auty","Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. Back to the platform customer contribution in the quarter the down 14%, was any of that exacerbated by contract renewals? And are we kind of freeing clear of those for the time being?","James Benson","Well, we're always renewing customers and we did renew our largest customer in the first quarter and they've been contracted now another two years. And so the good news is that our largest customer is now secure on the Akamai platform for the next two years. And I think the other piece of it is revenue came in pretty much in line with what we expected, we expected Q4 to Q1 to come down. And as I said we expect this customer base to be in the low to mid-40s for the remainder of the year.","Sterling Auty","Alright, great. And then you talked about the other actions that you're looking to go forward and complete. How do we think about how those savings layer in? Because I imagine some of them are international, some of them are domestic, and probably all those come out at once. So what should we think about in terms of the pace of those savings getting layered into the expense lines?","James Benson","So you're talking about -- they are not expense savings. I mean, as you can imagine every quarter is a bit unique, that some quarter you have more events when I say events internal events. It could be an Edge Conference or customer conference or a customer conference. So spending is initially linear. But I think what you can expect is that we're going to drive or try to drive operating margin expansion between now and the end of the year.","So I think maybe by the end of the year Q4, we'll probably be at our peak operating margins for the year. Some of that is due to the fact that Q4 has an uptick in revenue from Q3 to Q4. And then I think again, I'll outline more of this in late June when we have our Analyst Day that getting back to 30% margins or striving to get back to 30% margins by 2020 is going to happen overtime.","And it's not just linear like every quarter progresses up. You might have -- it might pop a point a quarter and then it flat lines or it may be goes down. But I think you're going to see the general trajectory of operating margins expand from 2017 to 2018 from 2018 to 2019 and then 2019 to 2020. And we're going to work like how to try to find a path to find 30% margin by 2020.","Sterling Auty","Great, thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits from Raymond James. Your question please?","Michael Turits","Hey guys. I'd like to come back to Enterprise Security both on the product side and on the go to market side. First of all on the product side, Tom, you mentioned Network Security where you don\u2019t have that much going on right now. I was wondering if you can drill down on that especially around Secure Web Gateway, which I believe is something that you've acquired a few years ago and lately we've had a company on security come public there is scalar so very high profile. Plus more specifically on Network Security and Secure Web Gateway.","And then a little bit more on go-to-market. since that's not a place where you have a traditional channel. What do you need to do in order to really effectively go-to-market in that very, very different kind of a product area?","Thomson Leighton","Yes. So ,we have today Enterprise Application Access and Enterprise Threat Protector, the next version of Enterprise Threat Protector will incorporate Secure Web Gateway functionality and strengthening that. And I think the foundation of the zero trust model to Protect Enterprise is that starts with Enterprise Application Access where the access to the internal application by the employee or the consultant would come through Akamai.","And then we layer on top of that products like Kona Site Defender and Bot Manager for that matter. So that we apply the same level of defenses to your internal apps from your internal employees as you would for an external app that clearly is a subject to attack by any entity. And that's based on the belief that today the bad guys can get around pretty much any of the traditional enterprise defenses.","Now in terms of go-to-market it's one of the reasons we're so excited to have Scot Lovett, join us to run our global web sales is that he has got a lot of experience in selling a wide variety of security products both from McAfee and from Cisco. And he's engaging very quickly there and I'm excited about his ability to help us in terms of helping establish that industry. It's very early days in the next generation of Enterprise Security, and I think he'll be a great leader in going into market there.","Michael Turits","Great, thanks. And great quarter. ","Thomson Leighton","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kvaal from Nomura Instinet. Your question please?","Jeff Kvaal","Yes, thank you. Two questions I think, one is would you mind refreshing us on where you are in the security attach rates to your Enterprise business the performance business? And where you think that may take us in the next few quarters or years?","James Benson","Yes, well our security attach rates now for the company across all customers is around a little bit less than 40%. And so there are a long way to go now that wasn't that long ago I would tell you that number was 20% to 25%. So, we're continuing to make steady progress in security attach rate. ","It's also important to note that when we talk about attach rate, that's attaching at least one security product. And as we talked about on this call, our security products are growing a number. And so, it's not just about attaching one security product, now it's even for customers of the 40% that are buying security is not -- there is only a smaller percentage of them that are buying multiple security products.","And so, the good news is we can sell more security products to our customers that already buy securities and there are a lot of customers that we don't -- that are already in the install base that haven\u2019t bought a security product.","Not to mention, the ability to sell security outside of the installed base of our customers. And so we can continue to drive both expand rates within our existing customers and new customer attach rates. So, I think it'll continue to be our largest growing and fastest growing product category for the company. It'll probably grow in call the high 20s, low 30s this year I think it will continue to be again a 20s grower for the company for the near future.","Jeff Kvaal","Okay, thank you. And then secondly there has been a lot of highly purposive weakness in linear video subscriptions at some of the cable companies and other satellite firms. How correlated do you think the performance of those subscriptions, subscriptions declined, declines our with your own Media business?","Thomson Leighton","Well, obviously the more people that are subscribing and watching video online are the greater potential market for Akamai. And we have a large share of that market. So, our business as we\u2019ve talk about is rapidly growing in terms of overall traffic and now growing in terms of revenue. But the more video subscriptions there are, the better that is generally speaking for Akamai.","Jeff Kvaal","Do you see that right away or is that spread that over a few quarters? How does that relationship work?","Thomson Leighton","I think pretty near-term as people subscribe and start watching traffic would flow across our platform and for carrying it and often we are. And then we'd be billing for that traffic as it flow. So, I would say it's very close correlation in terms of people watching and ultimate revenue to Akamai.","Jeff Kvaal","Thank you both very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Van Rhee from Craig-Hallum. Your question please.","Jeff Van Rhee ","Great. Just one for me guys, first congrats on the quarter, just looks great across the board. On the CapEx front, are you came in a little heavier this quarter you certainly guiding to some pretty meaningful CapEx. Just spend a minute and talk about how you think about maybe the year? And in particular just sort of your visibility and your through process you put together the CapEx plan for the forward quarter and the forward year. How much can you see, how do you see and how much is a leap of phase based on sort of higher level modeling that you might do? Just a little visibility there would help.","Thomson Leighton","It's a good question, I mean just to remind folks, that obviously of our CapEx that our CapEx is in three areas, there is network CapEx, which I think is what you are talking about. Then there is capitalized software and there is other CapEx for say facilities in IT. We spent about 17% of revenue, 16% to 17% of revenue on CapEx. Call it 6% of that is network CapEx, roughly 7% is capitalize software and the reminder facilities in IT.","But on the network CapEx front, as I mentioned in my kind of prepared remarks that we did kind of spend a little bit more than we had guided in Q1 and that was very purposeful. And it was purposeful because you saw we had a great media quarter. And what we did was we began more CapEx purchases in the quarter. I guided to Q2 that you'll see that that step up in CapEx in Q2. And you can expect that we\u2019ll continue to build out for the reminder of the year. We'll stay within the call the 16% or 17% of revenue number. So, for the full year our CapEx will be about 16% or 17%. ","And the way we think about network CapEx, we've reasonable visibility given the efforts that we've done and on the top 250 customers, call it within a range. And what we try to do is we're going to try to build out the network support the higher end of a range that you expect to have from those customers, so that you can make sure you have to pass through the available for them. ","And that's the way we've done it, and that's the way we'll continue to do it, which means we should probably be within -- and those ranges are roughly where we've been historically call it somewhere between 15% and 17% of revenue, and that's probably we\u2019ll be this year.","Jeff Van Rhee ","And I guess just to follow on that in long-term as you see your business evolving certainly with the enterprise push as well as the strengthen in security. Is there anything inherent in the structure of the business going forward that you think drives that CapEx number higher or lower if we look over sort of intermediate to long-term?","Thomson Leighton","Yes, I think the intermediate term we are going to stay probably in the 15% to 17% range. That's about what I except that it actually may have given all the innovation we're doing actually might even see a bit of an uptick in capitalized software. You might see it balancing it a little bit in network. And one thing is probably important to note and I will talk about this more at the Investor Summit, but we're building out or will be building out a new corporate headquarters here in Cambridge.","And so you'll see some onetime CapEx here later in 2018 and much more notably in 2019 as a result of building out the headquarters. But I\u2019d say in general 15% to 17% of revenues is what you'd expect for CapEx.","Jeff Van Rhee ","Got it, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Will Power from Baird. Your question please.","Will Power","Great, thanks. Nice job on the margins in the quarter. I guess question is as you look forward, with 38% EBITDA margin in Q1, guiding to 39% in Q2, is there any reason that wouldn\u2019t continue to uptick in Q3 and Q4 I think for a previous question you've referenced some deposit leverage in Q4 and I guess what I'm getting as built on your 39% for the year could be conservative. So just trying to understand kind of the second half outlook?","James Benson","As I mentioned, it is in the straight line as far as every quarter that it just is going tick up. I think the third quarter in particular will potentially be a more difficult quarter for the company. It is a quarter that the company's does a seasonal kind of salary increase for its employee. And so you'll see a natural lift and standing from Q2 to Q3, let me go through that.","And so, I think that 39% EBITDA, 25% operating margins, felt about right for us. I would say if we've tracking more to 26%, which is the high of our range in Q2, might you be able to round for the full year to 26% maybe. I'd say that I don't -- I think we're more comfortable guidance to 39% EBITDA or 25% operating margin. We don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves here that it is -- like I say it isn\u2019t quite it grows a point every quarter just doesn\u2019t quite work that way. ","But I think we're confident that by the end of the year, you'll be exiting at the highest operating margin level for the company. And you\u2019ll have that going into 2019 and then we have work to do in 2019 as well.","Will Power","Okay. ","Tom Barth","Operator we have time for one more -- sorry about that, we've time for one more question operator.","Operator","Okay. [Operator Instructions] And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would like to turn the program back to Tom Barth.","Tom Barth","Thank you, Jonathan. In closing we'll be presenting at several investor conferences in May and June and as Tom and Jim have mentioned holding our Analysts Day here in Cambridge on June 26th. Details of these can be found on the Investor Relations section of akamai.com.

Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Tom Barth","Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining Akamai's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Ed McGowan, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer. ","Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to material differently from those expressed or implied by such statements. ","Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on February 11, 2020. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. ","As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the Financial portion of the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. ","And with that, let me please turn the call over to Tom.","Thomson Leighton","Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. Akamai delivered excellent results in the fourth quarter. Revenue was $772 million, up 8% over Q4 in 2018 and up 9% in constant currency. This very strong result was driven by the continued rapid growth of our security business, a better-than-expected holiday commerce season and substantial increases in traffic for our media customers. Our non-GAAP operating margin in Q4 was 29%, up 1 point over Q4 in 2018. Q4 non-GAAP EPS was $1.23 per diluted share, up 15% year-over-year and up 16% in constant currency. These excellent results were due to our strong revenue growth, the benefit from cost reductions made over the past year and a lower tax rate. ","For the full year, we exceeded our projections on both the top and bottom lines. Revenue was $2.89 billion, up 8% over the prior year in constant currency. We're especially pleased to report that we expanded non-GAAP operating margin to 29% in 2019, up substantially from 24% in 2017 and putting us very close to our target of 30% operating margin in 2020. Non-GAAP EPS for 2019 was $4.49, up $0.87 or 24% over 2018. We generated $1.1 billion in cash from operations last year. ","In Q4, our Security portfolio continued to be the fastest-growing part of our business, with revenue of $238 million, up a very strong 29% year-over-year in constant currency. Security revenue for the year was $849 million and represented 29% of our total revenue in 2019. We believe that our Security business is poised to make Akamai one of the very few publicly traded companies that generate more than $1 billion in annual revenue from cybersecurity solutions. In 2019, over 1,500 enterprises relied on our market-leading Kona Site Defender and Bot Manager solutions to defend against more than 46 billion malicious log-in attempts and 6 billion web application attacks, an increase of 150% over 2018. Both these services continue to be recognized as best-in-class by the leading analyst firms. ","For example, last quarter, and for the second year in a row, Akamai was named as a leader in Gartner's report on critical capabilities for cloud web application firewall services and we received the highest scores in 2 key use cases. Just last month, Forrester named Akamai as a leader in its New Wave Bot Management competitive vendor evaluation. They said, Akamai leads the pack with robust attack response and reporting capabilities, and they called us the best fit for companies looking to thwart bots at the edge. That's important because we believe that the edge is the only place where you can successfully defend against large-scale bot attacks. ","Last quarter, Forrester also elevated Akamai to the leaders category in its Zero Trust eXtended platform wave, awarding us the highest possible scores in 5 areas, including workforce security, zero trust vision and strategy. I'm especially excited about our continued innovation in cybersecurity, which has resulted in the development of several new products that will leverage the strength of our edge platform and that we believe can drive continuing growth going forward. These new products include Secure Web Gateway, Identity Cloud, Enterprise Defender, Multi-Factor Authentication and Page Integrity Manager. ","Page Integrity Manager addresses a new and rapidly growing attack that most organizations have no visibility into or defenses for, leaving them exposed to data breaches and regulatory actions. The challenge is that most of the content on a typical website or app today comes from third-party software or scripts for things like ads, analytics, social media and so on. The problem with third-party content is that it's hard to keep track of and to make sure that it's safe. And increasingly, it's not safe. That's because attackers have figured out that they don't have to steal personal information directly from the website. Instead, they steal it from end users by using malware that they've inserted into the third-party content. ","Akamai Page Integrity Manager is designed to protect our customers' users from malware, no matter where it comes from, and also to alert our customers when we find malware on their site or on sites that they link to. Initial customer interest in this new service has been very high, and we're looking forward to exiting beta and selling this product more widely later in the year. ","Our Media and Carrier Division also performed well in the fourth quarter due to strong demand for OTT video services and software and gaming downloads. In Q4, we continued to grow traffic on our platform much faster than published growth rates for the Internet as a whole, meaning that we continue to gain traffic share. And on December 3, we set an incredible record for peak traffic in 2019 of 121 terabits per second, demonstrating the enormous and unmatched scale of the Akamai Edge platform. ","This record didn't last long though, as we've already delivered more traffic on multiple occasions during the first 5 weeks of 2020. In fact, I checked our traffic stats just a few minutes ago, and it looks like we're currently delivering about 140 terabits per second from the Akamai Edge platform. ","It's important to note that these traffic levels are not like the theoretical capacity that some competitors in the marketplace claim. Our numbers measure the actual traffic that we deliver on behalf of our customers. It's also important to realize that the only way to really get anywhere close to Akamai's scale is by having a true edge platform. That's because you need to be very close to end users in order to gain access to the last-mile bandwidth necessary to deliver large amounts of traffic with great performance. If you try to deliver content from the data centers at the core of the Internet, you run into problems with performance and scale as the traffic gets clogged at Internet peering points before it reaches the last mile. ","Delivering from the core is also more costly since you need to use expensive transit to reach end users. This is one reason why Akamai is so much more profitable than the competition. Of course, all the growing interest in the edge has led many vendors to play up any connection they can make to the edge, no matter how tenuous. But we believe that if you look carefully, you'll see that the others have a ton of catching up to do to match what Akamai has been doing at the edge and doing profitably for a very long time. We're excited by the opportunities in front of us as the OTT marketplace continues to develop, and we believe that our unmatched global capacity positions Akamai very well for 2020 and beyond. ","Overall, we're very pleased with our performance last year. We grew revenue and continued to expand our margins. We grew non-GAAP EPS by 24%. We developed innovative new technology that we believe will help drive future revenue growth, and we delivered excellent value to our customers. I want to thank all of Akamai's customers and especially our talented employees for helping us to deliver such great results in 2019. ","As we enter a new decade, I'm very pleased to see Akamai so well positioned for future growth. As you'll soon hear from Ed, we expect to surpass $3 billion in revenue in 2020, with over $1 billion of that total coming from our Security business. We also expect to achieve non-GAAP operating margin of 30%, and our non-GAAP EPS is projected to approach $5 per share. These are exciting new thresholds for Akamai, and I'll now turn the call over to Ed to provide further details. Ed?","Edward McGowan","Thank you, Tom. As Tom outlined, Akamai delivered another great quarter in Q4. We exceeded the high end of our guidance range on revenue and earnings. Q4 revenue was $772 million, up 8% year-over-year or 9% in constant currency, driven by continued strong security growth and higher-than-expected holiday traffic in our media and commerce verticals. ","As I mentioned on our last call, holiday seasonality from e-commerce and traffic from our large media customers could play a large role in our Q4 performance, and it did. Revenue from our Web Division was $420 million, up 9% year-over-year and 9% in constant currency. Revenue growth from this group of customers was again driven by our Security business as well as higher-than-expected holiday e-commerce traffic. ","Revenue from our Media and Carrier Division was $353 million, up 8% year-over-year and 8% in constant currency. The better-than-expected growth in Media came mainly from strong OTT video traffic. Revenue from our Internet platform customers was $52 million, up 20% from the prior year. It is worth noting that Q4 benefited from approximately $6 million of event-specific revenue that we do not expect to reoccur in Q1. Security revenue across the company continued to be very strong, and for the fourth quarter, was $238 million, up 29% year-over-year and 29% in constant currency. ","Moving on to revenue by geography, international revenue was $326 million in the fourth quarter, up 17% year-over-year or 18% in constant currency. Foreign exchange fluctuations had very little impact on revenue on a sequential basis, but had a negative impact of $3 million on a year-over-year basis. Sales in our international markets represented 42% of total revenue, up 3 points from Q4 2018 and consistent with Q3 levels. Finally, revenue from our U.S. market was $446 million, up 3% year-over-year. ","Moving now to costs. Cash gross margin was 78%, roughly flat with Q3 levels but down 1 point from the same period last year. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 67%, up 2 points from Q3 levels. Non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $285 million, up from Q3 levels and slightly higher than our guidance due primarily to higher commissions and employee bonus expense. ","Now moving on to profitability. Adjusted EBITDA was $319 million, up $18 million from Q3 and up 6% from the same period in 2018. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 41%, in line with our guidance but down 1 point from Q3 and down 1 point from Q4 in 2018. ","Non-GAAP operating income was $222 million, up $14 million from Q3 levels and up $21 million or 10% from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 29%, consistent with Q3 levels and up 1 point from Q4 last year. Capital expenditures in Q4, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $173 million. This was higher than our guidance range due to increased network investment in anticipation of continued demand from our OTT and gaming customers. ","Moving on to earnings. It is worth noting that our Q4 GAAP results include a $10 million restructuring charge, and we expect to record an additional restructuring charge of approximately $4 million to $7 million in Q1 of 2020. These charges are primarily related to reductions of approximately 1% of our global workforce. It is important to note, these restructuring actions are being taken to enable some rebalancing of our investments, de-investing in some areas and investing in others and to position the company to meet our long-term goals of continued growth and scale. Also included in our restructuring charges are some small capitalized software impairments related to projects we no longer feel provide adequate return on our investment. Therefore, GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $119 million or $0.73 of earnings per diluted share. ","Non-GAAP net income was $202 million or $1.23 of earnings per diluted share, up 15% year-over-year, up 16% in constant currency and $0.08 above the high end of our guidance range. This outperformance was driven by higher-than-expected revenue and a lower non-GAAP effective tax rate due to higher-than-expected foreign earnings. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $30 million based on a Q4 effective tax rate of 13%. ","Now I will discuss some balance sheet items. We continue to have a very strong balance sheet. As of December 31, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $2.4 billion. Our total debt at the end of Q4 was $2.3 billion, unchanged from the end of Q3. ","Now I will review our use of capital. During the fourth quarter, we spent $43 million to repurchase shares, buying back approximately 500,000 shares. We have approximately $765 million remaining on our previously announced share repurchase authorization. Our plan for 2020 is to continue to leverage our share buyback program to fully offset dilution resulting from equity compensation. ","As we said in prior quarters, we plan to remain active but disciplined in pursuing additional M&A, and we believe that our strong balance sheet provides us with strategic flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they arise. We also believe our capital allocation approach will allow us to continue to drive shareholder value through investing organically in the business, pursuing M&A and continued share repurchases. In summary, we are very pleased with our Q4 and 2019 results, and we remain confident in our ability to execute on our plans in 2020 and for the long term. ","I'd now like to provide guidance for full year 2020 as well as for the first quarter. Looking ahead to the full year, we expect revenue in the range of $3.055 billion to $3.105 billion, with over $1 billion of that coming from our Security business. ","We expect adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 43%, and we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 30%. We expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $4.80 to $4.95. This represents year-over-year growth of 7% to 10% and 9% to 12% on a constant currency basis. This non-GAAP earnings guidance is based on a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 15.5% to 16.5% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 164 million shares. ","Moving on to CapEx. Full year CapEx is expected to be 18% to 20% of revenue. We again expect full year CapEx to be higher than normal due to the continued investment in our network capacity. ","Before I move on to Q1 guidance, I thought it would be helpful to talk about how we see the year unfolding. Now I will highlight some key items that you may want to think about as you build your models. In the first quarter, we typically see revenue step down sequentially as Q4 is our strongest seasonal quarter. Q4 2019 was a notably strong seasonal quarter. It also included some onetime event revenue, which I mentioned earlier. ","On the expense side, remember that Q1, our employee payroll taxes and 401(k) matching expense reset, costs that will decline throughout the year. In addition, we won't see the full benefit of the restructuring efforts mentioned earlier until Q2. So we expect operating margins to be at the lowest level in Q1 and improved throughout the year. ","As we look to Q2 and beyond, there are a few other factors to take into account. In addition to more global expansion of existing OTT offerings that have been announced for later this year, we are aware of several new direct-to-consumer OTT launches planned for late spring and early summer. 2020 also includes a summer Olympics in Q3 as well as the U.S. presidential election cycle, which typically drives elevated traffic levels in Q3 and Q4. Finally, we expect Q4 to once again be our strongest seasonal quarter. ","So with that as a guide, I will provide specific Q1 guidance. We are projecting Q1 revenue in the range of $741 million to $755 million or up 6% to 8% in constant currency over Q1 2019. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative $1 million impact on Q1 revenue compared to Q4 levels and having negative $5 million impact on a year-over-year basis. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of 77%. ","Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $258 million to $262 million. The decrease in cost over Q4 levels is due mostly to lower incentive compensation-related expenses. Factoring in the cash gross margin and operating expense expectations I just provided, we anticipate Q1 EBITDA margins of approximately 42%. Moving now to depreciation. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $97 million to $99 million, and we expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 29% for Q1. ","Moving on to CapEx. We expect to spend approximately $139 million to $149 million, excluding equity compensation in the first quarter. This reflects the continued network investments I mentioned previously. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q1 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.13 to $1.18 or up 5% to 9% in constant currency. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of approximately $35 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 16%. And it also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 164 million shares. ","In summary, we are very pleased with our business performance and with our positioning as we look forward to 2020. Thank you. Tom and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. ","Sterling Auty","So looking at the strength in international revenue growth, is it fair to look at the OTT launches as relying on Akamai more for international distribution versus U.S.? Or what else explains the real strength internationally?","Edward McGowan","Store, this is Ed. I'll take that one. So I'll answer it in two ways. First is the -- we record the revenue where the customer is based. So to the extent that there's a U.S. customer that has a launch, that would be considered U.S. revenue. But you bring up a really good point. As these folks start to look internationally, we tend to get a greater share of that traffic as our international deployment is much greater than anyone. ","On the international revenue growth, we're seeing very, very strong growth. If you remember a couple of years ago, we made significant investments in our go-to-market capabilities and also our network that we're seeing great traction, especially in Asia Pacific. And we recently closed on our acquisition with Exceda and expect to see some decent growth down there as well as that's sort of an underserved market.","Sterling Auty","Okay. And then maybe one follow-up, Tom, for you. Looking at some of the newer security, specifically SWG and Identity Cloud, how should we think about the ramp of those solutions within your Security portfolio in context of that $1 billion-plus revenue guidance for 2010.","Thomson Leighton","Yes, it's early days for both. We're just launching the Secure Web Gateway. That will be part of Enterprise Threat Protector 3.0. We're really excited about that market. But early days, and we're just starting to get the bookings now. So for that to be a major contributor, you're looking at 2021, 2022. Identity Cloud met plan this year, and that's already, because of an acquisition, further along. And we're excited about the potential there in terms of privacy, regulation compliance. As you know, we've now got CCPA in effect in California. Other states are looking to put laws into place. GDPR, of course, in Europe. And I think enterprises are going to be looking for help in dealing with that. So we're optimistic about the future growth there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Gutman with Guggenheim.","Robert Gutman","From the segment breakout of cloud versus CDN, it seems like, from our perspective, the CDN really outperformed in the quarter. So I guess some of that was attributable -- you said there's $6 million of large Internet platform stuff, specific events. But can you talk with a little more clarity about the additional outperformance in the quarter, a little more specifically?","Edward McGowan","Yes, sure. This is Ed. I look at it through two lenses. One, we talked about on the web side, the commerce traffic was much higher than we thought going into the quarter with the Thanksgiving holiday falling as late as it possibly could and fewer shopping days. We were expecting to see a little bit less traffic, we actually saw more. So we're very happy with that. ","And then on the media side, we saw a strong OTT traffic. We saw that, as you mentioned, with the Internet platforms, that event-specific revenue certainly helped. We also saw a very strong live sports, especially across Europe. APJ did a lot better than we had expected in terms of traffic. A good gaming quarter. Software downloads were strong as well as new devices come online. There's a lot of firmware updates and things like that. And just to sort of put it in context for you, the last week of the year was exceptionally strong. On our normal traffic pattern, we tend to see our highest traffic levels on Sundays on a recurring basis. We tend sometimes could be 15% to 20% higher than we normally see during the week. ","And between the day before Christmas and New Year's eve, we saw what I would refer to as eight Sundays in terms of elevated traffic, which is something that we typically don't see. So a lot of factors that came into play here, both in our Web business as well as our Media business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of James Fish with Piper Sandler.","James Fish","Congrats on an awesome end of the year and success around the new OTT service launches. I guess, first, how are you thinking about enterprise security investments to get stand-alone security sales really moving in 2020 and beyond.","Thomson Leighton","Yes. So we have both on the product and product support side and go-to-market with sales specialists and experts in making enterprise security sales, a lot of attention on that. We saw a substantial increase in revenue and bookings this year. Still relatively small, given the early days for Zero Trust and some of the new products that we're bringing out now in enterprise security. And of course, as you know, our head of web sales is an expert in selling enterprise security services. So we've got a lot of expertise there and there's significant investment because we'd like to see that business really ramp up. And I think there's good potential for that.","James Fish","Got it. And then how do you plan on positioning the -- specifically the Secure Web Gateway in that market, given you do have a larger -- a large competitor out there that's doing fairly well as well as some of the firewall vendors trying to move into the proxy market.","Thomson Leighton","Yes, that's business we want to go out and get. And I think there's a lot of greenfield as well. Those -- in terms of the cloud solution provider for Secure Web Gateway, pretty small total revenue, relatively speaking, to what could be. And I think we're going to have a very competitive offer. And when you combine it with the rest of Akamai Security business, we're the larger player out there. We're well known, we're trusted. We have 1,500 major enterprises using Kona Site Defender already. And in some sense, this is a very natural partner to that to now protect the enterprise employee and the enterprise apps from importing malware, just as we protect the public-facing websites from attacks from the outside. So a lot of synergy with what we are the market leader at, and we have a lot of trust among the major enterprise CSOs out there and the buyers of functionality like Secure Web Gateway. So I am optimistic about our future there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.","Keith Weiss","As we think about these investments you guys are making to sort of build out capacity and be able to handle the growing OTT traffic, I was wondering if I get kind of your perspective on the durability of these OTT revenues over time. As some of these services become bigger and bigger, is there a risk that these will start to sort of go more in-house in Akamai and then the services are going to be more of a transitory step for these OTT companies? Or do you believe that this could be kind of a durable good revenue for you guys over an extended period of time?","Edward McGowan","Keith, this is Ed. Good question. Right now, I would say, certainly, in the near term, it looks like it's a nice durable revenue stream for us. I'd encourage you to look at the platform customers. Obviously, we had good stabilization and growth there and it shows that even in the DIY world, there's still a place for Akamai and especially as these folks start to look to go global, that's a big opportunity for us. And it's possible you could see some of these folks take some of the delivery in-house themselves. But just in general, most of the OTT folks out there today are going multi-CDN and I think that there's going to be a place for us. I don't think all of them will go DIY. It's possible that none of them do. But if they do, I think there's still a big place for us.","Thomson Leighton","At the end of the day, our goal is to do a better job with quality. We've got incredible scale. And also, we've got a great cost profile, which is unique. And so I think we have a compelling value proposition. And even to the extent folks do some DIY already, we're working in an environment with traffic splitting, as Ed said. And going all DIY is incredibly risky for a business. You have no fail over, it's not their core expertise. And I don't think it makes a lot of sense for these folks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of James Breen with William Blair.","James Breen","Just one, can you just give us a little more color on the OTT space and how that sort of manifests itself that you've seen so far in the numbers from a ramp-up perspective as these guys circle launch more, we'll see some more this spring. And how the multi CDN strategy might work? Is there a primary and secondary? Is it sort of -- is the traffic end of being split amongst 2 or 3 people? That would be a lot of help. And then just as we progress through the year, a little bit of color sort of on the margin progression as well. And then obviously, there's the Olympics, right, in December. So how does that impact the business as we've seen in past years?","Edward McGowan","Okay. Thought I'd get some help if I didn't get to all of them here. So I'll start with the last one. You talked about margin progression. I made some comments earlier that Q1, I believe where you'll see the lowest operating margin for the year and then it will trend up, and we guided to 30%. In terms of the multi-CDN environment, I would say, today, most big video players and most large software distributors do have a multi-CDN strategy and it can vary. In some cases, we'll do 80%, 90%. In some cases, we might do 25%. Usually, what we find is, as the needs for, say in gaming, capacity becomes a much bigger requirement, we tend to get a lot more share. We get a lot more share when we perform better. We get a lot more share as companies look to expand outside the U.S. It's a lot harder to build out capacity and drive your cost down outside the U.S. where bandwidth is more expensive. And a lot of those folks will look to us to take additional share. ","And in terms of how these things ramp, typically, when you see a launch, you'll see a lot of promotion around initial launch, a big spike in traffic, then it sort of levels off. Depending on promotions and things like that, you'll see traffic kind of go up and down, depending on various promotions as well as different types of content. Certain shows are more popular than others, et cetera. And then as they expand outside of -- into new markets, that also is another big jump in traffic. ","I think you also asked about the Olympics. That will be in Q3. We talked about sort of the revenue progression as you think about how we go from Q1 into the back half of the year. The back half of the year will be -- you'll start to see a step-up in revenue as we get into a strong Q3 with the Olympics as well as the beginning of the election, and some OTT launches. And then Q4 is obviously our strongest seasonal quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Will Power with Baird.","William Power","Yes, just a couple of quick questions. So great to see the continued security strength. I wonder if you could give us any further breakdown as to the sources of the upside there, a 29% growth between Bot Manager, WAF, DDoS? And then as you think about the guidance for 2020, I think you said you expected to see -- exceed $1 billion of revenue. I guess that leaves a lot to interpretation. But that would imply maybe something closer to low 20s. How should we think about that trajectory? Does it really drop that much, or is mid 20s kind of a good place to be for growth?","Thomson Leighton","Yes. So we're seeing very strong growth in WAF, DDoS, Bot Manager and also our managed security services. The security attack landscape is moving so fast and the adversaries are so capable that more and more leading enterprises are turning to us for our services support. And as we talked about on, I think it was the last call that all of these businesses are now more than $100 million a year for us, and that's what's driving the bulk of the dollar growth right now. And behind that, we have the newer products that we talked about. I listed the 5 of them coming to market -- have come to market in the last year or are coming to market. And I don't think they'll drive a ton of the growth next year, but that's what keeps the growth going I think beyond next year. We'll see upside. And if the products really take off, for example, Page Integrity, we could see some revenue that starts helping the growth by the end of the year, but those are really to keep it sustained over the longer haul. Ed, do you want to add?","Edward McGowan","Yes. So we didn't provide specific guidance, but obviously, if you get to exceed over $1 billion and you're about the 20% range, I think that's probably a decent place to peg the models for now. And if you recall last year, we started the year thinking we'd do it in the mid-20s and ended up at 30%. So I was just pegging it in the 20% range, and we'll continue to update you as we go. ","There's still a lot of room to go in our installed base. Only 55% of our customers today buy security products. That's up about 7% from last year. So there's still a long way to go. And only 28% of our customers are buying two or more. So a lot of room in the installed base and a lot of our new security sales of customers are being led by security first.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson with Needham.","Alexander Henderson","I was hoping to ask a little bit of a question around the pricing environment, particularly as we've moved volumes out of the monolithic web 2.0 customers into the splintering of a lot of smaller customers, but still relative scale. Are you seeing some benefit from the relative pricing between those 2 as that movement happens? And then along the same lines, how do we think about the initial scramble among the various players to try to get share? Has pricing been more aggressive because of that, less aggressive? What are you seeing on the pricing front?","Edward McGowan","Yes, so this is Ed. I'll take that one. I've said this in the past that the pricing market, the pricing for high-volume media tends to be pretty efficient, and really, it's volume that drives it. And in terms of the pricing environment, I haven't seen people get super aggressive in terms of anything that's outside the norm when it comes to grabbing share. And I would say, at this point, customers are really more interested in the quality than the price because the pricing right now, and there's not a ton of differential between the different players at certain volumes, it really just comes down performance in terms of share.","Alexander Henderson","Great. And just sort of follow-up on that would be, obviously, there's a parsing of traffic share out based on various geographies, various cities and the like. Over time, I would think that there will be a reshuffling as people either deliver good service. You guys deliver high-quality service, somebody else might stumble. How long a process does that take? Is it a quarter or two? Or is it much faster than that, if there's quality issues?","Edward McGowan","Well, it depends. I mean, a lot of times, you can see share shifts immediately. It depends on how the customers actually load balancing traffic. We've had instances where, in the last couple of quarters, in particular, where some of our competitors have stumbled and had significant trouble and we'll see a big shift of traffic move over to us. In some cases, that will stay for the long term. In some cases, as the company who's had trouble fixes their trouble, it will move back. But it can be pretty quick. And I can tell you that a lot of these media customers have gotten pretty sophisticated in terms of how they're looking at quality, and there's a lot of different metrics that they measure. And you're absolutely right. To the extent that somebody is struggling in a particular city, it could be in a particular city on a particular operator network or with a particular device type, where they'll shift share depending on who's performing better based on all sorts of different metrics that they're looking at.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James.","Michael Turits","Congrats on the good quarter. First, on the onetime event, could you tell us anything more about the general nature of it. I mean, frequently, you talk about 1 at a time events not having that big an impact. And was it in the IP platform group because they had obviously had a big bump.","Edward McGowan","Yes, Michael, this is Ed. Yes, they were in the IP platform. Obviously, there's not a lot of customers that sort of want to get too specific. But in general, event-driven revenue sometimes can be for our large-scale launches or big video events, et cetera, where customers will come to us for a variety of different reasons. In some cases, it's for services or security or for capacity or for delivery. So just kind of think about it in that light that it's for specific events that we were asked to help out a couple of customers, and we're happy to do it, and we're always looking for that type of business. But you're right. I mean, if you look at it in the grand scheme of things, $6 million on a $772 million quarter is not all that material. But certainly, a good business, and we're always happy to take it.","Michael Turits","And then I wanted to ask you about margins. Obviously, you haven't given any guidance beyond the 30% EBIT. But what are the puts and takes? And how do you think about it strategically at that point? There are so many interesting places that you could invest that would hit the income statement, especially on the security side. So how do you think strategically about that balance?","Thomson Leighton","Yes. So we haven't -- we're not going to give guidance for 2021 or beyond at this point. And we're focused on the 30% for this year. And we always want to be as efficient as we can. And it's across the board in decreasing the cost to serve traffic from our servers through better software. We had a lot of people working on that. It's being efficient with where we allocate our headcount dollars. It's efficient in terms of our procurement functions. So that's always a focus, and we're going to do as well as we can do. Now you're right, there can be trade-offs. We're making significant investments in the business. Obviously, CapEx to increase our scale advantage over the competition on a global basis. We're making a lot of investments in innovation, particularly in the security product area. As I mentioned before, the landscape there moves so quickly, and we're in a great position, but we want to stay ahead with the development of new capabilities there. And so as we see opportunities, we do make investments to keep revenue growth being strong and hopefully make it better over time. And there's a balance. We want to be fiscally responsible. We proved we can do that. We've already grown our operating margin by 5 points over the last 2 to 3 years, and we'll take the step with another point this year. At the same time, it's really important for us to be investing in innovation or new products to drive future growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Brad Zelnick","I wanted to ask sort of a follow-up to Alex Henderson's question, but really more from a different perspective. As we see the investments that you're making in capacity, I wanted to ask more about your views on capacity in the overall market and how that's informed pricing across the industry. So as you look at capacity across the industry today in your own plans, how do you view the level of capacity available in the market compared to demand?","Edward McGowan","Hey, Brad, this is Ed. Yes, that's a good question. I would say that Tom just talked about hitting a peak of 140 terabits per second today. That's becoming more of a norm. It seems that on Tuesdays tends to be the day that you see lots of software and gaming releases. And it's more and more players now are having much, much bigger needs in terms of these big spikes in capacity, and our day-to-day traffic continues to rise. I talked about that Sunday phenomenon. I would say that our customers certainly are getting a lot more nervous about capacity and talking to us way in advance of these, whether it's a new launch or going into a new geography. And certainly, when they're doing new games, picking up the phone and talking to us about the concern about capacity. You've got folks spending hundreds of millions of dollars on rights for sporting events and hitting new peaks every year. So it is becoming a bit of a premium here. Now does it translate into per gigabyte pricing? Not always, no. But in some cases, you can get capacity reservation fees, where you can guarantee somebody a block of capacity. And customers are, in some cases, willing to pay for that.","Brad Zelnick","Excellent. And if I could just follow-up with one on security. Any color that you can offer on your success selling security outside of your existing customer base? And perhaps if you can touch on the impact that your carrier partners are having on the security business this quarter, and any insight that you might have to what you're expecting out of them in 2020.","Thomson Leighton","Yes. Obviously, most of our security revenue, as we talk about products like WAF and Bot Manager, which tend to be sold to our traditional base. DDoS prevention, particularly the Prolexic capabilities, can go more broadly. Anybody operating a data center that has critical capabilities and that's connected, they got to worry about DDoS attacks and so we do pick up an expanded base there. I think going forward, the enterprise capabilities, the Secure Web Gateway, Multi-Factor Authentication, Enterprise Defender, that brings us into a whole new scope of potential customers and verticals that we don't service a lot today. And that's one reason you're really excited about the enterprise security business as a component. Mentioned the carrier side, we do have great relationships, as I probably know, with the world's major carriers, pretty much all of them. And we have developed security products that we make available to them on a white label basis. And that's where they would then go and attack the small and medium business market. We talked about last time on the call, our SPS service, which is a version of sort of a lower end of our enterprise security, Enterprise Threat Protector solution. But the carriers sell it under their own brand and they go live with it. And that's a great model for us. We don't even touch the customer there, but it generates growing revenue. So we do work with the carriers closely around our security solutions. Some of them also resell our regular enterprise-class solutions as well.","Edward McGowan","Yes. And just to add on that, what you asked about, Brad, just on the impact for the quarter. There's one thing just to highlight that we did -- similar to last year, we had some licensed pull-ins from Q1 about $3 million or $4 million of security license sales to the carriers that were expected to hit in Q1, that hit in Q4. So just keep that in mind as you're modeling out the security business in Q1.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Caroline on for Heather. So given your acquisitions of Janrain and KryptCo, do you guys feel like you have a complete product set to be competitive in the identity and zero trust market? who and do you typically compete against in those markets?","Thomson Leighton","Yes, I think we do. And in fact, we've been named as the leader there, if you look at the Forrester Magic Quadrant. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the leader in our Zero Trust strategy. So I think we're really excited about it. And it's not just Janrain and KryptCo, but now Secure Web Gateway being added to Enterprise Threat Protector, Enterprise Application Access, which take you through out of the world where you're getting network layer access, which is leading to so many of the data breaches and now access is being controlled at the app layer. And once it's -- a customer is using that, then we can actually apply our services like Kona Site Defender to scrub all traffic from \"trusted devices\" that are internal to make sure they're not spreading malware because it's so easy to get malware onto a device. You don't want it to spread within an enterprise. And you want to make sure that the enterprise is an exfiltrating sensitive data to botnets. And those are the capabilities we bring to market now with Enterprise Defender. And I think Janrain and KryptCo add to that and make it even stronger.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. That's helpful. And then just really quickly on the Internet platform customers. Could you remind us of who the big Internet platform customers are that might tend to drive some upside surprise? And then how should we think about that revenue line trending going forward? Like should we expect it to be growing positively year-over-year versus in prior years where it was declining?","Edward McGowan","Yes. So this is Ed. I'll take that question. So in terms of the way to think about the model going forward, obviously, with these customers, there are 6 of them and we have renewals from time to time. So I would sort of model that out at about $40 million a quarter roughly. We'll be looking for upside, obviously, as we go, but that's probably a decent place to put a mark in the sand. And in terms of the customers, it's the giant Internet platforms, it's Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Amazon and Netflix is in that group of customers.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tim Horan with Oppenheimer.","Timothy Horan","Tom, it's kind of interesting how you have such peaks in utilization of the network in Sundays and Tuesdays and different days of the week. Is there ways to kind of smooth that utilization out? Because, essentially, it's almost 0 marginal cost -- the networks there and you're not using it all that much. And I guess, with some of these new products that you have on enterprise and security, do they leverage the network in unique ways so that you can have unique products and services versus anyone out there?","Thomson Leighton","Yes. So surely, you have two questions there. And the second one on how does security mesh with the platform in getting leverage. That's a great question because we get fantastic leverage of our edge platform with security. The same servers and equipment and bandwidth and colo that's used to deliver these fabulous amounts of traffic, that same infrastructure and expense is used to absorb these gigantic attacks. And Akamai is unique in being able to absorb and defend against these giant attacks. And that's because we have fabulous amounts of capacity. So we get great financial leverage and infrastructure leverage with our edge network. And also, the edge is really important, as we've talked about, for delivering traffic. If you're not at the edge, you don't get access to the bandwidth that you need to give high-performance delivery of video or software. And being at the edge is where you need to be to absorb all the attack traffic right as it's coming on to the Internet. If you wait and try to do it at the data center, you're going to get overwhelmed and it doesn't work. ","So really strong leverage there. Now in terms of the network peaks, they're not -- it's not wildly different. I look at it now and you look at our traffic charge, and the minimum at night, on the least day of the week, is sort of what the peak was across the entire platform a couple of years ago. So it's not huge differences in the peaks and the troughs. And you can never make it totally flat because it's our customers that are driving that. And when they want to distribute a new game and they want everybody to get it quick or there's a live event, or you've got people home at night watching their OTT, well, we got to supply the capacity for that. ","So I don't think you'll ever see a world where it's exactly the same amount of traffic every hour of the day or every day of the week. But we're in pretty good shape there when you look at the traffic plots.","Timothy Horan","Great. And how unique do you think your infrastructure still is at this point? I mean, there's a lot of people building CDNs and said they have CDNs, a lot of the hyperscalers building out CDNs. Just any thoughts on what you're seeing out there?","Thomson Leighton","Yes, we are very unique. And you can see it in so many ways. Part of the uniqueness is that we really are an edge platform. Now these days, edge has become a buzzword. And so everybody says they're an edge network. It's just not true. And the way you can measure that is how many distinct locations do they have servers. And we're in 4,000 places. We're in 1,000 different cities. We're in over 1,500 networks. Nobody gets anywhere close to that. And so that's one way we're unique. You can also see it in the scale of our business, the traffic levels that we're serving. You can see it in the security business. Who's out there with our kind of security revenue in a real cloud service. ","You can't find really anything close to that. And it's because, again, of the edge platform and all the technology we built on top of it. Now you're right. There's a lot of CDNs. More and more, there's dozens of CDNs around the world. But they are tiny in comparison in terms of what they can do. And I think you have to look beyond the marketing, the buzzwords, to see what are they really doing? What are they really capable of? What are the -- where are their servers really located. And also take a hard look at the financials. Are they profitable, or are they trying to buy some revenue? Do they have a scalable model that some day really is going to be profitable? And I think it really is important to take a close look because there's just a lot of hype, and a lot of buzz and some big IPOs, and it's not real. We are unique.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Michael on for Colby. How should we be thinking about the level of M&A you could do while still being able to achieve your 30% operating margin target?","Thomson Leighton","Yes, our plan is to achieve 30% this year. And we're always looking for good acquisitions that can help us provide more value to our customers and to grow revenue. And of course, we're very disciplined buyers. So it's not that we're doing a lot of deals and we're very careful before we do larger deals. And as we look at the year ahead, we expect to do some deals, and we expect to hit 30% operating margins.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc.","Brandon Nispel","Great. One for Ed, one for Tom. I think, Ed, what are really the puts and takes in your guidance for 2020, does it specifically embed that you capture a certain percentage of traffic from new OTT services? And then maybe for Tom, along those lines, how are you going to measure the company's success in what seems to be a growing OTT market?","Edward McGowan","The first one. So we included in our guidance that we will participate in a lot of the OTT services that are coming to market, and some that are expanding. It's really hard to call how successful these will be. I mean, we have conversations with the customers. We know what their plans are. We make sure we build our capacity to be able to capture as much of the traffic that we can. But it really does come down to end consumer demand. It comes down to hours watched, how active the subscribers are, comes down to bit rate. So really hard to tell, but we've got some models from the past that we use and try to leverage. But you really don't know until you get a few months under your belt exactly how big and successful these will be. But we do the best we can to try to bake in an assumption for a good level of success.","Thomson Leighton","Yes. Yes. And to your second question, obviously, we measure success in terms of revenue, margin and profit and the growth of those metrics and at a different level. And strategically, we measure it in terms of share, scale, performance and reliability. And our goal is to grow our share, have even more massive scale to be -- continue our reliability. I think already today, we're the go-to player, if you ask any of the big OTT guys. And we want to grow that further. And we are making investments, and you see it in the CapEx. For example, you don't see it as easily in terms of the OpEx and the salaries of the people that are working on making the performance even better and the reliability even better because we're making the bet that OTT usage is going to grow a lot over the next several years. And then as that happens, we want to capture a lot of that on Akamai and to do it profitably. We worry a lot about cost, making our CapEx be a lot more cost-efficient to run, to get a lot more bits per second out of each dollar of CPU. So strategically, it's about increasing our capacity, reliability, scale and share with the goal of generating more revenue, profit and, of course, margins.","Brandon Nispel","And maybe if I could just follow-up on Ed's comments. Ed, it sounds like you are definitely including traffic from some new OTT services. Does your expectation include that you capture what would be your typical video traffic share in the market or something more or less than that?","Edward McGowan","Yes, I think I would say it's the typical share that were expected. But obviously, we're going to do our best to get as much as we can. But in terms of modeling perspective, you just put in what you think is a normal share based on the various customers.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rishi Jaluria with D.A. Davidson.","Rishi Jaluria","Quick, quick ones. One for Tom, one for Ed. Tom, on the -- I just wanted to maybe get your perspective, Janrain's about a year since you closed the acquisition. I wanted to get a sense for how it's performed relative to your expectations and how you're thinking about that product as a driver within your Security business. And just some questions on margins. I wanted to understand -- you clearly saw a lot of strength in OTT and internationally, want to understand what the -- maybe gross margin implications of both of those are as they become an increasing mix shift?","Thomson Leighton","Yes, this is Tom. I'll take the first one. Yes, we made our revenue plan on Janrain this year. We're doing well with the integration. I think as we look forward, we're excited about the potential for helping major enterprises comply with the increasing and more diverse regulations that are being passed. A lot of our customers do business across many states and countries. And it's harder and harder for them, with largely their homegrown solutions, to keep up with compliance. Now that's a new industry, really. And so that will take some time to develop. But I think has exciting potential for the future. And Ed, do you want to take the margin?","Edward McGowan","Yes, sure. So in terms of margins, obviously, the OTT media business is a lower margin than, say, our Security business. So as the mix shifts, you can get a slight movement. I think we're -- we talked about being down about 1 point year-on-year, but I think it's really more in the round. And then in terms of international, one of the things that we did several years ago that was really smart is we made a significant investment in our carrier relationships. And Tom talked about being in thousands of locations and thousands of cities around the world. By having so much traffic, we feel -- we provide a lot of value to the carriers. So we get generally very favorable economics in some of the hard-to-reach places that tend to be really expensive. So the margin internationally, in most places, is pretty decent for us. So again, just the way to think about it is your media business is going to be slightly lower on the gross margin line, your security business is going to offset that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lee Krowl with B. Riley FBR.","Lee Krowl","Great. Hats off on the good execution. Two quick questions. Just from a multi-CDN approach. Geographically speaking, with the rollout of some of these OTT streaming launches, just given your guidance of scale relative to your competitors, do you kind of anticipate that with your scale, you could perhaps garner more share as some of these services go internationally, just based on your ability to execute and provide capacity where perhaps your peers cannot?","Thomson Leighton","Yes, that is the plan. And that's what we've been talking about is to leverage our massive edge platform that exists all around the world. We're in 1,000 different cities and several of these OTT businesses are global in nature. And so it is our goal to leverage the scale and the performance and our reliability that's established there to gain share.","Edward McGowan","Yes, so just to add a little bit here, like I said, we spent a lot of time investing with our relationships with the carriers around the world. And there are some really challenging places to build out capacity. Latin America, in particular, is one that's very challenging. And we see outsized share in countries like the Philippines, Indonesia, across the Middle East and India, again, areas that are a little bit harder for some of our competitors to get to. And also, it requires an investment in people to be able to go out, establish those relationships and build out the capacity. So I think we're very smart in our approach in terms of our investments, and we're continuing to invest, and a lot of what we're doing with our CapEx is we're building more and more capacity outside the U.S.","Lee Krowl","Got it. And then just a second question, more of a housekeeping question. But are there any anticipated major renewals in 2020?","Edward McGowan","So there's always going to be lots of renewals throughout the year. And -- but I did last quarter, I'll do this last year, excuse me, and I'll do again this year, is I'll call out if there's anything going into a quarter that needs to be highlighted but we've factored that into our guidance.","Thomson Leighton","Yes. And one of the nice things is that we're much more diverse in our customer base now. We don't have customers that account for 10% or more of our revenue. In fact, you take the giants there, and they're all like 2% or 3% at most. So there's much less impact to our business now if a giant customer has a major repricing.","Tom Barth","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Van Rhee with Craig-Hallum.","Jeffrey Van Rhee","Great. Just maybe two quick ones for me. First, on the network utilization, how is the target utilization rate changed over the last 3 years with respect to the overall network utilization? And I think of that, particularly in light of multi-CDN, our switching strategy is becoming easier. And then the second question, shift gears over to sales, if you would. And I'm just curious, going into '20, how did you tweak the comp or sales structure approaches? Namely what particular behaviors, new behaviors did you try to incent? Looking for what changed there.","Thomson Leighton","Yes. I don't know that there's a fundamental change in network utilization strategy. I think there is -- we do, as Ed mentioned, in many cases, get reservation fees. The capacity on the Akamai platform is enormous, but it's not infinite. And we want customers to understand that if they may need to have large amounts of capacity, we need to have that conversation upfront and plan for it. And it doesn't -- we're not just going to sit and not have traffic and all of a sudden take it because somebody else falls over. And so I think with almost all the major customers out there, we have a very strong relationship. We have a large fraction of the traffic, and we have an understanding of what more we might take in the event they have problems with other vendors, if they're doing traffic splitting. Ed, do you want to talk about the sales comp?","Edward McGowan","Yes, on the sales compensation, there's really no major change this year. We had talked about two years ago, we have made some big changes in the media world to help them focus on gaining share and selling security. But in terms of the tweak we're making to the comp plans this year, there's nothing really major to call out.","Tom Barth","Thank you, Jeff. In closing, we will be presenting at several investor conferences and events throughout the rest of the first quarter. Details of these can be found on the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. We want to thank you for joining us, and have a wonderful evening.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator instructions] And as a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Tom Barth","Thank you, Candice. And good afternoon and thank you all for joining Akamai's first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Ed McGowan, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, these statements including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.","Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the Company's view on April 30, 2019. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances.","As a reminder, we'll be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of akamai.com.","And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom.","Thomson Leighton","Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. Akamai delivered excellent results in the first quarter with revenue, margins and earnings all coming in above expectation. Revenue was $707 million, up 6% over Q1 of 2018 and up 8% in constant currency. Q1 non-GAAP EPS was $1.10 per diluted share up 39% year-over-year and up 42% in constant currency.","The revenue over achievement was driven by the continued rapid growth of our Cloud Security business and very strong traffic growth from our media customers. Our earnings also benefited from a lower tax rate and our continued focus on operational excellence. Our EBITDA margin in Q1 was 42% up four points over Q1 of last year and our non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 30% up two points from the prior quarter and up five points over Q1 of 2018. We were very pleased to see our margins improved for the sixth consecutive quarter.","As you can clearly see from our strong financial results, we've made excellent progress towards our goal of achieving non-GAAP operating margins of 30% in 2020, while also continuing to invest in innovation, new products and acquisitions to drive our future growth. Our security portfolio continued to be the fastest growing part of our business and Q1 achieving revenue of $190 million up 29% year-over-year in constant currency and Bot Manager continued to be our fastest selling new product in recent memory with nearly 400 customers now under contract.","Bot Manager uses sophisticated AI and machine learning to distinguish between human neuromuscular signatures and machine generated requests. This technology is especially effective in floating bots that are trying to take over end user accounts and commit fraud across a range of consumer facing applications such as apparel sales, event ticket sales, travel reservations and gaming and streaming services.","Our success in the cybersecurity space was widely recognized in Q1 when we were named as the winner of nine industry award. For example, our flagship Kona Site Defender Service won the award for Best Web Application Solution at the recent RSA Conference. And a well-known security buyer's guide announced that they will honor our new enterprise application access service as the best enterprise secure access solution and the best security solution for retail at their upcoming awards event in June.","While it's gratifying to receive such accolades, we do not intend to slow down or rest on our laurels. In January, we closed our acquisition of Janrain, a market leader in the customer and identity access management space. Using their technology we've created the Akamai identity cloud, a new service which is designed to help customers stop credential abuse and account fraud, manage and protect consumer data and comply with regional data regulations.","Last quarter, we also announced our new joint venture with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group of Japan. The joint venture is called GO-NET, which stands for Global Open Network. GO-NET will offer a new blockchain-based online payment platform that's designed to enable next generation digital financial transactions to be scalable, fast, efficient and secure. We expect the GO-NET services will become available in Japan next year.","And earlier this month, we announced our expanded partnership with Microsoft Azure. By combining the power of Azure with the vast reach of the Akamai Edge, we plan to help content providers maximize performance and scale, mitigate costs, and realize the benefits of the cloud to deliver the best possible online experiences. We believe that this partnership demonstrates the essential role that our Edge platform plays in the evolving hybrid cloud ecosystem.","We were also very pleased with a strong performance of our media business in Q1. Traffic growth expected for both OTT traffic and software downloads with several records set for volume, and we continued to grow traffic faster than the Internet as a whole in Q1, which means that we continued to gain share. We believe that our Edge platform's ability to deliver superior performance at scale and when accounts most is a key reason why so many of the world's major media companies rely on Akamai for their content delivery.","In summary, we're very pleased with our results in Q1 and the strong momentum that we've established heading into 2019. It's very good to see our strong revenue growth and security, the strong traffic growth in our CDN business. That continued improvement in our operating margins and over 40% growth in non-GAAP EPS for the third quarter in a row.","We also continued to bring innovative new technology to market and to receive awards and recognition for our product leadership. And we managed to do all this while keeping Akamai a great place to work. In fact, just this month Akamai was named one of 50 great places to work in Washington DC, one of the three best places to work in Poland where we have over 600 employees, and one of America's best midsize employers. Our highly talented and motivated workforce is a key differentiator for Akamai and one reason why we're off to such a great start in 2019.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Ed to review our Q1 results and provide guidance for the year ahead. Ed?","Edward McGowan","Thank you, Tom. I'm very pleased to be here for my first call with Akamai as CFO, especially with such great results to talk about. Before I begin, I want to thank Jim Benson for all his efforts, ensuring a seamless transition.","As Tom outlined, Akamai continued to perform well and had a very strong first quarter. We exceeded the high-end of our guidance range on revenue, operating margin, and earnings. Q1 mark the sixth consecutive quarter of non-GAAP operating margin expansion. We remain confident in our ability to achieve our goal of 30% non-GAAP operating margins in 2020.","Q1 revenue came in above the high-end of our range at $707 million, up 6% year-over-year or 8% in constant currency. Revenue growth continued to be solid across the business, driven by rapid growth of security services and higher than expected media traffic notably within the Internet platform customers.","Revenue from our Web Division was $376 million, up 7% year-over-year or 9% in constant currency. Web Division growth was led again by another very strong quarter of security growth as we continue to see strong adoption of our entire security portfolio.","First quarter security revenue was $190 million, up 27% year-over-year or 29% in constant currency. We are very pleased to see continued strong revenue growth from both our Web and Media Division customers. Revenue from our recently closed Janrain acquisition contributed almost $4 million in the quarter and is included in our total security revenue.","As Tom mentioned, we believe security remains a tremendous growth opportunity and we plan to continue to invest to further enhance and extend our product portfolio as well as expand our go-to-market capabilities.","Revenue from our Media and Carrier Division customers was $330 million, up 5% year-over-year, were 7% in constant currency, led by higher than expected traffic growth in gaming, video and software downloads.","Revenue from the Internet Platform customers was $47 million, up 6% from the prior year and up 9% from the prior quarter. Q1 marks the first time since its Q3 of 2015 that we have seen growth year-over-year from this group of customers.","Moving on to geographies, sales in our international markets continue to be strong and represented 41% of total revenue in Q1, up two points from the prior quarter and Q1 represented the first time our international revenue was greater than 40% of total.","International revenue was $288 million in the quarter, up 17% year-over-year, were 24% in constant currency, driven by continued strong growth in Asia and another solid quarter in EMEA.","Foreign exchange fluctuations had a positive impact on revenue of $1 million on a sequential basis, but a $15 million negative impact year-over-year. Finally, revenue from our U.S. market was $418 million, down 1% year over year.","Moving on to costs. Cash gross margin was 78%, down one point from Q4 levels, one point higher than the same period last year and in line with our guidance. Our margins continue to benefit from our ongoing network efficiency efforts.","GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 66% consistent with Q4 levels. As a reminder, we needed to change our estimated useful life of servers from four years to five years this quarter.","That change resulted in a benefit of approximately $8 million and had a one point impact on our GAAP gross margin, in line with our expectations and our guidance. Non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $253 million, down $9 million from Q4 levels and in line with our guidance.","Moving now to profitability. The adjusted EBITDA was $299 million, down $2 million from Q4 levels, but up $43 million or 17% from the same period in 2018. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 42%, consistent with Q4, but up four points from Q1 2018 and at the high end of our guidance range.","Non-GAAP operating income was $210 million, up $9 million from Q4 levels and up to $43 million were 26% from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 30% of two points from Q4 levels, up five points from Q1 of last year and above our guidance range. Capital expenditures in Q1, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense were $130 million and in line with our guidance.","Moving on to earnings. Non-GAAP net income was $181 million or $1.10 of earnings per diluted share, up 39% year-over-year and up 42% in constant currency and $0.05 above the high end of our guidance range. These strong earnings results were driven by higher than expected revenue growth, ongoing network and operating expense efficiencies in the slightly lower tax rate.","Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $37 million based on a Q1 effective tax rate of 17%. This effective tax rate is one point lower than our guidance driven by a higher percentage of foreign earnings.","Moving onto GAAP earnings. GAAP net income for the first quarter was $107 million or $0.65 of earnings per diluted share.","Now moving to some balance sheet items. We continue to have a very strong balance sheet. As of March 31, our cash, cash equivalents in marketable securities totaled $1.2 billion. During the quarter, we paid off our $690 million convertible debt obligation that was due in February. This payment reduced our total debt to $1.2 billion of senior convertible notes which will be due in May of 2025.","During Q1 we also had two other large cash outlays worth noting. The first was the acquisition of Janrain which closed in January and the second was the funding of our joint venture with Mitsubishi Financial Group of Japan.","Another balance sheet item I'd like to call out, is that we adopted the new lease accounting guidance or ASC 842 in the first quarter. This resulted in us putting operating lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet related to our leases for office space and our co-location facilities. ASC 842 did not have an impact on our income statement or cash flows.","Now I'll review our use of capital. We continue to focus on the importance of returning capital to shareholders. During the fourth quarter, we spent $35 million on share repurchases, buying back roughly 500,000 shares. We expect the amount of quarterly share repurchases to increase during the year as we aim to fully offset or dilution during 2019. We have $1.1 billion remaining on our previously announced share repurchase authorization.","Going forward, we intend to continue to return a large percentage of free cash flow through share repurchases, balanced against preserving our flexibility for strategic opportunities. We believe our disciplined and balanced capital allocation approach will allow us to continue to drive shareholder value through investing organically in the business, pursuing M&A and continued share repurchases. We are very pleased with how the business performed in Q1 and we remain confident in our ability to execute on our plans for the long-term.","Now I'd like to provide Q2 guidance and an update on our previous 2019 guidance. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we are projecting another solid quarter on both the top and bottom lines. This is despite foreign exchange headwinds from the strengthening U.S. dollar. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact of approximately $12 million compared to Q2 of 2018 and a $2 million sequential revenue headwind in Q2.","Therefore, we are estimating Q2 revenue to be in the range of $688 million to $702 million were up 6% to 8% in constant currency over Q2 2018. At these revenue levels we expect cash gross margin of approximately 78%. Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $255 million to $260 million, up from first quarter spend levels driven partly by a full quarter of Janrain expenses and our Edge customer event in June. Factoring in the cash gross margin and operating expense detail I just provided, we anticipate Q2 EBITDA margins in the range of 40% to 41%.","Moving now to depreciation. We expect non-GAAP depreciation of $87 million to $89 million. Factoring in this guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 28% for Q2.","Moving on to CapEx. We expect to spend approximately $157 million to $167 million excluding equity compensation in the second quarter. This includes approximately $34 million related to the continued build-out of our new headquarters as well as a more significant network investment in anticipation of increased OTT traffic in 2020.","And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.97 to $1.02 were up 22% to 28% in constant currency. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of approximately $34 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 17% and it also reflects a fully diluted share count of 165 million shares.","Looking ahead to the full-year we are increasing our revenue and EPS guidance. On the revenue side despite of projected year-on-year headwind of $32 million from foreign exchange which is up $16 million since our last guidance. We are increasing our guidance to revenue in the range of $2.82 billion to $2.86 billion. For the full-year, we anticipate adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 41% and we expect non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 28%.","As we mentioned last quarter, we do expect to see some expense headwinds during the remainder of 2019. In particular, we are anticipating approximately $8 million per quarter of additional operating expense beginning in Q3 as the benefit of our patent royalty payments from Limelight comes to an end and as we take on higher costs related to our new Cambridge headquarters. Therefore, we expect to see a slight decline in both EBITDA and operating margins in Q3 from Q2 levels with an improvement in Q4.","Moving on to CapEx. Full-year CapEx is expected to be approximately 19% to 20% of revenue. Included in our 2019 CapEx spend is roughly $100 million of one-time costs related to the build-out of our new headquarters. Excluding this spend, we predict our CapEx to be at the high-end of our long-term model due to increased network build outs in anticipation of more significant OTT traffic in 2020.","Moving to EPS. We are increasing our non-GAAP EPS or non-GAAP earnings per diluted share by $0.05 to $4.05 and $4.20 for the full-year 2019. This higher range is despite a projected incremental six set foreign exchange headwind compared to our previous guidance.","Our EPS range assumes an expected non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 17% in a fully diluted share count of approximately 164 million shares. In summary, we are very pleased with our first quarter results and our improved outlook for the year.","Thank you. And Tom and I would like to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Keith Weiss","Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and a very nice quarter. If I could maybe sneak in a two parter. One on the strength that you guys saw with Internet platform customers or the big platform customers coming back, so how do you guys think about the durability of that strength, is that - are these levels or sort of - is growth something that we could expect on a going forward basis? And this is part one.","And on the other side of the equation, on the security side of the business still really good growth there. Did it kind of exceed expectations in the same way that you have in prior quarters? How are you feeling about sort of the durability of growth there? And then like a nuance question given that those are mostly subscription businesses, I would have expected a little bit more of a sequential increase quarter-on-quarter in the security business particularly since January and has entered into that. Anything that we should just thinking about in terms of one-time items in the last quarter that might have sort of changed that seasonality that Q-on-Q increase that we've seen in a lot of prior quarters.","Edward McGowan","Sure. Keith, this is Ed. I'll take the first question on the strengthening the Internet platform customers. So the strength really came from video gaming and software. And I think the important thing here is to note that what it really demonstrates is that, despite the fact that these are large do-it-yourself customers. Akamai still has an important role and generally these customers will turn to us for scale or reach and geographies where there are not built out for security, for Web delivery, for functionality or for lowering live video. So we believe we still have a big opportunity with the Internet platform customers.","But in terms of your second question as far as, should we think about this growth as being sustainable? I'd say kind of looking into the next quarter, I project it to be sort of flat to probably down $1 million to $2 million and sort of that range for the rest of the year. You got to keep in mind that they are no primarily large media customers and just like any media customers will have to go through some ups and downs in terms of contract renegotiations and also some of the content that we deliver, whether it's gaming content or software downloads can also be a little bit seasonal in the sense that you may have some quarters we have unusually large downloads or in the case of Q1, we saw significant number of really popular gaming releases.","Thomson Leighton","And on the security side, we're really excited about the potential for our security business. You know, growing at 29% was a little bit higher than we forecasted in guidance for Q1.","Now I remember that the Nominum acquisition has now experienced its full year-over-year wrap around and there'll be a little bit smaller now than they were before, but 29% is great. In terms of Janrain, as Ed mentioned, it was a small amount in Q1 about $4 million.","Now the nice thing about Janrain is that has a long runway. I've talked to a lot of customers, since the acquisition. They're very excited about the technology to manage customer logins to do that in a safe way. So they don't lose customer data. There's a lot of regional laws being passed around the world and they've got to comply with those laws and we can help them do that with Janrain. We can help support user opt-in, in terms of how the data's used. So a lot of runway to go with Janrain, very exciting.","And of course you can have our enterprise security solutions, which I briefly mentioned in terms of winning awards in Q1 and they again are very small revenue today, but a tremendous runway with our zero trust architecture, a lot of excitement around that for the future. So we're optimistic. We can keep growing our security business that are very rapid clip well into the foreseeable future.","Edward McGowan","Yes. Keith, just on your question around one-time item, just one thing to point out in Q4, we had a stronger than expected quarter with Nominum and Q1 one was a little bit lower. That tends to be timing. That's fairly common with the careers we tend to see a bit stronger Q4 and a little bit weaker in Q1. Just thought, I'd point that out.","Keith Weiss","Got it. That's super helpful guys. Thank you so much for answers there.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Sterling Auty","Yes. Thanks. Hi, guys. Wanted to dive into the increase investment in the network ahead of the OTT demand, if I rewind a little while back, we were in a similar situation, granted I think with more uncertainty on what apple might do and be able to do in terms of their service, et cetera.","But what I'm curious about is where's the confidence level this time around in the visibility that that traffic will actually materialize in 2020. And how might the monetization of that traffic differ versus traditional media traffic if at all?","Thomson Leighton","Sure. I'll take that one. It's Tom. So yes, we're increasing our investment. In this time, I think what I would say is different is last time was really focused around one of that here and we've talked about a number of customers that are coming out with launching.","Disney is one example, where there's a number of different opportunities that were more confident that we'll be able to see additional traffic growth associated with those. And in terms of the profitability relative to traditional media, I would say in line with - I wouldn't expect anything different there.","Other than the fact if you see no significantly higher volumes, a lot of media pricing is based on volume discounting. So maybe a little bit of that there. But that's the, that's the primary reason why we're more confident. And the other thing to note too is our normal growth for traffic has been very, very strong.","Tom alluded to the fact its growing faster than internet race. So the extent that we lean in a little bit here in Q2 just to be ready in case we do see significant traffic growth out of the gates. If we don't see that we can just dial back our CapEx spend and grow into the additional dollars spending.","Edward McGowan","Yes. We're always going to use this equipment. So the worst that happens, we don't see a lot of the upside on revenue, but we'll be using that equipment a quarter or two later.","Sterling Auty","Sounds fair. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brad Zelnick of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Brad Zelnick","Great, thanks a lot, and a good performance this quarter. My first question is for Tom. Tom in your prepared remarks, you talked about expanding the Microsoft Azure partnership, which I think appeared in the press release earlier this month, and I think some people might have missed it. So can you talk about the nature of the relationship? Is there incentive for either side to sell each other's products and capabilities and what would have to happen for this relationship to generate upside to forecast this year?","Thomson Leighton","Yes. I think it's a very good relationship for Akamai and Azure, and especially for our customers. We we'll be going to market together with a much better approach, starting with big media companies to distribute their, streaming and video assets. It's a coupling at the technology layer, which results in better performance.","There's economic benefits to our customers to take advantage of it, you don't have a very large cost associated with getting content off of the storage off of as Azure on to Akamai CDN that you would have with other large cloud providers or CDN. That's a very big cost that people don't talk about, but really impacts our customer base.","And so not only will they get better performance through this partnership, but they're going to get lower cost same time. And of course, adding Akamai's scale and Edge platform, which is close to all the end users in the video players and you greatly enhance the scale of the solution for big media companies. And so I think it's really exciting for our customer base and it's great to have such a cooperative relationship that I think will be good for Akamai and Azure.","Brad Zelnick","That's great context. Thanks. And if I could sneak in one for Ed. Any help in appreciating your security performance across Web and Media customers? And are you still seeing benefit from the more aligned go-to-market with media?","Edward McGowan","Absolutely. Yes. Great question. So again, both divisions grew very nicely in Q1 and we saw accelerated growth in the media space and continued to benefit from the alignment we did about a year and a half ago with the sales force. So very, very pleased with what we're seeing in both Media and Web.","Brad Zelnick","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Michael Cheng","Hey guys. This is Michael Cheng on for Mark. Thanks for taking my question. I just have two, so I was wondering if you could provide any additional color on some of the turn trends you're seeing. Anything in particular that's driven this result. And then in terms of cloud security, given that and Nominum's fully lapped, would you stay that mid-to-high 20% growth is reasonable for this segment for the coming years? Thanks.","Edward McGowan","Yes. The churn was again, very low in Q1 and very - we're talking low single-digits, so great work there. And of course, that helps in the growth of the business and very optimistic about the growth of our Cloud Security business, we forecasted mid-20s and we did better that in Q1 and you look at the potential for our Akamai identity cloud, which is powered by Janrain and organically developed Akamai capabilities and you look at our zero trust solution with our enterprise, security capabilities and there's a lot of potential for future growth there.","Michael Cheng","Got it. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Alex Anderson of Needham. Your line is now open.","Alex Anderson","Perfect. Thank you very much. I know you guys to have a number of contracts that are coming up that are in process of renegotiation. And I was wondering, as the security businesses increasing as a percentage of the sale? Is that helps when you to offset some of the pricing pressure that you might have otherwise been enduring as a result of people being able to move content from CDN to CDN easier when they're not linked into the security? How much of that impact your pricing thoughts?","Edward McGowan","Sure. I'll take that one. So in terms of the customers that came up for renewal, we mentioned on our last call, because it was notable, a little bit unusual in that we had a number of large media customers we consolidated in the industry and we're coming up for renewal. So that's why we had called it out and actually that's why you see the midpoint of the range down a bit from where we reported last quarter.","What I would tell you is that that all, we had most of those reprice in Q1 and as far as our expectations came right in line with our expectations, maybe a touch better. We have a pretty good handle on the industry and what we expect in terms of pricing declines and renewals and whatnot. So I was happy to see that that came in as we expected.","And as far as your question around security and the impact on pricing, I would say this - we have a strategy, especially in the Web Division where we're bundling security and Web Performance. And what's you see there is exactly what's you described where you will see pricing pressure typically in your Web Performance side of the business. And what our teams will do is bundle and security as a way to remain sticky, much more sticky I know location, but also what it does is while the Web Performance price may decline, you're able to maintain higher revenue levels then when you bundle in security.","Alex Anderson","One more question if I could throw it in. So obviously, Fastly is now filed to come public, and there's obviously interest in competition as a result of these smaller companies coming out. Can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of pricing relative to the smaller competitors that are coming out? I know you talk about your YETI comments prior quarter, but has there been any change in behavior? Is my sense that the pricing is actually firmed around some of these new players in the category?","Thomson Leighton","Yes. As you know, there's dozens of small CDNs out there, literally dozens. You mentioned Fastly, we see them some in the market. They're not among the leading CDN competitors that were battling day-to-day out there in the market and have been for a long, long time. The folks we see most out there and the ones that have been doing it 10 or 15 years and they're the ones that we would most often see in the market.","Pricing, it's always competitive about there, and there's no change with that. And that's where we got a big advantage. We're highly profitable. We put a lot of effort into driving efficiency and that's not just at the operational level, but at the technical level. We can drive a tremendous amount of traffic out of each dollar of CPU, each dollar for power, and square foot of co-lo. And that gives us a huge advantage when a customer needs a price point, we can go in there and offer that price point and stay very profitable, whereas the competitors that you're talking about are losing a lot of money.","And when you're tiny, you can get away with that for a little while, but it really is hard to scale and eventually you hit a wall that you just can't keep doing that. And that's why a lot of the little CDNs have really struggled to get a size of several hundred million dollars in revenue. When they're really small, you can pretty much make anything happen, but it becomes hard to grow the company. And also with our profit in the amount of money we're generating, we plow that back into development of new innovative technology, acquisitions of other companies that provide capabilities that our customers want.","You see that in the context of the security business, and Ed talked about Protect & Perform. So when we go compete against, a lot of the other CDNs out there, we're in a great position with Protect & Perform and all the other capabilities we have. And the other CDNs just can't stack up to that. So when they're small, it's easy to show a little bit of growth, but hard to scale that. And at the end of the day, our major enterprise customers want to see a company they can rely on over the long haul.","Alex Anderson","Great. Thank you very much for the answers.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Robert Gutman of Guggenheim. Your line is now open.","Robert Gutman","Thanks for taking the questions. First, just revisiting the contract renewal. So is that completed in the first quarter? In other words, is there any more to come in the second quarter? And secondly, if you could talk about in the Web Division, it seems that the security aspect that is doing very well, if we get some color on the non-security products and the demand there and any progress you've made operationally?","Thomson Leighton","Sure. So I'll take that one. In terms of the contracts completed, we've completed most of them in Q1. We've got another one to go here in Q2, but that's been factored into the guidance. Like I mentioned earlier, we've got a really good handle in terms of what goes on in the market and our pricing. So I anticipate that to come in line with what we're expecting.","On the Web side, we don't break out our Web Performance product revenue anymore. Perhaps the best way to think about is if you look at our CDN, there is a proxy for Web Performance growth is probably fair. But in terms of some of the other products, we've seen great growth with our image manager product and continued growth with our performance management products, the DPM or Digital Performance Management product. So we're still seeing some really good growth outside of security with some of our newer Web Performance products. Our core Web Performance business as we talked about the area where we do see a bit of a pricing pressure.","Robert Gutman","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Turits of Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Michael Turits","Hey guys. Good evening. So Tom mentioned the traffic is growing faster than the Internet, so canning share on a traffic basis. But the CDN group down 1% and up 2% constant currency. It seems less clear that you're getting share on a revenue basis at least I'll use the CDN numbers. So is that because the performance pieces dragging us down or is it because of price declines on the immediate delivery side?","Edward McGowan","Yes. So Mike, I think it's really three things here. One, there is some pricing declines as you as you're talking about. So that's one factor. The other thing is that we know which we're coming off a pretty seasonally strong quarter in Q4.","But in terms of the CDN business as a whole, as you mentioned is growing about 2% and we expect to see that probably be flat to slightly declining as we worked through some of these pricing declines that we talked about with the renewals. But as Tom mentioned, we are gaining share and still growing. So we're offsetting our pricing declines.","Thomson Leighton","Also as we package, performance and delivery and protect and perform packages, it does make it harder to allocate the revenue, which is why that we report the divisions overall. Obviously, the Web Division is Performance and Security products dominated, Media is dominated by delivery and in OTT has some security sales, but dominated by the delivery products.","Because it's just hard when a customer buys the package protect and perform, to allocate the revenue. So some of the CDN probably is doing a little bit better than you might think. But generally flattish to low single-digits, I think is a fair estimate there.","Michael Turits","Okay. And if I could have just one quick follow-up, you mentioned when we talked about the investment for next year in anticipation of uplift in OTT. You mentioned, Disney, but are there any other events we can talk about or launches that give you visibility of, because obviously there's all some risk investing add of these.","Thomson Leighton","Sure. Yes. So another thing to keep in mind, Michael is it, next year was even years so we'll have an Olympics and we'll also have a presidential election. So in general and even years, we see along with that just additional traffic roads. So that's one thing to factor in.","But there's been a number of other public publicized OTT offerings, NBC, Time Warner, et cetera. And as I've mentioned before, we have excellent relationships with all the folks that have been rumored to have OTT launches going into next year. And we feel very confident that we should be able to get a meaningful share of that business.","Michael Turits","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Caroline Lu","Hi, this is Caroline Lu on for Heather. Just quickly back on the cloud security business. I might have missed the response to Keith's question, but is all of that revenue subscription at this point? And then based on the fact that Janrain contributed, I think you said $4 million this quarter, could you share with us your expectation for Janrain for the full-year?","Thomson Leighton","Yes, sure. I'll take the last part. So Janrain, as we talked about on the last call at about approximately $20 million. And we still believe that still the right number for the year.","Edward McGowan","And security is the bulk of that is subscription. There are examples I guess with very large customers that can have a traffic component, but most all of that subscription and probably will become increasingly so. So you can think of security subscription business.","Caroline Lu","Got it. And then I'm back to - I guess pricing and the Performance segment. A few quarters ago you mentioned retail weakness. Is that still the case or is anything changing there?","Thomson Leighton","Yes. So that's still the case. And the U.S. retail market in particular is under an enormous amount of pressure. So are a couple of additional bankruptcies this year in the U.S. retail market. And what I would say about that is we haven't seen anything dramatically change in terms of the level of pricing compression. So it's relatively consistent in what we factored into our guy going forward.","Caroline Lu","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen. Your line is now open.","Colby Synesael","Great. Two questions if I may. One just following up on the Security business. So the Security business is up $5 million a quarter over quarter, and you've mentioned obviously now a few times that Janrain was 4 million, so it was up 1 million. I need organic basis and as you mentioned, it's a subscription business. The 1 million sequential increase doesn't seem to align with guidance for plus 20% growth through the years. I was hoping you can give us a little bit more color on that.","And then secondly, your U.S. business has been obviously, roughly flat for a while now and it was down I think slightly in the first quarter and obviously that's very different than what we're seeing internationally. And I would have thought that with the big six Internet customers outperforming in the quarter, we would actually have seen the US businesses see a step up in its growth since I assume that's where the majority of traffic for those types of customers is coming from. But we can see that.","So I'm trying to understand, what is it about the U.S. business that's fundamentally a structurally so much different than the results that we're seeing outside of us. Thank you.","Thomson Leighton","Sure. I'll take the first one, first question or second question first. In terms of the U.S. business, if you look at year-over-year, last year we have the benefit of the Olympics in Q1 and also we had Nominum and as I mentioned we had a very strong Q4 and Nominum last quarter and are a little bit lower than expected here in Q1, where last Q1 we had a pretty quarter with Nominum's you get reference.","The another thing in keep in mind to is that in the U.S. that's where we have our biggest for challenge when the Web business, where our U.S. retailers are. So we've seen, you know, some, some continued pressure in that area. So that's, those are really the things that kept our U.S. growth down.","And in terms of, the way to think about the international growth, that's an area that we're going to continue to invest in. We've been, for many quarters now in a row, we've seen significant growth in Asia as well as in Europe. And there's large opportunities in places like the Middle East and Latin America.","So we're very bullish on the international growth and I think as we look at the remainder of the year for the U.S. as I mentioned earlier some of those large customers that we're consolidating, most of them are in the U.S. So I'd expect to see that flattish to slightly down in the U.S. here for a couple of quarters until we start to see a growth accelerate going into next year.","And then your other question was on Security. If you look sequentially, you're right we're off above $5 million a quarter-to-quarter some of that is from Janrain. Remember I mentioned earlier that we did have a lot higher room, not a lot, but we had higher revenue and Nominum and Q4 and lower than expected revenue in Q1.","So when you normalize that just back to somewhat of a normal sequential growth, maybe a little bit less than what you've seen in Q3 and Q4 last year, but a pretty decent clip. And we're still calling from mid-20s security growth year-over-year.","Colby Synesael","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from James Fish of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","James Fish","Hey, congrats on a great quarter. Just wanted to sneak in a few here. A big question we're getting a round pretty much your anniversarying the Epic Games or Fortnite when in Q2 here. Are there any customers at this point that are more than 2% of revenue and not specifically Epic Games, but maybe you can talk about the IT guys especially because they came back this quarter. And then secondly on the Enterprise application access product. What are you seeing in terms of adoption now that you're doing both external and internal application access? Thanks.","Thomson Leighton","Okay. Epic Game. So you talked about the anniversarying of Epic Games, which did launch here in and actually late Q1 early Q2. And then I think the question was on any customers over 2%. We don't break that out. But what I can tell you is we certainly don't have anyone even close to 10%. And we're seeing continued strong growth in Gaming. So Epic or Fortnite has really started the trend that a lot of other companies are trying to replicate.","And as I mentioned, you're one of the strengths here in Q1 was due to Gaming and expect that to continue into the future. But one of the nice things about us relatives and some of our competitors is that we don't have a lot of customer concentration risk with any of our large customers. We have some large customers that that can bounce you around one quarter or another as they go through a renewal. But we don't have very significant customer concentration with anybody really.","Edward McGowan","In terms of our Enterprise Security offerings, led by Enterprise application access and the zero trust architecture, having a lot of positive response to the architectural approach. I'd say it's early days, good growth revenue, doubled year-over-year in Q1. And we're very optimistic about the future.","Now it's still early days, it will take time for traditional enterprises to migrate to the cloud-based security model and migrate from a network layer authentication and security model, which has been a tradition now for a long time to an application layer authentication and security model that's in the cloud.","But very good discussions with customers. They're very interested. The analyst community is very supportive and we're seeing very strong revenue growth, but early days and still relatively small amounts of revenue. But as we look to the future, we think it's an important source of growth for us.","James Fish","Thanks Tom. Thanks Ed.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from James Breen of William Blair. Your line is now open.","James Breen","Thanks for taking the question. Could you just talk about where the growth is coming from with respect to existing customers versus new customers? And is a lot of the international growth coming from existing sort of U.S. customers that are expanding globally? Thanks.","Edward McGowan","Sure. This is Ed. In terms of growth, obviously we've got such a huge installed base and a lot of growth does come from our existing customer base and that comes through additional traffic growth as well as selling more services to existing customers. So always find that the bulk of that typically will come from our existing customers.","That said, we've had a couple of quarters here on a row of pretty significant new customer bookings, now of course, we're growing off a really big base, so it's not a huge material number per se. But we've had made some changes in our go-to-market last year and we're starting to see some benefits of that, starting to see new customer growth, start to pick up a bit.","In terms of the difference between the U.S. and International, in International, it's more of a greenfield opportunity as we're going into places like China, Indonesia and India. So there's a lot of new customer to acquire there. So new customer growth is probably a little bit stronger in our International markets that is in the U.S.","James Breen","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Sameet Sinha of B. Riley FBR. Your line is now open.","Sameet Sinha","Yes, thank you. A couple of questions. Let me first start with enterprise security, you spoke about growth there. Do you think you need to make a Prolexic kind of an acquisition to kind of accelerate and provide you that sort of a momentum and brand name visibility in the industry?","Secondly, talking about, I don't think we've specifically addressed this in a while, so let me ask this. Last year you had number of operational improvement initiatives within the company, including a consultant who was in there. Can you talk to us about where are you in that process? Are you done with all the improvements that you need to make? Are there a few things more in the recommendations that are yet to be kind of initiated? Thank you.","Thomson Leighton","Yes. Obviously, we've been very happy with a Prolexic acquisition. I think it really did help accelerate the growth of our organically developed security business. And we've made several acquisitions in the security space that we've been happy with and continue to look for potential acquisition.","I don't think we need to buy something at a very large scale to be successful in enterprise security. But it's an area we're looking closely at. And of course, we got to be cognizant of price points there. There's some pretty high evaluations in the enterprise security space, but it is an area that we continue to look at.","And in terms of where we are with the operational improvement initiatives that something that we continue to work. We are very happy to see that we hit 30% in Q1. It's something that we're working on through the year and into next year. We have gotten benefit from our consulting engagement that's largely completed. But we are always focused on operational efficiencies and are investing in making our services be more efficient and how we allocate headcount and OpEx to focus that on the areas of greatest growth for the company.","Sameet Sinha","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ken Talanian of Evercore. Your line is now open.","Kenneth Talanian","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering, could you rank order the potential drivers that might cause you to exceed your security growth expectations factored into your guidance for the year?","Thomson Leighton","Well, obviously we have to see how fast the Janrain revenue accelerates our Akamai identity cloud offer. We have to see how fast the adoption takes place for our Zero Trust Architecture. These are things that are hard to forecast exactly. They're very early stage and relatively small numbers today. But if those were to take off faster than we expect, that would help. Bot Manager, as I mentioned, has been extremely successful in the marketplace. Now up to about 400 customers. We expect that to continue to ramp during the year and if it ramps faster and that can be helpful. Ed, do you have\u2026","Edward McGowan","Yes. What I would say is obviously you've got, as Tom mentioned, Janrain and Zero Trust is working on small numbers. So in terms of impacting this year is going to be from our core KSD Bot management and Prolexic as the main driver. If you look further out with Janrain and with enterprise that would be future growth drivers along with continued growth. We still have a lot of opportunity on our installed base to be able to sell security.","We had talked about, it was an earlier question on media. I know there was an area that we had identified year and a half ago, where there was a lot of opportunity and we've seen - we've been able to execute on that and still have a ways to go. So basically it's going to be from your core products and have a lot of room to go. And also from the new customer acquisition standpoint, most of our new bookings right now are coming from security. So we're leading with security. So it's a customer acquisition story as well.","Kenneth Talanian","Great. And if I may just sneak one in. Your DSOs are a bit higher than historically. Was there anything that changed in linearity of your business?","Edward McGowan","No. So it's funny if you go back a year ago, it's roughly the same thing. There's a couple of things going on with timing. We actually have a number of customers that are prepaying, so we send out some invoices for our customers who pay in advance for full-year. And if you look at the quality of the aging, the aging quality is fantastic. So it's really nothing in terms of electability or anything around that, and this is purely a normal jump we see in Q4 and Q1.","Kenneth Talanian","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Van Rhee of Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open.","Jeff Van Rhee","Great, thank you. Just a couple from me. I just want to go back to the sales sort of go-to-market changes. You mentioned that you've seen some impacts and some increase in capture from new customers. Is it on pace with what you expected? It's hard to get a sense of what the timing was when we should really see those impacts. But is it meeting your expectations as to where you thought we'd be at this point?","Thomson Leighton","Yes. So in terms of the new customer acquisition, I'd say we're probably doing about as good as we expected. We made those changes about a year-ago. So it takes a while for it to take hold you investment in lead generation, inside sales account development and things like that. So - but in terms of how it's progressing so far, we're on pace, maybe a touch ahead. But again, it takes a while for that to become a more material number over time.","Jeff Van Rhee","Okay. Got it. And then on the platforms, was the bulk of the sequential increase in platforms from one of those platform customers?","Thomson Leighton","No, it was actually fairly well distributed. There was growth like I said, in all different parts of the business from the gaming downloads, from software downloads, from a video delivery. And as I mentioned, one thing just to be mindful of when you have things like download events, they can be a little bit seasonal. That's why I said if you'll look towards a Q2 and beyond thinking of flat to down $1 million or $2 million, probably the right way to be thinking about those customers for now.","But I can tell you, I used to run that sales organization. The team is actively engaged with those customers and constantly looking for opportunities for growth and to the extent that we can become an extension of what they're doing and offer, whether it's security or additional scale and reach where there to do it. So we're certainly not giving up on this group of customers and help we can grow in the future. But now that said, we just want to be cautious as we think about guiding that going forward.","Jeff Van Rhee","Got it. And one last, if I could, I recall sort of thinking back maybe even a decade ago, I recall hearing you guys talk about Edge compute. How has that changed now? Certainly a lot - maybe a lot more noise about Edge compute, but what does it mean to your business at this point?","Thomson Leighton","Yes. So we have the ability for our customers to run applications on our Edge platform. We're increasing the investment there. Also this plays into our IoT Edge Connect platform where you can have really tens and hundreds of millions of devices maintain always on connections to the platform.","Often they'll speak non-web protocols. And so we'll be supporting the ability to run logic for metadata for command and control, so that these devices can be monitored. You can have alerting based on it. Basically you want to think of Akamai's providing the kind of compute you need to manage applications in user devices and on our Edge platform, both for Web applications, but also IoT kinds of applications.","What you won't see us do is, a generic kind of thing. We're just, CPU for any purpose at all. So you won't see us do to like an easy to kind of platform, it really needs to be material to our customer's businesses and managing applications and IoT devices. That's the sweet spot for us and you'll see that kind of capability on our Edge platform.","Jeff Van Rhee","Got it. Great, thank you.","Thomson Leighton","Candice, this is Tom. We have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from line of Brandon Nispel of KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","Brandon Nispel","Okay, great. Most have been answered. I just wanted to ask Tom, maybe, did you learn anything from Google Stadia announcement, regarding cloud gaming and maybe can you specifically talk about what type of discussions you're having with your customers?","Then one for Ed. Headcount growth was a - headcount was down sequentially. Who's curious if you could update us on what your expectations are for total head count, uh, growth in 2019? Thanks.","Edward McGowan","Yes. I don't think we learned anything in particular there. As we talked about, we work closely with pretty much all the major gaming companies. I think people have been talking about running games that the CPU for the games in the cloud data centers for a long time.","There's always a question about how much financial sense that's makes. We work with pretty much all the major gaming companies and you know, I think managing the metadata associated with the consoles and the devices that are playing games makes sense for us.","And we can do that through our IoT Edge Connect platform. But I don't know that there's going to be a lot of the streaming for the individual game necessarily coming from the cloud. People have been talking about that now. Our customers, we've been talking to about that for probably over a decade. In terms of your question on headcount, yes, headcount is down.","You may know that we've had a couple of restructuring charges in the last couple of quarters as we've looked to optimize some of our investments, the invest in some areas and invest in others in terms of a headcount growth going forward.","Tom talked about the opportunities and security. So as we - some of that savings from other areas be reinvested back in security as well as our go-to-market, especially in the international markets where we see significant opportunity.","In terms of headcount growth, I expect headcount to grow a bit here as we've taking some of these actions. That filled up the attire workforce in terms of the making these investments. So that's also factored into our guide. If you recall, I talked about operating margins coming down and touch here in Q4 and then reaccelerating Q2 and Q3 and everything.","Brandon Nispel","Great. If I could just follow-up, Tom, on your response to gaming, are there technical limitations for games to be streamed from a cloud location? It seems like Google has figured something out in terms of the latency issue that probably used to be a problem?","Thomson Leighton","Well, obviously, if you're playing a multiplayer game, latency makes a big difference and so you need to be doing the stream, close to the end user. That would be the only technical constraints. There are economic considerations, if you're - it's a high quality game, you now have a stream for an individual user, where the CPU the user hasn't purchased, but sitting in the cloud and the experiences we've had talking to the major folks doing that over the last decade when they try to think about doing it at scale, the economics don't look so good.","There's been some desire to do it, so in certain countries; maybe you don't have staff to the game. Maybe the game works on multiple devices. You don't want to have the players. And there's reasons you'd want to do it, but I haven't seen - I spend people talked about it for a long time. We can certainly handle the low latency aspect, but it's been more of the economics around it in terms of will that really take off at scale.","Brandon Nispel","Great. Thank you.","Tom Barth","Well, I wanted to thank everybody for joining us this evening. In closing, we will be presenting to several investor conferences and events throughout the quarter. Details of these can be found in the Investor Relations section of akamai.com.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following management's prepared remarks, we will host a question-and-answer session and our instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded for replay purposes.","It is now my pleasure hand the conference over to Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Tom Barth","Thank you, Bryan, and good afternoon, everyone, and we appreciate you joining Akamai's fourth quarter and fiscal year end 2018 earnings conference call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; Jim Benson, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer; and Ed McGowan, Akamai's Senior Vice President of Finance.","Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.","Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on February 12, 2019. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances.","As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of akamai.com.","And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Leighton","Thanks Tom. And thank you all for joining us today.","Akamai delivered excellent results in the fourth quarter. Revenue was $713 million up 8% over Q4 2017 and up 10% in constant currency. Q4 non-GAAP EPS was $1.07 per diluted share up 51% year-over-year and up 52% in constant currency. These very strong results were driven by the continued rapid growth of our security business; the continued improvement in our media and carrier division; and a robust holiday commerce season in our Web Division.","Our bottom-line also benefited from a lower tax rate and from our continued focus on operational excellence. EBITDA margins in Q4 expanded to 42% and non-GAAP operating margins expanded to 28%. Q4 marked our fifth consecutive quarter of increasing margins and we anticipate further margin expansion in 2019. We also have clear line of sight to achieving non-GAAP operating margins of 30% in 2020, while continuing to invest in innovation and new products to drive our future growth.","For the full year, revenue was $2.7 billion up 9% over the prior year. Non-GAAP EPS for 2018 was $3.62 up a $1 or 38% over 2017. We're especially pleased to report that we generated over $1 billion in cash from operations last year. This was up 26% over 2017 and represented 37% of our revenue.","In Q4, our security portfolio continued to be the fastest growing part of our business with revenue of $185 million up a very strong 38% year-over-year in constant currency. Security accounted for 26% of our total revenue last quarter and our Security business exited 2018 with a revenue run rate of $750 million per year. We now expect our security business to top the $1 billion mark in annualized revenues in 2020. That's a remarkable milestone, but we're not planning to stop there.","With our acquisition of Janrain which closed on January 23, and the development of our new Zero Trust Enterprise Security Solution, we anticipate that our security business will continue to grow at a very fast pace for many years to come. Janrain establishes Akamai as a market leader in the customer identity and access management space. Their solutions are designed to manage user log-ins and data for major consumer facing Web sites. They verify the identity of the end-user and make sure that the user experience is optimized and secure. Janrain does this in part by keeping track of how users access their accounts. For example, which devices they use and from which locations. We believe that we can use this data to help strengthen all our security solutions. And by combining Janrain's technology with our Bot Manager Solution, we believe that we can make it even harder for attackers to hack into or steal user accounts.","Janrain will also help us protect enterprises from data breaches. That's because Janrain stores user information so that the enterprise doesn't have to. And if an enterprise doesn't keep user information like user names, passwords, phone numbers and addresses then it can't be stolen from that enterprise in a data breach.","Keeping user data safe means more than just not having it stolen. It also means complying with the various data privacy laws that are being adopted by governments around the world. And it means helping end users have more control over who gets access to their data and what they can do with it. This is going to be increasingly important in the future and we believe that our unique security solutions can help position Akamai as a company that can be trusted in a world where big tech companies are being called out for their questionable uses of personal information.","As we look forward, we're also excited about our new Zero Trust Enterprise Security Solution. Last quarter, we signed our first Zero Trust deal worth more than $1 million per year. And we sold it to a manufacturer in Asia. Now as most of you know manufacturing is not a vertical known for buying our traditional Web services but manufacturing companies do care about cyber security and protecting their enterprise. And the same is true for just about every major company today. And so, with our enterprise security solutions, we see an opportunity to dramatically expand the range of companies that we can serve. And since companies typically spend more on enterprise security than they do on Web security, we expect this emerging business to have a more meaningful impact on our revenue beginning in 2020.","We're also continuing to invest in other innovative technologies that could bring substantial future returns. For example, today we announced a new joint venture with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group of Japan. The joint venture will offer a new block chain based online payment platform called Global Open Network or GO-NET for short. GO-NET is designed to enable next generation digital financial transactions to be scalable, fast, efficient and secure. The new platform is expected to become available in the first half of 2020.","We were also very pleased to see the continued improvement in our media and carrier business in Q4. Traffic growth last quarter remain very strong in our OTT and gaming sectors. And in December, we achieved another record for peak traffic driven by software downloads from Microsoft and Fortnight and streaming of the UEFA Champions League. We continue to grow traffic faster than the Internet as a whole in Q4, which means that we continued to gain share and because of our relentless focus on efficiency, we actually spend less on network costs in 2018 than we spent in the prior year.","Overall, we're very pleased with the progress we made last year. We accelerated revenue growth. We made dramatic improvements to our margins. We grew non-GAAP EPS by nearly 40%. We developed innovative new technology that we believe will drive substantial revenue growth in the future. And we delivered excellent value to our customers further decreasing our already low customer churn rate. And we managed to do all this while keeping Akamai a great place to work where corporate social responsibility is a strong part of our culture.","For example, we rank as one of the Forbes just 100 companies doing right by treating workers and customers well, protecting privacy, producing quality products, minimizing our environmental impact, giving back to our communities and by providing ethical leadership.","We rank as one of the best employers for diversity out of 50,000 U.S. firms with more than 1000 employees. And we scored a perfect 100 on the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index.","I'd like to take this opportunity to thank all of the talented employees on our global team for all their hard work on behalf of our customers and shareholders in 2018, because of their continued innovation and great customer service, Akamai is very well positioned for the years ahead.","I also want to take this opportunity to say a special thank you to Jim Benson. As you may have seen in today's press release, Jim is planning to retire from Akamai later this year. And he'll be transitioning his CFO duties to Ed McGowan in March. Jim has been a great CFO and I'm very grateful to him for his many contributions to Akamai's growth and future success.","Over the last 10 years, Jim has developed an outstanding finance organization and he's instilled a strong operational and financial discipline across the company. He's been a great business partner not only for me, but for the entire Akamai senior leadership team and the Board. His many contributions to Akamai will be fondly remembered for many years to come. Although Jim is stepping out of the CFO role after filing the 10-K in March, I'm very pleased that you'll be staying on as an Executive Advisor to help ensure a smooth transition.","While we're sad to see Jim leave, we're also delighted about Ed's promotion to CFO. Ed is a highly accomplished finance executive and an 18-year veteran of Akamai, with broad knowledge of our business, our customers and the industry. He began his career with us in finance and sales operations. And then, took on executive roles in Corporate Development and Global Media and Carrier sales. Most recently Ed served as SVP in Finance, overseeing business finance, customer revenue operations and FP&A as well as leading a key transformation project to drive increased levels of sustained profitable growth. Having worked closely with Ed for over a decade, I'm looking forward to benefiting from his experience and knowledge in the role of CFO as we work to deliver profitable growth for our shareholders in 2019 and beyond.","Now I'll turn the call over to Jim to review our Q4 and 2018 results, and then, Ed will share our guidance for Q1 and 2019 as well as some preliminary thoughts about 2020. Jim?","Jim Benson","Thank you for the kind words Tom, and good afternoon everyone.","This is a great team here at Akamai and I am very proud of what we've accomplished over the last nine years. With revenues approaching $3 billion a year a rapidly growing security business with the $750 million annualized run rate, a more diversified portfolio that I believe positioned Akamai for long-term success, industry leading profitability and a consistent focus on managing the business for the long-term while delivering results in the near-term.","As I approach my 10th year helping to lead and drive the business and after discussing my desire to make a change with Tom, I've decided this is the ideal time for Akamai to transition to the next CFO to lead our next phase of continued growth and expansion. The company has been demonstrating strong business results. We have a very talented finance team and bench in place and there are many exciting future growth opportunities ahead.","I am very pleased to be turning the reins over to Ed McGowan, who I have worked with over the past nine years most recently as my Senior Vice President of Finance. I'm looking forward to helping Ed, Tom and the team in the near-term spending some more time with my family and considering my next professional challenge. I am confident that this transition will be seamless.","With that, let me now dive into the details of our strong Q4 financial results. As Akamai -- as Tom outlined, Akamai continued to perform well and had an exceptional fourth quarter closing out a fantastic 2018. We exceeded the high-end of our guidance on revenues, operating margins and earnings and delivered substantial operating margin improvements for the fifth consecutive quarter. We continued to execute well and to demonstrate the leverage in Akamai's operating model. And we remain confident, we will show further progress in 2019 and have clear line of sight to achieve our goal of 30% operating margins in 2020.","Q4 revenue came in above the high-end of our guidance range at $713 million up 8% year-over-year or 10% in constant currency or up a healthy 11%, if you exclude the six large Internet platform customers. Notably this is the fourth straight quarter of year-over-year double-digit revenue growth, when you exclude the Internet platform giants.","Revenue growth continued to be solid across most of the business with the over achievement compared to guidance driven by the rapid growth of our security services. And higher than expected holiday season traffic in our media and commerce verticals notably. I mentioned on our last call that holiday season traffic would play a large role and where we would land relative to our fourth quarter guidance. And it did. Traffic was solid across our core installed base with particularly strong growth coming in our gaming over the top and commerce verticals.","Revenue from our media and carrier division customers was $328 million in the fourth quarter up 8% year-over-year or 9% in constant currency and up a healthy 14% in constant currency excluding the large Internet platform customers. Revenue from the Internet platform customers was $43 million in the fourth quarter consistent with Q3 levels and in line with our expectations. Revenues from these customers continued to stabilize and represented just 6% of total Akamai revenues. Our lowest level of revenue concentration in recent memory and a testament to our continued progress on diversifying our revenue base across customers, solutions and geographies over the past several years.","Moving now to our Web Division. Revenue from these customers was $385 million up 9% year-over-year or 10% in constant currency, a slight acceleration from Q3 levels driven by a strong online retail season for our e-commerce customers.","We also continue to see a strong uptake in our new product areas namely Bot Manager, Image Manager and Digital Performance Management as well as further strong growth and adoption for our core security solutions.","Turning now to our results for our security solutions, fourth quarter revenue was $185 million up 36% year-over-year with 38% in constant currency and yet another quarter of tremendous revenue growth from increased customer adoption of these solutions globally. We are particularly pleased to see continued strong revenue growth in our security offerings in Q4 and throughout full year 2018 from both the Web and Media division customer bases.","Entering 2019, our rapidly growing security business now at an annualized revenue run rate of $750 million. As Tom mentioned, we believe security continues to present a tremendous growth opportunity for us and we plan to continue to invest in this area to further enhance and extend our product portfolio and go-to-market capabilities. Our recent entrance into Customer Identity and Access Management is a great example of how we're adding complementary capabilities to our world-class security offerings as well as acquiring additional enterprise sales talent.","Moving on to our geographies, sales in our international markets continue to be strong and represented 39% of total revenue in Q4 up 1 point from the prior quarter. International revenue was $279 million in the fourth quarter up 20% year-over-year with 23% in constant currency driven by continued strong growth in our Asia-Pacific region and another solid quarter in our EMEA region.","Foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact on revenue of $3 million on a sequential basis and $8 million on a year-over-year basis. Finally, from our U.S. market, revenue was $434 million up 2% year-over-year and up 4% excluding our large Internet platform customers.","Moving on to costs, cash gross margin was 79% up nearly 2 points from Q3 levels in the same period last year and 1 point above our guidance due to higher revenues and improved network efficiencies. Not only is this the second consecutive quarter that our bandwidth and co-location dollar spend declined year-over-year, but absolute expenses for a full year 2018 were lower than 2017 spend as well. This is noteworthy given the significant increase in traffic over the same period. We are very pleased with our continued ability to efficiently manage network cost.","GAAP gross margin which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation was 66% also up 2 points from Q3 levels and in line with our guidance. Non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $262 million up $18 million from Q3 levels this was slightly above our guidance driven by increased year-end commission and bonus costs associated with the revenue over achievement.","Moving now to profitability, adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $301 million up $28 million from Q3 levels and up $56 million or 23% from the same period in 2017. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 42% up 1 point from Q3 levels up 5 points from Q4 2017 levels and in line with our guidance range.","Non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter was $201 million up $20 million from Q3 levels and $42 million or 26% from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 28% up 1 point from Q3 levels up 4 points from Q4 of last year and in line with our guidance range. I am very pleased with the five consecutive quarters of margin expansion we have seen from our ongoing efficiency efforts and feel confident, we can achieve our 30% non-GAAP operating margin goal in 2020, while continuing to make the required investments to drive both growth and further scale and leverage in the business.","Capital expenditures in Q4 excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense are $125 million in line with our guidance for the quarter. For the full year 2018, capital expenses came in at 16% of revenue and in line with our long-term model range.","Moving on to earnings, non-GAAP net income was $176 million or $1.07 of earnings per diluted share, $0.04 above the high-end of our guidance range. These strong earnings results were driven by continued top-line execution, ongoing network and operating expense efficiencies and a lower tax rate.","Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $32 million based on a Q4 effective tax rate of just over 15%. This effective tax rate is a couple of points lower than our guidance due to a higher mix of foreign earnings and the resulting year-to-date true up in the quarter. For the full year, the 2018 non-GAAP tax rate was just under 18%.","Moving on to our GAAP earnings. There was one noteworthy item impacting our Q4 GAAP results that I'd like to provide some color on. We recorded a $13 million restructuring charge in Q4 and we expect to record an additional restructuring charge of approximately $10 million to $12 million in Q1. These charges are primarily related to workforce reductions of approximately 125 employees in January or about 2% of our total headcount.","Also included in our restructuring charge are some small capitalized software impairments from decisions to deprioritize certain investment areas that have not achieved the commercial success and return on investment we expected. It is important to note these restructuring actions are being taken to enable some rebalancing of our investments, divesting in some areas, investing in others and to position the company to meet our long-term goals of continued growth and scale.","Factoring in this GAAP-only restructuring charge, GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $94 million or $0.57 of earnings per share.","Now, I'll review our use of capital. We continue to focus on the importance of returning capital to shareholders. During the fourth quarter, we spent $124 million on share repurchases buying back roughly 1.9 million shares. For the year, we spent $750 million buying back 10.2 million shares representing 124% of our free cash flow. And resulting in our share count declining from 171 million shares at the beginning of the year to 165 million shares in the fourth quarter. We now have $1.1 billion on our previously announced share repurchase authorization and going forward we intend to continue returning to our shareholders a significant percentage of our free cash flow through share repurchases balanced against our preserving our flexibility for other strategic opportunities.","We believe our disciplined and balanced capital allocation approach will allow us to continue driving shareholder value through investing organically in the business, pursuing additional M&A like we recently completed with Janrain and returning capital to stockholders via share repurchases.","In summary, we are pleased with how the business performed in Q4 and throughout 2018 and remain confident in our ability to execute on our plans for the long-term.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Ed to cover the Q1 and 2019 guidance along with some initial thoughts on 2020. And again, I want to say how pleased I am to hand the reins to you. I know we are in good hands. Ed?","Ed McGowan","Thanks Jim.","It's been a pleasure working closely with you over the past nine years. I look forward to following your example of professionalism and business leadership in years ahead. Before I move on to guidance, there are three housekeeping items that I wanted to highlight. The first relates to a change in our network server useful lives as some of you may recall, we announced on our Q4 2012 earnings call that we were required to extend the useful life of our network servers from three years to four years based on the actual server useful life trends. We carefully monitor the useful lives of all of our capital assets annually and based on the outcome of that review; we now need to extend the useful lives of our network servers from four years to five years, similar to when we made the change six years ago. This extended useful life is a direct result of the continued software and hardware initiatives that we have put in place to manage our global network more efficiently because we are now using our servers in our network for an average of five years, we have determined it is appropriate under GAAP accounting to adjust our useful life policy to five years and this change will be effective in Q1.","Please keep in mind this change has no impact on cash flow, but will result in roughly a $24 million depreciation benefit in 2019 and a benefit of approximately $7 million in 2020. We have provided a supplemental table in the Investor Relations section of our Web site that details the impact of this change.","Also during Q1, we closed on our recently announced acquisition of Janrain. As we previously stated, Janrain will be approximately $0.05 to $0.06 dilutive to non-GAAP EPS in 2019. But, we expect it to be accretive to non-GAAP EPS in 2020.","Finally, just a reminder that our $690 million convertible bond is maturing on February 15, 2019. We are expecting to repay bondholders at par value using a portion of our $2.1 billion of cash on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2018.","Moving now to guidance. Today, we are providing guidance for both Q1 and full year 2019 along with some early thoughts on 2020. Looking ahead to the first quarter, we are projecting another solid quarter on both the top and bottom-line. We do expect to see some normal sequential revenue decline that we typically see in Q1 due to seasonality. And perhaps a bit more pronounced this year due to the very strong holiday season this past quarter.","In addition, we expect some foreign exchange impact from the strengthening U.S. dollar. The current spot rates foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact of approximately $14 million compared to Q1 of 2018. Therefore, we're expecting Q1 revenues in the range of $690 million to $704 million or up 5% to 7% in constant currency over Q1 of 2018. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of approximately 78%.","Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $252 million to $256 million down from fourth quarter spend levels even as we absorb the incremental expenses associated with the Janrain acquisition. The decline in Q1 is partially due to incentive compensation plans resetting at the beginning of the year partially driven by the recent workforce reduction actions, Jim mentioned a few moments ago.","Factoring in the cash gross margin and operating expense expectations I just provided, we anticipate Q1 EBITDA margins in the range of 41% to 42% consistent with Q4 levels. Moving on to depreciation, we expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $90 million to $92 million which includes the impact of the network server useful life change I mentioned earlier. Factoring in this guidance we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 28% to 29% for Q1.","Moving on to CapEx, we expect to spend approximately $126 million to $136 million excluding equity compensation in the first quarter. With the overall revenue and spend configuration I outlined. We expect Q1 non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1 to $1.05 or up 31% to 37% to constant currency. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $35 million to $37 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 18%. And it also reflects a fully diluted share count of 164 million shares.","Looking ahead to the full year, we are anticipating revenue in the range of $2.81 million to $2.85 million which factors in a negative impact of roughly $16 million due to foreign exchange. We also expect a revenue by quarter to follow the same quarter-over-quarter trends that we saw in 2018. For the full year, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 41% and we expect 2019 non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 28% up approximately 1.5 points over full year 2018 levels. And we are on a trajectory to further expand non-GAAP operating margins to 30% in 2020.","It is worth noting that we do see some expense headwinds in 2019. We expect approximately $8 million per quarter of additional operating expenses beginning in Q3 as the benefit of our patent royalty payments from Limelight comes to an end. And as we take on higher rent costs related to our new Cambridge headquarters, therefore, we expect to see a slight decline in both EBITDA and operating margins in Q3 with an improvement in Q4.","Moving on a CapEx, full year CapEx is expected to be approximately 19% of revenue. Included in our 2019 CapEx spend is roughly a $100 million of onetime costs related to the buildout of our new headquarters that is expected to be completed by the end of this year. Excluding our headcount related spend, our CapEx levels are in line with our long-term model. At these revenue and margin levels along with an expected non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 18% and fully diluted share count of approximately $164 million, we anticipate non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $4.15 for the full year 2019. At the midpoint of that range non-GAAP EPS would be up 14% year-over-year when adjusted for foreign exchange.","We are pleased with how full year 2019 is shaping up particularly from a margin expansion and profit perspective. In 2019, we plan to continue investing and innovating in areas we believe will drive future growth, continue to refine and optimize our go-to-market efforts and ensure we are well-positioned to capture a growing share of the OTT market as we continue to focus on quality, cost and scale. We are optimistic that our efforts in 2019 across the company will result in an acceleration in growth rate for both revenue and EPS in 2020.","Given our expectations of significant traffic growth in 2020 due to more events such as the Olympics and the U.S. Presidential election as well as more direct to consumer offerings coming to market later in 2019 and early 2020, strong adoption of our new Customer Identity and Access Management products, increased market traction of our enterprise security products and continued strong growth in our core Web security products such as Kona Site Defender and Bot Manager.","In closing, we are very bullish about the opportunities ahead for Akamai. We are confident in our ability to deliver revenue growth along with margin and earning expansion, achieve our 30% operating margin goal in 2020 and continue to invest in innovation to drive future growth. Thank you. Tom, Jim and I would like to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from James Breen with William Blair. Your line is now open.","James Breen","Thanks for taking the question. Just can you talk about the security business and how you've seen the sales go between sort of the core DDoS, and then, some of the other products that you've sold. From a customer perspective what types of products taking all services from you guys? Thanks.","Tom Leighton","Yes. We're seeing strong adoption across the board starting with DDoS, then we have Kona Site Defender, which protects applications from being corrupted or taken over or the Web site content from being corrupted, theft during transactions. Bot Manager as we've talked about before is our fastest new selling product and memory. The majority of transactions today are no longer human. There's bots and particularly the bots are trying to take over user accounts. The vast majority of log-ins today are not legitimate people but bots who are trying out stolen credentials.","So very strong adoption across the board, and we're starting to get traction now with our Zero Trust Enterprise Security Solution. As I mentioned we signed up our first $1 million a year customer. And what was really nice about that is it came from an account that would never have likely bought our normal content delivery, Web acceleration products. So, the security business just across the board is doing very well.","James Breen","From a growth perspective, is growth coming from -- or can you give a little color on where it's coming from new customers versus existing customers taking more volumes?","Tom Leighton","It's both. The large fraction of our new customer bookings are for security today and we are getting good up sell with the new products within the existing base. For example, Bot Manager being a new product with our enterprise security offerings, early days, but there's both new customers like the one that became our $1 million customer, they weren't a customer before, but also selling that within existing accounts. So, I would say both are strong new customers and upselling the new security offerings within existing accounts.","James Breen","Great thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from line of Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Brad Zelnick","Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Congrats on a great Q4. And Jim it's been great working with you and we look forward to working with Ed, so congrats on a great run there.","Jim Benson","Thank you.","Brad Zelnick","You're welcome. Just a follow on the cloud security question, cloud security remains really impressive. How should we think about the sustainability and the visibility that you have here to the growth? And can you comment on pricing trends for WAF and DDoS in the market?","Tom Leighton","Yes. We anticipate continuing a very strong growth rate probably not in the 30s over the next couple of years, but I would say certainly in the mid-20%. We did benefit last year from the acquisition of Nominum and their security products, which are doing quite well, but with the acquisition we got a boost in 2018.","In terms of pricing; the pricing is very strong. We have unique capabilities and they are very much needed by major enterprises. So, we're in a very strong position there to be able to maintain growth.","Brad Zelnick","Thank you. And Jim, just to follow-up or add perhaps, in Tom's remarks, he had mentioned that you'd spent less on network costs in 2018 than in the prior year and Jim in your prepared remarks as well. You talked about efficiencies with bandwidth and qualification costs. Can you just remind us once again the sources of efficiencies along the entire stack? And how you're able to do that and what the limits of these are as we look out into achieving 30% and perhaps even beyond in the years to come?","Jim Benson","That's a great question. I mean this is not new for Akamai as you know. We've made tremendous progress on network efficiencies for a long, long time. And some of the things we've talked about in the past have been, we continue to implement new software to get more throughput out of our servers. And so, you certainly saw that I think because of our breadth and the amount of traffic that we serve from a bandwidth perspective, we get very favorable bandwidth pricing and in some cases, we actually get free bandwidth for our customers. The same is true for co-location that we've been able to reduce our co-location spend by reducing the footprint and getting more throughput out of the servers as I mentioned.","So, I would say it's not new. It's something we've been doing for quite some time. We continue to work on engineering innovation to continue to drive that. We continue to work on things around negotiations with providers and I expect those things will continue Brad. I do think that as I outlined at our Investor Day in June that I expected that network costs and our gross margins on a cash basis would be in the high 70s. And we're ahead of where I expected to be. So, I think we should be able to stabilize those margins from where they are. And as I outlined before that on the path of 30, we're pretty close. We'll call it -- we're at roughly 28% now. And we think we're going to be able drive more efficiency out of G&A in particular. We're building out a new procurement set of capabilities and we're going to be able to drive more procurement savings we've done some facility consolidation. We'll continue to do that and we're driving some IT enablement that will allow us to take more G&A costs out.","So primarily kind of going forward mostly from G&A. I'd say we're also getting some efficiencies on the go-to-market side as we build out a more efficient go-to-market model in both our Web and our media division. And so, I mean that's not going to be the bulk of where the incremental margin is going to come from it's going to largely come from G&A, but you'll also see continued improvements within sales and marketing spend.","Brad Zelnick","That's really helpful. But just to be clear, the tick up in CapEx in 2019, that's really just due to the $100 million one-time expenditure towards the new headquarters, correct?","Jim Benson","Yes. Yes. And I outlined at the Analyst Day that we'd have a big uptick kind of one-time for the new Cambridge headquarters. If you -- I think Ed outlined in his prepared remarks that if you actually adjust for that, we're actually well in line with our model that we've outlined a kind of 15% to 16% of revenue. So, the uptick in CapEx is all Cambridge headquarter related.","Brad Zelnick","Perfect. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Tim Horan","Thanks guys. Tom can you give us an update on your major hyperscale customers essentially. Where are they with do-it-yourself, do you think you're pulling ahead in terms of technology and cost capabilities versus them? And maybe the same color with some of the sort of competitors that are out there. Thank you.","Tom Leighton","Yes. Some of the largest Internet platform companies have do-it-yourself efforts. They are used for large software downloads, some basic delivery. Our services we believe are a lot more effective at doing this offer, a lot more scalability and higher quality and that's the reason there's so few of the companies that really could think about affording to do what themselves because that's a big cost for them.","I don't see any fundamental change in that landscape. In general, the competitive landscape as a whole hasn't really changed all that much. There's a lot of competitors, the folks that have been doing CDM for a long, long time, plenty of startups out there trying to get in the business. And of course, the do-it-yourself. No fundamental change. We, I think continue to gain share and we do that through superior performance, competitive pricing, the largest scale that's available on the Internet and increasingly our security solutions are very helpful for us in terms of gaining share especially with the performance solutions. We sell packages protect and perform, in the same platform that accelerates the side or delivers the content secures it and security is really important for our customers and nobody really is in a position to offer the kinds of capabilities that we do there.","Tim Horan","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Colby Synesael","Great. Thank you. A few questions on growth. I was hoping you can give us what the organic growth was in 2018, so backing out the benefit from some of the acquisitions that occurred in parts of 2017. And then, also what the implied organic revenue growth is for 2019 and maybe as part of that just what your assumptions are for Janrain. And then, my other question just has to do with the performance segment, I know you don't break that out anymore, but when you give your guidance for 2019, what is your just broad expectations or assumptions for that that went into that. Thank you.","Ed McGowan","Yes, sure. This is Ed. In terms of our organic growth last year, it's [4.7%] [ph]. If you look at Nominum headed about $40 million roughly last year to the growth rate. As far as our expectations around Janrain expecting it to be approximately $20 million not significant for 2019 in terms of revenue. But we do expect to get significant traction in the marketplace with our customers and expect to see significant growth going into 2020 in new Janrain products. And as far as the organic growth, now, we're expecting [cyber] [ph] security solutions to be growing in the mid 20s as Tom talked about it and if you do the math on that basically it would suggest that the CDM and other business is roughly flat and a lot of that is driven by trends that we're seeing in media. We had a very tough compare this year in terms of media, in terms of the gaming sector. We have a number of large renewals in the first half of the year. We've got some industry consolidation that's really adding to the impact of some of those renewals and a lot of these deals were put in place about 18 to 24 months. So, I'd say that's really normal things that you see in the media and entertainment place.","As far as the Web Division, we are continuing to see a little bit of pressure here in the commerce space as we talked about in the past and that's really what's adding to the flattening of our CDN and other business. We do expect to see that return to growth in 2020 as we expect to see a significant uptick in our media business going to 2020.","Colby Synesael","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Charlie Erlikh with Baird. Your line is now open.","Charlie Erlikh","Great. Thanks. I wanted to ask a question about the enterprise security products specifically. In the past, compared those enterprise -- I guess the enterprise business to what the security business was in its early days. And I just wanted to ask I guess, how the enterprise business has been doing so far relative to those expectations. So, I guess the question is, how is the adoption the bookings and the overall interest been relative to your initial expectations for that enterprise business.","Tom Leighton","Doing very well. Obviously, early days, but we had very strong bookings this year up substantially over 2017. And so, and we're anticipating even stronger bookings next year. So, I would say we're very pleased with the progress in enterprise security. I think in the long run, it should be a bigger business than the Web security business. You think about enterprises more of them, almost all of them in fact care about enterprise security. And only really certain verticals are focused on Web security, which is our current product set. And the amount of money that enterprises spend today on firewalls and trying to prevent data breaches is much greater than what companies will spend on securing a Web site.","So, I think the market's bigger and I think we're really at the cusp of a major change in how enterprises secure themselves. The notion of Zero Trust what everybody is talking about that now. Take years for enterprises really to fully make the transition, but the first customers now are embracing that and adopting Zero Trust Solutions. So, I think a very exciting future.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Sterling Auty","Yes. Thanks. Hi guys. First, Jim congratulations on completing a great tenure as CFO and Ed congratulations on your promotion.","Jim Benson","Thank you, Sterling.","Sterling Auty","And then, in terms of, you talked about the different detail around the growth dynamics into 2019. I think that's very helpful. But you did mention in the prepared remarks especially the OTT strength and with preparation some of the launches that have gone on. What are you seeing in terms of the uptick there and is the pricing in those opportunities different than what you've seen in traditional media delivery?","Tom Leighton","Yes. So, a couple of things there. And I'll start with the back, the last part of the question around pricing. Really pricing in the media space is really driven by volume. So, there's really no difference in terms of high volume with OTT customer or high-volume software download customer. We do tend to get additional value on our OTT space from security sales and professional services et cetera. But in terms of the traffic expectations as we look at the guidance, we take a look at the customers that we have today, we've got pretty good trends and track record in terms of understanding how their businesses grow. As we look out, I talked a little bit about some of the launches that may be coming at the back half of '19 and '20.","We tend to take a bit of a conservative approach there for a variety of reasons. Many of the things that go into an OTT launch that went past us really revolve around traffic growth and there's a lot to think about in terms of the exact date of the launch, sometimes launches can be moved. It is very complex technology and workflows that are involved. Sometimes customers want to launch them either in a limited fashion. It's really not until it gets to be a service that is a market that we really get a good handle in terms of what we expect in terms of volumes.","Also, other things that impacted is the service of paid subscription services is ad supported, what is the user adoption, what's our share of traffic, what's the engagement time of the user, what's the bit rate? So, as we look at 2019 any of these OTT offerings that are coming in the back half of the year were very, very conservative in terms of the adoption rate, the impact on outcome.","Sterling Auty","Okay. All right. That makes sense to me. And then, one follow-up would be, you gave the 28% operating income margin guide for 2019. I want to make sure I'm thinking about this the right way. What would that guidance have been under the old depreciation rules in terms of the four years instead of five years?","Ed McGowan","Yes. I said it's about $24 million FX, so it's a little less than a point. Yes, keep in mind also that I mentioned that we're taking on Janrain as well, so included in the guidance was the impact of Janrain. So, you'd have to add that back-in. So, if you add those two things roughly [net each other out] [ph].","Sterling Auty","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Keith Weiss","Thank you, guys for taking the question and a nice quarter. Two questions from me, one, just more broadly and I guess this is a question for Ed. Kind of walk us through again sign of where you guys get the confidence to sort of this for accelerating growth into 2020? And I mean forecasting is top [or saying] [ph] two years is really tough. But what are the kind of like mechanical things that you can see better growth in 2020? And then, one, this is probably for Tom. How do you enter in 2019? How do you feel about sort of your sales forces ability to sell outside of your traditional customer? I mean like the selling point within a customer of going from the guy who's traditionally in charge of the Web site to now selling directly to a [indiscernible] or just selling to other guys within the organization who hasn't traditionally been be the sweet spot for Akamai.","Ed McGowan","Sure. I'll take the 2020, the confidence there. So, one thing to think about -- I will talk about media first and I'll get into the Web in a second. If you think about media, there is a odd year, even year phenomenon and I talked about in the prepared remarks that 2020 will have additional events for us that we won't see in '19. And one of the reasons why our growth rate is a little bit lower in the media business this year is the fact that we did have some large events in 2018. That's one thing.","The other thing I mentioned was the -- some of the big renewals that are coming up and I touched a bit on the consolidation in the industry there's been some very, very big consolidation. And there you're taking, that will be a bit more of a decline in terms of your prices due to the fact that you've got no additional volume that's added when you put the two companies together.","And also, there are a number of services for example, the companies might have professional services engagements and whittle that down to one et cetera. But these things are very temporary. And what we see is you see a decline in the business. And then as traffic ramps you see revenue grow again so that that's one thing.","The other thing is that we've seen some significant security growth in both of our verticals. But sticking with media, we made a change back in the beginning of the year and our compensation plans and we saw a significant increase in our revenue from security and there's still a tremendous amount of wide space there to go.","And then, in terms of the OTT offerings I talked about, if you look at some of the offerings that are coming to market. Well, I talked about -- bit about being a little bit more cautious in '19 and '2020 we feel that those offerings will start to take hold in the market and we believe we're positioned very well to do so. And part of that is addressing some of these concerns around consolidation and being -- playing the long game in terms of being a partner and helping with some of the synergies on the cost side.","On the Web side, there's a number of go-to-market initiatives that we put in place. We're starting to see some pretty good traction in terms of our new customer efforts that we've put in place in 2018. We're seeing significant growth in outside the U.S. both in APJ and EMEA. We're also seeing some pretty good growth in APJ and Media as well. And then, just security in general within the Web Division, so a lot of wide space to go and then we're very optimistic about the Customer Identity Access Management demand that we expect to see there as well as an uptick in our enterprise security products.","So, all of that together gives us the confidence to feel that we'll see an acceleration in 2020.","Keith Weiss","That's super helpful.","Tom Leighton","And on your question about selling the security solutions, we've made a lot of progress there. Pretty much all of the sales force is expected to be able to sell security solutions and they're doing that with the Kona sales, the CSO, with a security organization pretty much always involved there even though that's sold to for the Web site. With the Bot Manager product and being all about fraud prevention there that's the security organization typically heavily engaged with that. Prolexic that's a data center protection level sale really nothing to do with the Web site per se. It protects all the assets in the data center. So, there we're dealing with the data center networking security side of the house.","We're putting a lot of effort in our marketing to get better known as a security company. Past year we hired a new Global Head of Web Sales, Scott Lovett who's well-known as a security expert. In fact, the large majority of our new customer bookings are led by security now. So, I would say we're doing very well and making the transition in terms of a sales force that sells CDN to a sales force that sells security.","Now the Zero Trust Solutions is the next step in that direction. And we're off to a good start there.","Keith Weiss","Thanks. That sounds great. Thanks a lot guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Brandon Nispel","Great. Thank you. Thanks for taking the question. I'm going to ask a growth question again. So, you mentioned the CDN business will be flat in 2019, but return to growth in 2020 due to the big events. What do you think is sort of two-year stacked growth rate and what's sustainable in that business over a multi-year timespan? That's one. And two, just to be clear, I guess more of a housekeeping, does your guidance embed pricing declines from some of the consolidation that's going on? Thanks.","Ed McGowan","Sure. I'll take the last question. This is Ed. I'll take the last question first. Yes, we did embed the expected pricing declines in our guidance. In terms of the core CDN business, if you look at our core CDN business excluding net giants just as the giants can sometimes skew some of the results. They grew at about 4% in '17 and above 4% and '18. We're calling for roughly a flat year here as we go through some of the items that I talked about and then a return to growth.","So, I think looking at that trend low single digits is probably the right way to think about that business. I think one of things that Jim pointed out some of their cost initiatives that are going on in that business, it is a very profitable business for us and it's something that we're going to continue to optimize as we go forward. And really in terms of the next big leg up in growth OTT once that becomes a significant portion of users viewing time that's the decision to begin to accelerate.","Brandon Nispel","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Michael Turits","Hey, guys. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Jim of course congratulations to you and a privilege working with you, and Ed, welcome to the slot and congratulations as well.","Jim Benson","Thank you.","Michael Turits","Two questions, one on CDN, one on security. First, one on CDN, in terms that that flattish growth for 2019. Is that any different in terms of the growth expectation for the media delivery piece as opposed to the Web performance piece within the CDN segment?","Tom Leighton","Yes. So, it's roughly the same, Michael. Give or take a percentage point or two.","Michael Turits","Right. So, it sounds like that's maybe a slightly an improvement maybe in performance stabilizing a bit?","Tom Leighton","I would say it's more stabilizing a bit.","Michael Turits","All right. And then, my next question is on Security. So, security isn't great. As you pointed out it's about $750 million run rate and you're looking to get it to $1 billion by 2020. But I think it's probably been mostly WAF and DDoS up to this point. But, the combined market for those two is only about $2 billion. So, it seems as if we're going to get to $1 billion yourself. Unlikely you'd be 50% of that market, so you must be anticipating a really good contribution outside of WAF and DDoS. Can you give us some sense for how big you think the non WAF and DDoS piece of your security business could be by 2020?","Tom Leighton","I think the vast majority of it will be WAF and DDoS in 2020. We do command a very strong share because we have really unique capabilities there in the market. Now that said, over the longer term we're looking for the non-WAF items particularly enterprise security, Zero Trust to drive a lot of growth. We also get smaller contributions would be from Nominum with their enterprise security solutions that we sell actually to carriers and they provide it as a channel. And there's smaller pieces here and there with the fast DNS, but the vast majority is WAF and DDoS. And I think it'll take a little bit of time for the other pieces really, which will be led by enterprise security and the Zero Trust solutions to be a big share of that. I would count Bot Manager as part of WAF, when I say Bot Manager that's part of WAF because that's a very fast growing product and that's a pretty good share of what we'll see in 2020.","Michael Turits","Great Tom. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Robert Gutman with Guggenheim. Your line is now open.","Robert Gutman","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering in the non-GAAP operating margin guidance for the year, is there anything else that's one time holding that back besides the depreciation in Janrain anything related to headquarters or is that all in CapEx?","Jim Benson","Yes. So, as I mentioned in Q3, we'll start to see the rent expense hits in Q3 associated with the new headquarters building. Other than that there's really no onetime items in it. Obviously, as I mentioned the Limelight patent royalty going away in Q3, but other than that there's really no other onetime items. But Janrain is also something that you need to -- keep into consideration as well in margin guidance.","Robert Gutman","Got it. Thank you","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Mark Mahaney RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Mark Mahaney","I want to follow up on some of the -- two of the OTT questions. Could you at least ring fence the opportunity in OTT for Akamai in kind of leaving aside the timing? How much of an incremental opportunity you see this some of the launches are relatively well publicized as to who hopes to launch an OTT service, but just maybe not talking specifically about customers, but whether any of those potential launches that are clear opportunities for you or some that just aren't because you don't -- you have never with that company. Just ring fence the opportunity both on the low side and high side in 2020 and 2021? Thank you.","Tom Leighton","Yes. Without talking about timing, we work with all the companies that have been rumored to have OTT offers. When Ed talked about before, it's really hard to predict timing and scale success, adoption and those kinds of things. So, we tend to take a pretty conservative view there in terms of our guidance. I think if you look longer term in what could be on a global basis for OTT, there's tremendous opportunity for growth. If you get to the point where the majority of TV or video watching is done online, which a lot of people think will happen and it's done at high quality say at least 10 megabits per second. There's the opportunity for orders of magnitude of increased traffic. Now timing on that is really hard to predict.","As you know there's a couple of companies that either do it all themselves and so we don't participate in their revenue, but for the large majority of the OTT providers those that are setting up new services both here and globally. We have very good relationships and are in a position to benefit.","Mark Mahaney","Okay. Thank you.","Tom Barth","Operator, we have time for probably one more question.","Operator","Yes, sir. Our last question will come Sameet Sinha with B. Riley FBR. Your line is now open.","Sameet Sinha","Yes. Thank you very much. And Jim and Ed congratulations on your next steps. A couple of questions here. Saw some nice leverage on the R&D line in the fourth quarter. Can you speak to that specifically what exactly is going on? Obviously that division has probably been impacted somewhat by the consultant recommendations and other sort of efficiency initiatives that you have.","Secondly, if you can just talk about the churn rate, this is the second quarter in a row where you mentioned that churn rate has gone down. Can you specifically address what are some of the key initiatives that you've taken to make sure that this means a continued dynamic? Thank you.","Jim Benson","On the R&D leverage. I mean as I outlined earlier the bigger source of leverage for the company for margin expansion is really going to come from G&A, sales and marketing to some extent and also some network costs. We did see a little bit of leverage in R&D. As you know, we capitalize a fair amount of our R&D spend for new innovation and you should you view that as good because that effectively means that new product innovation that's being incubated. We saw a bit of an uptick on that from Q3 to Q4 in our kind of capitalization activity, which has a benefit in your operating expenses. But I think by and large, we expect our R&D spend as a percent of revenue to be roughly flat over the next couple of years because we don't want to under invest in a critical area to drive growth for the company.","Tom Leighton","Yes. In terms of the churn rate that's all about making the customer happy providing great performance. We have great professional services. Our people are really great and the customers like that. Innovative new products. Our customers want to see a roadmap and investment and innovation to help them stay ahead of the game. A low rate of service incidents things that go wrong and we listen to our customers and engage with them. And provide them the level of service that they're looking for. So, in general our customers are very, very happy with Akamai and that's directly reflected in a very low churn rate. And we are very pleased to see it decrease further in Q4 and 2018.","Sameet Sinha","Okay. Thank you very much.","Tom Barth","Well, thank you. In closing, we'll be presenting at several investor conferences throughout the remainder of the quarter. Details of these can be found in the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. And we thank you for joining us and wish you a very nice evening.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for your participation on today's conference. This does conclude our program and we may all disconnect. Everybody have a wonderful day."],"381":["Akamai Technologies, Inc.

My name is Derrick and I'll be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We shall facilitate a question-and-answer session at the end of the conference. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Tom Barth - Head-Investor Relations","Thank you and good afternoon and appreciate you joining us for Akamai's third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Benson, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on October 27, 2015. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances.","As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of our website.","With that, let me turn the call over to Tom.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. Q3 was another solid quarter for Akamai on both the top and bottom line. Revenue in the third quarter was $551 million, up 11% year-over-year, and up 15% when adjusted for foreign exchange headwinds. Once again, revenue growth was especially strong for our Cloud Security Solutions, which grew 44% year-over-year in constant currency. Our annualized revenue run rate for our Cloud Security Solutions now exceeds $250 million per year, making Akamai one of the Internet's largest cloud security providers. Non-GAAP EPS for the third quarter was $0.62 per diluted share, exceeding the high-end of our guidance range and unchanged year-over-year, but up 5% when adjusted for foreign exchange headwinds.","Our higher-than-expected earnings were bolstered by a favorable tax rate from a higher mix of foreign earnings, which positively impacted non-GAAP net income by $5 million, or $0.03 per diluted share. I will be back in a few minutes to talk more about the third quarter and the opportunities that lie ahead.","But first, let me turn the call over to Jim for our detailed financial results and the outlook for Q4. Jim?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As Tom just highlighted, Akamai performed well in the third quarter. Q3 revenue came in slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range at $551 million, up 11% year-over-year or up 15% if you adjust for foreign exchange headwinds with solid growth across most of the business. Media revenue was $245 million in the quarter, up 5% year-over-year, or up 10% on a constant currency basis. As I mentioned in our last earnings call, we expected a moderation in media revenue growth when compared to our very strong Q3 of 2014. And while we had solid growth this quarter across the vast majority of the customer base, as expected, traffic and revenue growth slowed considerably in some of our largest media accounts.","As we have discussed in the past, the drivers of the media business, namely traffic volumes and price can lead to revenue variability from period to period, given the timing of customer renewals at lower price points, the size, timing and delivery mechanism of software and gaming releases, as well as the adoption of social media and video platform capabilities. And while media growth rates have moderated over the past few quarters as compared to the significant growth we saw in 2014, we believe the traffic and revenue growth upticks and downticks are just the nature of this business. We continue to remain bullish on the longer-term secular growth trends for this business.","Turning now to our Performance and Security Solutions, revenue was $263 million in the quarter, up 15% year-over-year, or up 18% on a constant currency basis. Within this solution category, we saw solid growth across most of the product lines. And as Tom mentioned, we continue to see strong growth in demand for our cloud security offerings. Third quarter revenue for our Cloud Security Solutions was $65 million, up 39% year-over-year or up 44% on a constant currency basis. We are pleased with our continued growth and the market recognition of our unique and differentiated cloud security capabilities.","Finally, revenue from our Services and Support Solutions was $43 million in the quarter, up 19% year-over-year or up 24% on a constant currency basis. We continue to see strong new customer attachment rates for our higher and enterprise class professional services as well as service offering upgrades into the installed base.","Turning now to our geographies, sales in our international markets represented 27% of total revenue in Q3, up one point from the prior quarter. International revenue was $150 million in the quarter, up 12% year-over-year or up 27% on a constant currency basis. The stronger dollar continued to weigh on growth rates and had a negative impact on revenue of $20 million on a year-over-year basis and $2 million on a sequential basis. On a constant currency basis, we continue to see solid growth in both our Asia Pacific and EMEA markets. Revenue from our U.S. market was $401 million in the quarter, up 10% year-over-year. Most of this quarter's media growth moderation came from the U.S. where our largest media customers reside. Outside of media, revenue growth was solid across the other product lines.","And finally, revenue through channel partners represented 26% of total revenue in Q3, down one point sequentially. Channel revenue was $146 million in the quarter, up 20% year-over-year in constant currency with continued strong growth coming from our carrier partners.","Moving on to costs and margins, cash gross margin was 77%, consistent with Q2 levels, down one point from the same period last year, and in line with our guidance. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation was 67%, consistent with the prior quarter, down one point from the same period last year, and also in line with our guidance. GAAP operating expenses were $252 million in the quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, acquisition related charges, and other nonrecurring items.","Excluding these charges, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $203 million, down $1 million from the prior quarter and slightly below the low end of our guidance primarily due to discretionary spending reductions. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $222 million, up $8 million from Q2 levels and up $9 million from the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 40%, consistent with Q2 levels and down three points from the same period last year and in line with our guidance. GAAP depreciation and amortization expenses were $75 million in the third quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation associated with stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, and the amortization of capitalized interest expense.","Excluding these charges, non-GAAP depreciation was $65 million, up $1 million from Q2 levels and slightly below our guidance given the timing of network and capitalized software projects deployed in the platform. Non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter was $157 million, up $7 million from Q2 levels and consistent with the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 29%, up one point from Q2 levels and down three points from the same period last year, and above our guidance due to lower operating expenses, as I described earlier.","Moving on to the other income and expense items, interest income for the third quarter was roughly $3 million, consistent with Q2 levels. Non-cash interest expense related to our convertible debt was roughly $5 million, also consistent with Q2 levels. As a reminder, this non-cash expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results.","Moving on to earnings, GAAP net income for the third quarter was $88 million, or $0.49 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $112 million or $0.62 of earnings per diluted share, coming in $0.04 higher than the high end of our guidance range. As Tom mentioned earlier, we had a more favorable tax rate than expected, driven primarily by a higher mix of foreign earnings which positively impacted non-GAAP net income by $5 million or $0.03 of earnings per diluted share. Excluding this favorable tax rate, our non-GAAP earnings would have been $0.59 per diluted share, coming in $0.01 above the high end of our guidance range.","For the quarter, total taxes included in our GAAP earnings were $26 million based on an effective tax rate of 23%. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $48 million based on an effective tax rate of 30% and lower than our guidance due to a revised full year 2015 tax rate projection that reflects a higher mix of foreign earnings.","Finally, our weighted average diluted share count for the third quarter was 180 million shares, down slightly from Q2 levels and in line with our guidance.","Now, I'll review some balance sheet items. Days sales outstanding for the third quarter was 59 days, consistent with Q2 levels and down one day from the same period last year. Capital expenditures in Q3, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $99 million, and coming in at the midpoint of our guidance range for the quarter. Capital generation continue to be solid in the third quarter. Cash from operations was $183 million in the quarter and $546 million year-to-date.","During the quarter, we spent $76 million on share repurchases, buying approximately 1.1 million shares at an average price of $72. At the end of Q3, we had $231 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. Our balance sheet also remains very strong with roughly $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on hand at the end of the quarter. If you factor in our convertible debt, our net cash is approximately $815 million.","As we discussed in the past, we believe the strength of our balance sheet and cash position is an important competitive differentiator that provides us the financial flexibility to make key investments at opportune times. As always, our overall goal is to deploy our capital in a manner we believe is in the best long-term interests of the company and our shareholders.","Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, holiday seasonality plays a large role in our performance, driven by online retail traffic for our e-commerce customers and traffic for our large media customers. As a result, it is the quarter that is most impacted by the external macroeconomic environment which remains hard to predict. In addition, we expect continued foreign exchange headwinds to weigh on year-over-year growth rates. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact of $12 billion compared to Q4 of last year.","Lastly, and most notably, we expect a decline in revenue in Q4 in three of our largest U.S. media accounts, driven primarily by slowing traffic growth compared to our very strong Q4 of 2014. The impact is expected to be magnified by their do-it-yourself efforts, but most of the impact is from less traffic growth overall. We are also anticipating slower traffic growth from our software download business which also had a very strong growth last Q4.","To provide additional insight, it's worth noting that media pricing overall has continued to decline at normal historical levels. Competition in the media business remains constant but is not expected to be a significant factor in our traffic and revenue estimates. And while we expect media growth rates to continue to moderate in the near term and heading into 2016, we remain bullish on the medium to long-term growth prospects for this business, namely the potential for an increase in the amount of video traffic that could move online. Over-the-top traffic is much more difficult to serve at quality and scale and therefore not subject to the same do-it-yourself activity you see for less performance sensitive areas like software downloads.","Factoring in all of these items, we are expecting Q4 revenue in the range of $557 million to $577 million. This range represents 6% to 10% growth adjusted for foreign exchange movement over an exceptionally strong fourth quarter last year. To frame the guidance range, if the holiday season traffic is particularly strong, you would expect to be near the higher end of the revenue range. If the holiday season traffic is weak, then we would expect to be towards the lower end of the range. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of 77% and GAAP gross margins of 66%. Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $204 million to $211 million.","We have purposefully slowed down the rate and pace of head count additions and discretionary spending to align with our near-term top line growth expectations. But we are continuing to make prudent investments in the business that we believe are necessary to build a foundation for a sustained long-term growth and scale.","Factoring in the various items I just mentioned, we anticipate Q4 EBITDA margins of 40% to 41%. And as I have been messaging, looking beyond Q4, we will strive to operate the company in the 40% to 41% EBITDA range for the foreseeable future. However, to be transparent, and as I mentioned last quarter, maintaining EBITDA margins at 40% to 41% will be heavily dependent on several factors, including revenue volumes, possible M&A, spending on platform capacity in anticipation of greater demand for our over-the-top video delivery services and foreign exchange movements.","Moving on to depreciation, we expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be $68 million to $69 million. Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 28% for Q4. And with the overall revenue and expense configuration I just outlined, we expect Q4 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.60 to $0.64. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $47 million to $50 million, based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of roughly 30%. This guidance does not include a benefit from the federal R&D tax credit which is uncertain to be reinstated by the year end. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 180 million shares.","On CapEx, we expect to spend approximately $78 million to $88 million in the quarter, excluding equity compensation. Of course, we will continue to balance network investment against future revenue opportunity and continued network initiatives.","Now, let me turn the call back over to Tom.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Jim. As Jim just mentioned, we are projecting some moderation in the growth of our U.S. media business, primarily due to slower traffic growth in a few of our largest accounts. Of course, we are never happy to see slowdowns in traffic growth rates. But as those of you who are familiar with our 17-year history know, we have experienced similar decelerations in traffic growth in the past, most notably in 2011. And in each case, Akamai emerged stronger and more diversified than ever before, as evidenced by our business performance over the past several years.","To be clear, the rest of our global media business is very healthy. Our overall media traffic is still projected to grow at a substantial pace, and I am very optimistic about the future growth of our media business. Major broadcasters and Internet companies around the globe are moving more media content online, and they are turning to Akamai for help.","Online media and the potential for broadcast OTT were central themes among the 1,700 participants from 42 countries at our eighth annual customer conference in Miami last week. Media customers at the conference reaffirmed their desire to move more content online and their desire to partner with Akamai to provide the ultimate in quality, scale, and security for the delivery of their video content.","At the conference, we demonstrated our latest end-to-end video delivery technology which is designed to manage the many challenges and complexities of delivering OTT content. This includes our unique approach of streaming content to a global network of over 200,000 edge servers located close to end-users, which allows us to bypass congested peering points, resulting in a more reliable viewing experience for end users.","Our superior communication and video transport protocols which are designed to deliver the kind of higher-quality picture that is expected by users and broadcasters alike, and our client-side software, which is now installed on over 100 million clients around the world and designed to greatly improve quality and scale while also lowering costs. There is, of course, uncertainty concerning the timing of when various OTT services may become available and also how successful they will become. Our goal at Akamai is to be ready and to help enable the adoption of OTT by providing a service with true broadcast-level quality and scale.","Security was also a top concern for customers across all verticals at the conference. Many customers toured our Security Operations Center in Fort Lauderdale where they witnessed first-hand how our flagship security solutions, Kona Site Defender and Prolexic, are differentiated by their scale, their sophistication, and their unique ability to sustain performance while leveraging our massively distributed platform as a defensive shield against attacks.","We also demonstrated our new Client Reputation and bot management services. Our first Client Reputation service was introduced in Q2 and already has over 40 customers. This service identifies IP addresses that have attacked or abused customer websites by leveraging behavioral analytics and the enormous volume of web traffic that Akamai handles. Our customers can then proactively alert or block the malicious users based on a risk score derived from their prior actions.","Bot manager is our newest security service and is now in beta with 18 customers. Bots are automated software agents, and they have become a significant issue for our customers. On a typical day, Akamai sees over 10 billion requests from over 60 million bots. Some bots, such as search engine bots, are helpful, but many are harmful. Malicious bots can steal intellectual property and personal information, scrape prices, and consume significant bandwidth and server resources. Some of our customers have been surprised to learn that over half of their traffic is from bots. Bot manager identifies over 1,200 types of bots and enables our customers to customize their response to request based on the type of bot. Typical responses include allowing fast and unlimited access for search engines, prioritizing the activity of partner bots, and slowing down responses or serving alternate content to malicious bots.","Although we are excited about our new Client Reputation and bot management services, our longer term ambitions for security are much broader. Thus far, Akamai's approach to security has been to focus on protecting data centers, websites, and web applications from cyber attacks. Going forward, we also plan to create cloud services designed to protect end users and enterprise employees from malicious web attacks.","Our first enterprise security product is scheduled for release in late 2016, and it is designed to detect and prevent phishing, malware, and data exfiltration attacks against enterprises. Building on the acquisition of Xerocole earlier this year, we have already deployed some of this technology in a product for our carrier partners which they use to block access to undesirable sites for their subscribers. This technology is already being used to process many billions of requests per day on behalf of 50 million subscribers across 21 carrier partners. We plan to combine the data gathered from these requests with the already enormous amount of data that Akamai gathers on a daily basis to further strengthen all of our cloud security offerings.","In addition to working with many of the world's leading carriers, we are also establishing close relationships with major cloud providers. Last week at our customer conference, we were very pleased to announce our new partnership with Microsoft, which will provide for automated access to Akamai's content delivery network through Microsoft Azure. The new Azure CDN offering is designed to optimize the delivery of content and the performance of applications deployed on Azure. As part of our expanded relationship, Microsoft sales force is also planning to sell Akamai's market-leading acceleration and security solutions.","In summary, we are continuing to focus on solving the grand challenges faced by our customers, delivering video over the Internet with unprecedented quality, scale, and affordability; providing near instant performance for websites and apps on any device anywhere; securing websites and data centers from cyber attacks that seek to disrupt their online operations, corrupt their data, or steal sensitive information; and scaling enterprise networks to handle new cloud workloads efficiently, securely, and cost effectively.","These are very hard problems, but I believe that Akamai is very well-positioned to provide solutions, and that by doing so, we can continue to return significant value to our shareholders. I also want you to know that while there will always be bumps along the way, I am as excited as ever about our prospects for future growth. Thank you for your time today.","Now, Jim and I will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question will be from the line of James Breen, William Blair.","Jim D. Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking the question. Just a couple of questions, one on the guide. Jim, can you give some color into the breakdown there? It sounds like Performance and Security is doing okay. So the weakness relative to where consensus was, is that mainly in the media group? And I guess for Tom on that, is this sort of a fundamental change with your relationship with those three big media companies? There has always been a concern about some of those large players doing it themselves in terms of handling traffic internally within their own networks. Can you sort of give us some color on that? Thanks.","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I'll take the first part of it. Then I can let Tom comment on kind of the do-it-yourself efforts. But certainly you could tell from the guide, this is predominantly a media story as far as the deceleration in growth rate that we're still having very, very healthy growth rates in our Performance and Security Solutions, and our Services and Support Solutions. We don't guide necessarily by product category, but if you generally look at the growth rates we've had in those other areas, you can certainly see that media growth rates are going to be effectively flat to up very significantly, or down very significantly.","This is largely in the Americas, and it is really very heavily focused on these three particular accounts, and as you can imagine, we had a huge, huge Q4 last year with these accounts. These accounts in Q4 grew well over 40% year-over-year last Q4. So it's a very difficult compare, but admittedly, we are seeing a slowdown in those accounts off of very strong Q4 of last year, and it is magnified by the fact they do serve some of their own traffic. But we believe kind of the bigger slowdown in traffic here is that traffic overall is slowing, not so much an acceleration and kind of do-it-yourself. And Tom can maybe comment on do-it-yourself.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I don't see a fundamental change in our relationship with our largest media customers. I am close to these accounts, and I would say our relationships are very strong. Now, as we've talked about, the largest few media companies do have do-it-yourself efforts, and we've competed with these efforts very successfully over the years, and I think we continue to do that. Now, one thing that happens when they carry a substantial portion of their traffic over do-it-yourself networks is, if the overall traffic is less growing at a slower rate and less than expected, well, there's a tendency to fill up the do-it-yourself effort first, and then we would get the remainder which leaves us with even slower traffic growth. And we are projecting to see some of that in Q4, and maybe into early next year.","The flip side of that coin, we saw last year, whereas if the traffic is growing stronger than projected and at a very fast clip, then we tend to get more than we would otherwise get because it flows to us. So the DIY effort does tend to magnify the swings, with the largest few accounts. And those customers do provide a significant portion of our media revenue and so you do see it reflected in the guidance going forward.","Jim D. Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC","And you're seeing the growth internationally. I'm assuming it's one \u2013 with some of those accounts as well, they're feeling that you are still going to be a main supplier for them in terms of transport outside the U.S.?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, we have very strong relationships on a global basis with the major media companies. We have not seen the same behavior that we have in the three accounts that we talked about. We haven't seen that behavior as much overseas. And in general, I am very bullish on the medium and long-term growth of the media business. We continue to invest there, and we are seeing the deceleration in the three particular accounts now, and that may persist for some time. But I think then, as we look at potential of more video moving online, we have to see what the timing of that is and the scale. But that could put us in a very good position for future growth.","Jim D. Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC","And just one last one. Does this at all change your longer term view of high-teen's growth over the next five years?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","We still have the same goals for 2020. We are on a good clip overall for that. I think we are ahead of where we needed to be. On the other hand, as growth decelerates in media in the near term, we'd like to see that reaccelerate in the future. I should also add, in terms of the DIY, the DIY is most relevant for the kinds of traffic where performance is not as important. An example would be a background software download. And there's literally been cases where it might take eight hours whereas on Akamai, it might take eight minutes and if it's in the background and not urgent, maybe that's okay. As we look to the future and you think about what really drives traffic growth in the future, and probably video is a big source of that, particularly live and linear video and broadcast moving over-the-top over the longer-term, that is much harder to do, and performance really matters a lot. And there were a lot less \u2013 DIY is a lot less competitive in that kind of situation.","Jim D. Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Gray Powell, Wells Fargo.","Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for taking the question. So your server account really spikes starting in mid-2015, and I guess that it's in anticipation of future traffic growth likely in 2016. I'm just kind of curious what kind of visibility do you have on initiatives that could drive traffic growth higher next year. And then what's your confidence level around them?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I would say that we have some visibility there, but there's a lot of uncertainty, and there's a lot of factors that are certainly beyond our control. I think with perfect hindsight, we probably would've spent a little bit less on CapEx this year, but we don't have perfect view into when various OTT offers will become available or how successful they'll be. And our goal is to be ready and to make sure that we have a platform that can deliver any broadcast OTT that becomes available in very high quality and scale and also make sure it's affordable. And so we will, as we talked about before, lean in there. And really the worst that happens is we are a little too early and that we will eventually be using that capacity. And we just don't know exactly when, but we're going to be ready.","Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's very helpful. And then that actually kind of leads into my next question. If I look at 2013 and 2014 and your cash expenditures like CapEx plus OpEx, they grew at a slightly faster pace than revenue. And then in 2015, we've seen a bit of a divergence with expenses growing more in excess of revenue. I know you don't want to give guidance on 2016, but when should we see more of a direct correlation between expense and revenue growth?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, yeah, to be clear, I think what you've outlined is true. But we were very clear that was our intention. The intention of the company back in the 2012 timeframe was we felt that we were going to purposely lower the financial model of the company to make what we thought were the right investments to drive future growth and scale. And so it was by design that we made these investments. Yes, they grew at a faster pace than revenue growth, more on the OpEx side than the CapEx side. And certainly, as you can see, we did moderate spending in Q3 with the near-term revenue moderation that we saw. We are moderating spending in Q4. And we'll continue to manage spending in alignment with revenue growth of the company.","I did provide some caveats that obviously \u2013 that depends upon revenue volumes, possible M&A we do and things of that nature. But I want to be clear that where the company financial model is now is effectively what we said we were going to do. Yes, this year we're going through a year where we're spending a little bit more on CapEx. So my \u2013 long-term model that I provided has 18% of revenue as kind of the high. And we're probably going to be more in the 19%. And that's largely from building up more network CapEx, as Tom mentioned, which is a bit in anticipation or was in anticipation of demand in the future. And as Tom said, the timing of that is very, very difficult to assess. But we get better visibility, call it, on a three-month window. And so we can always moderate future CapEx investments based on the visibility that we see.","Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. That makes sense. All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question will be from the line of Sterling Auty, JPMorgan.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, thanks. Wanted to start with \u2013 I still want to get a little bit more clarity in terms of when we look at the fourth quarter and the slowdown in media, exactly how much of the slowdown is the DIY impact versus how much of that slowdown is just general slowing volumes in the media industry or segment?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. It's mostly the former, which is the top three accounts. And again, these top three accounts in our media business represent a reasonably large percentage because these are big, big, big media companies. So the biggest share of the revenue deceleration and actually these three accounts are declining year-on-year. And so again, their revenue weighting is pretty high for our media business. The rest of the media business is actually performing reasonably well. We are seeing a little bit of a slowdown, as I mentioned, in our software download customers. And as we've shared with you in the past that the timing of gaming and software downloads varies from quarter to quarter, we're not expecting a huge software download quarter. We expect a reasonably good gaming quarter this quarter, but the bigger driver of the revenue deceleration is these large three accounts and modestly a little bit of softening in the software download customer base.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right. And that is the overall traffic is not growing at as fast a clip. And as we talked about a few minutes ago, when you combine that with an existing DIY infrastructure and the nature of that traffic, that can lead to substantially disproportionate deceleration in the traffic that we're carrying in those accounts.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So, about a year ago, you were willing to at least give us a way to triangulate the size of your largest media customer. I think you gave us a percentage of accounts receivable. Can you give us some sense of what portion of the media business these top three represent?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I'm not going to provide a specific percentage. Obviously, as I shared before, our largest customer, we don't have any 10% customers, but as I shared before, we obviously have had a 10% receivable customer in the past. And these three customers are, call that, no one is larger than the largest customer, but customers two and three are not that much smaller. So that gives you some kind of order of magnitude of the size of these customers. And these are almost predominantly, not exclusively, but almost predominantly media customers. So that's largely where you see the impact for our media business.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And last question (37:50) you talked, Tom, I think you mentioned that this impact could persist. Should we be walking away from this thinking that we need to see the OTT initiatives kicking in as the catalyst to get this part of the business to rebound, or is there any other items that could come along to offset some of this impact?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, the even years can be better in terms of the major sporting events like Olympics and so forth. And events themselves don't do that much, but they do tend to get people to try a higher bandwidth or higher quality format which drives more traffic, more devices are used. So there can be some benefit there. I would say if large amounts of content, broadcast content, comes over the top, that can make a difference. And then obviously we're sort of setting up a different base here, at least we're projecting to through Q4. And so just with time through the year, the effect will become mitigated in terms of our growth rates.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will be from the line of Steve Milunovich, UBS.","John M. A. Roy - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you for taking the questions. John Roy in for Steve. Hey, I know you don't have the OTT timing, but can you give us an idea what OTT might do to margins? Any type of color would be useful on that.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, the volume of traffic we talked about, I think, on the call last time. If you imagine, and I don't know if and when this will happen, you had five million people watching, and they were watching at a pretty reasonable quality, and the target these days is for 10 million people, that's 50 terabits a second, which is more traffic than we're pumping right now. So there's a large amount of traffic there. We are working, as Jim said, to stay in the zone of 40% to 41% EBITDA margins. If there was \u2013 inside there are things, as Jim said, that can take you out of that zone. But that's our expectation at this point in time.","John M. A. Roy - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will be from the line of Vijay Bhagavath, Deutsche Bank.","Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, thank you. Hi, Tom. Hi, Jim. Question on your DIY comments. We could have the Bears pick on that comment tomorrow morning. So please clarify to us the DIY commentary around over-the-top and also help us understand what aspects of the media delivery business that some of these customers would be doing it themselves. And then would that be like a contagion that could spread potentially to some of the other customers? Thank you.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right. Again, we've been competing with DIY in our largest handful accounts for almost forever, over 10 years, certainly. And DIY is mostly used for the delivery of items where performance is not important or where maybe it's easier to do static objects is an example. DIY is not nearly the kind of competitor to us for things like live and linear broadcast or content that might move over the top in a pay subscription kind of model where a user expects very high quality, they are paying for it and it's very hard to do. So that's where DIY comes into play. A top few customers do it. And to be honest, over time, I think they find that it's not as productive as they thought to do it, and so sometimes a large customer will end their DIY capability, and then you will see them a few years later try to start another project.","I know of one large account that's gone through the entire cycle twice. It's not something that I think even makes any sense at all for somebody who is not a giant media company, just \u2013 it's not going to be any kind of quality you'd want to have and it doesn't even make sense financially, I think. The very biggest media companies there, I think they've all tried it. Many of them use it and we have been competing with it for a long time very successfully.","Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And then a quick follow-on, Tom, on over-the-top. Could we view over-the-top more as an overlay service that would be accretive to EBITDA margins that over-the-top revenue dollars start flowing in? And then also with over-the-top, do you anticipate value-added opportunities such as student-forward (42:46), encryption, ad insertion? Would those be above and beyond how you monetize the core over-the-top traffic activity? Thanks.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, we monetize the end-to-end process for over-the-top, often with partners for some components of it. The large majority of the revenue there is with the delivery because of the scale and the enormous number of bits that might be carried if broadcast TV were to move over-the-top in a major way. It's not just free. There is substantial expense in actually delivering all that traffic and providing all that functionality. So it's not the kind of thing that just comes in as revenue with no cost associated with it. There is significant cost, including the build-out of the platform itself.","Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Excellent. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will be from the line of Mark Kelleher, D.A. Davidson.","Mark D. Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Great. Thanks for taking the question. If I look at your Performance and Security group, it looks like the sequential increase was entirely from the cloud security side. What's going on, on the other side, the web performance? What are your expectations there?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I mean, certainly that we had another very, very strong quarter in our Cloud Security Solutions, they grew 44% in Q2, they grew 44% again in Q3. You did see a slight moderation in, call it, the other businesses that are in there, the largest of which is our web performance business. We've seen a bit of a deceleration in their product line for the last few quarters. Bookings continue to be reasonable, as I've said before, that there is a tremendous amount of excitement with our sales teams in selling our new security offerings, and I think that there is a fair amount of focus in that area.","So, yeah, we probably could do a little bit better in that segment, we know that. We're doing very strong in security, maybe not as strong in the web performance business. But I think it's \u2013 we're keeping at it. There's a significant market opportunity for us to further penetrate in that space. It's just a matter of continuing to execute and innovate.","Mark D. Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question will be from the line of Michael Turits, Raymond James.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. A couple of clarifications and then a question. So just to make sure what right that you did expect the media delivery to be flat to down next quarter?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","And also, sort of a clarification is one \u2013 so through the two large accounts, a bulk of the impact was mostly DIY, organic slowing. But what really was the organic slowing due to?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, it's actually more \u2013 these three accounts, these big, big accounts do DIY and in a couple of these big accounts, Akamai is the exclusive CDN provider. No, this slowdown is not so much an increase in DIY. As Tom tried to outline, which is, overall traffic is lower. And so what's happening is that they've continued to build on DIY, which they've been doing all along and their traffic has moderated overall. They are serving more of the traffic themselves, and less is going to us. So if you generally look at it from a share perspective that yes, they are taking more of the share of the traffic, but it's because overall traffic in aggregate is less than expected.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And what's the reason for that slowing \u2013 that organic slowing of traffic?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I mean, that's tough to tell. I mean, this is the nature of our business that we can't control how many people are doing a download, how many people are doing various things. So that's really an end user thing. So why it's slowing for our customers is difficult for us to assess.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And if I get one last one in there, Jim, just to \u2013 did I mention or did you talk about the CapEx rate going forward? Any thoughts on CapEx in 2016, obviously you haven't given guidance, but where we might think about it relative to the range?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I mean, I think what I did say, I mean I provided guidance for the quarter. I think we said that, we'd be, call it, in the low $80 millions (47:28) for CapEx. So we're going to be a little bit above my long-term model of 18% this year. Again, we're going to strive to manage the company, call it, around the 18% of revenue going forward. That's the long-term model that I've highlighted all along. There is going to be periods of time as we've had before, it could be at 17%. There could be a period of time where we're at 19%.","I'm actually not going to quibble between a point here or there to be honest with you. We're going to make the investments that we think are the right investments for the business, either on R&D innovation, which is around software capital, or as Tom indicated, if we need to make more network CapEx investments because we think they're the right thing to do to support what we think is going to be coming demand, we'll do that. But generally speaking, we're going to strive to manage CapEx around 18% of revenue.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Jim.","Operator","Your next question will be from the line of Philip Winslow, Credit Suisse.","Sitikantha Panigrahi - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, guys. This is Siti Panigrahi for Phil. I just wanted to ask on the gross margin side, you came in at the low end of the guidance and I think also guided below consensus. Just wondering how much of this impact due to the CapEx investment you did in the last few quarters versus some of the \u2013 co-location and bandwidth costs that you are seeing in the quarter.","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, it's largely from what we've talked about. We've been building out CapEx really for the first three quarters of the year in a fairly substantive way. If you take the year-to-date, CapEx as a percent of revenue has been well north of 20%. We're not expecting that for the full year, because you're seeing it moderate here in the fourth quarter. So as you build up more CapEx and you deploy more servers in the network and you are incurring co-location costs, you're going to see an uptick in cost of goods sold. And certainly, as we've talked about, we're building out, or we did build out in anticipation of wanting to make sure that we have the capacity available. We did signal that that may have near-term pressure on gross margins and that's what you're seeing.","Sitikantha Panigrahi - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","But any changes in terms of co-location and bandwidth costs in recent quarters?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. I mean no change in \u2013 from a color perspective around in general the market for bandwidth or co-location spending. As you can imagine that, bandwidth in particular that as you have contracts in some cases that you have fixed port arrangements that you're building out, and if you're not building those fixed ports at a fixed cost that you're not monetizing. But again, that's something that we signaled that it was a bet we were willing to make. If in fact, we've built out more capacity than is needed, we'll grow into it. And so that's effectively what we're doing.","Sitikantha Panigrahi - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will be from the line of Heather Bellini, Goldman Sachs.","Heather Anne Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you. I've got a couple. I guess the first, going back to these DIY comments, I guess what I'm trying to parse, given the guidance for this segment in Q4, why isn't that going to persist for the next three quarters where you are going to be flat to down year-over-year? I mean this is the first quarter you've really made a big point about driving this home. So I'm not sure what's going to change over the course of the next three quarters that's going to make this growth rate be positive. So if you could comment on that. I know you are not trying to give long-term guidance, but it just seems like this is something that's going to persist until you anniversary it.","I guess the other part of the question would be just as traffic growth flows and I guess \u2013 I just \u2013 I have listened to some conflicting data. You're trying to say that it's not because they are doing more in-sourcing when in the beginning it said that you were seeing more in-sourcing. I get that your \u2013 the share of traffic is going down because volume is slower. But these top three customers all seem to be building out their own CDN networks as well. So is there a chance that this is just a new trend that you are going to have to live with, with your share of traffic that's just going to continue to go down? So I guess what gives you the confidence that that's not going to happen? And then my last question \u2013 sorry, to put so many in there, but how do you get to that $5 billion target you laid out in 2020 without M&A being included for at least a few points per year of that CAGR you are forecasting? Thanks.","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. That was a bunch. Let me try to take them in order. So I think we did signal in our guidance, I am not certainly providing guidance for 2016 on this call, but we certainly did signal that we do expect that what we're seeing here in the fourth quarter is going to continue into 2016. As you know, the nature of traffic is it spikes and as it goes up and it goes down. So it's difficult to predict whether, to your point, it is a wraparound and you go through this for three quarters and then you see it again in Q4. It's tough to tell. That is one possible scenario, the scenario that these customers' overall traffic volumes continue to accelerate and our share then increases. So these are customers that have planned to do DIY. They have been doing it for a while. It's very difficult to assess what's going to happen next year. But we do expect that there will be a moderation. As you've seen in the past, we've been surprised at the upside. As Tom mentioned, both in 2013 and 2014, we were talking about over-achievements in media growth, and we specifically talked about our large customers, and that's really what the driver was, the same phenomena.","Also, it's fair to say that growth outside of these three customers in the media is doing very well. Our international growth is strong in the media business, and is strong in other segments of our U.S. market as well. So again, we're going to go through a period here. How much affect it has on growth rates in 2016, I think, remains to be seen. But we do expect to see this persist into 2016.","And whether or not we're going to need M&A to hit our ambition for $5 billion that if you think about the markets that we are in, you look at the media market, and you think about the amount of traffic that could move online, that we would be poised to benefit from. That's a significant growth catalyst in the media business. Our Performance and Security Solutions by themselves have significant growth opportunities. And then there's new emerging areas that we are just barely getting into in cloud networking that by themselves could be huge growth opportunities for the company.","So there's enough catalysts across the portfolio to certainly achieve the ambitions that we have. The challenge you have with the media business is sometimes the media business is in acceleration and aids you in your quest to get \u2013 the CAGR needs to be around 17% to get there. Sometimes it's going to be lower, but I think over time, there's enough growth catalysts in the company to be able to do that. It's a matter of innovating, and it's a matter of executing.","Heather Anne Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. So M&A is not in your target then for 2020?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, no, M&A is \u2013 I would say...","Heather Anne Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","(55:18)","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We talked about the fact that \u2013 no, we don't have a specific number for M&A. We've been doing M&A where we think it makes sense for the company to either expand into an adjacent area that there has been technology tuck-ins that we believe that will help secure an area that we want to do from an innovation perspective. So we certainly did the acquisition of Prolexic, which did contribute revenue. Most of our acquisitions to date have not been revenue contributions, they've been more technology tuck-ins. That's not to say that we're not actively searching, and that there may be something that is of revenue contribution. But we don't have a specific target in mind for what M&A is going to be to deliver to the $5 billion ambition.","Heather Anne Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will be from the line of Mike Olson, Piper Jaffray.","Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Hey. Good afternoon. So based on the slowdown in media revenue, I would imagine a lot of people are going to start looking for signposts to give us a sense for whether or not OTT is starting to take off to come in and rescue the media business. What would you suggest the timing of that is as far as more and more material OTT revenue, and what signposts would you watch for if you were us for getting a sense if we're getting closer to that?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, we don't really know of any dates, in particular. I think in terms of watching for signposts, you'd look for offers that come to the market, you'd look for adoption rates of those services. Is it being successful, are users watching more video content online? And then we don't have any dates in mind that we're in a position to share around that. We're going to be ready and we're going to try to help enable it and then we'll see how things unfold next year.","Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","All right. And then on the security side, is it around 2,000 or so, maybe 5,500 total customers now that are using security around 35% to 40% of your customer base that are on a security solution?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's generally in the ballpark, yes.","Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","All right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question will be from the line of Colby Synesael, Cowen & Company.","Colby A. Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. Just wanted to go back to the performance portion of the business or DSA. That business, as you mentioned, Jim, has been, I think, weak relative to expectations for the last few quarters now. And I know you mentioned that really what needs to be done here is just better execution. But would you argue that it's more because the competitive dynamic in that aspect of the business has increased, which is making execution more difficult? Or is it that the products that you have right now are arguably ahead of where the market is in terms of demand, and we're just not there where you are seeing just a tremendous amount of demand whether it's for your products or either of your competitors' products in the segment of the business?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, I mean, I think it's difficult to tell that it's \u2013 certainly, we can execute better in that area. What share of it is driven by what drivers is tough to tell. There is certainly still a significant market opportunity for it. I think what we need to do is, in particular, and our sales team is doing this that you've got to go through multiple go-to-market motions both direct and indirect in being able to build out effective channel relationships to be able to sell this and get better acceleration on it that's not just from your direct sales force. It still is a product that requires a fair amount of handholding to be sold, so it's not an easily channeled sellable product. We're working on that.","And so there's probably an element of that that is disruptive to being able to get that business back to where we need it to be. But we do think that with continued innovation on the product side, as well as maybe continued focus from a go-to-market perspective around not just going deep and wide with our customers. So the customers that we're going to try to up-sell them to the higher value ion offerings as well as getting new customers, that's really the recipe. It's about executing on the innovation side and executing on the go-to-market side.","Colby A. Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will be from the line of Ed Maguire, CLSA.","Edward Everett Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC","Yes. Good afternoon. Just a question on traffic volume. So a few years ago, you had this phenomenon of the number of customers renegotiating their rates for large contracts. And I was wondering if that's a dynamic that you expect to come into play over the next couple of quarters. In other words, if the rate of growth in traffic at these largest customers is slowing, are they still paying a higher tariff? And is there risk of downward resets among some of your other customers on volume-based pricing?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Pricing steadily declines. And I would say in the period we are in now, it's pretty normal; nothing unusual or no bad news there in terms of our revenues. So now when customers send more traffic to us, they often get a lower price. So you have large volumes and traffic costs less per bit than small volumes and traffic. But if you look at constant amount of traffic through time, pricing steadily decreases, and there's really no fundamental change there.","Edward Everett Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. And if I may, the international growth is really strong. Is there an appreciable difference in the composition of the revenue contribution from your customers outside the U.S. that's really behind that growth? And is that itself sustainable as well in your view?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, we are very pleased with the growth in the international markets. It accelerated over Q2 that \u2013 I would say that we still think there's huge opportunity to continue to grow the international markets faster than our U.S. markets, for sure. But as far as the mix, actually, the mix contribution between Media, Performance and Security, and Services and Support is roughly similar across all three geographies. Admittedly, though, in the EMEA and APJ (62:22) geographies that there isn't any significant concentration from customers. And so they call it the diversification of their customer base is a little bit broader whereas in the U.S., we have very, very large U.S. media customers that tend to have a pretty high share of some of our U.S. media business. And so obviously when you have a downturn there, notable both for the U.S. market as well as the total companies, but that just gives you maybe a little bit of color on the mix profile.","Edward Everett Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Michael Bowen, Pacific Crest.","Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities","Okay. Thank you. Good afternoon. I hate to beat a horse here, but the more I listen to the call, the more I still keep coming back to the fact that we don't really seem to know collectively when or if the traffic volumes on the media side are going to improve. So maybe coming at it from this side, can you guys talk a little bit about what your thoughts are with regard to over-the-top as far as a TAM? And then give us some thoughts with regard to perhaps adoption in 2016. What's your \u2013 obviously, you are spending a lot of CapEx as a percentage of revenue to address this opportunity and others. So I'm trying to get a better gauge on timing and magnitude of this opportunity because right now weakness will continue into 2016 was your statement. But I have to think that that turns if OTT manifests like a lot of us think it will. Thanks.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I really can't comment on adoption rates in 2016. I wish I could, but I can't. But the TAM, what hypothetically could be possible is very large. Just think about all the people that watch TV, and imagine if even a very small portion of them started watching TV online. And you think about what quality they might do that at someday. The old DVD format, I say old, but the DVD format is about four megabits per second, compressed 4K. Sort of the next gen format is 16 megabits a second. The average of that is 10 megabits a second, and that's where we see the major broadcasters having an interest in targeting bandwidth rates for watching a single stream at 10 megabits a second. And as I mentioned earlier that if you had five million people doing that at the same time, that's 50 terabits a second and that's a heck of a lot of traffic, and that's only five million people.","Now, you think farther into the future, some people think that someday, I don't know if it's by the end of the decade or not, that maybe most watching, there's more watching online than on TV, the traditional mechanisms. And that's hundreds of millions of people and maybe 1 billion someday. So when you think about the TAM, it's an enormous TAM. And that's why I think there's so much interest, not here, but in the industry, around OTT. Now, I know you all are interested, as are we as when does that start. And we don't know. We are, to the point, today where we can enable it from the technology perspective and from the financial perspective.","We can do it at a good quality, we can do it at scale, not 1 billion yet, 1 billion viewers, but certainly the scale where we would start out and we can do it at a reasonable price point that can enable that to take place. And from there, we are watching and working with the industry to try to facilitate that to happen. But a lot of that is beyond our control. Certainly, the users at the end of the day, the subscribers, will dictate how much watching is done OTT.","Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities","And that's helpful. I mean clearly, we have two dynamics here, right? You've got whether or not overall traffic is going to increase, and I think it probably will due to OTT. But then you have got the DIY versus coming to you. So if you look at some of the smaller media companies, is there some type of threshold, or how can we think about what size company out there may think \u2013 how big do you have to be to do it yourself versus coming to you? How do they make those decisions? What are those breakpoints?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","We only see meaningful DIY in a handful of accounts, and it's not for live linear video. Now that doesn't say that someday people won't be doing DIY themselves for OTT broadcast content OTT. But we don't really see that today. The DIY we see is a handful of very large media accounts, and it's focused on more static \u2013 the delivery of static content and often where performance doesn't matter. Obviously, with paid subscription OTT, performance matters a lot, or the subscriber is not going to pay. They're not going to be happy. And as we look across the major broadcasters today, I really don't see DIY as being a factor there, at least for now.","Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will be from the line of Greg McDowell, JMP Securities.","Rishi Jaluria - JMP Securities LLC","Hi. This is Rishi Jaluria dialing in for Greg McDowell. Thank you for taking my questions. Mostly follow-up questions on all the stuff we've been discussing. First, just wanted to go a little bit deeper on CapEx. I know you have mentioned in the past that your CapEx is mainly server build-out preparing for this OTT opportunity. Putting aside questions around the timing of when OTT will become more widespread or see that adoption, at what point do you think Akamai in terms of its server build-out and capacity is going to be ready for that opportunity whenever it comes?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I mean, that's, obviously, we are building out based on discussions that we have with folks in the ecosystem. We've certainly \u2013 what is a lot of uncertainty about what is going to get introduced, when it's going to get introduced, what the adoption rates are going to be. So as Tom indicated, yes, we have done build-out and the build-out means that we have available capacity. It is an (69:17) infinite capacity, obviously. This would be, call it, we built out capacity for what could be the first wave of some level of over-the-top. I think we certainly did signal that we do expect generally traffic moderation going into 2016. And I do believe \u2013 just to be clear, I do believe that there are \u2013 the biggest catalyst that's going to cause traffic growth to reaccelerate is going to be continued movement of premium content online. The rate and pace of that is very, very difficult to assess. I mean, some of it is being done now. So it's not like it's not being done now, it's just being done now on a very much smaller scale.","The question is when does it start to get hold in a more fulsome scale, and I think that will be the catalyst. But I think without that, I think there are certainly headwinds that we have going into 2016 on traffic, just to be very clear. I think Heather asked earlier that is tough to tell with these large three customers what their traffic volumes are going to do, whether their traffic volumes accelerate or not. So there's a bunch of dynamics that will have an impact on the media business in the near term. So I just want to make sure we're clear that we think that there are certainly catalysts to grow this business in the medium term to long term. We're not calling out guidance here for 2016, but it's just important to be clear with you that certainly we do see deceleration in traffic. We do think that there are going to be catalysts for traffic growth. The question is rate, pace, and timing.","Rishi Jaluria - JMP Securities LLC","Okay, great. And then following up on OTT, you did mention it's a major opportunity for Akamai. And you also mentioned on this call that you're seeing slowdown in growth with your three largest, let's call it, U.S. media delivery customers. I just wanted to get a better handle on how significant that OTT opportunity internationally outside the U.S. can be.","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think the math is the same. It could be very significant. There's obviously a lot more TV watchers and people online outside of the United States than here. Many countries are better connected with their Internet than here. So in the long run, I would say it's a larger market, potential market outside the U.S. than inside the U.S.","Rishi Jaluria - JMP Securities LLC","Okay, great. And then in terms of \u2013 you touched on your partnership with Microsoft. Is this primarily going to be an impact on the Performance and Security side of the business versus the Media side? And what sort of impact do you think that it could have on the company over the next several quarters?","Frank Thomson Leighton - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I would hope it would have a positive benefit to both our Media business and our Performance business and our, for that matter, our Security business. That Microsoft will be selling all of our services and in terms of the basic Azure CDN capability, you will be able to automatically take advantage of Akamai's base level CDN capabilities.","Rishi Jaluria - JMP Securities LLC","Okay, great. And then last one, I will jump off. But it looks like this quarter the rate of employee addition is a lot slower than it's been in, I don't know, let's call it, the past six quarters. Was this primarily the result of cost controlling, or was this more in anticipation of this slowing down of traffic growth that you talked about?","James Benson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Certainly, when we guided for the quarter for Q3 that we certainly did guide that OpEx expense was going to slow, we certainly had better visibility of what we thought was going to be happening going into Q4 as the quarter progressed. And so we did moderate hiring as the quarter progressed.","Rishi Jaluria - JMP Securities LLC","Okay, very helpful. Thanks a lot, guys.","Tom Barth - Head-Investor Relations","Okay. Well, thank you.
