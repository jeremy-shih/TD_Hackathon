[operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Rodney Sacks. Sir, you may begin.","Rodney C. Sacks","Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice President and President is -- our Vice Chairman and President, is with me today; as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance.","Before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends.","Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company, that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call.","Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed March 3, 2014, including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements, for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during this course -- the course of this call, is provided in the notes designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated May 8, 2014. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section","We reiterate that our products are safe. More than 10 billion Monster Energy drinks have been sold and safely consumed around the world over the past 12 years. The long history of safe use of products containing caffeine in the U.S. has remained unchanged. Recent studies confirm that the average amount of caffeine consumed by the U.S. population has remained relatively stable despite the entry of energy drinks into the market.","As previously indicated and stated by the FDA in 2012, available studies do not indicate any new previously unknown risks associated with caffeine consumption, although the FDA has continued to explore whether additional research on caffeine or energy drinks is needed.","The Institute of Medicine held a public workshop in August 2013, in Washington, D.C. to help determine whether there were potential health hazards associated with the consumption of caffeine in food and dietary supplements. In January 2014, the IOM forwarded a report of the proceedings to the FDA.","Many studies conducted in recent years in the U.S.A., Canada and Europe, including a very recent study, have all consistently concluded that the principal sources of caffeine, for teens under 18, are coffee, soft drinks and tea, and not energy drinks. In fact, the recent article published by -- in the Journal of Pediatrics analyzed the consumption data. Even after including young adults, aged 19 to 22 years, in the most recent 2-year period study, 2009 to 2010, only some 6% of the caffeine consumed by all persons 22 and under was from energy drinks, as compared to 24% from coffee and 38% from soda.","If young adults aged 19 to 22 are excluded as they are neither children nor adolescents, the percentages are even lower with the result of less than 3% of the caffeine intake for children and adolescents 18 and under comes from energy drinks.","To put the level of caffeine in Monster Energy drinks in context, we, again, remind listeners that a medium Starbucks 16-ounce large brewed coffee contains approximately 350 milligrams of caffeine, which is more than double the approximately 160 milligrams of caffeine that is contained in the same-sized Monster Energy drink.","On April 30, 2014, the American Beverage Association formally adopted new U.S. model guidelines for energy drink companies that are supported by the company, as well as all the other major energy drink companies in the U.S.A.","In the litigation between the company and the city attorney of San Francisco, the company recently filed a motion to strike allegations in the complaint, challenging the theory for relief previously rejected by the court, as well as a motion to bifurcate and\/or stake of claim relating to the safety of Monster Energy drinks pending resolution of the ongoing FDA investigation on the safety and labeling of food products to which caffeine is added. These motions are calendared for hearing on May 21, 2014.","In the Kona federal securities case that has been pending since 2008, the company entered into a stipulation of settlement on April 16, 2014, that, if approved by the court, will resolve the litigation and result in the action being dismissed with prejudice. The proposed settlement contains no admission of liability or wrongdoing on the part of any of the defendants, each of whom continues to deny all the allegations. The full amount of the settlement will be paid by the company's insurers -- insurance carriers.","The company assumes no obligation to update any statements made with respect to ongoing litigation and regulatory matters, including with respect to the foregoing disclosures, whether as to new information, future events or otherwise other than as required by law.","Given the current litigation and pending regulatory requests, will refrain from answering questions or commenting further on these specific subjects. We are happy, of course, to answer questions that you may have about our products in general, or about the first quarter as best as we can, after we have concluded our discussion on the business.","Turning to the business. In the first quarter of 2014, the beverage market, generally, in the U.S.A. continued to experience softness. In contrast, the energy drinks sector in the U.S.A. grew in the high-single digits.","In the first quarter, the company achieved record growth sales, up 10.6% to $613.7 million and net sales up 10.7% to $536.1 million. Sales of our Ultra line continued to improve during the quarter, while sales of our Muscle Monster line continue to gain traction. Sales of our Monster Original Green Energy Drink also increased in the quarter.","According to Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through March 15, 2014, in the convenience and gas channel, Muscle Monster was the second best-selling brand in the protein supplement sector and achieved a 23.1% market share. Although Muscle Monster's ATV distribution levels have improved, they are still relatively low at approximately 56%. We are working with our distributor partners to improve these levels. We believe that as we achieve increased distribution levels for that line, Muscle Monster's market share will continue to improve.","We are pleased with the sales achieved in the first quarter. Our revenues were affected by less robust growth rates for the energy category, as a whole, in certain of our overseas markets, including within EMEA, and especially Eastern Europe, increased distribution of sales in the U.S.A. of our Ultra line, as well as new Muscle Monster line, sales in the U.S. of our Ultra line were low accretive did result in some cannibalization, generally across our existing SKUs, primarily Absolutely Zero and Lo-Carb.","The sales of Monster Energy products in glass bottles in the U.S.A. were lower during the quarter. Our operating income was up 38.7% to $148.9 million. During the first quarter, our operating income was negatively affected by professional services costs of $5 million related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the company's marketing, promotions, ingredients, labeling and safety of its Monster Energy drinks, which we believe are exceptional in nature.","Diluted earnings per share increased 49% from $0.37 per share in the first quarter of 2013 to $0.55 per share in the first quarter of 2014. Distributed terminations were 0.01 million in the 2014 first quarter compared to 8.3 million in the corresponding quarter last year.","Net income was reduced by foreign currency losses of about $200,000 this quarter as opposed to $4.7 million in the same quarter last year. The effective tax rate decreased from 39.8% to 36.1%, which was primarily the result of profits earned in certain foreign subsidiaries that have no related tax expense as a result of the prior establishment of valuation allowances on their deferred tax assets.","The effect on diluted earnings per share of professional services costs related to regulatory matters and related litigation, net of tax, is approximately $0.02 per share. According to Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through April 26, 2014, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including Shots, increased by 6.8% versus the same period a year ago.","Sales of Monster grew 15.1% in the 13-week period, while sales of Red Bull increased by 4%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 4.7%, and sales of 5-Hour decreased by 3.2%. Sales of AMP were down 12.3%, NOS increased sales by 26.3%, and sales of Full Throttle increased 5.7%.","According to Nielsen reports for the 4 weeks ended April 26, 2014, sales of energy drinks in the convenience and gas channel, in dollars, increased by 6.7% over the comparable period in 2013. Sales of Monster increased by 13.4% over the comparable period last year, while sales of Red Bull increased by 2.8%. Rockstar was up 2.6% while 5-Hour was down 1.7%. NOS was up 24.7% and AMP was down 7.7%.","According to Nielsen for the 4 weeks ended April 26, 2014, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased by 2.1 points over the comparable period a year ago to 35.4% against Red Bull's share, which was lower at 34.5%. Rockstar's share was lower at 7%, 5-Hour's share was lower at 9.2%, while NOS share was higher at 3.3%.","According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended April 26, 2014, sales of Energy Plus Coffee drinks, in dollars, in the convenience and gas channel increased 12.8% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 7.1% higher than in the comparable period last year, while Starbucks Double Shot energy was 21.7% higher.","According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel, in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended March 8, 2014, the energy drink category grew 2%. Monster sales increased 11%. Our market share increased 2.4 points to 28.3% over the comparable period last year. Red Bull sales increased 1% and its market share decreased 0.5 point to 36.6%. Rockstar sales increased to 12% and its market share increased 1.5 points to 16.9%.","According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined, in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 14.5% in the month of March 2014. Monster sales increased 23.3%. Our market share increased 2.6 points to 37.1% against the comparable period last year. Red Bull sales decreased 19.2%, and its market share decreased by 11 points -- 11.1 points to 26.5%.","Boost sales increased 42.9% and its market share increased 3.1 points to 15.7%. And Vivo 100, new in 2013, has grown to 8.5% market share, while Coke's market share represented by Burn and Gladiator decreased 3.1 points to 9.3%.","The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced, positively or negatively, by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain, in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.","Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 11.8% to $514.4 million for the 3 months ended March 31, 2014, from $460.2 million in the same period in 2013. Operating income for the DSD segment increased 34.2% from $139 million to $186.5 million.","Gross sales from original Monster Green Energy Drink continued to increase in the quarter as did sales of Java Monster. However, the increase in sales of these products, together with the sales of our Ultra and Muscle Monster lines, as well as certain other Monster Energy products, was partially offset by lower sales of certain Monster SKUs, including Monster Energy Absolutely Zero, Lo-Carb Monster Energy, the Monster Rehab line and Import.","Net sales of our Peace Tea line were higher. Net sales for the company's warehouse segment decreased 9.5% to $21.8 million for the 3 months ended March 31, 2014, mainly due to the reduced sales of Hubert's Lemonade, in part, due to a purchase last year by a large customers that was not repeated in the same quarter this year. Operating income decreased from $0.4 million to $0.3 million in this quarter.","For the 3 months ended March 31, 2014, gross sales to retail grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers represented 4% of gross sales, up from 3% in the comparable period in 2013. Gross sales to club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represented 9% of sales, down from 10% in 2013. Gross sales to full-service distributors represented 62% of sales, the same as in the comparable period in 2013. Gross sales internationally were consistent at 23%. Other sales at 2% for the period were also consistent with the comparable period in 2013.","Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the first quarter of 2014 amount to $144.3 million compared to $130.7 million in the same quarter in 2013. Included in such sales are sales to company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas.","Net sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in the first quarter of 2014, in dollars, were 5.2% higher than the same period last year. Net sales in Europe and the Middle East alone were 9.3% higher than the same period last year.","As I mentioned in our conference call on February 27, in anticipation of the introduction of a sales tax on energy drinks in France on January 1, 2014, our distributor in France increased its purchases in the fourth quarter of 2013 by an estimated $3 million and which we estimated resulted in a reduction in our sales to our French distributor in the first quarter of 2014 by a similar amount. We have implemented a formula change for our products sold in France to address this tax. We estimate that as a result, our sales in Europe were negatively affected in the quarter by about 4.2%.","Sales from our distributor in South Africa during the quarter were also negatively impacted by a price increase in South Africa, which took effect over a few months in 2013, as well as the shift in timing of a promotion with a large retailer from the first quarter of 2013 to the second quarter of 2014.","Monster continues to gain momentum and increase its market share at retail in Europe, and in particular in the United Kingdom, Spain, Greece, Sweden, Belgium, France, Germany and Hungary, as well as in South Africa. Group progress is made in Western Europe and Africa in increased distribution levels and sales.","While the Central and Eastern European market is still incurring operating losses, we are seeing improved results from the strategic changes we implemented during last year. Overall, our EMEA division traded profitably during the first quarter of 2014.","The addition of Monster Ultra Blue and Ultra Red, as well as the launch of our Muscle Monster line in 2013, was successful. We're continuing with our expansion strategy in international markets. In addition, we are proposing to launch Monster in a limited number of countries in Asia, Central and Eastern Europe and Africa this year.","Sales of the Monster Energy brand internationally, including Japan, in particular, continue to grow satisfactorily. Relative to the comparable quarter last year, the weaker yen negatively affected our growth sales in U.S. dollars, as well as our margins in Japan during the quarter. Sales to our Japanese distributor in the first quarter of 2014, both in yen and in dollars were higher than sales in the comparable quarter last year.","Production in Japan has commenced and plan for production elsewhere in Asia continue to move forward. We are also moving ahead with our plans to produce Monster Energy drinks in India, as well as in South Africa. Sales in Chile continued to progress. Our distributor in Brazil continues to secure increased distribution from month-to-month.","We are continuing with our strategy to secure local production in certain of our international markets in order to improve gross margins, reduce freight, reduce damages and assist in mitigating the effects of exchange rate fluctuations.","Net sales of Peace Tea for the first quarter were higher than in the comparable period in 2013. We continue to believe that the Peace Tea brand has good growth potential and have added a mango juice cocktail to the line. We are planning to launch an iced coffee line in glass bottles under the Peace Tea brand later in 2014.","In the Warehouse division, sales of Hubert's Lemonades in glass bottles for the first quarter of 2014 were lower compared to last year, largely due to a purchase by large customer last year that was not repeated in the same quarter this year.","Gross profit as a percentage of net sales achieved in the first quarter of 2014 was 53.5% versus 52.1% in the comparable quarter in 2013. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to a small decrease in allowances and lower cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales.","Gross profit percentage achieved in the first quarter in North America in 2014 was higher than in the comparable quarter last year. Gross profit percentages achieved outside North America for Monster Energy were lower in the first quarter of 2014 than in the comparable quarter in 2013.","We have covered a significant portion of our anticipated requirements for aluminum cans in 2014, as well as a significant portion of our anticipated requirements for apple juice and sugar over the same period. We do not believe that, at current levels, increases in cost of any raw materials will have a material negative effect on our margins.","Distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales in the first quarter were 4.7% versus 4.6% in the comparable quarter in 2013. Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 10.7% in the quarter versus 13.5% in the comparable period in 2013.","While sponsorships and endorsement costs, as well as commissions were higher, cost of premiums, allocated trade developments, social media and point-of-sale were lower during the quarter. Total general and administrative expenses decreased 3.3% in the first quarter. The decrease in general and administrative costs was primarily attributable to an $8.3 million decrease in distributed termination costs in the quarter.","The decrease in general and administrative costs was partly offset by increased professional service costs for legal accounting and other professional costs. $2 million of the increase in the quarter related to regulatory matters and litigation regarding our Monster Energy drinks. Federal expenses and insurance costs also increased by approximately $3 million.","Operating income increased 38.7% over operating income for the same period a year ago. We are continuing to work towards reducing our overall operating costs in our international markets. We recorded foreign currency exchange losses of $200,000 for the quarter as compared to $4.7 million in the same quarter last year.","Our effective tax rate in the 2014 first quarter was 36.1% compared to 39.8% in the 2013 first quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of profits earned in foreign subsidiaries that have no related tax expense as a result of the prior establishment of valuation allowances on the deferred tax assets. During the 2014 first quarter, no share repurchases were made under the board authorized share repurchase program.","Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $312 million compared to $211.3 million at December 31, 2013. Short-term investments were $438.9 million compared to $402.2 million at December 31, 2013. Long-term investments, which are comprised of certain auction rate securities, decreased to $8.1 million from $9.8 million at December 31, 2013. Included in the long- and short-term investments are auction rate securities having a fair value of $14.5 million.","Accounts receivable, net, increased to $342.1 million from $291.6 million at December 31, 2013. Days outstanding for trade account receivables were 50.5 days at March 31, 2014, and 50.4 days at March 31, 2013, compared to 42.5 days at December 31, 2013.","Inventories decreased to $204.1 million from $221.4 million at December 31, 2013. Average days of inventory was 73.7 days at March 31, 2014, which was lower than the 83.5 days of inventory at March 31, 2013, and lower than the 75.6 days at December 31, 2013.","We recently launched the new Punch Monster line by converting our existing 2 Dub Edition products into Punch Monster products with new can graphics and flavors. We are planning to launch new additions to the Monster family later in 2014.","Gross sales in April 2014 were approximately 7.8% higher than in April 2013. We caution, again, that sales in a single month and over a short period are often disproportionately affected by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall and the timing of promotions in retail stores and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period.","In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points: North American gross margins remain healthy. Our 2014 first quarter gross margins for North America were higher than in the comparable quarter in 2013; two, Nielsen market statistics show that energy category growth has recovered to the high single digits, and that Monster Energy's growth is still outpacing the growth of the category as a whole; three, new additions to the Monster family is that we're introduced during 2013 are continuing to gain market share and contributing positively to the overall increase in the company sales; four, we believe that our recently launched new Punch Monster line will appeal to a broader consumer demographic than the Dub Edition and will be positively received by distributors and consumers in 2014. Our new Strawberry and Peanut Butter Cup Muscle Monster Energy shakes are performing well and should further enhance the Muscle Monster line in 2014.","Turning to international markets, we're pleased with the performance of our international expansion and investments, particularly Japan, United Kingdom, Spain, South Africa, Brazil and Chile. According to Nielsen in the 13-week period to the end of March 2014, the actual days of the 13-week period vary by a few days between different markets.","Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 18.7% to 21.1% in Spain; from 18.4% to 18.5% in South Africa; from 16.2% to 17.9% in France; from 18.6% to 27% in Greece; and from 7.9% to 8.1% in Germany.","In Great Britain, Monster's retail market share value for the 4 weeks ending April 26 grew from 10.3% to 10.7% -- 10.8%. I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country to country;","Nine, it is noteworthy that even though the energy drink category has been in existence in Europe for over 26 years, our EMEA markets on average are still experiencing single-digit growth while Monster continues to grow in excess of the category; ten, sales of Monster in Japan are continuing to increase and remain encouraging. We have finally commenced production in Japan; 11, we were finally able to obtain a regulatory approval for the sale of Monster in India late last year. Sales in the quarter have progressed satisfactorily; 12, as advised by Ambev, distribution levels and their sales in Brazil to their customers continue to improve.","I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from John Faucher from JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Want to talk a little bit about the margin expansion in the quarter and, Rodney, can you talk a little bit about, particularly on the gross margin line, with the gross margin up a lot this quarter, how are you -- how should we look at that in terms of maybe some favorability of raw material trends versus some of the more structural changes you're making in terms of moving the manufacturing more to the local markets? And then, also, if you can give us a little bit more color on the SG&A leverage, which was very strong in the quarter. Are you finally getting to that point in some of these markets, you talked about European being positive, where you're really getting solid leverage on some of the marketing investment you've been making for the past couple of years?","Rodney C. Sacks","Well, let's just deal with the margins. I think, sales mix is clearly one of the most important factors that has influenced the margin change. This can be seen from the fact that we've had the very successful increase in sales of our Ultra margin -- Ultra line. The Ultra line cost-wise has a lower cost of goods than some of the other lines, particularly lines like the juice lines or any of the java lines or Muscle Monster lines. So when you weigh the numbers, clearly, that has helped our margins. And we also had, as we indicated earlier, some cost of goods as well. Also sales of Peace Tea, in many cases we've gone away from the $0.99 price, pre-priced cans, so our margins have improved slightly on Peace Teas. We've also been able to lower some freight expenses, we reinstated a co-packer in the Texas market, which is a pretty big market for our product, which, if you eliminated a lot of freight we were incurring in shipping product into that market from surrounding states. So when you take into account the fact that you're looking at the substantial volume we've actually been able to achieve, look at the Nielsen's on the Ultra line, and being a lower-cost item, that has primarily been the primary source of the extra margin. We also had to put of our pricing on 24-ounce and that is starting to show through on the margins as well. And that package is also starting to come back and do quite nicely. The -- with regard to the operating expenses, one of the large differences was incurred in basically the cost of premiums decreased due to the gear promo, which was very successful promotion we've done in past years, but it was costly promotion, in supplying gear and sending it out to consumers. And so we had alternative promotions this year, which we felt were good, but didn't involve us in having to contribute as much back to the consumer through benefits. So that helped us quite a bit. We also, as we indicated, we sort of basically took a closer look at International Operations. We pulled back on a number of expense items, some sampling and sales people in the markets. We also pulled back on some sponsorship opportunities and promotions internationally, with the result that we -- overall, we've just been able to, in fact, reduce our selling expenses, which has been very fortunate for us. If we just look at -- we also have the effect, as we indicated earlier, of the distributed termination costs, which is a large item, which hit our P&L last year in the comparable quarter. So clearly, we are getting to a point now with the steps we've taken to operate more leanly overseas. We are getting positive profits from Europe now and we actually -- we believe we will continue that sort of trend going forward.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mark Astrachan from Stifel.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","I guess, I wanted to dive a bit deeper into the April number, the plus 7.8%. Maybe just talk a bit about what you're seeing from a trend standpoint that resulted in what seems to be a pretty good deceleration for a first quarter, and maybe, just more broadly, how you're looking at trends through the first quarter and into April, given the January number was also better than what the overall first quarter sales number came in at.","Rodney C. Sacks","Yes, I think, again, in this month, in particular, I think, you got to take into account that these are one monthly numbers. We've seen some non-matching trends when you look at things like Nielsen because we basically find that we don't work to timing a particular month. And if you take, for example -- we've seen some destocking or just managing of entire inventories from our distributors. Again, we -- in many cases, we don't have visibility to their stock, but for example, I'll give you one example. In 2013, the short lead orders, which are orders that are placed -- they're require shipment within 6 or 7 days, last year, we received from CCR a total of 42 orders, which was 1.3% of the total orders got into the we-urgently-need-inventory category. In 2014, the short orders -- short lead orders had increased to 272 orders, which was 6.7% of the total orders. We believe they are -- they have reduced inventories and are managing their inventories much more tightly, but the result is that, that means that they've run out inventories more quickly on this, and then they need these urgent orders to replace them. But again, most of our distributors and bottle partners we don't have visibility on their stock policies. Sometimes, you get some idea, we have a feeling about it but we don't always. So I think that what is important to us ultimately is the trends that you see from the Nielsens, which are really showing consumer demand at the retail level. That's showing the pull-through from month-to-month. And we think that. When you look on a longer-term basis, those are more indicative of the trends than looking at the one monthly numbers. But -- and that's why we do have that caution because really is something we need to be cautious about.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And maybe if you could just touch on sort of sequential trends through first quarter. And then just sort of a related question, how much was the FX impact on the international revenue growth line? And inclusive of that, what was the Japan impact?","Rodney C. Sacks","I think that was about 0.5% -- it's about a 0.5% higher, yes.","Operator",".","Our next question comes from Amit Sharma from Bank of Montr\u00e9al.","Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Can you talk about -- and this is a follow-up to what John was asking in the international profitability, I mean, you mentioned that Europe is now positive and also some tax benefits from profitability in some international markets. Can you give us some idea where profitability is in some of your key markets and which of them are now profitable versus not making money?","Rodney C. Sacks","I think we've -- we have broken it down to as much as we want to, we don't break it -- we're not going to break it down any further. Because the other markets are really new and they're choppy. They're being affected by many factors where you do promotions, where you've got -- we do have issues with foreign exchange and goods damages and shipping costs. Like for example, with Japan, we're now right in throes of changing over to local production so we think that will have a big effect. But the tale of the issues we've been facing, affect these numbers quite dramatically. And for that reason, we think that it really wasn't -- it's not appropriate to break it out into the other markets here. We have focused on the main international area at the moment, which was Europe, which we've gone positive and that's, I think, a very important turning point for the company. We believe that as the other markets starts to settle down, we start to be able to get local production, those results will also improve as we go forward.","Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then the tax benefit that you had during the quarter, is that sustainable through the rest of the quarters as well, the lower tax?","Rodney C. Sacks","We think regarding [indiscernible] it's probably pretty much up.","Hilton H. Schlosberg","As long as there's profitability off season, yes.","Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Got it. Okay. And then...","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Powers with UBS.","Stephen Powers - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I guess, so going -- first, going back to what you're saying regarding channel inventory relative to Nielsen trends, which have been stronger, at this point, do you feel there's still essentially excess inventory to work through from your distributors or are you seeing more of a catch-up that's yet to come as the year progresses?","Rodney C. Sacks","It's -- again, it's something which we really don't have the visibility on, but we have seen this trend. And it gets to a point where, obviously, we are seeing -- it's not going to be able to go on forever. But -- and as we believe they are likely to start getting more in line. But that -- we're just facing our sales. And unfortunately, people look at the Nielsens in advance, and then obviously you look at our sales and then you do the comparison all the time. They just really are not comparable. There's various reasons why we don't necessarily match all the time, particularly in newer markets where you're starting a new market, your customer may order too much or may order to little. And then, you have a catch-up, and then he gets pipeline, and then the next year, he's got a sales trend, and then all these factors that continue to influence the relationship between Nielsen. As you get to more stable markets, long mark to [indiscernible] they do have -- start to have a much closer correlation but even in the U.S. nets that I alluded to, we have this situation now where we do feel we have -- there has been a realignment by our larger customers to try and manage down their inventories, and that has an effect on our sales versus when you look at the market. Obviously, there are other issues in the market that also change, which is timing, but that would be the main reason we feel.","Operator","And our next question comes from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess, Rodney, I guess, I just wanted to circle back on the April number I don't want to really get this into too much -- just understanding it's just one month. But what I'm hearing from you is that from a consumer kind of takeaway, all the trends that you're seeing, both at Europe from your brands and in the category levels seem to be relatively healthy. The full down [ph] really appears to be driven by the inventory movement at your wholesalers, primarily in the U.S. market. Are there any other markets that you're seeing this inventory kind of disconnect continuing? I think, in the second quarter, or sorry, the first quarter, you said Japan was up year-over-year. I think Asahi had numbers up by 40% so I'm just trying to reconcile what's happening in the U.S. from underlying versus inventory, and then also some of the international markets.","Rodney C. Sacks","Yes. If you take the -- basically, South America and Asia Pacific markets, in the month, those were down. But if you take, which is the point I made and our sales were down because of timing, or mistiming whatever the case -- whatever you want to put it, of purchases, when we went to new distributor last year, and it was very choppy. So you end up with one month where there was a high level of purchases coming out of Brazil, and then this month, you end up with a much lower level. But if you go through the numbers, and you look at the sales out of that distributor in Brazil, and that is one particular distributor where we do have some visibility on their sales numbers. Their sales numbers have continued to grow and are substantially higher than last year. But our sales into them, in April, specifically, are negative. And if you take the Asia Pacific, it's not only -- it's largely Japan but then there are a lot of other markets in that one month while we were up in the quarter, we were negative in that month. And that was part of that transition month where we changed over from supplying goods made in the U.S. to local production. So again, we believe that will change as we go forward during the quarter. But those had -- those 2 markets had quite an effect on the April number. The April number would have been quite a few percentage points higher if you take -- if you just take into account sales in, basically, North America and Europe, or EMEA, as we put it. So we're quite comfortable with the numbers going forward. We think the categories showing pretty resilient and healthy signs. And as you can pick up from the Nielsen, that really is the best indicator of ultimate consumer demand for the brand and for the category.","Operator",".","And our next question comes from Caroline Levy from CLSA.","Brian Doyle - CLSA Limited, Research Division","This is Brian Doyle, filling in for Caroline. I was just wondering -- just on international profitability, again, you said EMEA is now profitable. I was wondering if you could just update us on how big that is as a percentage of your total international revenue. And then, secondly, just on the international gross margin, I was kind of surprised that it was down in the quarter. My first thought that, that would largely be currency-related, but it sounds like currency was only like 0.5 point hit to the top line, so just a little clarity on when the sort of international margins are going to improve.","Rodney C. Sacks","It's -- at the moment, it's -- the actual net margins are small in relation to the sales. It's just basically at the beginning of turning the corner. And we -- as we go forward, we believe we will continue to improve there, but we do have thinner margins overseas. We did indicate, I think earlier, that our gross margins overseas were slightly less than its comparable periods last year. And we're looking to, again, trying to deal with -- address that. Again, we think some of that will be addressed as we look for -- go forward. One of the things we will be looking to do is to introduce new products where we believe we will have better margins internationally as we expand the product range overseas. So we, obviously, are looking to try and improve those margins, but at this point a lot of that will depend on our ability to get our cost down.","Operator",".","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to turn the call back over to your host, Rodney Sacks, for any further remarks.","Rodney C. Sacks","On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company.

However, we are seeing positive momentum in the energy category. Net sales for the 2018 second quarter were negatively impacted by $12.2 million due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606, under ASC 606, commissions paid to The Coca-Cola Company based on our sales to certain of the company's customers, which The Coca-Cola Company accounts for under the equity method or consolidates, are now included as a reduction to net sales. Whereas prior to January 1, 2018, commissions based on sales to those customers, which Coca-Cola accounts for under the equity method were included in operating expenses.","In the second quarter, net sales were $1.02 billion, up 12% from $907.1 million in the second quarter of 2017. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been $13.3%. Net sales in the second quarter were positively impacted by approximately $16.8 million of foreign currency movements. The company recorded second quarter gross sales of $1.19 billion, up 14.7% from $1.04 billion in the second quarter of 2017. Gross sales in the second quarter were positively impacted by approximately $21.4 million of foreign currency movements.","Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2018 second quarter was 61.1% compared to 64.3% in the 2017 second quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to an increase in promotional allowances as a percentage of gross sales, the $12.2 million of commissions accounted for as a reduction to net sales due to the adoption of ASC 606, increases in certain input costs such as aluminum cans and other costs, domestic product sales mix and geographical sales mix. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.7% for the 2018 second quarter as compared to 3% in the 2017 second quarter, an increase of $10.7 million largely due to higher carrier cost contract rates in the U.S.","Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.4% compared to 12.6% in the same quarter a year ago. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 10.7% as compared to 10.1% in the same quarter last year. Included in general and administrative costs were distributed termination expenses of $5.5 million for the 2018 second quarter as compared with $0.2 million in the comparable 2017 second quarter.","In the quarter, payroll expenses were up $9 million compared to the same period last year, primarily due to head count growth both domestically and internationally. Legal expenses related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $0.7 million in the 2018 second quarter as compared to $2.4 million in the 2017 second quarter.","Operating income was adversely affected by losses in China and India. The losses in India were due to establishment costs incurred in advance of the launch and in connection with the current rollout as well as inventory reserves.","Our effective tax rate decreased from 35.9% in the 2017 second quarter to 24.6% in the 2018 second quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017. The decrease was partially offset by the elimination of the domestic production deduction.","Net income was $270.1 million in the 2018 second quarter compared to net income of $222.6 million in the 2017 second quarter, an increase of 21.3%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 578 million for the second quarter of 2017 to 566.4 million for the second quarter of 2018 as a result of share repurchases, which I will cover later in this call. Diluted earnings per share for the 2018 second quarter increased 23.8% to $0.48 from $0.39 in the second quarter of 2017.","We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. We also are making good progress in the U.S. in non-traditional channels including foodservice accounts and e-commerce. We reached agreements to transition Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers in Arkansas. In the second quarter of 2018, we transitioned parts of Arkansas and are planning on transitioning the remainder of Arkansas in the third quarter of 2018.","In EMEA, we launched in Belarus and Tanzania. Further launches are planned in the third and fourth quarters of 2018 in Armenia, Azerbaijan and Ukraine. We plan to launch Predator later in 2018 and in 2019 as an affordable energy brand in select eastern European and African markets.","During the second quarter of 2018, we launched Monster in Uruguay and relaunched Monster in Peru. In July, we launched Monster in Ecuador. Bolivia is on track to launch later this year. In China, we continue to focus our efforts towards establishing Monster around the country with an emphasis on distribution in the top 40 cities and to key accounts, targeting the younger and more affluent consumer demographic.","We commenced shipments of Monster to Coca-Cola India where we launched Monster in April in a lead market. We have now expanded the launch to a number of larger cities principally in the south and west regions of India. We plan to complete a national rollout in India by year-end. Mutant, one of our affordable energy brands that is positioned differently than in the U.S., was recently launched in Pakistan and Cambodia with launches in Myanmar and Vietnam during the third quarter of 2018.","According to the Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through June 30, 2018, for all our outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including Energy Shots increased by 9% versus the same period a year ago.

Sales in the OXXO Convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.","I'd like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country.

Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 48.4%.","Net sales in Brazil in the quarter increased by 1.6% in local currency, impacted by ASC 606 and higher taxes on sales and decreased 6.3% in dollars as a result of foreign currency movements. Net sales in Chile increased 39.3% in dollars and 28.5% in local currency.","Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $659.7 million compared to $528.6 million at December 31, 2017. Short-term investments were $211.1 million compared to $672.9 million at December 31, 2017. At the end of the quarter, we held no long-term investments.","Accounts receivable increased to $592.6 million at June 30, 2018, from $449.5 million at December 31, 2017. Days outstanding for accounts receivable were 45.2 days compared to 43.8 days at December 31, 2017.","Inventories increased to $275.6 million from $255.7 million at December 31, 2017. Average days of inventory were 62.7 days at June 30, 2018 compared to 75 days at December 31, 2017.","In the second quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Mule, a ginger-flavored energy drink exclusively with a large regional convenience store customer. Initial results have been positive.","In Canada in the second quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Green and Zero Ultra in a slim 310ml can and a Collector's Edition Lewis Hamilton Monster Energy drink in a 473ml can. We also launched Monster Mango Loco with 7-Eleven in Canada this June and we will roll out nationally in Canada during the third quarter of 2018.","Following the launch of Monster Hydro in the first quarter in Sweden and Germany, we launched Monster Hydro in 550ml PET bottles in France and BPM Zero in Ireland in June 2018.","In the first half of 2018, we launched Monster Mango Loco in Great Britain and Sweden along with Monster Pipeline Punch in Great Britain, Belgium, France and Germany, and Relentless Apple Kiwi in Great Britain. We also recently launched Mutant as an affordable energy drink in Pakistan and Cambodia.","In the second quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Ultra Citra in South Korea.","We are planning for approximately a 4% increase in our pricing to our customers effective November 1, 2018 for Monster and January 1, 2019 for NOS and Full Throttle. We estimate July 2018 gross sales to be approximately 15.9% higher than in July 2017. On a foreign exchange adjusted basis, we estimate July 2018 gross sales to be approximately 15.7% higher than in July 2017.","Please note that the impact of ASC 606 has not been included in determining these figures. July had one extra selling day in 2018. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production.","In some instances, where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers, as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period, such as a single month or even two months, should not necessarily be imputed to or be regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.","During the 2018 second quarter, the company purchased approximately 10.6 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $52.42 per share, for a total of $553.2 million, excluding broker commissions. As of August 7, 2018, approximately $196.7 million remains available for repurchase under our previously authorized repurchase program. On August 7, 2018, the company's board of directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to an additional $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock.","In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points; One, the company's continued to achieve record market shares in the U.S. and many countries. Two, retail sales statistics from many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow, and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category in line with earlier periods. Three, the new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. Four, we are excited by the prospects for our brands and our new product launches. Five, we are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India. Six, we are continuing to launch Monster Energy drinks with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain markets.","And I would now like to open the floor to questions about the quarter.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time if you would like to ask a question...","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Sorry, just \u2013 sorry. Could I just make \u2013 just one clarification. The price increase I referred to is related to the U.S. Sorry. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen...","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","All right, thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","...my pleasure. And our first question will come from the line of Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Good afternoon.","Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Rodney, just talk about international sales growth a little bit. We saw some deceleration across all three regions. Anything to note there or is it just part of normal volatility in these markets?","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","We think it's part of the normal operations. There have been some sort of \u2013 some noise \u2013 some countries were higher than others. We are looking at it, but we think that it's, again also distorted in some cases by monthly numbers. We are seeing quite big differences in the monthly numbers as we see them come through from overseas markets. So I think we'll just wait and see what the trend is going to be when we go through the third quarter.","Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.","Yeah, I think that's fair. If you look at the consolidated foreign numbers, including Canada, net sales grew at 18.69%. So we also have to adjust for ASC 606. So there are some variabilities in that, and overall we haven't seen a slowing in sales. There's just been some issues in certain countries, which we believe will correct themselves in the next few months.","Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Any abnormal inventory builds in any market that's worth pointing out to?","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","No. Actually, there was inventory issues in the quarter, mainly in Europe, where unfortunately, there was insufficient production capacity to satisfy demand. They're having a very hot summer in Europe, as you know, and we've had some production challenges in Europe. So to the contrary, it's lower inventories rather than higher inventories.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, hey, thanks, and good afternoon, guys.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Hi, Mark.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So just a quick follow up on the last one and then another question. In Asia, it sounded like that was a little bit weaker. Maybe any sort of update on what's going on in China? Was there any sort of impact there from lapping the sell-in from a year ago?","And then shifting to the U.S., just curious, anything you're seeing domestically? It looked like the trends, if I looked at it correctly, were a little bit below what the scanner data said consumption looked like, you said that online and on-track was doing well. So I don't know, anything that you see there that may have explained the delta?","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Well, I think you'll always see a discrepancy between Nielsen and ourselves. And we've discussed this many times on various calls that we sell to our distributors. We also have some direct customers, but in the main, our sales go to our distributors. They sell to their customers, and their customers sell to retail. So you'll always see the discrepancy between Nielsen, which is retail sales, and our own sales. And what I've always advised is the real test is not what we're selling, but the real test is what's coming off the shelves.","Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.","Yeah, with regard to China, we've just really focused on the top cities. There was probably a little bit of additional inventory in the pipeline and, with distributors from last year going into summer, which we needed to work through, and our distributors to work through because we didn't \u2013 in order to get them fresh inventory. We've done it under the cap promotion this summer in China, which has done nicely, and we are slowly starting to build up some core repeat business and consumers focused on the modern trade in the top, I think, as we said, 40 cities. So it's a slow build. It's steady. We are planning to launch Monster Ultra in China later this year and to roll it out again slowly. It won't be in all the business units initially. It will be in the business units where we feel they're able to handle it better. So we do have some plans to expand the product line with an additional launch next summer early in 2019.","We believe this is \u2013 it is sort of appropriate and necessary for us. It'll help us, we think, get visibility for our brand on the shelves, which is one of the things we've referred to in earlier calls is it's been hard for us to have a smaller sized can and get recognized with a single can in stores, and particularly in Coke coolers where some of the Coke products have similar size cans. So we believe that the additional products will continue to help build the brand. So we're pretty positive on the build in China, but it is going to be a long, slow build. But ultimately, we think that the brand is going to continue to do well, and as we've said, the new products we've done some initial taste tests of them. They've been very well received. So we're pretty excited. The first product will be Ultra, and the next product will be our Mango Loco product for China.","Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.","Yeah, I think the only thing I would add to that, Mark, is that remember we were rolling out China last year. So there was a buildup of inventory gain to the system last year. And Japan was good in the quarter. Korea was good in the quarter. So overall, I think we were satisfied with the numbers bearing in mind the differences in various countries.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah, thanks, and good afternoon, everyone.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Hi, Nik.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. A modeling question and then another question. On modeling, can you just \u2013 I know you don't want to give guidance for margins, et cetera, but just to help us think about it going forward, can you just rank order the factors weighing on gross margins kind of most impactful to least just to give us a better understanding? Because I guess when we look at the P&L and we look at the year-ago compares, promotional allowances are always listed first when you talk about gross margin pressure, and I know we're going to start lapping some of the Java promotional dollars as you are getting it back on the shelf. So that's the first question on gross margin.","And then the second, the bigger picture question is, at the shareholder meeting, you talked about talking to the Coca-Cola Company about Mutant and potentially a new arrangement around that brand, and I just wanted to know if there is any progress there? Thanks.","Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.","Okay. Well, if I could just answer the first question. Remember on a previous call, I spoke about a personal view about margins what I felt about personally. So if you go back to the number that I gave you then and you look at this quarter, you adjust for ASC 606, and you adjust for the issues that we have had to sustain in increased aluminum prices relating to increases in aluminum can purchases, you'll find that the number is just kind of within \u2013 is in that number. So the margin adjusting for those two factors alone was just above 62%. So while we talk about promotional answers and that is a fact and, yes, promotional answers are up, and one of the big reasons for that is increased shelf costs and cooler placement fees.","There is a reduction in margin as we continue to sell products such as the coffee product, Muscle Monster, Caff\u00e9 Monster that are lower than the Monster cold food products. And then added to that, you have the issue of international sales where the margins are not as high as the U.S. margins. So I hope that's given you a good feel about the margin structure.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Only thing I would add on to the margins is in addition, there's also been a switch between the proportion between we have strategic brands which have concentrated models which have higher margins and Monster. And Monster is continuing to grow ahead of the strategic brand, so that continues to put some pressure on the margin as well. So you take all those three factors on product mix, geographic mix, and mix between the actual product, the Monster versus strategic brands and that has had that effect.","Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.","So what I'm looking at here is that if you rank them in order, the point that Rodney mentioned was kind of at the bottom. So you've got all those other factors, plus you've got the strategic brands Monster percentages. And that should give you a full explanation to your question.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Very helpful. And then on Mutant?","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","On Mutant, we have not made progress with the Coke Company on a different model. We're sort of reevaluating Mutant. We think that Mutant in the U.S. is probably something that's \u2013 we're probably going to tailor off and sort of refocus our attention. We're actually spending we think too much time and effort on the brand, and we just don't feel that that's where we would be best spent going forward.","So I think that we're going to focus on newer products. We have some additional new product lines and some positioning in the Monster brand in the U.S. I think we're going to focus on that. We will continue to \u2013 have regard to Mutant as I indicated earlier internationally as an energy brand and Predator depending on the different markets. But at this point, we just don't see the reward and payback for Mutant in the U.S., so that seems to be something that we're de-emphasizing and moving away from I think going forward.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you, all. Hi. Good afternoon, there. I just wanted to actually explore a little bit more on the pricing, first of all, if you're seeing any signs of potential moves from your competitors? And then if you can kind of elaborate more if you're thinking of pricing also internationally. I know the pressures from COGS are less so of aluminum, but perhaps because of some places where FX may be going the other way, it hasn't been the case of course for you guys, but if you see some room for international pricing as well. Thank you.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Well, we only really recently announced the pricing increase. Yeah, so we've really not really had any input back or heard anything back from our competitors. So we really can't give you much direction in that regard. We believe that they are undoubtedly also facing the same price and cost increases that we have, so we would believe that they probably will follow similarly, but we don't have any indication on that.","Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.","And then internationally, as we've always advised, we are the smaller player in many international markets and we price according to the leading competitor. And we just have to ensure that we are priced correctly relative to that competitor to be able to capture a good share of the market. So we would not lead \u2013 necessarily lead internationally without the lead competitor going first.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","But that being said, with all of the uncertainty that's been happening in the world with the aluminum price and some other raw material price increases, we are keeping a watch in different countries. And as and when there are price adjustments by leading brands and other competitors in those markets, we will react to that and obviously look at the opportunities as well individually for taking up pricing as and when we think that that's appropriate. But we are certainly focusing initially now on the U.S. pricing, and then which is the largest impact on our business, and then we will look at \u2013 probably early in the New Year look at the international markets.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good evening, guys. I was hoping for a follow up on the pricing, and then maybe some commentary on India. The follow up on the pricing is just to what extent will the pricing that you announced cover the input cost inflation that you're seeing? Is it adequate to cover all of it? Is it a large portion of it? So commentary there would be helpful.","And then help me just building on sounds like a loose guidance or (42:46) your personal view before with the 62%. We've seen this with the presence of negative geographic mix, promotion, et cetera. So in theory, while those things will still be present to some degree, pricing has not been obviously. So should we be thinking about something a little bit better than that 62% as we get into Q4 and then looking out to next year?","And then, Rodney, a broader question on India. Maybe talk a little bit about sort of early indications there, and how you're defining success in that market? Thank you for all that.","Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.","Okay. So you're kind of getting greedy. The price increase should cover increases in input costs and the increases in freight. But who knows where they're going to go from there. I mean, today aluminum shot up again based on a number of factors. So as we sit here now, the pricing should contain our cost increases. Will we get more? I don't know, and I honestly I wouldn't consider even discussing more on this call because it's just too premature.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","If we increase pricing, I mean it's not going to have an effect through to us, certainly not in the current year. And then talking about India, we've had a controlled rollout, literally by city and surrounding region-by-region basis. It's gone well. We are seeing some good response. There is a recognition of the brand from when we were there many years before when we did sort of rollout and we were in India. We had a very limited presence but the brand was there, so we are seeing some recognition of the brand, which is good sort of very different to China where we really obviously had no brand recognition while we've launched. So it is different, and we are \u2013 but it really is premature.","Hilton and I are both planning to go to India and review the markets and launch this ourselves personally within the next few months, but at this point it just is premature for us to comment on really what is happening there and how it's going. We're getting some good anecdotal reports but that's not sufficient for us to be comfortable to give you a direction from the company at this point yet.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you. Good luck.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session for today. So now it's my pleasure to hand the conference back over to Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, for closing comments and remarks.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Thanks, everyone. On behalf of the company, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our strategy and remain committed to continuing to develop and differentiate our brands and expand the company both at home and abroad. And in particular, to expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottling system internationally.","We are also particularly excited by the new opportunities that we have going through with our portfolio together with our strategic brands as well as Hydro, Mutant, and Predator in the affordable energy sector in many Eastern European, African, and other markets where that sector is continuing to show good growth opportunities. Thank you very much for your attendance.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. This does conclude our program, and we may all disconnect.

You may begin.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I am Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our last Vice Chairman and President, is with me today; as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends.","Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call.","Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2018, and our Form 10-Q filed on August 9, 2018, including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements for discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance.

A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section.","There are encouraging signs in the beverage category globally, and we continue to see positive momentum in the energy category. Net sales for the 2018 third quarter were negatively impacted by $11.6 million, due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606. Under ASC 606, commissions paid to The Coca-Cola Company based on our sales to certain of the company's customers, which The Coca-Cola Company accounts for under the equity method or consolidates, are now included as a reduction to net sales. Whereas, prior to January 1, 2018, commissions based on sales to those customers, which Coca-Cola accounts for under the equity method, were included in operating expenses.","Gross and net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2018, were impacted by advance purchases made by our customers due to a pre-announced price increase effective November 1, 2018, on certain of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks. The company estimates that impact to gross and net sales was approximately $18 million and $16 million, respectively.","In the third quarter of 2018, net sales were $1.02 billion, up 11.7%, from $909.5 million in the third quarter of 2017. Without the adoption ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 13%. Net sales in the third quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $5.3 million of foreign currency movements.","The company recorded third quarter gross sales of $1.18 billion, up 13.7%, from $1.04 billion in the third quarter of 2017. Gross sales in the third quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $5.6 million of foreign currency movements.","Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, for the 2018 third quarter was 59.8%, compared with 62.6% in the 2017 third quarter. The gross profit percentage, as adjusted for ASC 606, would have been 60.3% for the quarter.","The decrease in gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was primarily attributable to increases in certain import costs such as aluminum cans, freight in and other input costs; the $11.6 million of commissions accounted for as a reduction to net sales due to the adoption of ASC 606; an increase in promotional allowances as a percentage of gross sales; domestic product sales mix; and geographical gross profit mix.","Distribution costs, as a percentage of net sales, were 4.1% for the 2018 third quarter as compared to 3.2% in the 2017 third quarter, an increase of $12.8 million, largely due to higher carrier contract rates in the U.S.","Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 11.2% compared to 12.7% in the same quarter a year ago. General and administrative costs, as a percentage of net sales, were 11.1% as compared to 11.8% in the same quarter last year. Included in general and administrative costs were distributor termination expenses of $14.1 million for the 2018 third quarter, as compared with the $15.9 million in the comparable 2017 third quarter.","Excluding distributor termination expenses in both quarters, the comparable general and the administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 9.7% in the third quarter of 2018 compared to 10.1% in the same quarter last year.","In the quarter, payroll expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 6.2% compared to 6.3% in the same period last year. Payroll costs increased $5.9 million primarily due to head count growth both domestically and internationally. Legal expenses relating to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $1.4 million in the 2018 third quarter, as compared to $2.9 million in the 2017 third quarter.","Operating income was adversely affected by losses in China of $2.9 million in the quarter. Our effective tax rate decreased from 31.9% in the 2017 third quarter to 21.8% in the 2018 third quarter.","The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017, and to a reduction in certain foreign income that is subject to U.S. taxation. The decrease was partially offset by the elimination of the domestic production deduction. We anticipate that the effective tax rate will be higher in the fourth quarter.","Net income was $267.7 million in the 2018 third quarter, compared to net income of $218.7 million in the 2017 third quarter, an increase of 22.4%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 578.4 million for the third quarter of 2017 to 560 million for the third quarter of 2018 as a result of share repurchases, which I will cover later in this call.","Diluted earnings per share for the 2018 third quarter increased 26.4% to $0.48 from $0.38 in the third quarter of 2017. Excluding distributor termination expenses in the 2018 third quarter and in the comparable quarter last year, earnings per share would have increased 25.6% to $0.50 per share.","We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. We are also making good progress in the U.S. in non-traditional channels, including foodservice accounts, e-commerce and home improvement stores.","In the third quarter of 2018, we completed the transition of Arkansas to Coca-Cola bottlers. This concludes the Anheuser-Busch distributor transition in the United States.","In EMEA, we launched in Ukraine. Further launches are planned in the fourth quarter of 2018 and in the first quarter of 2019 in Azerbaijan and in Armenia.","Last week, we launched Predator in South Africa as our strategically preferred energy brand. And plan to launch Predator later in 2018 and in 2019 in select Eastern European and African markets.","During the third quarter of 2018, we launched Monster in Ecuador. Paraguay and Bolivia are now on track to launch in the first quarter of 2019.","In China, we continue to focus our efforts towards establishing Monster around the country, with an emphasis on distribution in the top 40 cities and to key accounts, targeting younger and more affluent consumer demographics. Our core range will expand its offering and appeal with the launch of Ultra White in the fourth quarter.","We continued the rollout of Monster to Coca-Cola India. We have now expanded the launch to 40 of the largest cities across the country. Monster is now selling in approximately 75% of the country, with national rollout expected by year-end.","Mutant energy, one of our affordable energy brands that we have positioned differently from the Mutant Super Soda previously sold in the U.S., was launched in Myanmar and Vietnam in the third quarter. Mutant energy is now available in Cambodia, Myanmar, Pakistan and Vietnam.","I wanted to take a moment to address one aspect of our agreement with Coca-Cola. Among other provisions, these agreements between the company, Coca-Cola and certain affiliates restrict Coca-Cola from competing in the energy drink category with certain exceptions. As some of you may have read, Coca-Cola has developed two energy products it believes it may market under an exception relating to the Coca-Cola brand.","We believe that the exception does not apply. While mutual agreement to obtain clarification, the issue was submitted to arbitration last week on October 31, 2018. Coca-Cola has indicated that it has suspended the proposed launch of such energy products until April 2019.","According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through September 29, 2018, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 6.6% versus the same period a year ago.","Sales of Monster grew 10% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS increased 4.8% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 1.4%.

Our first question comes from Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Good evening, everyone.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Hi, Amit.","Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.","Hi, Amit.","Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Rodney, can you provide a little bit more context into the energy drink brands being developed by Coca-Cola? How far along are they or any other information on it, please?","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","I think that we have some information, but we don't have full information. And I think that now that an arbitration has been filed between us to try and determine our respective rights, we just believe that it isn't appropriate for us to provide additional comments at this time. Our commercial business activities and relationship is continuing as in the past, and we are looking to just get a third-party determination for the correct interpretation of our respective rights.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks. Hi, everyone.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Hi, Judy.","Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.","Hi, Judy.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So, Rodney, just as a follow-up, just a quick follow-up on the last question. I mean, maybe if you could take a little bit of a step back and just kind of give your perspective on the relationship that's been evolving with The Coca-Cola Company. Obviously, the Mutant situation didn't also go as well as I think that you were hoping for. So kind of how do you see this changing your relationship with the KO, as well as the bottlers? So maybe just be helpful to just get your broader perspective.","And then, more specifically, my other question is just really on the EMEA supply chain issues. I'm just wondering if this is limited to certain countries or this is really a broader regional issue. And whether this is being addressed as we speak, so we get more of a bump up in sales in the fourth quarter? It seems like we've been having some of these supply chain issues in international markets time-to-time. So how do we think about really more fully addressing the issue broadly? Thank you.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","That's a lot for one question, Judy.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","A follow-up, one was a follow-up.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Okay. On the relationship with Coke, I think our relationship is good and continues to be good. There is Coke, obviously, looking at their own portfolio and looking for where they believe they see opportunities and where their own BUs would look to expand their own portfolio. As we indicated in the call, there is an exception for certain products that are in the Coca-Cola brand and that is of itself an area that we are looking at.","We have a difference of opinion on it. We don't know and at this point we don't think it's appropriate for us to speculate on if that comes to fruition, what effect that might or might not have on our brand. I mean, we continue to be partners with Coca-Cola and with the bottlers. We continue to have our full range sold by them. And we just don't think that at this point we'd be in a position or should be in a position to speculate on what effect that might happen.","There will just be another product being sold by Coca-Cola bottlers, but the impact and effect on us would be something I think wouldn't be appropriate for us to deal with that. We don't believe it will have a majority impact on our relationship. We just believe we'll have to manage it in an appropriate way if and when it occurs.","On the EMEA supply chain side, I think...","Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.","Sorry, Rodney. Maybe I could give a different perspective to Judy or a similar perspective.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Sure.","Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.","The relationship with The Coca-Cola Company, I believe, is good. And I'm not a lawyer, so I'm giving the response to you from a business perspective. There is an issue in an agreement, which we've agreed to go to arbitration civilly and determine what course of action is appropriate. So nothing has changed in the relationship. And the manner in which this situation will be dealt with will be conducted from both parties on a civil basis according to the agreement. So I honestly don't see any changes in the relationship with The Coca-Cola Company.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Sure. All right. On the EMEA supply chain side, it affected us through a number of plants in different areas, not obviously right through all of the \u2013 there are probably 70 or 80 countries that comprise EMEA, but there were a number of countries and a number of plants that did have supply issues for a whole host of reasons. We've taken steps to address this.","We had a period of time when our previous Senior VP of Operations retired and we were looking for a successor. We have appointed a successor who is \u2013 he has got his feet on this desk and he's in the job, he's been out in Europe. We have also appointed a new VP of Operations in Europe to give us more hands on deck there. And so, we are looking at getting our hands around it. We are in the process of doing it at this point in time. Perhaps if you'd like to add some color to that?","Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.","No, I think that we've had issues. Remember, it was a very hot summer in Europe and a lot of the plants were working to capacity and beyond capacity. We've had certain issues, which are being addressed and will be addressed going forward. And the one thing is clear is that our business is growing, which is a good thing. And we have to ensure that we have sufficient capacity and sufficient plants to be able to accommodate our needs.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen. Your line is open.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Good evening.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Hi.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","So I was hoping to talk about your U.S. business and specifically the trends for your core Green Monster, where, at least in the Nielsen scanner data that we have, it does appear that there has been a modest softening in terms of the market share declines. So can you offer any color on whether there has been a change in your promotional strategy heading into the price increase or is this more interaction with new product offerings that are hitting the market? Any color there would be helpful. Thank you.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","If I'm looking at the general market, Monster is continuing to increase its share. The category is growing and Monster is growing in excess of the market.","If I look at regular Monster as such, I'm just looking, for example, at the main channel, which is convenience, there is still some growth in Monster in the original core line in its 16-ounce. And then, obviously, we have additional SKUs with the original Green Monster. So the core brand is continuing to grow.","There has been the entry into the market of additional products, primarily probably in what we would maybe call or describe as a performance energy category or a workout fitness energy category or not even really maybe in that category. And there is some sales on that. There are a number of reasons that those products are all sort of starting to gain some traction.","But if I look at the sales levels, they are still behind the increase in sales. So I think, overall, we are getting additional products in the category, but the category itself is continuing to grow.","Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.","So we're still seeing growth, Vivien, in Monster Green. It's continuing to grow. And remember, we've added a number of other SKUs into the portfolio on both juice products and the Ultra range, which is the no-sugar product. So while we are seeing growth in Monster Green, there has been as well the proliferation of other SKUs within our portfolio.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Yes. In that side, obviously on the coffee side, we are continuing to see growth in Java. We've just launched a line extension in Java. We have the Caff\u00e9 Monster line and Espresso Monster again, that has continued to grow.","On the Ultra line, which is growing, we do have plans to launch an additional Ultra in the spring, which will be launched, which is Ultra Paradise.","So we are all continuing to see growth in the category. And we see additional entrants probably to some extent. We are not sure of the exact measurement at this point in time, but do see some increase in incremental sales coming into the category from these new entrants.","Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.","And Monster Green does remain a very important barometer for us.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is open.","Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yes. Hey. Good afternoon, guys.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Hi, Mark.","Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So I'm going to try the Coke thing again. You can answer or not, I guess. My understanding of the exceptions relate to the specific products or specific ingredients which is in there.","So are we talking about a product in similarity to, say, a Kickstart from the Pepsi system, where it's effectively sort of a competitor, but not really? Are they adding some sort of caffeine component to some other beverage, which is a non-carbonated soft drink? I mean, any sort of color you can give on that, that would be helpful.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Mark, there isn't a limitation on them just adding caffeine. They could have a higher caffeine product, there's no limitation on that.","There is, if you look at the agreement, which is filed, there are certain ingredients that are, if used in combination, obviously then create a definition. And there is a definition of what an energy drink is.","The exception goes back to the Coca-Cola brand, not Sprite, not Kickstart, not any other brand, it's the Coca-Cola brand. And there are certain exceptions about what \u2013 because the Coke brand has certain \u2013 otherwise there would be certain limitations. And there is an exception for that brand.","But I think that it's a long explanation. There are different analyses of what that means and what that entitles Coke to do under that brand. Again, if it was just a question of adding vitamins, well, then Coke would obviously add vitamins. There isn't an issue with that.","But where the brand transcends into a product that we see positioned as an energy drink, that's where we have a difference of view on the exception and under the Coke brand. That is really where we are.","I think there is not much more we could really add or more color we could give at this point in time. There is a section in the agreement that you guys could look up if you really had that interest. But we are dealing with it with Coke. And we think we will come to a resolution reasonably quickly as to what that exception means and how it should be implemented.","Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.","And just to add on that, Mark, what I said earlier, the discussions are very civil and very business-like, very civil. And it's a question of difference of opinion, which will be resolved in per the agreement.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Your line is open.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks. Good afternoon.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Afternoon, Bill.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Just a little bit further on the gross margin, but for kind of the quarter and then going forward with pricing. Trying to understand, as we look, will this more than offset \u2013 I mean, can you hold gross margins relatively flat going forward? And when I say that, have we seen the full impact of costs in the third quarter? Or do you still have another kind of layer or step-up of cost input inflation that kicks in fourth quarter and 2019?","Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.","Well, what's interesting looking at aluminum and the tariffs and the imposition of tariffs were announced way after we had our discussion on this call about gross margins. So we've had this increase in tariff, which has resulted in increase of aluminum, which is slowly coming off, right? It's a very slow process. So we've also had extreme increases in freight-in in costs that we account for cost of sales, where product is moved to our co-packers or moved to our warehouses. That's all included in cost of sales. So we have had significant cost increases in that regard as well.","So we have these cost increases. I think that the quarter that we've just experienced, I'm not seeing further increases in aluminum and I'm not seeing further increases in freight either, but anything is possible. Having said that, we will have price increase from November 1. And the other thing for sure is we will continue to have this ASC 606 adjustment, which we didn't have when we first spoke about the gross margin issue earlier this year. So it's kind of a mixed bag, with increases and cost increases, which is exactly why we were forced into having a price increase. So \u2013 but I hope that answers your question.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah. I think I understand, but I guess it's more of, do you see any need for further price increases from here?","Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.","Well, we've announced a price increase in NOS and Full Throttle, which we spoke about on the call. We are proposing a price increase in Canada, which we discussed on the call. And where we are now with regard to price increases, I'm not sure we will \u2013 having implementing a price increase in November 1, I'm not sure there is runway to do it again within a short period of time unless costs dramatically and significantly increase from where they are today.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Yeah. At this point, we haven't sort of envisaged price increases in other places around the world, but I think that is something we will be evaluating and looking at the markets, the elasticity where we \u2013 if we can justify pricing. We'll evaluate that going early in the new year.","Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.","See, in the United States, we really are now the market leader. In the various countries around the world, we really price ourselves after Red Bull in most cases.

We have successfully concluded negotiations with Coca-Cola bottlers in many countries, and are planning to launch Monster with these bottlers in most of their international markets in the near future. We have substantially completed the transition of Monster in most of the 28 countries serviced by the Coca-Cola Hellenic Group, and are currently in the process of transitioning the remaining countries. We have successfully launched Monster in Russia, and are moving forward with plans to commence production and distribution of Monster in Nigeria, through Coca-Cola Hellenic. We've also recently successfully transitioned our Monster brand in both Spain and Portugal to Coca-Cola Iberian Partners. We are continuing to transition a number of countries in Africa to Coca-Cola bottlers. This process will continue through the remainder of 2016. We've also reached agreement with Coca-Cola \u0130\u00e7ecek for distribution of Monster within the countries which fall within their Coca-Cola territory, which includes Turkey and 10 other countries.","We've reached agreement with Coca-Cola Amatil, which distributes the Coca-Cola product in Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and Fiji. Finally, we having reached agreement with Big (3:42), the 100% owned Coca-Cola bottler that operates in a number of international markets, for the distribution of Monster in the majority of their markets. We've also made good progress in our discussions with FEMSA, Arca, and other bottlers operating in South America. Our plans to launch Monster in China are continuing to move forward with the Coca-Cola bottlers there. We received preliminary approval from the Chinese authorities for our Monster Energy formula, and are currently awaiting formal approval. We had a successful trial run in China, and are currently engaged in additional trial runs. We are still planning to launch Monster in China late in the second quarter of 2016, but the launch could be delayed by various factors, including regulatory approvals.","We've also made good progress in the repositioning, repackaging, and reformulation of many of the Coca-Cola energy brands that were acquired as a result of the Coca-Cola transaction. As announced earlier in the week, we are pleased with our pending acquisition of the concentrated flavor business operated by American Fruits and Flavors, in California for $690 million in cash, subject to adjustment. The acquisition agreement was entered into on February 22, 2016 and we expect to close this transaction by the end of the first quarter of 2016.","AFF is our principal supplier of concentrated flavors for our Monster Energy drink line. Our purchases from AFF represent approximately 87% of their sales. In 2015, AFF's total net revenues were approximately $168 million, and its adjusted operating income was approximately \u2013 sorry AFF \u2013 was approximately $87 million. It is our intention that AFF will continue to operate from its existing premises in Southern California, and will continue to carry on its business of supplying concentrates and flavors to third-party customers as it has in the past.","Following the transaction, we will own the vast majority of the proprietary flavors that we use in our Monster Energy drinks including, in particular, the flavors used for our original green Monster Energy drink, Lo-Carb Monster Energy, and Monster Energy Absolutely Zero, the majority of the flavors that are used in our Java Monster and Ultra lines, as well as flavors used in many other Monster Energy drinks. We intend to continue to purchase concentrates and flavors from other flavor suppliers for both our existing products and new products we develop.","Put simply, we intend to operate in the same way as we have in the past to ensure that we are able to develop and secure the best flavors in the future and to continue to excel at innovation. The acquisition of AFF will be immediately accretive to the company from the transaction's closing. The location of AFF's facilities in Southern California will facilitate our management of the business and the integration of AFF's business into the Monster organization. We are extremely excited by this acquisition, which aligns us with our principal flavor supplier, and will enable us to expand and secure most of our flavors at an economical cost.","Our board has authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $1.75 billion of the company's outstanding common stock, which combined with the current outstanding authorization of $250 million remaining from the September 2015 repurchase program, totals $2 billion. We are planning to move forward with the return of capital in 2016 to our shareholders, pursuant to repurchases which could be effective pursuant to open market transactions, a modified Dutch auction tender offer, accelerated share repurchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, subject to applicable laws, regulations, and approvals. The timing of share repurchases, or a modified Dutch auction tender offer, will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Obviously, the company is expected to continue to generate cash from operations.","In the fourth quarter, sales in the beverage industry in general, and of carbonated beverages in particular continue to show weakness. However, the sales of Monster Energy products accelerated in January. In the fourth quarter, the company achieved record gross sales of $743.2 million, up 6.7% from $696.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Net sales were $645.4 million, up 6.6% from $605.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Net sales in the fourth quarter were adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $19.7 million. Net sales were also adversely affected by the buy-in before the price increase effective August 31, 2015, which had an estimated impact of approximately $11 million by destocking in Spain and South Africa, by existing international distributors in anticipation of our transition to Coca-Cola bottlers in these countries and also, by reduction in inventory in Germany during the fourth quarter, all of which had an estimated impact of $11.8 million. In total, such amounts had a negative impact on net sales of approximately $42.5 million in the fourth quarter. The increase in net sales after adjusting for these items would have been approximately 13.6% as compared to the reported increase of 6.6%.","Our original green Monster Energy drink continued to perform well at retail. Retail sales of the Ultra line continue to show good growth in the United States during the fourth quarter, as did our Java Monster line. Gross profit as percentage of net sales was 62.5%, as compared to 54.8% for the comparable 2014 fourth quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to increased net sales of the Concentrate segment, which has higher gross margins than the Finished Products segment, the disposal of our non-energy brands, and the price increase on our 16-ounce Monster Energy drinks effective August 31, 2015.","Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.2%, as compared to 4.1% in the same quarter last year. Selling expenses as percentage of net sales were 12.9% compared to 9.3% in the same quarter a year ago. Sponsorship and endorsement costs, advertising expenses, principally for strategic brands, merchandise display costs, social media expenses, and commissions were all higher in the fourth quarter as compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. General and administrative costs including distributor terminations as a percentage of net sales for the 2015 fourth quarter were 11% as compared to 9.5% for the corresponding quarter in 2014. Payroll expenses were up $6.1 million due partially to increased staffing in connection with our acquisition of the strategic brands. Stock-based compensation, which is a non-cash item, was $3 million higher in the 2015 fourth quarter as compared to the same quarter last year. Distributor termination costs were $3.3 million higher in the fourth quarter as compared to the 2014 fourth quarter. Regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing and promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's product were $3.1 million higher in the 2015 fourth quarter as compared to 2014 fourth quarter. In addition, other legal costs were $1.8 million higher for the 2015 fourth quarter.","On a pro forma basis, giving effect to the items above, operating income for the quarter would have been approximately 31% higher than the reported operating income for the same quarter in 2014. Our effective tax rate increased from 34.7% to 39.5% in the fourth quarter primarily due to the reduction in the domestic production deduction. On an ongoing basis, we expect that our normalized tax rate will be approximately 36.5%. Net income was $138.7 million, compared to net income of $125.3 million during the fourth quarter of last year, an increase of 10.7%. However, due to the substantial increase in share capital, diluted shares increased from 174.9 million to 205.8 million following the issuance of shares to Coca-Cola, diluted earnings per share decreased to $0.67 for the fourth quarter from $0.72 in the 2014 comparable quarter.","Turning to the full year results, the company achieved record gross sales of $3.1 billion for the full year, up 9.9% from $2.8 billion in 2014. Net sales were up 10.5% from $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion. Net sales for the year were adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, totaling $84.3 million for the year. The acceleration of deferred revenue added $39.8 million to net sales in 2015. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 60% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 54.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Operating income was up 19.6% to $893.7 million from $747.5 million in 2014. Pro forma operating income is adjusted for acceleration of deferred revenue of $39.8 million. Distributor termination costs of $224 million, the Coca-Cola transaction expenses of $15.5 million as well as $161.5 million from the gain on the sale of the non-energy business was $931.9 million, an increase of approximately $23.9 million over 2014. Operations from outside of North America delivered operating income of $51.5 million for the 2015 full year as compared to operating income of $37.8 million for the 2014 full year.","Our effective tax rate increased to 38.7% in 2015 from 35.2% in 2014. Net income was $546.7 million, up 13.2% over net income of $483.2 million in 2014. And diluted earnings per share increased 2.4% to $2.84 from $2.77 in 2014.","Gross sales to customers outside the United States were $177.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $160 million in the corresponding quarter of 2014, an increase of 10.6%. Net sales to customers outside the United States were $145.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $133.8 million in the corresponding quarter of 2014, an increase of 8.6%. Foreign exchange movements had an unfavorable impact on gross sales of approximately $23.1 million, and our net sales were approximately $19.7 million. Gross sales to customers outside the United States were $713.2 million in 2015, compared to $657.9 million in 2014, an increase of 8.4%. Net sales to customers outside the United States were $580.3 million in 2015 compared to $534.2 million in 2014, an increase of 8.6%. Foreign exchange movements had an unfavorable impact on gross sales of approximately $102.4 million and on net sales of approximately $84.3 million.","According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through January 23, 2016 for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category including energy shots increased by 9.9% versus the same period a year ago.

NOS' share decreased 0.2 of a point to 4.1%, and Full Throttle share decreased 0.2 points to 1.1%. Red Bull share decreased 0.2 points to 34.6%, slightly below Monster share.

Vive 100's market share increased 11 points to 31.3%, while Boost's market share decreased 2.1 points to 13.9%.","The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced, positively and\/or negatively, by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in their chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.","According to Nielsen in the 13 week period ended December 2015, the OXXO 13 week periods vary by a few weeks between different markets, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 12.7% to 13.5% in Great Britain, from 17.8% to 20.3% in France, from 10.6% to 13.6% in Germany.

According to IRI, Monster's market share in Greece increased in the 13 weeks to the end of December 2015 from 29.7% to 30.5%.","I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers and the IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide, because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen for the month of December 2015 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased to 20.3% as compared to 14.2% last year, and in Brazil, Monster's market share for the month of November declined from 5.7% to 3.7% as compared to the same period last year.","According to Nielsen in the 13 weeks to the end of December 2015, Monster's retail value sales grew 15.8% in Spain, 11.4% in South Africa, and 41.8% in Germany. For the top 20 EMEA markets which account for approximately 92% of EMEA Monster volume, Nielsen reports that in the 13 weeks to the end of December 2015 Monster's retail value sales grew 19.3%. According to INTAGE for the month of December 2015, the convenience store channel in Japan, Monster's market share grew from 32.6% to 38.6%. The launch of Monster Energy Ultra in Japan continues to be a positive driver for the brand.","Net sales for the Finished Products segment in the fourth quarter, formerly the DSD segment, but excluding Peace Tea, were negatively impacted by approximately $16 million of foreign currency movements in the fourth quarter, and by approximately $74.1 million for the year. Net sales for the Finished Products segment in the fourth quarter were also adversely affected by the buy-in of approximately $11 million before the price increase on August 31, 2015, and by destocking in the amount of approximately $11.8 million in Spain and South Africa, and a reduction in inventory in Germany as described above.","On a pro forma basis, net sales for the Finished Products segment for the fourth quarter, after adjustments for these items, would have increased 8.5% from $574.8 million to $623.9 million in the quarter. On a pro forma basis, after adjusting for foreign currency movements of $74.1 million and $39.8 million of acceleration of deferred revenues, net sales for the Finished Products segment for the year would have increased 10.3% from $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion. Net sales for the company's new Concentrate segment were negatively impacted by approximately $3.7 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter, and by approximately $10.2 million for the year.

Despite the destocking issues described earlier, EMEA overall is now operating well, and we have made good strides in achieving increased sales distribution levels and in-store execution, including securing distribution by Coca-Cola bottlers in new countries and territories within the region.","The launch of MEGA Monster in 553 ML cans with the resealable lid in limited additional markets in Europe has been successful and is largely incremental to our original Monster 500 ML size products. Additionally, we have continued the launch of a limited number of SKUs in the Ultra line, in a number of countries in Europe with positive initial response. Ultra will be launched in a further 15 markets in Europe in the first half of 2016.","Monster sales depletions from our distribution partners to customers in the fourth quarter of 2015 were up 18.9% in EMEA. And in particular, sale depletions experienced double-digit growth in Spain, Germany, and South Africa. In Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Sweden, Monster achieved increased sales gains at retail as well as increased market share.","In many international markets, where our independent distribution partners anticipated the Monster brand being transitioned to the Coca-Cola network, sales levels were markedly lower compared to last year than sales levels in markets which were already being distributed \u2013 we were already being distributed by the Coca-Cola bottler system also as compared to last year. We are pleased with the initial sales and distribution gains following the December launch of Monster in Russia. The rollout of Monster in Russia is currently taking place.","In Asia-Pacific, net sales for the quarter increased 52.6% in local currencies, and 37.2% in dollars. For the year, net sales increased 45.1% in local currencies and 27% in dollars. Net sales in Mexico, Central and South America and the Caribbean for the quarter increased 28.8% in local currencies, and 10.7% in dollars. And for the year, increased 29.8% in local currencies and 15.7% in dollars compared to 2014. Monster's sales in Brazil were negatively impacted due largely to the overall difficult economic and market conditions there, together with the uncertainties for distributors relating to the Coca-Cola transaction. In Chile, sales of Monster continue to show good growth. Net sales in the quarter increased 114% over the fourth quarter of last year, and for 2015 increased 29.1% over 2014.","In Mexico, net sales for the fourth quarter increased 24.4% in local currency and 5.4% in dollars as compared to the same quarter last year. And in 2015, net sales in Mexico increased 14.2% in local currency and 10.2% in dollars as compared to 2014. In Japan, net sales in the fourth quarter increased 15.3% in local currency and 4.1% in dollars as compared to the same quarter last year. And in 2015, net sales in Japan increased 32.4% in local currency and 13.4% in dollars as compared to 2014. We are moving ahead with production in India and anticipate reentering the market in India later in 2016.","As mentioned earlier, we're optimistic that we will be able to finalize agreements with Coca-Cola bottlers in numerous countries in the near future. We're also continuing to evaluate production opportunities with Coca-Cola bottlers both in the U.S. and internationally, which we believe will yield cost reductions.","Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $2.2 billion compared to $370.3 million at December 31, 2014. Short-term investments were $744.6 million compared to $781.1 million at December 31, 2014. Long-term investments decreased $15.3 million from $42.9 million at December 31, 2014. All auction rate securities have now been redeemed in full and are no longer included in either short- or long-term investments. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 43.2 days at December 31, 2015, and 36.4 days at December 31, 2014. Inventories decreased to $156.1 million from $174.6 million at December 31, 2014. Average days of inventory was 58 days at December 31, 2015, which was slightly higher than 57.4 days of inventory at December 31, 2014.","During the 2015 fourth quarter, we launched Ultra Black, which was previously sold last year on a limited time basis to a single convenience and gas chain, but it's now being made available to the general public. In the fourth quarter, we also launched Pipeline Punch nationally. In the first quarter of 2016, we launched Salted Caramel Java Monster, and are in the process of launching our new Gronk energy drink. We are planning to launch additional new products in 2016.","Gross sales in January 2016 in dollars were approximately 9.5% higher than in January 2015. In local currencies, gross sales in January 2016 were approximately 12.2% higher than in January 2015. January 2015 gross sales included the old Warehouse division and Peace Tea. We caution again that sales in a single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period.","In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. One, our acquisition of AFF is exciting and represents an important milestone for the company through the ownership of the proprietary formulas for our principal products. This transaction will immediately be accretive to the company's earnings. Two, the board has authorized a new repurchase program of up to $1.75 billion of its equity securities, in addition to the $250 million available under the previously authorized $500 million share repurchase program. Once implemented, the effect of this repurchase program will be to substantially reduce the number of shares of common stock outstanding, and thereby enhance earnings on a per-share basis. Three, North American and international gross margins remained healthy and continued to improve. Four, the U.S. Nielsen market statistics and equivalent market statistics for many countries around the world show that the energy category is continuing to grow, and that Monster is invariably growing ahead of the category. Five, the new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the company's sales. We believe that the repositioning of our Juice Monster and Punch Monster lines continue to be positive. Six, we are particularly pleased with our performance in our international markets. Seven, we have successfully transitioned a number of countries to Coca-Cola bottlers and we have reached an advanced stage to transition many more markets to Coca-Cola bottlers from the second quarter of 2016.","I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from Vivien Azer from Cowen. Your line is now open.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi, thank you very much for taking the question. I have just one point of clarification. Hi. The $42.5 million impact, was that the global number or was that just international?","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","$42.5 million I believe is (34:00) it relates to international.","Hilton H.

And so my bigger picture question, clearly, the underlying health of the business is just fine, and there's a lot of moving pieces in terms of this transition, but can you help give us a sense of the timeline of when we might expect some of this destocking and distributor transition disruption to abate, please? Thank you.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I just want to clarify, that $42.5 million does include the impact of destocking. Yeah, which is then global.","Hilton H.

So lots of moving pieces, underlying business remains healthy, but the disruption is clearly a little bit painful, so can you give us a sense for how you see that progressing, and then we might be through that?","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. We are clearly having a choppy time just getting everything implemented and in line. There are a lot of moving pieces all over the world. And we believe that pretty much we should be done with a lot of the transitions by \u2013 we hope, by the end of the second quarter or at a position where we've at least negotiated the transitions, and are starting to implement them. That's been part of the uncertainty. Now that uncertainty will start being removed. We believe that the actual results will start flowing through once we've transitioned markets, and that does take some time. But we think that will be \u2013 we'll start seeing the impact of that through the second half of the year. But \u2013 so we really just believe it's been pretty much a year of transition for us from when we originally closed the transaction, and we are, as we've indicated throughout the call, at an advanced stage of our discussions with really the principal Coca-Cola bottlers around the world. So we do anticipate we will start seeing some really rapid advances in that regard.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Your line is now open.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks. Quickly, two things. One, can you give us a little more behind the thought process on the size of the share repurchase? Why not more? Why this? And then, also on the AFF acquisition yesterday, can you give us a little idea, I'm just trying to understand, should we just bake in that whole $90 million of operating income that you'll receive or is there some since they were a supplier, do you not get all of that? I mean, how do we model that going forward?","Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary","Bill, maybe I can answer that. Hi.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good afternoon.","Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary","On your first question, I think you know that we are conservative folk when it comes to borrowing, and we took a decision, and the board took a decision that we would rather maintain a cash-positive situation, hence the amount of the buyback. So the results of the buyback will mean that we will not have to go into borrowings. So that's the answer to your first question. The answer to your second question is the $87 million operating income that we discussed is the operating income in 2015. Some of the customers may, in fact, choose not to continue with the company. But we account for 87% of the company's business. And the business that we place with AFF is indeed profitable to them. So as you model, I think a good chunk of that $87 million could be taken into enhancing operating income for the consolidated organization. But as results of the other 13%, it's really too premature to say. But the number will be determined in due course.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey, good afternoon, guys. So the 9.5% gross sales in January, just want to clarify. So that includes the new Coke Concentrate acquired business, but also laps the old business, which includes the Warehouse business. Is that correct?","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That is correct.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. And then secondly, just trying to understand again the supply-demand reported versus, and demand metrics here, I don't get it. I mean, I understand there's moving parts here, but last quarter you killed numbers versus expectations. The June quarter was almost flat. This quarter, again, a miss relative to people's expectations. I get you don't give guidance. But, I guess, is there anything that you can help us sort of understand that makes us believe that the end demand per what we see in the scanner data in the U.S., what we hear from distributors outside of the U.S., is still consistent with how you believe your end demand is actually looking? And, obviously, then reconcile that with what you reported from a top line standpoint in the quarter.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think that you've got to look at the \u2013 and that's a very good indicator, that's why we spent time on the call dealing with the Nielsen numbers, and we've actually also referred to some of the sales-out numbers from our distributors because that is more indicative of your ongoing and sort of more stable demand for our product. So Nielsen are just \u2013 as you know is pure scanned data, and therefore, that's the demand that's happening. And then your demand from retailers, unless there is a big promotion, that is also less choppy than our demand. Our demands are really \u2013 clearly, our demand for our products from our customers is choppy and that choppiness has been exacerbated during the last probably 12 months or so.","But because of all these announcements, because of the changes, different bottlers or distributors have different policies in holding inventory. Some bolt up extra inventory because they would just \u2013 I think anticipate it being canceled, and having their own minds, that somehow that would give them a longer period to sell, or different opportunities to sell, and then you've got to deal with that inventory situation. And there were a lot of independent \u2013 there were independent bottlers, and that's part of the issues, and there was no consistent pattern. And that really is what has happened. And so, obviously, we can only report our revenues as they are and as they come into us, and we try and match them as well. And so, we believe that the \u2013 literally if you're looking to the trends, the more important trends are not our reports over the last three quarters or four quarters, but it is the Nielsen numbers which are showing consistent numbers, and showing good growth both in the U.S. and internationally. And that's what keeps us excited and makes us comfortable that as to the direction of our brand, and our brand is continuing to grow. And so as soon as we are able to actually get through all these transitions, get rid of the uncertainties, we will see long term growth that we think a healthy growth for the brand and for the company.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes, thank you. Good afternoon.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I want to talk a little bit about the Concentrate revenues, and Hilton, you talked about this before that the numbers that we got in the filings were pro forma numbers, but it seems as though the Concentrate numbers continue to come in a little bit lower than \u2013 well, not a little bit this quarter, a lot lower than what I would have anticipated there. Is there \u2013 is that FX? Is that volume? Is that inventory adjustments at the bottlers as you look to transition to this new model? Is there something going on in terms of the Concentrate revenues versus the pro forma numbers that we got in the filings? Thank you.","Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary","Well, some of it was indeed forex, as we highlighted that number on the call. Some of it was that some of the international distributors \u2013 international bottlers were, in fact, overstocked as we went into the transaction really to ensure that they would not miss a beat with regard to production. So, some of it is that. Some of it is indeed the fact that some of the KO brands have been falling off in market share, and that is something that we are addressing. We spoke earlier that we're repositioning a number of their brands \u2013 or a number of our brands. We're repackaging them, and we have a number of marketing initiatives going with regard to those brands. So a lot of it is a lot of all of that. But, in essence, I think we remain satisfied with the acquisition of the strategic brands, and we remain satisfied with the profitability that those strategic brands are generating to us relative to the purchase consideration that we paid.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And we are starting to see positively \u2013 also I think there was a little bit of a drop-off in morale from the bottlers for some of those brands in some of the areas. And they hadn't seen sort of the levels of investment or a clear direction or positioning for those brands. We are taking steps to deal with that now and to address those issues. We've changed some of the marketing and the focus and the positioning of the brands and these things does take time to turn this around in different regions of the world. But we are doing that, and we've got into it now. We're introducing some new flavors. And as Hilton indicated, our packaging has changed on some of them and we're continuing to make changes. But most important, we've actually decided on some strategic positioning for the brands. And again, those are being changed. I mean in many cases, one of the higher costs we had was, for example, advertising. There was an advertising campaign that we committed in order to, in the best interest of the brands, we continue to be responsible for it. It was committed before we took over. But ultimately, we don't believe that that was really beneficial for the brand, and it's not a direction we're going on, so we've changed those directions. So these are the changes that we are making, and long-term, we believe we will stabilize and continue to grow these brands, but in slightly different ways.","Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary","I think I also may have mentioned it, and if I didn't, I should say that some of those brands also did not benefit from the same level of marketing contribution that they had in the past. So they definitely, as we moved through the transition, there was a reduction in marketing expenditure on those brands.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes, thanks. Just two questions from me. On the acquisition, does this flavor supplier, are they dealing with some of these new breakthrough products that you've been discussing, the three to four new products? Just wanted to get some clarity on that. And then the bigger picture question is when you think philosophically about how you launch into a market, should we think about it in a similar template on how you handle the U.S. in terms of kind of SKU by SKU, flavor by flavor, or do you think you'll go with a much broader SKU set as you enter some of these global markets? Thanks.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Just perhaps dealing with the SKU set, there isn't a one-formula-fits-all. In some countries, we'll launch with two or three flavors, but not a massive array of 10 flavors. In other countries, we'll do one or two flavors. And then obviously try and seed up our principal Green Monster, that's the flagship, that's where all our marketing around the world goes to, and get that on the shelf. And then basically expand from there as quickly or as slowly as we need in order to make sure that we're able to get our products on the shelf and they're able to sustain a satisfactory sell rate.","And so that is (47:24) and that's what we've done throughout Europe and everywhere else. We started with two flavors, I think it was Green and then Lo-Carb, and then we introduced a juice, and then we introduced another. And that is how we've continued to go. In some of the Ultra flavors in Europe, we took the decision to actually introduce two or three at the same time as a line. So again, it's flexible, and it depends on where we see the demand and where we see the ability to secure shelf space for the products.","Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary","And then the second question \u2013 or the first question I think was is this flavor company involved in developing new flavors for us for new products? And the answer is yes. The other point I wanted to make earlier to Bill Chappell, and I'm just going to make it on the call, is that we spoke about the total net revenues of $168 million approximately from AFF. Please remember that as we go forward, a significant part of that will flow through in cost of sales and gross margin rather than in additional revenues, because on a consolidated basis, we will not reporting those sales as sales. They'll come into our financials as a reduction in cost.","Operator","This concludes Q&A for today. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Sacks.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you very much. One of the things I would like to perhaps just stress on the call is I think there've been one or two questions that were just posed to us as to why we did the transaction now and timing and we have other things. But I just wanted to say that this was an acquisition and the strategy behind buying and getting ownership of our own flavors was something we considered very important and valuable as far back as a decade ago. And we have made approaches repeatedly, we have spent time trying to negotiate. And really it came about last year that I think the owner was approaching getting I think close to his 80th birthday, and for the first time after an approach, they decided that they were receptive, the family, to an approach. And obviously, we took the opportunity when we could. It wasn't just spur-of-the-moment. This was something we've been wanting to do for a very long time.","And then, there has been some other suggestion asked whether this is \u2013 people if we could expect more acquisitions along this line. We don't think so. We're not going to say, give you an emphatic no on anything. But certainly that is not our intention to get into the flavor business or concentrate business. We're not intending to expand it. This clearly was a very strategic acquisition for a supplier of almost all of our products. And for us, we're able to lock up pretty much most of these revenues, or our revenues, as we sell. As we go forward, every additional case of Monster we sell, that will be additional margin that we will able to basically drop to our bottom line.","So we see this as a very low risk and a very strategic acquisition. It's based in California, it's easy to manage. It's not a massive staff. It's not a very capital intensive business. It has a very low capital base, a very low working capital requirement. It was also strategic we felt to enable our flavor supplier to grow internationally with us. As a private company, they had faced some challenges in many countries and actually having the resources and the expertise to have their flavors get through the regulatory process in these countries and be able to import ingredients, and particularly ingredients and supply them in country. And not being an international base, but yet their flavors were obviously very, very important and key for us.","So we believe that by aligning ourselves with them, we will be able to facilitate and help them through, on the regulatory side. We have quite a deep bench of staff here who understand regulatory issues and legal issues, or in the regulatory area. We also obviously, as it's important for us, as we expand into many more countries and many more distant places, we want to really have the opportunity to put our best foot forward and have these key flavors come from this supplier and not have to resort to alternative suppliers.","But that being said, obviously we do also still intend to continue to work with our existing suppliers, because we want everybody to \u2013 we want to obviously ensure that we're still able to get cutting edge technology, cutting edge flavors, have everybody stay competitive whether it's on the AFF side or our independent suppliers side. And so for all those reasons we do believe this transaction to be very, very important for us going forward.","Thanks, everybody, for your continued interest in the company. We continue to obviously believe in the company and our growth strategy and are committed to continuing to develop and to differentiate our brands and to expand the company, both at home and abroad and in particular, to expand distribution of our products, including the strategic brands, through the Coca-Cola bottler system internationally. We are particularly excited by the new opportunities that we have going forward with our robust portfolio, together with our newly acquired strategic brands. Thank you very much for your attendance.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO. Mr. Sacks, you may begin.","Rodney C. Sacks","Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, is with me today; as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance.","Before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1954 as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends.","Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company, that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed March 1, 2013, as well as our most recent report on Form 10-Q filed November 8, 2013, including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements, for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated February 27, 2014. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section.","We reiterate that our products are safe and are pleased to report that more than 10 billion Monster Energy drinks have been sold and safely consumed around the world over the past 12 years. The long history of safe use of products containing caffeine in the U.S. has remained unchanged. Studies confirm that the average amount of caffeine consumed by the U.S. population has remained relatively stable, despite the entry of energy drinks into the market. As previously indicated, and as stated by the FDA in 2012, available studies did not indicate any new, previously unknown risks associated with caffeine consumption, although the FDA has continued to explore whether additional research on caffeine or energy drinks is needed.","The Institute of Medicine held a public workshop in August 2013 in Washington, D.C. to help determine whether there were potential health hazards associated with the consumption of caffeine in food and dietary supplements. In January 2014, the IM forwarded a copy of the proceedings to the FDA. Many studies conducted in recent years in the U.S.A., Canada and Europe, including a very recent study, have all consistently concluded that the principal sources of caffeine for teens under 18 are coffee, soft drinks and tea and not energy drinks. In fact, a recent article published in the Journal of Pediatrics analyzed the consumption data. Even after including young adults aged 19 to 22 years in the most recent 2-year period study, that's 2009 to 2010, only some 6% of the caffeine consumed by all persons, 22 and under, was from energy drinks as compared to 24% from coffee and 38% from soda. If young adults aged 19 to 22 are excluded as they are neither children nor adolescents, the percentages are even lower with the result at less than 3% of the caffeine intake of children and adolescents, 18 and under, comes from energy drinks.","To put of the level of caffeine in Monster Energy drinks in context, we again remind listeners that a medium Starbucks 16-ounce sized brewed coffee contains approximately 330 milligrams of caffeine, which is more than double the approximately 160 milligrams of caffeine that is contained in the same-sized Monster Energy drink.","In the litigation between the company and the City Attorney of San Francisco, the company recently filed the demurrer to and motion to strike allegations in the complaint. The demurrer and motion to strike were currently scheduled for a hearing on March 4, 2014.","Subsequent to the last conference call, the court issued a final ruling dismissing the amended complaint filed in the purported class action against the company, in which 3 individuals challenged the safety of Monster Energy drinks and the marketing activities of the company. The plaintiffs have filed an appeal against that decision. The American Beverage Association is awaiting a response from certain senators to the proposed U.S. model guidelines for energy drink companies that are described in our last conference call. We continue to support the proposed model guidelines and would be prepared to adopt them if all other major energy drink companies doing business in the U.S. do the same.","With respect to the Kona Federal Securities case that has been pending since 2008, we are currently negotiating the terms of a possible settlement of the action, following a mediation conducted by an independent mediator. Any potential settlement, if completed, will be fully paid by insurance and will not have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position or results of operations.","The company assumes no obligation to update any statements made with respect to ongoing litigation and regulatory matters, including with respect to the foregoing disclosures whether as to new information, future events or otherwise, other than as required by law.","Given the current litigation and pending regulatory requests, we will refrain from answering questions or commenting further on these specific subjects. We are happy, of course, to answer questions that you may have about our products in general or about the fourth quarter and 2013 full year results as best we can after we've concluded our discussion on the business.","Turning to the business. In the fourth quarter of the 2013, the beverage market, generally in North America continued to experience softness, not only in traditional CSDs, but even more so in diets. In contrast, the energy drink sector grew in the high-single-digits.","Positive sales momentum of our Ultra line continued during the fourth quarter. According to the Nielsen reports, sales of Ultra Red, which we introduced in September 2013, exceeded the sales of Ultra Blue in the 13 weeks through January 25, 2014, in the convenience and gas channel. Rehab Pink Lemonade also continued to progress and is now the second best-selling Rehab product. In fact, our 3 Ultra products are among our top 8 best-selling SKUs in the convenience and gas channel.","Sales of our Muscle Monster line continued to gain traction. According to Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through December 21, 2013, in the convenience and gas channel, Muscle Monster was the second best-selling brand in the protein supplement sector and achieved a 22.8% market share. Although Muscle Monster's ATV distribution levels have improved, they are still relatively low at approximately 50%. We are working with our distributor partners to improve these levels. We are confident that as we achieve increased distribution levels for that line, Muscle Monster's market share will continue to improve.","The company continued to make good progress in the fourth quarter and achieved record fourth quarter gross sales, up 14% to $621.1 million and net sales up 14.7% to $540.8 million. Although we are pleased with the sales achieved for the fourth quarter and year-ended December 31, 2013, our revenues were affected by:","One, less robust growth rates for the energy category as a whole in certain of our overseas markets, such as EMEA. Despite the slower growth, Monster was able to achieve 15.2% growth in net sales in dollars in that region in the fourth quarter, well ahead of the growth of the category overall in that region. As measured by Nielsen, for of our EMEA markets and IRI for its measure Italy and Greece. The energy category in EMEA grew by 5.5% in value in the 13 weeks to the end of December 2013, while Monster grew 23% in value over that period. The actual days of the 13-week period vary by a few days between different markets.","Two, sales were positively affected in the U.S.A. by the launch of our new Ultra Red energy drink, as well as sales of Zero Ultra and Ultra Blue and our new Muscle Monster line.","Three, sales in the U.S.A. of our new Zero Ultra, Ultra Blue and Ultra Red energy drinks are lower accretive did result in some cannibalization generally across our existing SKUs primarily Absolutely Zero and Lo-Carb. Four, sales of Monster Energy protein glass bottles in the U.S.A. were lower during the quarter.","Operating income was up 18.3% to $134.8 million. During the fourth quarter, our operating income was negatively affected by professional services costs of $4.7 million related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the company's marketing promotions, ingredients, labeling, and safety of its Monster Energy drinks, which we believe are exceptional in nature.","Diluted earnings per share increased 13.7% from $0.39 per share in the fourth quarter of 2012 to $0.44 per share in the fourth quarter of 2013. Net income was also negatively affected by foreign currency losses of about $3.6 million, principally attributable to Japan and South Africa. And an increase in the effective tax rate to 42.2% from 39.1% last year, which was primarily the result of the establishment of a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of certain foreign subsidiaries, as well as losses in certain foreign subsidiaries for which no tax benefit is recorded. We anticipate that the rates should return to a more normalized level in 2014.","The net effect on diluted earnings per share of professional services costs related to regulatory matters and related litigation, foreign exchange losses and higher tax rate is approximately $0.07 per share. According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through January 25, 2014, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including shots, increased by 7.6% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 17.9% in the 13-week period, while sales of Red Bull increased by 6.3%.","Sales of Rockstar increased by 3.3%. And sales of 5-Hour decreased by 2.8%. Sales of AMP were down 9%,","NOS increased sales by 17.3% and sales of Full Throttle increased 3.5%.","According to the Nielsen reports, for the 4 weeks ended January 25, 2014, sales of energy drinks in the convenience and gas channel, in dollars, increased by 6.6% over the comparable period in 2013. Sales of Monster increased by 14% over the comparable period last year, while sales of Red Bull increased by 5.4%. Rockstar was up 7.5%, while 5-Hour was down 3.3%. NOS was up 11.7% and AMP was down 2.8%.","According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended January 25, 2014, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased by 2.2 points over the comparable period a year ago to 33.9% against Red Bull share points of 34.8%. Rockstar share was flat at 8.5%, 5-Hour's share was lower at 9.6%, while NOS' share was slightly higher at 3.1%.","According to Nielsen, in the 4-weeks ended January 25, 2014, sales of energy plus coffee drinks, in dollars, in the convenience and gas channel increased 7.1% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 6.3% higher than in the comparable period last year while Starbucks Double Shot Energy was 9.3% higher.","According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended January 11, 2014, the energy drink category grew 3%, Monster sales increased 21%. Our market share increased 4.6 points to 31% over the comparable period last year. Red Bull sales were flat versus a year ago, its market share decreased 1.3 points to 36.6%. Rockstar's sales decreased 3% and its market share decreased 0.9 to 13.6%. According to Nielsen, with all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 22.6%. In the month of December 2013, Monster sales increased 20.9%.","Our market share decreased 0.5 to 35.1% against the comparable period last year. Red Bull sales increased 2.6% and its market share decreased by 5.6% to 28.4%. Boost sales increased 35% and its market share increased 1.5 points to 16.5%. Vivo 100, new in 2013, has grown to 7.8% market share, while Coke market share represented by Burn and Gladiator is 9.5%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and\/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market.","Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn could be materially impressed by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.","Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 15.2% to $519.4 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2013, from $451 million in the same period in 2012. Operating income for the DSD segment increased to 22.2% from $145.6 million to $177.9 million. Sales of our Monster Original Green Energy Drink continued to increase in the quarter as did sales of Java Monster. However, the increase in sales of these products, together with the sales of our Ultra Muscle Monster line, as well as certain other Monster energy products was partially offset by lower sales of certain Monster SKUs, including Lo-Carb Monster Energy, Monster Energy Absolutely Zero, certain of the Rehab, Monster Rehab drinks, Monster Import and Khaos.","Sales of Monster [indiscernible] and Peace Tea taker multipacks did not meet our expectations and we are winding down our sales of these products. Net sales for the company's Warehouse segment increased 4.5% to $21.4 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2013.","Sales of juice boxes and Hubert's Lemonades were higher but were partially offset by reduced sales of sodas. The warehouse division experienced an operating loss of $1 million in the quarter compared to an operating loss of $300,000 in the same period last year, largely as a result of lower gross profit due to the impact of increased cost of apple juice concentrate, as well as higher promotional allowances.","For the 3 months ended December 31, 2013, gross sales to retail grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers represented 4% of gross sales, up from 3% in the comparable period in 2012, gross sales to club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represented 8% of sales, down from 9% in 2012. Gross sales to full service distributors represented 64% of sales, lower than the 65% in 2012. Gross sales internationally increased to 22% from 21% in the same period in 2012. And other sales were 2% for the period, the same as in the comparable period in 2012.","Gross sales to customers outside of the United States in the fourth quarter of 2013 amounted to $137.9 million compared to $115.2 million in the same quarter in 2012. Included in such sales are sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. Net sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in the fourth quarter of 2013, in dollars, were 15.2% higher than the same period last year. Monster is continuing to gain momentum and increase market share in Europe. In particular, in the U.K., Spain, Germany, Sweden, Belgium, France and South Africa, Monster increased -- achieved increase -- achieved sales gains and continued to increase its market share.","Overall, our Western European and African divisions are now operating well and we have made good strides in achieving increased distribution levels and sales. In anticipation of the introduction of a sales tax on energy drinks in France, on January 1, 2014, our distributor in France increased its purchases in the fourth quarter of 2013 by an estimated $3 million, which we estimate will result in a reduction in our sales to our French distributor in the first quarter of 2014 by a similar amount. We're in the process of implementing a formula change for our products sold in France to address such tax.","The Central and Eastern European market is still incurring operating losses although we are seeing improved results from the strategic changes we implemented during last year. The addition of Monster Ultra Blue and Ultra Red, as well as the launch of our Muscle Monster line in 2013 were successful. We are continuing with our expansion strategy in international markets. Our distributor commenced sales in India during October 2013. In addition, we are proposing to launch Monster in a number of limited countries in Asia, Central and Eastern Europe and Africa this year.","Sales of Monster Energy brand internationally, including in Japan, in particular, continue to grow satisfactorily. The weaker yen negatively affected our growth sales in U.S. dollars, as well as our margins in Japan during the quarter. Sales to our Japanese distributor in the fourth quarter were higher in dollars than in the comparable quarter last year.","Plans for production in Japan and Korea continue to move forward and we are on track to commence full commercial production in Japan in March. We are also moving ahead with our plans to produce Monster Energy drinks in India. Sales in Chile are progressing well as are sales in Brazil where our new distributor continues to secure increased distribution for month-to-month. We are continuing with our strategy to secure local production in certain of our international markets, which we believe will facilitate improved gross margins and mitigate the effects of exchange rate fluctuations, as well as reduced damages.","Net sales of Peace Tea in the fourth quarter and 2013 full year were higher than in the comparable periods in 2012. We continue to believe that the Peace Tea brand has good growth potential and have added a mango juice cocktail to the line. We are planning to launch an iced coffee line in glass bottles under the Peace Tea brand later in 2014.","In the warehouse division, sales of Hubert's Lemonades in glass bottles for the year to December 31, 2013, were higher than sales in the previous year. The Hubert's brand continues to gain market and consumer acceptance.","Gross profit as a percentage of net sales achieved in the fourth quarter of 2013 was 51.2% versus 51.7% in the comparable quarter in 2012. The decrease in gross profit percentage was primarily attributable to certain inventory damages in reserves in excess of normal levels, as well as international sales, which have lower gross profit percentages than our North American sales. The gross profit percentage achieved in the fourth quarter in North America in 2013 was higher than in the comparable quarter last year. Gross profit percentages achieved outside North America from Monster Energy were lower in the fourth quarter of 2013 than in the comparable quarter in 2012. Gross profit percentage for the 2013 full year was 52.2% compared with 51.7% in 2012. We have covered a significant portion of our anticipated requirements for aluminum cans in 2014, as well as a significant portion of our anticipated requirements for apple juice and sugar over the same period. We do not believe that at current levels, increases in the cost of any raw material will have a material negative effect on our margins.","Distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales in the fourth quarter was 4.5%, versus 4.7% in the comparable quarter in 2012. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 10.8% in the quarter versus 12.5% in the comparable period in 2012. Our sponsorships and endorsement costs were higher, as well as the cost of merchandise displays and commissions, cost of point of sales, premiums and other marketing expenses were lower during the quarter. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2013, distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales were 4.5% versus 4.4% in the prior year. Selling expenses as a percentage of sales were 11.9%, unchanged from 2012. Sponsorship and endorsement costs, merchandise display costs and allocated [indiscernible] development programs were higher than in 2012. Selling expenses were also higher due to certain marketing expenses and in-store demos. The increase in selling expenses was partially offset by reduced expenses for advertising and allocated [indiscernible] program.","General and administrative expenses increased 22.2% in the quarter and 28.8% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in general and administrative cost was partially attributable to increased professional service costs for legal, accounting and other professional costs of which $4.7 million in the quarter and $17.9 million for the year, related to regulatory matters and litigation regarding our Monster Energy drinks, as well as increased payroll and related costs, which includes severance payments due to the reorganization of sales and marketing groups in Europe.","Operating income was negatively affected by combined operating losses of $3.5 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2013, from our international operations outside North America, which was higher than the operating losses of $0.7 million, which were incurred by us during the same period last year. We are continuing to work with certain of our distributors to increase their contribution towards promotional costs going forward and are working towards reducing our overall operating costs in our international markets.","For the 12 months ended December 31, 2013, operating income was negatively affected by combined operating losses of $12.9 million from our international operations outside North America. Following the strength of the U.S. dollar, we recorded foreign currency, transaction losses of $3.6 million for the quarter and $12.9 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2013.","Our effective tax rate in the 2013 fourth quarter was 42.2% compared to 39.1% in the 2012 fourth quarter, effective tax rate for the year ended December 31 was 39.9% compared to 38.1% for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase in effective tax rate for both the 2013 fourth quarter and 2013 full year was primarily the result of the establishment of a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of certain foreign subsidiaries, as well as losses in certain foreign subsidiaries, for which no tax benefit is recorded.","During the 2013 fourth quarter, the company purchased approximately 1 million shares of its common stock at an average purchase price of $56.98 per share pursuant to the repurchase program previously authorized by the Board of Directors in April 2013.","Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $211.3 million compared to $222.5 million at December 31, 2012. Short-term investments were $402.2 million compared to $97 million at December 31, 2012. Long-term investments decreased to $9.8 million from $21.4 million at December 31, 2012.","Included in short- and long-term investments are auction rate securities of $16.2 million. Days outstanding for trade account receivables were 40.1 days at December 31, 2013 and 39.2 days at December 31, 2012, compared to 44.7 days at September 30, 2013. Inventories increased to $221.4 million from $203.1 million at December 31, 2012. Average days of inventory was 75.6 days at December 31, 2013, which was lower than the 80.3 days of inventory at December 31, 2012, and higher than the 78.7 days at September 30, 2013.","Following up the positive response that we received from consumers to the launch of Zero Ultra, as well as our Ultra Blue line extension in the first half of 2013, we launched a new Ultra Red drink in the fourth quarter of 2013. In 2013, we also introduced a new line of 3 15-ounce energy shakes called Muscle Monster that contains 25 grams of protein per can, and subsequently, late in 2013 launched 2 new line extensions to the Muscle Monster line in Strawberry and Peanut Butter Cup flavors.","Our additional Monster Rehab line extension, Pink Lemonade, was well-received and has become our second best-selling Rehab product in the latest 13-week ended January 25, 2014, in the convenience and gas channel. We recently launched a new Punch Monster line by converting our existing 2 Dub edition product into Punch Monster product with new can graphics and flavors. We are planning to launch new additions to the Monster family.","Gross sales in January 2014 were 12.6% higher than in January 2013. We caution again that sells in a single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, and the timing of promotions in retail stores, and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period.","In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points:","One, North American gross margins remain healthy. Our 2013 fourth quarter gross margins for North America were higher than in the comparable quarter in 2012;","U.S. Nielsen market statistics show that the energy categories growth has recovered to the high single digits and that Monster Energy's growth is still outpacing the growth of the category as a whole;","three, new additions to the Monster family that have been introduced during 2013 are positive;","four, we believe our recently launched new Punch Monster line will appeal to a broader consumer demographic than Dub edition and will be positively received by distributors and consumers in 2014;","five, we believe that our new Strawberry and Peanut Butter Cup Muscle Monster Energy shakes will further enhance the line and increase sales;","six, turning to international markets, we are satisfied with the performance of our international expansion and investments, particularly Japan, United Kingdom, Spain, South Africa, Brazil and Chile;","seven, according to Nielsen, in the 13-week period to the end of December 2013, the actual days in the 13-week period vary by 2 days between different markets. Monster's market share in value in Great Britain, Spain and South Africa as compared to the same period last year grew from 9.6% to 10.6% in Great Britain, from 17.3% to 22.3% in Spain, and from 16.8% to 21.1% in South Africa. In addition, Monster's market share in Germany and France grew from 7.1% to 8.6% in Germany, and from 15.4% to 17.4% in France;","eight, I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in the EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in the EMEA vary from country to country;","nine, it is noteworthy that even though the energy drink category has been in existence in Europe for over 26 years, our EMEA markets on average are still experiencing single-digit growth, while Monster continues to achieve double-digit growth;","ten, sales of Monster in Japan are continuing to increase and remain encouraging;","11, [indiscernible] we were finally able to obtain regulatory approval for the sale of Monster in India. Sales are progressing satisfactorily;","12, as advised by AmBev, sales in Brazil by them are continuing to improve;","13, our initial tip productions in Japan have been favorable and we are moving forward with plans to produce in India.","I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets.","Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Rodney, you talked about France and the reformulation of product in France. Is that likely to have any ongoing sales impact in France, or do you see a similar tax initiated in either of the markets in Europe?","Rodney C. Sacks","We saw a similar tax initiated in Hungary and then in Mexico. And in Hungary, they put in a tax that was really high and the result was most of the energy drink companies reformulated in a different way and nobody paid the tax because it was just completely onerous and just not pragmatic. They then reformulated and they've redrawn the tax I think 3x now and they introduced tax now at a very much lower rate, which was -- which really made sense and was commercially realistic. And we reformulated and it didn't have an effect to ourselves, we have now gone back to reformulated based on the [indiscernible] tax and sales have come back. We did reformulate in Mexico and it didn't affect our sales and so, where we had the experience that we have reformulated, we've actually been able to continue. We found that the [indiscernible] labels that we were able to put in or [indiscernible] the ingredients were satisfactory. And so we believe we'll be able to reformulate and we don't believe that it will affect our sales in France. And we're just -- but obviously, we don't know exactly how it will pan out and what the government may do if they don't get the taxes they were hoping to get. So we'll see where it goes from there.","Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Great. And if I may ask one more. In the U.S., you had talked about the adoption, if everybody adopts new regulations to marketing. Now can you talk about what is your exposure to 14- to 18-year-old here? And if you adopt some voluntary marketing restrictions, what impact might have that on your sales here?","Rodney C. Sacks","Well, firstly, our primary demographic, which we've said from the -- when we first launched products in the energy category 16, 17 years ago when we launched Hansen's energy, was that our primary demographic is young adults 18 to 34. And that has since expanded a little more to 40 -- up to 45-plus. People, both above and below that age will consume our products. But that isn't our primary demographic and we don't focus our marketing efforts on people outside of that demographic. So we really don't believe that the issues of adolescents would have a [indiscernible] effect on our business. But if we look at those guidelines, the guidelines that had been proposed at this point do not affect adolescents, they are focused on marketing to children, the ADA and the FDC generally define children as under 12, many people define children as 12 and under, but that's the sort of range. So it's really focused on children and not on adolescents. And as we've said right from the beginning again, our products were not -- have not been recommended for children, we don't believe that children are consuming our products and our products are fine for adolescents and, again, but we don't believe that would be addressed by these guidelines -- be affected by the guidelines.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Wanted to quantify the gross margin impact in the quarter. So how much of the inventory damages in reserves are took down to gross margins? So what would've been on a normalized basis, that's question one. And also one while we're housekeeping, what the impact of FX was in the quarter, as well as on net international sales?","Unknown Executive","Mark, we gave the impact of FX in the statement. I'm not sure what more you're looking for on FX.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Well, I want to know what the impact was on the top line so not just what you're talking about in terms of the impact that you quantified in the release.","Rodney C. Sacks","Well the impact to the top line is not material at all. There are some gains and there are some losses [indiscernible] . I mean, it resembles and you take individual countries that become [indiscernible] sure, it was very material in Japan but not in other countries but overall...","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Overall, that's fine.","Rodney C. Sacks","Yes.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","What about the net international sales and the gross margin piece, please?","Rodney C. Sacks","On the gross margin, the excess, I don't have the exact -- an exact figure, but it's around about the $6 million level as we think was excess of -- in damages and -- higher than we would normally see in that area. But that's an approximate.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great. And then, just sort of broadly thinking about international profitability selling expenses. How should we think about those numbers on a go-forward basis? The selling expense is down year-on-year on an absolute basis. You talked about putting some of the promotional activity on the distributor. So is this sort of a shift now as we look forward that maybe perhaps we start seeing some international profitability and the selling expense numbers are sort of the good ones to use on a run rate basis, the one we saw in the fourth quarter?","Rodney C. Sacks","I think that we are trying to conservatively manage our costs without clearly focusing on cost management, particularly with international, with a view to getting profitability across the board. There are many countries that are already profitable in some of the earlier countries or smaller countries that it's been harder to get enough scale of sales to offset the costs of trying to run small countries that they -- it is fragmented. But as that continues to improve, we do -- we are hopeful that by keeping the top [indiscernible] on cost, we will get -- be able to improve our profitability. We also did refer to some realignment on some of our -- we had spent -- we have pulled back on some of our sampling, our net activities, [indiscernible] ourselves, where we were sort of supplementing and helping our distributors in some countries and we probably were over -- we had too many heads, so we sort of realigned that going into the fourth quarter and we will start to see a lot -- more of those benefits coming through the 2014 year. So we are looking to obviously get to a profitability position internationally. We are optimistic but at this point, we need to see how the next couple of quarters pan out.","Unknown Executive","And of course, local production will help, local production in Japan, local production in India.","Rodney C. Sacks","Yes, And then South Africa, I think that we also are planning I think later in the year. We are opening up some additional plants in southern Europe, which will help reduce some cost. So again, that is will be one of the material impacts that we think that over the course of 2014, we will probably open up quite a few additional production sites, which will be helpful.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So in the U.S. scanner data, we clearly saw a nice rebound in retail sales in Q4, both for your business and the energy category. You seem more bullish at the January Analyst Meeting. But since then we've seen a slowdown in the February scanner data. So I was hoping for some perspective and if you think that's primarily weather-related? Or are there other factors at play that could linger longer-term? And I guess, just taking a step back and parsing through this volatility, are you comfortable that the energy drink category is on better sustainable footing now at this point versus some of the weakness we saw last year?","Rodney C. Sacks","That it's a lot more is a sort of we're not sure, I mean, that would be we'd be guessing, but I -- we think that weather has -- we never like referring to weather. One of the things we've never been weatherman in this company as opposed to some of the major soft drinks companies but we are all right of getting to a point where we are actually -- but I think it is correct. I think weather did have an effect. I think the weather has been exceptionally harsh in the East. And in many cases, it actually has affected our distributors' ability and some of our men in different -- to actually go on that we deliver and that hasn't -- it's something that we experienced over the last few years. This is something that is unusual. So we do think that weather has had some impact on the category as a whole. And we are hoping that once we get through the next month or 2, weather will start improving all over and particularly in the East and we will -- things will return to normal. We think the -- we feel quite good about the category, about the growth and that it has sort of returned to better levels. But again, depending on what happens on the regulatory front, it has been quiet and that might have an impact. But on the one hand, on the other hand, it's been going on now for over a year so I think a lot of consumers are basically starting to get tired of it and it's becoming old news. And we still feel very comfortable with the science and the safety of our products.","Operator","Our next line -- our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","If you could just kind of dig in deeper to Dara's question, the energy drink category certainly had a nice recovery over the last several months. And I'm just curious, maybe if you could correct in context on -- is this new consumers coming to the category? Is this kind of existing consumers getting back to normal consumption behavior? Any context you can provide around some of the consumption patterns would be helpful?","Rodney C. Sacks","We simply don't know. We read the results, and -- but we just don't have -- and also, I can't give you good numbers [ph] , I would be guessing. So I just can't.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just following up on Mark's question earlier. I missed, what were the $6 million in damages, was that in Japan store or is that somewhere else? And is that expected -- anything to carry over into 2014?","Unknown Executive","We don't -- it was widespread. It was one of those interesting situations where we had widespread damages in reserves across-the-board. Some in Europe, some in the U.S., some obviously in Asia.","Rodney C. Sacks","Yes, Asia the [indiscernible] one of the problem areas and as we continue to [indiscernible] local production, we believe that will lower our cost of goods there, improve our margins and also, reduce -- eliminate the damages of concern. But it really -- it was spread all over.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Rodney, just thought on the kind of roll out this year, just trying to understand, I mean, are we seeing most of the new, be it Red, be it Peanut Butter Cup in the market now, or will that kind of phase-in, I mean, do you expect bigger launches as we get closer to summer?","Rodney C. Sacks","Well, Red has gone up and that's picked up quite nice distribution and that's -- in the Muscle Monster line, the actual Muscle Monster line is only about a 50% level. So we are rolling out Strawberry and that's going to pick up. We will be rolling out Peanut Butter to the general market probably in May. The new Punch line is going up as we work it through old cans and inventories, we are not sort of basically discarding any of the old inventory, so that it's starting to get onto shelves now and really by -- we expect by the end of March, early April or so, that will be pretty well distributed. There are 1 or 2 new products we are looking at. And at this point, those are sort of slated for midyear.","Unknown Executive","But we should mention that the Peanut Butter is in exclusive distribution with one particular customer group.","Rodney C. Sacks","At this point, that is correct and then the general market will go out in about May, I think it is.","Unknown Executive","That's good.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with CLSA.","Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I'm just trying to understand on -- it's taking as long as it is to get local production going, for example, in Japan. It seems to have been pushed out a little bit over time and the damages become increasingly an issue. So what are some of the challenges you face because it's hard to imagine why it's so difficult?","Rodney C. Sacks","I'll tell you why. In Japan, we launched Monster in a slim can, the 11-ounce [indiscernible] slim can. That can was not a can manufacturer available in Japan. So we actually had to contract with a can company to have molds made and to actually have the can specifically made for us. Once we had the can made, we had to then get changed parts made on a line at which we're doing and we are testing and we're dealing with seaming issues now and production issues for really a new can that is not being run and -- on Japanese line with particular manufacturer. So this is why that has been an unusually long process. Normally, the process to get a packer up and running, you will need lesser amount of change parts maybe a share mixer or the RO water, which we require, those are 2 things that we find generally we do need to usually have our packers purchase and install. And those are usually shorter timelines, not as much complications in getting it up and running and getting quality right. So that is the reason that we've had with Japan. Then you normally have the issues of flavors and waters, the Monster Flavor, particularly the Green is very sensitive to different types of water, even though you use RO, RO has different meanings and there are different levels of minerals that are left in it. And they generally -- you'll -- you can come -- working with 1 factory works the first time and other factors, we've had a real problem with the factory in Spain where all our flavors are fine except the green. We simply can't get green with the right taste. So it's been nearly 9 months of trials and retrials in Spain to get green done. But the guys up and running with the other ones in the [indiscernible]. So we just had some production issues, the flavor is very delicate, particularly the green flavor, and that is the reason -- once we get going and we get the right authorizations in, for example, in India, that will be a shorter production issue. The issue with South Africa is similar, they don't have cans, they don't make the 500-milligram cans, it's not available. We actually are contracting to try and get cans shipped to South Africa in the short-term, and then, they will be in local production on 500, they are introducing that size towards the end of the year. So we are hoping, we actually can get production towards the second -- early in the second half of the year with the imported cans which will be slightly more expensive but then we'll go through local production. So those are the challenges we're having in addition to the normal production challenges we have. As I said, with water and mixing equipment, et cetera.","Unknown Executive","I think it's also important, Caroline, to understand that we go with the package that we feel has got the best success in our market. That's why in Japan, we went for a particular can, because we felt that would have the best success. And I think that performance to-date has proven that, that was a good move. But the can is not commercially available yet, but it will be shortly.","Rodney C. Sacks","I think one of the reasons that maybe distinguishes us from many beverage companies is that in the case of -- a usual beverage company, they will simply use the package that is easier to produce and that is locally available. And it doesn't -- they don't focus on being different and being unique and I think that is -- we do, we really do, we've done it all our lives here. And we would rather take the time and effort to get into a package that is different and that is unique than rather just follow the herd and just take a normal -- we could use a normal 12-ounce package like a soda can and do it, but we think that is the reason why we've been able to make Monster different and that was one of the reasons. And it is important to stay true to that, so it has taken more time. We understand that. But it will come together, it's just it has taken more time than we would have liked them.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Wanted just follow up on one of the things you mentioned in the call, which was severance payments in Europe, related to your restructuring. Is that related to some of the changes in the contracts you're trying to work out with the distributors?","Rodney C. Sacks","No, that is completely separate. This was just in anticipation of possibly, sort of maybe being more optimistic about where the category was going in sales. I think, we ramped up with there and just found that we had our MET teams and TDMs were probably too large. We looked at our margins and the available margins and this really had to trim down and get that down to a more manageable level and to grow a little slower. So we looked -- that was the restructuring and that was pretty much and by and large in Western Europe. This is during the last -- the fourth quarter.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. And then one other sort of quick follow-up on India. At the Analyst Meeting, you talked about moving into India maybe a little bit sooner than you had planned because the right distributor came up. I guess, how should we think about the run rate there, is this a market where you think it -- we should -- we need to be patient and it's going to take a long time to develop?","Rodney C. Sacks","We think you need to be patient. We think ultimately, the market is a very big market but as the moment, the Ultra Premium energy drink market is a small niche market from an affordability point of view. But we think that will continue to grow just as the country starts to expand and grow. So we see the energy category being a much bigger market down the line. I mean, it's obviously you know that population is up. But in the short term, it will be a smaller niche market and we are hoping to grow as we did in Japan was to hope to actually grow the market as opposed to simply trying to get a share of the existing market, but a lot of logistical issues in Japan in getting product from -- through the different cities where we sort of primarily focused our launch on a couple of key cities, the 2 main cities, obviously of Delhi and Mumbai, and a couple of the other major ones sort of -- as well. But those -- that's been the focus and as we continue to grow, we will be able to roll it out more.","Unknown Executive","And as we have mentioned and spoken to our analysts in the past, we'll continue to lose money in India until we are able to achieve local production.","Rodney C. Sacks","In some ways it's good enough to sell too much because -- well there's more per can. But we are going to get there and we hopefully will get to local production or so reasonably, reasonably soon, going forward.","Operator","I'm showing no further questions at this time and I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Rodney Sacks for any further remarks.","Rodney C. Sacks","Thank you very much. On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad. We are reiterating, and I can do it enough in times, that our products are safe, are properly labeled and the caffeine content of a Monster at approximately 10 milligrams per ounce is less than 0.5 milligrams per ounce of the caffeine levels contained in Starbucks and other coffee house, brewed coffee.

Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, he's with me today; as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance.","Before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and which are based on currently-available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance, and trends.","Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations, and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call.","Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission; including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2017, including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements, for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.","An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes and designated with asterisks in the consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated May 4, 2017. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section.","Sales continue to be challenging in the beverage industry in the first quarter and remain weak. In the first quarter, net sales were $742.1 million, up 9.1% from $680.2 million in the first quarter of 2016. The company achieved record first quarter gross sales of $845.5 million, up 8.8% from $777.5 million in the first quarter of 2016.","Unfavorable currency exchange rates reduced net sales by approximately $3.7 million in the 2017 first quarter. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the first quarter was 64.8%, as compared to 62.2% for the comparable 2016 first quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to cost of goods savings, as a result of the AFF transaction, which was partially offset by product mix and certain increases in other costs. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.1% for the 2017 first quarter, as compared to 3.4% in the 2016 first quarter.","Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.7%, compared to 10.2% in the same quarter a year ago. The increase was primarily due to increased sponsorship and endorsement costs and commissions. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 14.4%, as compared to 11.1% in the same quarter last year. General and administrative costs, excluding distributor termination expenses, as a percentage of net sales increased to 11.8% in the first quarter of 2017, compared to 10.6% for the 2016 first quarter.","Payroll expenses were up $13 million, primarily to support the strategic brand that we acquired from Coca-Cola, as well as the launches in China and other countries internationally, and stock-based compensation, which is a noncash item, was $3.1 million higher.","Distributor termination expenses were $19.9 million in the first quarter as compared to $3.4 million in the 2016 first quarter.","Legal expenses related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's product were $1.9 million in the 2017 first quarter as compared to $5.4 million in the 2016 first quarter.","Our effective tax rate decreased from 35.8% in the 2016 first quarter to 32.8% in the 2017 first quarter primarily due to an increase in profits earned by certain foreign subsidiaries in lower tax jurisdictions than the U.S., as well as an increase in equity compensation deductions.","Net income was $178 million in the 2017 first quarter, compared to net income of $163.9 million in the 2016 first quarter, an increase of 8.6%.","The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 620.7 million for the first quarter of 2016 to 582 million for the first quarter of 2017, as a result of share buybacks, including the modified Dutch tender auction, which was completed in June 2016.","Net income was impacted by the substantial increase in distributor termination expenses previously mentioned above.","Diluted earnings per share for the 2017 first quarter increased 15.8% to $0.31 per share from $0.26 in the first quarter of 2016. We estimate that distributor termination expenses in the 2017 first quarter of $19.9 million negatively affected diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.02 per share after tax.","We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. Domestically, we transitioned distribution of Monster Energy Drinks in Wisconsin to Coca-Cola bottlers in early January 2017, in parts of Minnesota including Minneapolis and St. Paul in March 2017, and in a part of North Dakota including Fargo in April 2017. We are also making good progress in the U.S. in non-traditional channels, including food service accounts.","In EMEA in the first quarter of 2017, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Nigeria, Oman and smaller countries in EMEA. And in April 2017 we commenced distribution of Monster with the Coca-Cola bottler in Kazakhstan. Further additional launches are planned in the remainder of the second quarter of 2017 in certain countries in Africa and the Middle East.","In the first quarter of 2017 we launched distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain countries in the Caribbean. In the second quarter of 2017 we anticipate launching Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain other smaller and medium-sized markets in that geographic region.","In China during the first quarter of 2017, we continued with launches in Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Zhejiang and Jiangsu. We also extended distribution in the Guangdong province. Further launches are planned in China and in other countries, including a relaunch in India in 2017. We also commenced distribution in Malaysia in the same period.","We continue to make progress towards our planned relaunch in India later this year. We are also on track to commence distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Vietnam, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan in the second quarter.","As a result of the AFF transaction, we achieved raw material cost savings of $23.3 million in the 2017 first quarter, which were broadly in line with expectations.","According to the Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through April 22, 2017, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category including energy shots increased by 2.5% versus the same period a year ago.","Sales of Monster grew 1.8% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS increased 10.6%, and sales of Full Throttle decreased 5.1%. Sales of Red Bull increased 5.3%, sales of Rockstar increased by 1.9%, sales of 5-hour decreased 6.4%, and sales of AMP decreased 29.9%.","According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended April 22, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars increased 2.7% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 1.5% over the same period last year, while NOS was up 12.7%, and Full Throttle sales decreased 2.1%. Sales of Red Bull increased by 5.8%, Rockstar was up 4.6%, 5-hour was down 7.2%, and AMP was down 29.9%.","We pointed out that the energy shot category has been slowing for some time. And if we exclude the energy shots, as well as energy coffee and energy protein drinks, where we have experienced production capacity shortages, for the 4 weeks ended April 22, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channel in dollars, in fact, increased by 4.6% over the same period last year, with sales of Monster increasing by 4.5%.","We note that the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks and 4 weeks ended April 22, 2017, exclude sales of NOS and Full Throttle 8 packs, which were not yet in the Nielsen system.","According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended April 22, 2017, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, decreased by 0.4 points over the same period last year to 35%. NOS's share increased 0.4 points to 4.2%, and Full Throttle's share remained the same at 1%. Red Bull's share increased 1 point to 36%, Rockstar's share was up 0.1 of a point to 8%, 5-hour's share was lower by 0.8 of a point at 7.4%, and AMP's share decreased 0.6 of a point to 1.2%.","According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended April 22, 2017, sales of energy plus coffee drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel decreased 6.3% over the same period last year. Sales of Java Monster were 19.5% lower than the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Doubleshot Energy were 8.6% higher. We continue to experience production capacity shortages for Java Monster, which I will address later in the call.","According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12-weeks ended April 1, 2017, the energy drink category increased 2% in dollars. Monster sales increased 10% versus a year ago, and market share increased 2.1 share points to 30.5%. Red Bull sales increased 3%, and its market share decreased 0.4 of a point to 35.9%. Rockstar's sales increased 5%, and its market share increased 0.8 points to 19.4%.","According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 27% during the month of March 2017. Monster sales increased 41.1%, and market share in value increased 2.7 points to 26.7% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn decreased 27%. Burn's market share decreased 2.7 points to 3.7%. Red Bull's sales decreased 3.5%, and its market share decreased by 3.7 points to 11.6%. Vive 100's market share increased 4.5 points to 41.9%, while Boost's market share decreased 2.1 points to 7.9%.","The transition to the KO bottler system in August 2016 resulted in significantly-wider availability of Monster in the traditional trade channel, mom-and-pop stores in Mexico. According to Nielsen, distribution of Monster grew from 10% in March 2016 to 24% in March 2017 in this channel. This translates to growth in Monster's value share of 9 percentage points versus March 2016 in the traditional channel.","The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and\/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in their chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.","I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers for EMEA should only be used as a guide, because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI for EMEA vary from country-to-country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending March 2017, the actual 13-week periods differ, varied by few days between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 13% to 15.5% in Great Britain, from 9.5% to 10.6% in Belgium, from 9.1% to 11.6% in Norway, from 21.5% to 23.7% in France, from 24.4% to 26.5% in Spain, and from 13% to 16.3% in Germany.","According to Nielsen, for the period ending March 2017, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year decline from 6.8% to 5.2% in the Netherlands and from 11.1% to 10.8% in Sweden, although the retail value of sales grew 22.1% in Sweden in the comparable period.","For the 13-week period, ending March 2017, according to Nielsen, Monster's retail market share and value as compared to the same period last year grew from 11.3% to 11.6% in the Czech Republic, from 15.8% to 17.7% in South Africa and from 6.9% to 9.7% in Italy.","For the 13-week period, ending February 2017, according to Nielsen, Monster's retail market share and value as compared to the same period last year grew from 7.3% to 9.9% in Ireland.","According to IRI, Monster's market share in Greece grew in the 13 weeks ended February 2017 from 27.7% last year to 29.1%.","According to Nielsen, Monster's retail market share and value in Chile increased to 28.4% in March 2017 as compared to 20.5% last year, and after transitioning to the KO bottler system in November 2016, Monster's market share and value in Brazil grew to 7.4% in March 2017 as compared to 2.9% in the same period last year.","According to Nielsen, in South Korea, Monster's retail market share and value increased from 17.9% to 24.5% in February 2017 compared to the same period last year.","According to INTAGE, Monster's market share and value in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 39.9% to 44.2% in March 2017.","According to IRI, in Australia, Monster's market share and value grew from 3.1% to 7.1% in March 2017, and in New Zealand, Monster's market share and value grew from 2.3% to 5.5% for the first quarter of 2017 versus the same period last year.","Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the first quarter of 2017 increased 7.5% from $621.7 million to $668.6 million from the comparable period last year. Gross sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the first quarter of 2017 increased 7.4% from $713.5 million to $766.6 million for the comparable period last year. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the first quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $4.7 million of foreign currency movements.","Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment were $68 million for the first quarter as compared to $58.5 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales for the company's Strategic Brands segment were positively impacted by approximately $1 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter.","Net sales for the Other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, were $5.5 million in the 2017 first quarter. There were no sales for the Other segment in the comparable 2016 first quarter.","We continue to experience production capacity shortages for our re-torqued (18:03) products, Java Monster and Muscle Monster. To reduce the shortfall, we have commenced manufacturing certain flavors of Java Monster in Europe which will shortly be available to our customers in the U.S. We've also procured additional production in the U.S. which will be coming on stream early in the third quarter of 2017 and will result in additional Java Monster and Muscle Monster volumes being available for distribution to retailers thereafter.","As a result, we anticipate that it will still be a number of months before production availability allows us to restore normal supply patterns and fully meet consumer demand that exists for these products. We estimate that net sales in the quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $12 million as a result of such production capacity shortages.","Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $190.9 million for the 2017 first quarter compared to $149.1 million in the corresponding quarter in 2016. In local currencies, net sales to customers outside of the U.S. were approximately $3.7 million higher. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, net sales in the first quarter increased 17.7% in dollars, and 21.7% in local currencies over the same period last year.","Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 50.2% in the same period last year to 50.3% during the quarter. We are pleased with the rollout of certain SKUs in the Ultra range in EMEA markets. In 2017, we added additional SKUs of Ultra across EMEA with the introduction of Ultra Citron, which will be available in 10 additional EMEA markets in 2017. Various SKUs in the Ultra range are now sold in 33 EMEA markets. We're also pleased that Monster continued to perform well and gained market share in Great Britain, Germany, France, Spain, Norway, Denmark, Poland, Ireland, Italy and the Czech Republic.","In Asia Pacific, net sales in the first quarter increased 58.1% in dollars, and 60.5% in local currencies over the same period last year.

In South Korea, net sales increased 15% or 18.2% in local currency, as compared to the same quarter last year.","In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia and Guam, net sales increased 44.7%, or 50% in local currencies, as compared to the same quarter last year.","As previously mentioned, we are moving ahead with plans for local production in India with a view towards reentering the market in 2017.","In Latin America, including Mexico, the Caribbean, gross sales in the first quarter increased 36.2% in dollars and 34.9% in local currencies. Net sales in the first quarter increased 42.2% in dollars and 41.8% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 41.1% in the same period last year to 48.8% during the 2017 first quarter.","Net sales increased in Brazil 396.4% in dollars, or 481.7% in local currency, largely due to the transition of Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers, which took place on November 1, 2016. Net sales in Chile increased 47.6% in dollars, and 59.1% in local currency.","Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $576.3 million, compared to $377.6 million at December 31, 2016. Short-term investments were $209.4 million, compared to $220.6 million at December 31, 2016. Long-term investments decreased to $0.5 million from $2.4 million at December 31, 2016.","Accounts receivable increased to $509.5 million at March 31, 2017, from $448.1 million at December 31, 2016. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 54.9 days, compared to 48.2 days at December 31, 2016. Inventories increased to $171.3 million from $162 million at December 31, 2016. Average days of inventory was 59 days at March 31, 2017, compared to 57 days at December 31, 2016.","As previously reported, in September 2016 we launched Mutant, an exciting super soda in limited convenience stores in certain U.S. markets with encouraging sales per point of distribution. We will be launching a line extension of our Mutant brand family, namely White Lightning, a zero-sugar offering to limited customers initially, followed with a general market launch in July. We remain confident about the potential of this brand.","In preparation for the launch of Hydro, we commenced limited deliveries of Hydro products to our bottlers and full service distributors at the end of the quarter and are planning for the launch of Hydro to the general retail trade at the end of this month. Hydro is a non-carbonated, lightly-sweetened energy drink that is packaged in a unique 16.9 oz PET can, the size of which is exclusive to us in the U.S. at this time. We are planning to launch Hydro in a 550 ml PET bottle in the United Kingdom and Ireland during the second quarter of 2017.","We expanded distribution of Monster Energy Ultra Violet and launched Full Throttle Orange during the first quarter of 2017.","At the end of April 2017 we launched a new Lewis Hamilton signature Monster Energy drink in Great Britain, which will be followed by launches in 24 European markets in the second quarter of 2017 and in South Africa in July.","We have a robust innovation pipeline and further launches, such as Mango Loco, a new flavor in our Monster Energy juice family, which is planned for a third quarter 2017 launch, and a new espresso Monster Energy drink in 8 oz slim cans in two flavors planned for launch before year end.","April 2017 had one fewer selling day compared with April 2016. We estimate April 2017 gross sales to be approximately 9.5% higher than in April 2016. On a foreign exchange adjusted basis, we estimate April 2017 gross sales to be approximately 10.6% higher than in April 2016.","In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches, and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances, where our bottlers are responsible for production, and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.","On February 28, 2017, the company's board of directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. No shares were repurchased under this repurchase program during the first quarter. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. We recognize the reduction in raw material costs of $23.3 million in the first quarter as a result of our acquisition of AFF.","North American and international gross margins remain healthy. While the U.S. Nielsen market statistics show that the Energy Drink category slowed in the U.S. towards the end of the 2016 fourth quarter, it appears to have picked up steam through the first quarter. The equivalent market statistics from many countries around the world show that the Energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category. Currency exchange rates continue to affect our results.","The new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the company sales. We're excited about the prospects for our new product launches. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China, one of the largest energy drink markets globally.","We have successfully transitioned additional international countries to Coca-Cola bottlers in the first quarter and will be transitioning a number of other markets to Coca-Cola bottlers in 2017.","I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good afternoon, guys.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Hi, good afternoon, Dara.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Rodney, can you give us more detailed thoughts on your trends so far in the cities and where you've launched in China early on. And you've been, for a few months, any update on consumer demand in those markets? And then also, separately, some of the new cities launched more recently and what level is retailer reception you're getting? Thanks.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","I think that it really is still very early to tell. We're getting sales that we are comfortable with. It's all right, but they vary from area to area depending on the execution of the bottler, depending on the positioning in the stores and basically, pricing and points of sale. So, we think that it's certainly going to take time to continue. You can't just put stuff \u2013 a brand like Monster which is not known on the shelf and expect it to immediately start achieving velocities that are where you'd like it to be. There is a buildup and we're going to go through this buildup over a period of time.","So really, it really is premature. We're comfortable with the velocities we're getting and the volumes. We're comfortable with the attention and focus. We're putting a lot of effort behind it. We're building up our own infrastructure and teammates to support the brand, support sampling and in-store execution, and we are seeing good execution from a point of view of our point of sale and things of that nature. And we are quite happy with that.","But it really is just premature to talk. We are comfortable with the market. It is a large market, and it will continue. We're right in the middle of the rollouts, as we've indicated. There were a whole new number of regions we introduced. It's probably late because of the Chinese New Year was late February into March.","We're planning launches. We've planned launches, and we have launched throughout April. And we continue in May, and then pretty much most of it will be done. So there will be a few more areas to do in June and July, but we think it'll be pretty much done by then. There may be one or two hiccups that we don't anticipate at this point. But it will take time, and it's just a very big market and you've got to be patient with and just build slowly.","Hilton H. Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.","I think one of the other points about China is that a number of the websites and social media that our consumers are used to elsewhere in the world don't appear in China. So in a sense while we have extremely good exposure for the brand in many, many markets in the world, we don't have that same exposure to the Internet in China. So the build will be a lot harder.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good afternoon, everybody.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Hi.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. I just wanted to follow up with more like thinking of all the outlets, if you can think about like how your growth was? I mean if you're putting the $12 million back, most likely your sales grew close to 7%? I wanted to just clarify that in the U.S.","And if that is a number that we should use? And how is the cadence of the improvement during the quarter? I'm assuming, as most companies, like things have improved for the cadence of the quarter? And if you can tell us roughly how the sellout has been?","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Well, let's just deal with the first question. One at a time.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. All right.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","You've got to do your own numbers. We don't report the numbers for the U.S. and break them out. You've seen the Nielsen numbers. If you take the Nielsen numbers and then factor in the negative effect on the production issues we've had and they've really been sort of more identified by \u2013 we try to keep the two main SKUs in production and on the shelf. But really what it's done is that most of the other SKUs have been out of production and off-the-shelf, and that has continued. So you've got to really take that into account in looking at the growth of the industry and the growth of Monster in the U.S.","We did sort of have probably less innovation hitting in this period than we had last year, sort of the reserve for Red Bull. But again, we've explained on a number of occasions what our innovation is for this year and how it's going to come in later in the year because of timing.","So we really think that you guys have got make your own judgment call on how you look at the U.S. and the growth. We don't give guidance on the growth either to U.S. or on a broader basis, but we feel pretty comfortable about the industry. We are seeing growth if you look at the Nielsen numbers, and that's what I was referred to earlier.","It was down to almost a negative inconvenience in December, and then it's grown just under 1% in January. It was 1.5% or so, roughly, in February. It was 2.5% or 2.6% in March, and it's actually gone up a little higher in April. So clearly there is a nice trend, but you can see the numbers as well as we can. And we think that that is positive going forward.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","But do you see it tracks well at this point? Nielsen is tracking well your actual volumes?","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","I'm not sure I heard the question.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","No. I'm just saying if...","Hilton H. Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.","There's a difference between our sales and \u2013 the increase in our sales and what we are seeing in Nielsen. So we went through the Nielsen numbers on the call. You saw what our quarterly sales levels were, and then you must make your own assumptions as to what you think the performance was.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","We obviously sell in a lot of the non-major channels and that really accounts for the difference and if you've noticed over the years there always has been some timing differences between Nielsen and our numbers.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Thanks","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is open.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yes. Hey. Good afternoon, guys.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Hi, Mark.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So maybe just to go back to that last question, something that clearly comes up repeatedly in conversations from investors in terms of trying to reconcile the scanner data with your reported results, maybe if you could give us a bit of specifics about change in points of distribution in the untracked channels, just so sort of where they come from, where are they now, and how large as a percent of the business \u2013 if you don't want to say specifically, but just sort of broader strokes about how important they're becoming to the business today versus where they've been. I think that might help folks a bit.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Without going into the level of them, we are starting to do more business and have more sales in the non-major channels, for example, food service, specialty accounts, non-food accounts. And those continue to increase. Internet, Amazon, although small, some of them are small, they are increasing at quite a strong rate. And we think that one of the reasons there is possibly some slowdown in the convenience channel is it may be attributable to the broader availability, not only of Monster but in fact of energy drinks, through a number of these non-traditional channels.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Hilton H. Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.","So, Mark, maybe I can give you a little bit more color. In the on-premise segment, we continue to see double-digit growth in this channel. So maybe that'll be helpful.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Sharma with BMO. Your line is open.","Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Hi. Good afternoon.","Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Rodney, two questions. One on China. You talked about the buildup as we go through the next few months, or three months, and expect to be fully done by, latest, summer. When you say that, are you thinking about the ACV build or just the penetration? How are we thinking about it when we say fully implemented there? And then international again...","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Well, let's just start \u2013 let's just do it one at a time, guys, please.","Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Okay. When we say July, we will have launched through all of the business units in the \u2013 on the two Coke bottlers, there were three Coke bottlers and, as you are aware, the Coca-Cola owned bottler, they've sold their and refranchised their system. It's been divided effectively between COFCO and Swire. And then there was some interchange of territories between COFCO and Swire so that their own territories are more aligned and more adjacent to each other.","So we will have launched by July through the different BUs. There is obviously no instantaneous miraculous listing on all the shelves. We're going to continue to build, because particularly in China, there is a modern trade, which is easier and obviously you pick up listings on that much more quickly.","But the very, very bulk \u2013 large bulk of the business is still traditional trade. And that means it's got to be built up store-by-store slowly, slowly, one-by-one. So that is going to still take time to get that penetration up. And that is going to be a slow build. As we continue to build, as we continue to gain momentum, as we hopefully increase our velocity, we'll also be increasing our exposure and distribution through the whole system. So that's still going to take some time. There is a distinction between those two.","Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it. That's really helpful. And then I just had a question on the international contribution margins, right? And you talked about gross margins increasing in many markets. How should we think about it? You're getting more and more contribution from international markets. At the operating level also are you seeing margins improve from these markets?","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","We are seeing some benefit. We are seeing benefits of scale and also improving our local production. We're continuing to get a number of additional plants online, which is helping us reduce our costs in many markets. And that will continue, because as we continue to build out the international market, we are continuing to go through this process of getting production lower and nearer to these markets.","We do have \u2013 we'll have that same build in marketing and at G&A spend. But initially in some of the newer markets, we obviously are overspending in our G&A side, particularly payroll, in order to support the launches of brands. And so that will take some time, but as we continue, it will have less and less impact as we get maturer in these markets. But we still do have some large markets. I mean, going through the market in China at the moment, we're continuing to increase our head count quite substantially as we're go into each of these launches in each of these Bus, we have to have representation. When we go into India, we will need more people.","So there is a disconnect but it is becoming less impactful, because of that we're seeing we think some better gross margins and better bottom-line margins as we go forward.","Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Laurent Grandet with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Laurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, guys.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Hi.","Laurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","I'd like to understand, I mean, to have a bit more clarification on two buckets of growth for you. So first is international launches. Could you give us an update on the three of the major country launches this year? So India, Pakistan, and Argentina. I understand Nigeria has been down. And the second bucket, of course, is Mutant in the U.S. So would like to understand, I mean, what are the marketing activities you are planning to implement to support same-store sales growth, that seems to be soft for now So if you can give me, I mean, or give us, I mean, a bit on those two things and two buckets of growth that would be great. Thank you.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Yes. Just looking at those three markets, they're very large markets, but they're smaller markets from a point of view of the energy category, the premium energy category. So, in India, we are \u2013 as we've indicated planning to launch. We're also evaluating the possibility of launching Mutant as a sort of an affordable energy drink in that market.","Argentina, we are moving forward. We are very close. We've still not finalized packing arrangements, but we're right in the middle of negotiations on that, and hope to be able to finalize that reasonably soon. We are, at the same time, going down the track of actually having our product registered and approved, so that's all happening, so that is again will also be a later launch later this year.","With regard to Pakistan, we just \u2013 pretty much, I think we're about or we're in the throes of just starting to sell now, but it's a smaller market from a premium energy drink product brand. We think there is a much larger market that we can look at, and again, we're also looking at the possibility of launching Mutant there, also still later this year. So they're sort of slightly different. They're slightly different markets, and we are in the planning stages with them, and in the process, so they're all hopefully going to come through before the end of the year.","Laurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you. And on Mutant in the U.S., give us some color on to the marketing activities you are planning to implement to support same-store sales growth that would be great. Thank you.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Well, we have some planning activities. We have switched certain of our existing Monster properties, which we've had for many years and have done \u2013 worked very nicely for Monster, such as the Vans Warped Tour. We've made the Vans Warped Tour pretty much a Mutant property, which will get us a lot of sampling, a lot of exposure in 40-something markets and concerts around the U.S.","We've also switched, not completely, but a lot of exposure of Mutant into the Monster Jam Series, which are those big trucks, and that's going to happen for the rest of the year. We are going to do in-store price promotions. We're doing sampling, extensive sampling promotions as well for Mutant, and that's all starting to kick in now starting in May and June, the promotions and, as I've said, the sampling activities.","We also indicated that we had started with certain limited retailers. We're actually starting some distribution of basically our new zero-calorie White Lightning Mutant drink, which will then give us a better positioning on shelf, and give us alternative offerings, full calorie, and sugar and zero, and that will be probably in the general market by beginning of July.","So those two things together we believe with a much broader rollout now. We've opened the market. The number of accounts we're going to in the channels. We are expanding that at the same time now and getting listings. So again, by the time we get to summer midyear, we think that we will have much better distribution for Mutant.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO for closing remarks.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company, both at home and abroad, and in particular to expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottling system internationally. We're also particularly excited about the new opportunities that we have going forward with a portfolio of energy products throughout the world comprised of our Monster Energy brand, together with the strategic brands, as well as Mutant.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Rodney Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may begin.","Rodney Sacks","Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I\u2019m Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, is with me today, as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance.","Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends. Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the Company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call.","Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed February 29, 2016, as well as our most recent report on Form 10-Q filed August, 2016, including the sections contained therein entitled risk factors and forward-looking statements, for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","An explanation on the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes and designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated November 3, 2016. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section.","Sales in the beverage industry in the third quarter continued to be weak on a global basis. In the third quarter, net sales were $788 million, up 4.1% from $756.6 million in the third quarter of 2015. The Company achieved record gross sales of $913.3 million up 5.9% from $862.4 million in the third quarter of 2015. The comparative growth in net sales of $862.4 million and $756.6 million respectively for the 2015 third quarter was positively impacted by advance purchases made by the Company\u2019s customers due to a pre-announced price increase effective August 31, 2015, on certain of the Company\u2019s Monster Energy brand energy drinks.","The Company estimates that both gross and net sales for the 2015 third quarter increased by approximately $12 million and the $11 million respectively as a result of such advance purchases. Gross and net sales for the 2016 third quarter, after adjusting the 2015 third quarter comparatives for advance purchases, increased by 7.4% and 5.7%, respectively. In this regard, I would like to point out that the increase in Monster\u2019s net sales for the 2016 third quarter is hurdling a significant increase in the third quarter of 2015 over the prior year\u2019s third quarter. Unfavorable currency exchange rates reduced gross sales by approximately $4.8 million and net sales by approximately $2.6 million in the 2016 third quarter.","Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 63.8% as compared to 61.5% for the comparable 2015 third quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the cost of goods savings and as a result of the AFF transaction and product mix. ","Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.1%, compared to 3.5% in the same quarter last year. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.1% compared to 10.7% in the same quarter a year ago. Increased sponsorship and endorsement costs, as well as increases in certain other marketing expenses including marketing, research and social media were the principal reasons for the increase in selling expenses. In-store demos and premiums were also higher in the quarter. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 11.7% as compared to 8.8% in the same quarter last year. Payroll expenses were up $7.3 million, primarily to support the strategic brands that we acquired from Coca-Cola, and stock-based compensation and non-cash item was 3.3 million higher.","Distributor termination costs were $4.7 million in the third quarter, as compared to $2.5 million in the 2015 third quarter. Regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and safety. and sale of the Company\u2019s product were $4.9 million in the 2016 third quarter, as compared to $3.4 million in the 2015 third quarter. Legal and professional costs related to intellectual property matters particularly in China were $2.5 million in the 2016 third quarter as compared to $0.8 million in the comparable 2015 third quarter. Our effective tax rate in the quarter decreased from 39.4% in the 2015 third quarter to 33.8% in the 2016 third quarter, primarily due in part to a one-time benefit related to a prior period domestic production deduction. On an ongoing basis, we expect that our normalized tax rate will be approximately 36%.","Net income was $191.6 million in the 2016 third quarter compared to net income of $174.6 million in the 2015 third quarter, an increase of 9.8%. Net income per diluted share increased 17.5% to $0.99 in the quarter due in part to a lower share count as a result of the completion of the modified Dutch auction in June 2016. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from $208.1 million at September 30, 2015, to $194.4 million at September 30, 2016.","We are continuing to make good progress on the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers internationally. In United States, we\u2019re continuing to see improvements in our quality of distribution. In the third quarter, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Mexico, Colombia and Chile. We commenced with the transition to Coca-Cola bottlers in Brazil earlier this week and we\u2019ll transition Panama and Costa Rica later this month. We commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Denmark, Montenegro and Ukraine in the third quarter.","In July, we successfully transitioned Monster to the Coca-Cola bottlers in South Africa, which occurred at the same time, as the restructuring of the Coca-Cola bottlers in South Africa took place. After a slow start, we\u2019re seeing better execution in South Africa. During the quarter, we also commenced distribution of Monster in Botswana and Zimbabwe, and transitioned Swaziland, R\u00e9union and Mauritius. Over the fourth quarter, we plan to launch Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in additional African countries.","We are making good progress in Nigeria with regard to both product registration and co-packing arrangements and are planning to launch Monster by early 2017 in Nigeria. In October, we commenced sales of Monster through the Coca-Cola bottlers in Turkey. In the fourth quarter, we are planning to launch Monster through Coca-Cola bottlers in a number of central Asian and Middle Eastern countries with further launches to follow in 2017. Following the conclusion of negotiations with Coca-Cola bottlers in China, we commenced the launch of Monster beginning with Beijing in September and Shanghai and Hunan province in October. We expect Guangzhou, Shenzhen and potentially other markets to be launched in the fourth quarter and are planning to launch Monster in additional territories in China during 2017. We are currently awaiting approval for our product in India.","As we previously reported, we successfully completed our acquisition of a concentrated flavor business operated by American Fruits & Flavors on April 1, 2016. As a result of the AFF transaction, we achieved raw material cost savings of $23.3 million in the 2016 third quarter, which were broadly in line with the expectations.","According to the Nielsen report for the 13 weeks through September 24, 2016, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 3.5% versus the same period a year ago.

Sales of Red Bull increased by 1.4%, Rockstar was up 0.5%, 5-Hour was down 4.5% and AMP was down 27.1%.","According to Nielsen, for the five weeks ended September 24, 2016 Monster\u2019s market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars increased by 1 point over the same period last year to 35.6%. NOS\u2019 share remained the same at 3.9% and Full Throttle\u2019s share decreased 0.1 of 1 point to 1%. Red Bull share decreased 0.3 points to 35%. Rockstar share was down 0.1 of 1 point to 7.9%. 5-Hour share was lower by 0.5 points and 7.6%, and AMP share decreased 0.6 points to 1.5%.","According to Nielsen, for the five weeks ended September 24, 2016, sales of Energy Plus Coffee drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 19.1% over the same period last year. Sales of Java Monster were 18.2% higher than in the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Double Shot Energy were 21.7% higher. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended August 20, 2016, the energy drink category decreased 4%. Monster sales increased 1% versus a year ago.

Monster sales increased 12.6%, our market share in value decreased 4.7 points to 22.3% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn, one of our acquired strategic brands increased 28.4%, although Burn\u2019s market share decreased 0.3 points of 1 point to 4.9%. Red Bull sales decreased 11.7% and its market share decreased by 6.3 points to 11.7%. Vive 100\u2019s market share increased 15.4 points to 44.2%, while Boost\u2019s market share decreased 5.9 points to 9.3%.","The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single month, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.","According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended September 2016, the actual 13-week periods vary by a few weeks between different markets. Monster\u2019s retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 11.9% to 14.2% in Great Britain, from 19.4% to 22.6% in France, from 12.3% to 14.9% in Germany, from 22.2% to 25.6% in Spain, from 8.8% to 10.5% in Belgium, from 9% to 10.5% in Sweden, from 6% to 11% in Norway, from 9.5% to 11.4% in the Czech Republic and from 6.1% to 6.4% in the Netherlands.","According to IRI, Monster\u2019s market share in Greece decreased for the 13 weeks prior to the period ended September 2016 from 28.4% to 27.4%. For the 13-week period ended August 2016 according to Nielsen, Monster\u2019s retail market share in Ireland grew from 8.6% to 11.2%. And for the 13-week period September 2016 Monster\u2019s retail market share in value decreased, however, from 15.6% to 13.1% in South Africa, primarily due to increased distribution of Dragon, a new low-priced energy drink, although retail sales of Monster increased.","I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country-to-country. According to Nielsen, Monster\u2019s retail market share in value in Chile increased to 21.6% in September 2016 as compared to 18.2% last year and Monster\u2019s market share in Brazil declined from 3.9% to 2.6% in September 2016, as compared to the same period last year. In South Korea, Monster\u2019s retail market share in value increased from 10.7% to 23.7% in September, compared to the same period last year, and according to INTAGE, Monster\u2019s market share value in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 39.2% to 41.7% in September of 2016.","According to IRI, in Australia Monster\u2019s market share in value grew from 3.5% to 6% in September 2016 and in New Zealand Monster\u2019s market share in value grew from 2.2% to 6% for the last four weeks ending October 2, 2016 versus the same period last year. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the third quarter were negatively impacted by approximately 1.6 million of foreign currency movements.","Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the third quarter of 2016 increased 3.4% from $686.7 million to $710.1 million from the comparable period last year. Net sales for the Company\u2019s Strategic Brands segment were negatively impacted by approximately $1 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment were $72.1 million for the third quarter as compared to $69.9 million in the same quarter last year.","Net sales for the other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF were $5.7 million in the 2016 third quarter. There were now sales for the other segment in the comparable 2015 third quarter.","Continued increases in sales of the ready-to-drink coffee category in the U.S. including our Java Monster line bodes well for the future. However, their exists limited production in the U.S. for such products which requires a rethought process due to the use of fresh milk and cream. Due to production capacity constraints, resulting from production and maintenance issues with co-packers, product shortages have been experienced in the industry. We are taking steps to address the issues but anticipate that it will take a number of month before production availability will be balanced with consumer demand.","Sales of Java Monster were impacted by such shortages in September and October, and we anticipate that sales will continue to be impacted in the foreseeable future. Net sales for customers outside the United States were $190.8 million in the 2016 third quarter compared to a $170.6 million in the corresponding quarter in 2015. Net sales to customers outside of the United States were higher in local currencies by approximately $2.6 million. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the Company\u2019s military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas.","Net sales in EMEA in the third quarter of 2016 in dollars were 14% higher than in the same period last year. In local currencies, net sales in the region were 19% higher than in the same period last year. The foregoing differences were primarily due to the weakening of the British pound against the U.S. dollar. Gross sales were 11.6% higher in dollars and 18% higher in local currencies. Gross profit in this region, as a percentage of net sales, decreased from 51.5% in the same period last year to 50.5% during the 2016 third quarter. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased from 51.5% in the same period last year to 52.5% during the 2016 third quarter in local currencies.","Monster is continuing to gain momentum and increase market share in Europe. In particular in Germany, France, Spain, Great Britain, Belgium, Sweden, Norway, the Czech Republic and Ireland, Monster achieved sales gains and continued to increase its market share. We are pleased with the performance of the Monster Ultra line in EMEA region, which is now available in 25 European countries and was launched in South Africa in July. We anticipate that the Ultra line will be sold in almost all of our Western European markets by the end of this year.","In Asia Pacific, net sales in the third quarter increased 34.2% in dollars and 20.4% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales decreased from 49.4% in the same period last year to 46.6% during the 2016 third quarter. In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 28.2% or 7.2% in local currency, primarily due to the strengthening of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar as compared to the same quarter last year. We continue to experience strong performance in Japan. In Korea -- South Korea, net sales increased 125.7%, 127.2% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year.","In Oceana, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia and Guam, net sales increased 22.2% or 19.9% in local currencies, as compared to the same quarter last year. In Singapore, net sales increased 109.1% or 111.1% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. As previously mentioned, we are moving ahead with the planning for local production in India with a view to reentering the market in 2017.","In Latin America, which includes Mexico and the Caribbean, gross sales in the third quarter decreased 6.1% in dollars and increased 3.9% in local currencies. Net sales in the third quarter decreased 15% in dollars and decreased 6.2% in local currencies, over the same period last year. This region was impacted by foreign currency exchange rates and higher trade promotions in 2016. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales decreased from 50.3% in the same period last year to 47.6% during the 2016 third quarter.","In Mexico, gross sales increased 3.8% in dollars and 21.5% in local currency in September 2016. Net sales decreased in part due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and higher trade spending in 2016. However, although Nielsen reported Monster\u2019s market share decreased during September 2016, Monster sales at retail in Mexico grew 12.6% during September 2016. Net sales decreased in Brazil, largely due to the overall difficult economic and market conditions, together with the ongoing uncertainties for our distributor relating to the Coca-Cola transaction and the transition of Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers, which took place on November 1.","Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $341.5 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $2.18 billion at December 31, 2015. Short-term investments were $257.7 million compared to $744.6 million at December 31, 2015. Long-term investments decreased to $9.5 million from $15.3 million at December 31, 2015. Accounts receivable increased to $467.3 million at September 30, 2016 from $353 million at December 31, 2015. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 46.5 days at September 30, 2016 compared to 43.2 days at December 31, 2015 and 43 days at September 30, 2015.","Inventories increased to $167.8 million from $156.1 million at December 31, 2015. Average days of inventory was 53 days at September 30, 2016 compared to 58 days of inventory at December 31, 2015 and the 59.4 days at September 30, 2015.","In late September, we launch Mutant, an exciting super soda in the U.S. that is positioned as refreshment energized in limited convenience stores in certain markets with encouraging early results. We experienced some production challenges with Mutant in early September, which have now been largely, resulting in very limited distribution for Mutant in the quarter.","The number of retailers stocking Mutant increased substantially in October. We have an additional new product planned for later this year and are working on new product that we\u2019re planning to introduce early in 2017 and which includes our new Hydro line that we previously announced.","On October 14, 2016, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved","Board of Directors approved a 3.1 stock split of its common stock to be effected in the 200% stock dividend. On November 9, 2016 each stockholder of record will receive two additional shares of common stock for each share of common stock owned at the close of business Eastern Time on October 26, 2016.","We estimate October 2016 gross sales on a foreign-exchange adjusted basis to be approximately 12.3% higher than in October 2015. In this regard, we point out that according to Nielsen, for the five weeks ended September 24, 2016 for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 3.5% versus the same period a year ago, while sales of Monster grew 6.4% in the same period versus a year ago.","We caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.","In conclusion, I\u2019d like to summarize some recent positive points. Our acquisition of AFF is exciting and represents an important milestone for the Company through the ownership of the proprietary formulas for our principal products. Our ability to utilize the full benefits of the transaction through a reduction in operating costs commenced with the third quarter. This transaction will be accretive to the Company\u2019s earnings.","North American and international gross margins remain healthy. The U.S. Nielsen market statistics and equivalent market statistics from many countries around the world show that the energy category is continuing to grow, and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category. Currency exchange rates continue to affect our results. While the net difference was on balance not material, unfavorable exchange rates in the UK, our largest market in EMEA, negatively affected our EMEA results following Brexit. Similarly, unfavorable currency exchange rates in Mexico also negatively affected our Latin American results. On the other hand, favorable currency results in Japan positively affected our Asia Pacific results.","The new additions to the monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the Company\u2019s sales. We are excited about the prospects for our new Mutant beverage. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets. In particular, I would like to call out the launch of Monster in China and the enormous growth potential for us in one of the largest energy drink markets globally.","We have successfully transitioned additional international countries to Coca-Cola bottlers, and we have reached an advanced stage to transition many more markets to Coca-Cola bottlers in the fourth quarter and in 2017.","I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Judy Hong","Thank you. Hi, everyone. So, Rodney, I guess just maybe you can help us quantify how much the production shortages in Java perhaps hurt the Q3 reported sales and then the October number? Because it looks like in Q3, I know the advance purchases last year was a tough comp but even beyond that it looks like, there was a pretty sizeable gap between reported and the takeaway data. And then just secondly on China, maybe, you can just help us what you\u2019ve seen so far in terms of the launches you\u2019ve done in Beijing and Shanghai, and what\u2019s been the response to the launches? I know it\u2019s early, but just any color there would be great.","Rodney Sacks","Hilton will speak about the coffee Java issue, if you\u2019re able to. It\u2019s been difficult for us, because we\u2019re just trying to get a handle on what impact it\u2019s had with different bottlers, because again, it\u2019s affected different bottlers in a different way, and we were not certain of how much inventory they\u2019ve had. What we have seen is that in stores there have been signs put up by our major competitor who we also had shortages. So it\u2019s really been difficult to determine. I think it affected our October number probably more than our September number, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re trying to get handle on that at the moment. If you\u2019re able to give any more color?","Hilton Schlosberg","Judy, we are really trying to get and exercise together because there was some inventory that we had obviously in the system that we were able to get out in the quarter. But we\u2019re still reviewing those numbers and we\u2019ll be in a better position to talk about that sometime later. But I think there will be a more pronounced impact in Q4.","Rodney Sacks","Judy with regard to your second question on China, basically the way we launch generally is through a soft launch and to go into the smaller stores, independent convenience stores first and start to get the product established and sampled cold. Today, we probably secured probably of the order, and it\u2019s a very rough guess from what we\u2019ve discussed with our bottlers, about 50,000 accounts in the areas where we\u2019ve already launched. We will be going into Guangzhou, Shenzhen pretty much within the next week or so.","So, we are getting good distribution. We are getting good response to the product. And so, we just are very hopeful and excited that we will be able to continue to expand. There is a massive universe of stores available to us, it\u2019s a very big country. Probably by the end of the year, we should have launched Monster in probably areas that would be covered by about 18% of the population or and those areas represent our estimate at the moment is about 30-33% of the current energy market, once we\u2019ll have got through December.","So, it\u2019s a big market and we\u2019re obviously planning to do -- there is little bit of -- there will be a bit of a hiatus between beginning of January and until off the Chinese New Year. But once we\u2019re through that, then we\u2019re going to start focusing on launching pre-summer in China. Obviously that will be the thrust of our focus.","Hilton Schlosberg","But we can also say Judy that the teams are satisfied with the results and the bottlers are excited about the results, we\u2019ve seen so far. So, it will help us well for the future.","Rodney Sacks","One thing I just wanted to clarify, I talked about the October gross sales on a foreign exchange adjusted basis 12.3; this was actually 12.6; the unadjusted basis was 12.3, just to give that clarification.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Your line is now open.","Mark Astrachan","The October number, wanted to come back that again, are there any differences in selling days from a year ago? And also if you could quantify roughly what the impact is from Mutant sell in or even China I guess would be helpful. And then just to go back to sort of the quarter itself. So, by my math, your U.S. legacy sales were down something like 1% in the third quarter; the scanner data shows up something, I don\u2019t know, mid to high single-digits roughly. We know you talk about benefits from on track channel in the past. So, could you help just sort of quantify what is going on there, was there some selling ahead of third quarter; is there pent-up demand out there from an inventory standpoint, just sort of helping to reconcile that would be good?","Hilton Schlosberg","There is a whole bunch of questions. [Multiple speakers] Can you just start and then we can answer them one at a time?","Mark Astrachan","Okay, October. So, selling days, this year versus last year and then incremental benefits from Mutant in China?","Rodney Sacks","Okay. We\u2019ll get to you that because we just don\u2019t have it handy.","Mark Astrachan","Okay. And then, the other is, I calculated down one for your legacy U.S. business sales in the third quarter, obviously the scanner data has been better than that. So what gives?","Rodney Sacks","I think on the legacy sales, it\u2019s just the timing issue.","Mark Astrachan","Okay. [Multiple speakers].","Rodney Sacks","Not there is any destocking or restocking or anything of that nature.","Hilton Schlosberg","Whenever we sell a concentrate with the legacy brands. And so what we -- what we see in Nielsen and what we are selling in concentrate is quite a significant disconnect, it\u2019s not even as if we\u2019re selling a finished product. We do sell finished products but in main, you talk about concentrate and there is a huge lag between where the concentrate is manufactured by the bottlers and then sold in the market and sold to consumers.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes the Laurent Grandet of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Laurent Grandet","I would like to understand a bit more about Mutant. I know, I mean it\u2019s very early stage right now. And it\u2019s kind of a double effort [ph] for you in terms of profitability. So, any kind of calculation -- cannibalization between Mutant and your energy core brands would be helpful for us to understand. If it\u2019s a good start and is there some legs in the future, could you give us some more color on this?","Rodney Sacks","Again, it\u2019s been very early days on Mutant, but we\u2019ve had some insight from three or four of the what we\u2019d call representative or convenience chains. And the Mutant sales as a percentage of Mountain Dew, which is the main competitor, they are obviously going after, has been quite good. It varies quite a bit between the stores but whichever way you look at the percentages, it\u2019s quite respectable. And everybody, including the retailers, have been quite surprised and quite happy with the sell-in. The actual level of Mutant that was sold in the quarter, I think that is Mark\u2019s question -- one of Mark\u2019s questions earlier was about 4.5 million in our numbers on a gross basis.","And so, it really started late and it\u2019s really just starting to ramp up now. And the whole strategy that we had with Mutant, just talking about Mutant generally, is we never intended at any time, it\u2019s how we\u2019ve launched all of our products, we didn\u2019t intend to go out and secure execution and make a big splash on day one. It\u2019s a bubbling up, we put it into convenience stores, we are being very specific about way we want to see it placed in the store and we feel that\u2019s important. And the results of us doing that is actually the feedback we\u2019ve got is that there is very, very minimal, if any cannibalization.","So, we are achieving we believe our strategic objective to minimalize any cannibalization with Monster Energy Drinks. And so that is being achieved. We are pretty much across the board getting retailers buy in on our strategy and where it should be placed. There have been a few retailers that have resisted that. And in some cases, for that reason, we have not sold to those retailers. But we pretty much have very, very board acceptance and buying from retailers. And so far we are actually very encouraged by the sale rate for a new brand.","Tom Kelly","Also Mark, to answer your question, it was one extra day, selling day in October 2016 versus 2015.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Vivien Azer of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Vivien Azer","So, I was hoping, please, if you could just comment on the broader health of the energy drinks category. Given the torrid rates of growth that we\u2019ve seen historically, I think it\u2019s not unexpected to see the growth rate moderate. Do you feel like kind of this new run rate is sustainable or is there any kind of exogenous headwinds that you think may be weighing on category sales?","Rodney Sacks","Yes. That\u2019s $1 million or $64 question -- $64,000 question. We have seen some sort of settling in the energy category. However, we\u2019ve also got to bear in remind that I think over this period, we haven\u2019t seen a lot of innovation. Our innovation, we\u2019ve been dealing with new packaging, different packaging, it\u2019s taken some time for us to get our hands around it. And so, if you take for example high growth coming out, we\u2019re looking at the beginning of next year, Mutant really has just hit the shelves, just pretty days before the quarter-end. And our Cafe Monster product, which we\u2019re looking at launching next year also it will come through next year sometime. We will have to obviously deal with the production issues, it\u2019s one of the things -- one of the challenges we\u2019ll face with Cafe Monster. But we think that if you\u2019re looking at innovation, it really was probably pretty limited this year and that we think has been one of the reasons. But again, the category is more positive, it\u2019s gone up and down over in the past, and we do believe that we will continue to see some increase in growth rates next year. But again, this is -- we don\u2019t have any crystal ball to be able to do so.","Hilton Schlosberg","One of the other growth opportunities for us is in the non-traditional channels which are not measured by Nielsen? And we make a lot of headway with the Coca-Cola system in some of these non-traditional channels.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Kevin Grundy","Two detail-oriented questions from you. First on the getting back to the October sales update. Do you have the split between U.S. and international? That would be helpful just to kind of gauge how the U.S. may look versus what we\u2019re currently seen in the Nielsen data, and any potential benefit there with shipments with respect to Mutant. That\u2019s question number one if you have that handy. And question number two, the selling and distribution expense was elevated; you spoke to some of this in your prepared remarks. I know you don\u2019t guide specifically. But given the push here internationally, particularly in China and a number of other markets, should that remain elevated -- should we expect that to remain elevated in the near to intermediate term?","Hilton Schlosberg","Okay. If we could talk about the numbers for October. The U.S. grew by just under 10%, 9.8%. And you can work out regarding international. So that\u2019s the number for the U.S. Your second question on selling and operating expenses, obviously what we spoke about in the quarter was an increase -- a significant increase in endorsement and sponsorship costs and that\u2019s something that maybe grow as we go forward, depending on when it takes the brand from a marketing perspective. So, we don\u2019t give guidance and I broadly not give any guidance on selling expenses because a lot of that will determine on a number of initiatives that we\u2019re considering at this time. Regarding operating expenses, I think there is -- the operating expenses other than selling expenses i.e. the admin expenses are probably largely in line where they will be in the foreseeable future of course depending on a lot of these legal costs and relating to the regulatory aspects and some of the -- the case is that we are still involved in, which are in fact reducing in number.","Kevin Grundy","Okay. Thank you.","Rodney Sacks","So, one of the things that -- the bumps that came in the series was the -- take on staff to really support the sales and marketing, put some marketing behind the strategic brands as we continue to -- we\u2019re getting our hands around them, we may be able to look at some sort of rationalization on some of those costs going forward as we get to know the brands better and we get more focused on how we want to position these strategic brands going forward.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Rodney Sacks for any further remarks.","Rodney Sacks","Thank you. On the half of Monster, I\u2019d like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the Company. We continue to believe in the Company and our growth strategy, and remain committed to continuing to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the Company, both at home and abroad, and in particular, to expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottler system internationally. We are particularly excited by the new opportunities that we have going forward, with a robust portfolio of energy drink products throughout the world, comprised of our Monster Energy brand, together with the strategic brands, as well as Mutant. Thank you very much for your attendance.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This concludes today\u2019s program. You may all disconnect.

Welcome to Monster Beverage Corporation Second Quarter 2017 Financial Results. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session with instructions following at that time. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","Now, I'll turn the conference over to your host, Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO. Please begin.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, is with me today; as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends.","Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2017, and our Form 10-Q, filed on May 8, 2017, including the sections contained therein entitled risk factors and forward-looking statements for discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance.","The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures which may be mentioned during the course of this call is provided in the notes and designated with asterisks in the consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release, dated August 8, 2017. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section.","Sales continued to be challenging in the beverage industry in the second quarter and remained weak. In the second quarter, net sales were $907.1 million, up 9.6% from $827.5 million in the second quarter of 2016. The company achieved record second quarter gross sales of $1.04 billion, up 9.8% from $945.8 million in the second quarter of 2016. Unfavorable currency exchange rates reduced net sales by approximately $8.2 million in the 2017 second quarter. The comparable 2016 second quarter net and gross sales included $5 million of accelerated deferred revenue related to distributor terminations. Excluding such accelerated recognition of deferred revenue from a comparable 2016 second quarter, net and gross sales for the 2017 second quarter increased 10.3% and 10.4%, respectively.","Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the second quarter was 64.3% as compared to 62.6% for the comparable 2016 second quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to cost of goods savings as a result of the AFF transaction and product mix in the U.S., which was partially offset by geographic mix and certain increases in other costs. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales was 3% for the 2017 second quarter, as compared to 3.2% in the 2016 second quarter. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.6% compared to 11.2% in the same quarter a year-ago. The increase is primarily due to increased sponsorship and endorsement costs and commissions.","General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 10.1%, as compared to 13.3% in the same quarter last year. Included in general and administrative costs were distributor termination expenses of $0.2 million and $25.3 million for the 2017 and 2016 second quarters, respectively. Included in general and administrative expenses for the 2016 second quarter were AFF transaction-related expenses of $3.6 million and modified Dutch auction tender offer expenses of $1.5 million. General and administrative expenses, excluding distributor terminations, AFF transaction expenses, and stock repurchase expenses, were 10.1% of net sales for the 2017 second quarter, compared to 9.6% of net sales for the comparable 2016 second quarter, largely due to an increase in payroll costs.","Payroll expenses were up $10.1 million, primarily due to head count growth internationally, including to support the launches in China and other countries as stock-based compensation, a non-cash item, was $1.3 million higher. Legal expenses relating to regulatory methods and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $2.4 million in the 2017 second quarter, as compared to $3.8 million in the 2016 second quarter. Our effective tax rate decreased slightly from 36.1% in the 2016 second quarter to 35.9% in the 2017 second quarter, primarily due to an increase in equity compensation deductions.","Net income was $222.6 million in the 2017 second quarter, compared to net income of $184.2 million in the 2016 second quarter, an increase of 20.9%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 614.9 million for the second quarter of 2016 to 578 million for the second quarter of 2017 as a result of share buybacks, including the modified Dutch auction tender offer, which was completed in June 2016. Diluted earnings per share for the 2017 second quarter increased 28.6% to $0.39 from $0.30 in the second quarter of 2016. We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. Domestically, we transitioned distribution of Monster Energy Drinks to Coca-Cola bottlers in a part of North Dakota, including Florida in April 2017. So, we're also making good progress in the U.S. in non-traditional channels, including food service accounts and e-commerce.","In EMEA, in the second quarter of 2017, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Kazakhstan, Jordan and Pakistan. Additional launches are planned in the third quarter of 2017 in certain countries in Africa, the Middle East and Eastern Europe. In the second quarter of 2017, we launched distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain countries in the Caribbean. In the second half of 2017, we anticipate launching Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain additional countries in Central and South America and in the Caribbean.","In China, during the second quarter of 2017, we continued with launches in 14 new operating units. The two remaining operating units in China were launched during July 2017. We also transitioned distribution in Hong Kong and Macau to Coca-Cola bottlers. We continue to make progress towards our planned relaunch in India later this year. We are planning to commence distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Vietnam and Taiwan in the third quarter.","Raw material cost savings from the AFF transaction were approximately $28.6 million in the second quarter of 2017 as compared with $1.1 million in the second quarter of 2016. Raw material cost savings from the AFF transaction were minimally realized in the comparable 2016 second quarter as the company's inventory on hand prior to the AFF transaction, as well as the inventory acquired in the AFF transaction which were recorded at fair value, were not fully recognized through cost of goods sold until the end of the second quarter of 2016.","According to Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through July 22, 2017 for all outlets combined, that will be convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category including energy shots increased by 0.8% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 2.2% in the 13-week period while sales of NOS increased 11.8% and sales for Full Throttle increased 1.1%. Sales of Red Bull increased 2%. Sales of Rockstar decreased by 1%. Sales of 5-Hour decreased 8.7% and sales of AMP decreased 25.8%.","According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended July 22, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channel including energy shots, in dollars increased 1.7% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 6% over the same period last year while NOS was up 9.5% and Full Throttle sales increased 1.7%. Sales of Red Bull increased by 2%. Rockstar was down 2.6%. 5-Hour was down 11.3%, and AMP was down 23.4%. We point out that the energy shot category has been slow for some time and if we exclude the energy shots, as well as the energy coffee and energy protein drinks, where we have experienced production capacity shortages, for the four-weeks ended July, 22, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channels in dollars in fact increased by 4.3% over the same period last year with sales of Monster increasing by 10%.","According to Nielsen, in the four weeks ended July 22, 2017, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, increased by 1.5 points over the same period last year to 36.7%. NOS' share increased 0.3 points to 4% and Full Throttle's share remained the same at 0.9%. Red Bull share increased 0.1 point to 35.5%. Rockstar share was down 0.3 points to 7.6%. 5-Hour's share was lower by 1.2 points at 7.1% and AMP's share decreased 0.4 points to 1.1%. According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended July 22, 2017, sales of energy plus coffee drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel decreased 11% over the same period last year. Sales of Java Monster were 21.2% lower than in the same period last year while sales of Starbucks Doubleshot Energy were 0.4% lower. We continued to experience production capacity shortages for Java Monster, which I will address later in the call.","According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12-weeks ended June 24, 2017, the energy drink category remained flat in dollars. Monster sales increased 11% versus a year ago. Our market share increased 3.1 share points to 31.3%. Red Bull sales decreased 1% and its market share decreased 1.3 points to 37.3%. Rockstar sales decreased 14% and its market share decreased 1.8 points to 16.8%.","According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 7.6% during the month of June 2017. Monster sales increased 22.6%. Our market share in value increased 3.3 points to 27.1%, against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn decreased 37.8%. Burn's market share decreased 2.1 points to 2.9%. Red Bull sales decreased 6.8% and its market share decreased by 1.7 points to 11.1%. Vive 100's market share decreased 0.7 points to 42.3%, while Boost's market share decreased 1.7 points to 8%.","The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and\/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain, in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in their chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. I'd like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers for EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI for EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending July 2017 \u2013 the actual 13-week periods vary by a few days between different markets \u2013 Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 13.9% to 17.3% in Great Britain and from 22.3% to 23.1% in France.","According to Nielsen, for the period-ending June 2017 \u2013 the actual 13-week periods vary by a few days between different markets \u2013 Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 13.9% to 14.7% in Germany, from 10.5% to 13.7% in Norway, from 24.9% to 26.5% in Spain, from 10.3% to 11.4% in Belgium, from 11.7% to 12.4% in Czech Republic, from 7.6% to 11.1% in Italy, from 7.9% to 10.3% in Ireland and from 13% to 16.2% in South Africa. According to Nielsen, in the latest 13-week period ended June 2017, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year declined from 10.7% to 9.6% in Sweden, although the retail value of sales grew 18.1% in the same comparative period, and declined from 7.4% to 5.6% in the Netherlands, which is being addressed. According to IRI, Monster has increased its market share from 27.4% to 34.5% in Greece in the 13 weeks ended June 2017.","According to Nielsen, for the month of June 2017 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 21% to 29.8% compared to the same period last year, and Monster's market share in value in Brazil for the month of June 2017 increased from 2.5% to 11.5% as compared to the same period last year. According to Nielsen, in South Korea, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 18.6% to 28.9% in May 2017 compared to the same period last year.","According to INTAGE, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 39.2% to 43.8% in June 2017. According to IRI, in Australia, Monster's market share in value grew from 3.4% to 7.8% in June 2017 as compared to the same period last year. And according to IRI in New Zealand, Monster's market share in value for the last four weeks ended June 11, 2017, grew from 4.2% to 6.7% as compared to the same period last year.","Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the second quarter of 2017 increased 9.7% from $743.5 million to $815.3 million from the comparable period last year. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the second quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $8.3 million of foreign currency movements. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment were $85.6 million for the second quarter as compared to $77.4 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales for the company's Strategic Brands segment were positively impacted by approximately $0.1 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter. Net sales for the Other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, was $6.2 million in the 2017 second quarter as compared to $6.6 million in the same quarter last year.","We continued to experience production capacity shortages for our retooled products, Java Monster and Muscle Monster. To reduce the shortfall, we are manufacturing certain flavors of Java Monster in Europe which are now available to our customers in the U.S. We've also procured additional production in the U.S., which will be coming on stream in the third quarter of 2017 and will result in additional Java Monster and Muscle Monster volumes being available for distribution to retailers thereafter.","As a result, we anticipate that it will still be a few months before production availability allows us to restore normal supply patterns and fully meet consumer demand that exists for these products. We estimate that net sales were negatively impacted as a result of such production capacity shortages by approximately $13 million in the second quarter and year-to-date by approximately $25 million. Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $247.9 million in the 2017 second quarter compared to $200.2 million in the corresponding quarter in 2016. In local currencies, net sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately $8.2 million higher. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas.","In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, net sales in the second quarter increased 18.6% in dollars, and 24.8% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales decreased from 50.8% in the same period last year, to 49% during the quarter. We are pleased with the rollout of certain SKUs in the Ultra range in EMEA markets. In 2017, we have added certain SKUs of Ultra across EMEA, with the introduction of Ultra Citron, which will be available in 10 additional EMEA markets in 2017. Various SKUs in the Ultra range are now sold in 33 EMEA markets. We are also pleased that Monster continued to perform well and gained market share in Great Britain, Germany, France, Spain, Norway, Denmark, Poland, Ireland, Italy, Czech Republic and South Africa.","In Asia-Pacific, net sales in the second quarter increased 64.6% in dollars, and 66.6% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 46.1% in the same period last year to 50.7% during the 2017 second quarter. In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 53% or 55% in local currency, as compared to the same quarter last year. We continued to experience strong performance in Japan. In South Korea, net sales increased 84.7% or 78.7% in local currency, as compared to the same quarter last year. In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia and Guam, net sales decreased 3.1%, or minus 4.3% in local currencies as compared to the same quarter last year. As previously mentioned, we are moving ahead with plans for local production in India with a view to re-entering the market in 2017.","In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, gross sales in the second quarter increased 28.6% in dollars and 28.8% in local currencies. Net sales in the second quarter increased 25% in dollars and 24.8% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales decreased from 50% in the same period last year to 46.7% during the 2017 second quarter. Net sales increased in Brazil 849.6% in dollars, or 728.8% in local currency, largely due to the transition of Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers, which took place on November 1, 2016. Net sales in Chile increased 35.4% in dollars and 33.4% in local currency.","Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $777.7 million, compared to $377.6 million at December 31, 2016. Short-term investments were $323.9 million, compared to $220.6 million at December 31, 2016. Long-term investments increased to $48.6 million from $2.4 million at December 31, 2016. Accounts receivable increased to $537.1 million at June 30, 2017, from $448.1 million at December 31, 2016. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 47 days compared to 48.2 days at December 31, 2016. Inventories increased to $190.6 million from $162 million at December 31, 2016. Average days of inventory was 53 days at June 30, 2017, compared to 57 days at December 31, 2016.","We launched a line extension of our Mutant brand family, namely White Lightning, a zero-sugar offering to limited customers in the second quarter, with the general market launch in July. We remain confident about the potential of this brand. We launched our Monster Hydro energy drinks during the quarter in three flavors. Monster Hydro is a non-carbonated, lightly-sweetened energy drink that is packaged in a unique 16.9 ounce PET can, the size of which is exclusive to us in the U.S. at this time. We launched Monster Energy Ultra Violet nationally during the quarter after limited sales with a club store customer the previous quarter. We launched Mango Loco, a new flavor in the Monster Energy juice family exclusively with a convenience store customer in June and we'll launch to the general market nationally in September 2017.","We also launched Monster Hydro in a 550 mL PET bottle in the United Kingdom and Ireland during the second quarter of 2017. At the end of April 2017, we launched a new Lewis Hamilton Monster Energy drink in Great Britain, which was followed by launches in 21 European markets in the second quarter of 2017 and in South Africa in July.","We have a robust innovation pipeline including a new espresso Monster Energy drink in eight-ounce slim cans in two flavors and Nitrous Mango planned for launch before the year-end in the United States. We estimate 2017 July gross sales to be approximately 13.8% higher than in July 2016. On a foreign exchange adjusted basis, we estimate July 2017 gross sales to be approximately 14.7% higher than in July 2016.","In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affect the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. We also reiterate that sales over a short period, such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.","On February 28, the company's board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. No shares were repurchased under this repurchase program during the first and second quarters.","In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. One, we recognized the reduction in raw material costs of $28.6 million in the second quarter as a result of our acquisition of AFF. Two, North American and international gross margins remain healthy. Three, while the U.S., Nielsen and market statistics show that the energy category slowed in the U.S. towards the end of the 2016 fourth quarter, it appears to have picked up steam this year, as well as in July. Equivalent market statistics from many countries around the world show that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category.","Currency exchange rates continued to affect our results. The new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the company's sales. Five, we are excited about the prospects for our company's new product launches. Six, we are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China, one of the largest energy drink markets globally. Seven, according to Nielsen, in the last 12 months ended July 1, 2017, Monster is in the top ten beverage brands in Great Britain on a value basis. Eight, we have successfully launched or transitioned Monster Energy Drinks to Coca-Cola bottlers in a number of markets in the first half of 2017 and anticipate further transitions and launches in the second half of the year.","I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from Bill Chappell of SunTrust. Your line is open.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks. Good afternoon.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Afternoon. Hi, Bill.","Hilton H. Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.","Hey Bill.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Can you just talk a little bit about \u2013 we've been hearing as the transition of Coke in the U.S. goes from Coke corporate to the bottlers, there have been some benefit in terms of sales. Are you seeing that? Are you seeing any kind of change in where they go to market with your products? And is that a net benefit? I remember I guess a year ago there was \u2013 as you had the transition from ABI to Coke, it was a actually a slowdown, but I didn't know if you were seeing some net benefit as you move to market this year.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","We think that it is \u2013 there's not a general rule across the board. In certain markets, the transition has been less noticeable. In some markets, it has taken some of the newer bottlers, has taken them some time to get up to speed and we are seeing some sort of disruption in delivery schedules and et cetera. But overall, we are seeing improvements and benefits. So we are positive about the transition. It's a question of just, there is some sort of noise during the transitional periods as they've had to get up to speed. I think Hilton's got some...","Hilton H. Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.","I think the only thing I wanted to make was that anecdotally, as we looked at the independent bottlers over the years, their performance relative to the company bottlers has actually been better. So I think we're looking for better performance from these bottlers as refranchising takes place.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Yeah. I agree.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Vivien Azer of Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Vivien Azer - Cowen and Company, LLC","Hi. Thank you. Good afternoon.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Hi.","Vivien Azer - Cowen and Company, LLC","And thank you for the question. So my one question just has to do with the supply constraints on coffee that you're going to remedy by exporting out of Europe. Can you please give us a sense of the potential implications to your gross margin as you work through those supply issues? Thank you.","Hilton H. Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.","We had a price increase in Java Monster effective January 1. And what we have seen is that the increase in finding the price increase has actually been kind of equivalent to the increased costs that we're sustaining by bringing product from Europe. So it's basically been a wash.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Yeah. And I think that as we continue to secure increased production in the U.S., which is what we're now doing, those costs will come down. So really, it's been a temporary increase just to the extent that we have been importing, obviously, to supplement our products, yeah, we're still at all times have been getting the vast majority of our production in the U.S. And so, we obviously do have a shipping charge, but as Hilton has indicated, that's been negated by the increase, and going forward, we think that will become less relevant and we will increase those margins again.","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Your line is open.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Hi. Mark, what happened to you?","Operator","Pardon me, Mark. Your phone is on mute.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Perhaps we can come back to Mark.","Operator","We'll move to the next person. Our next person is from Amit Sharma of BMO Capital. Your line is open.","Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Hi.","Hilton H. Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.","At least you're there, Amit.","Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Rodney, a quick question on the trends in the CMD (32:19) channel, definite acceleration versus where we were last quarter. Can you talk about that; what's happening? In the past you've talked about innovation, maybe a reason for the category slowdown. Are we getting past that hump at this point?","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","We still haven't got a really accurate handle on the reason for the slowdown in convenience. We've all been puzzled in the beverage industry, generally. There are a number of speculative reasons that have come out over the period of time. We were talking to the Coke bottlers, and everybody's got theories. But it has been a slowdown which has been sort of unusual for us in these times. It is starting to pick up. We are seeing some positive signs, both in the CMD (33:13) category and sector and generally.","Hilton H. Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.","I think one of the other things is that our convenience store customers have also been concerned about foot traffic. And while no one could put their hands on it, there's lots of speculation, as Rodney said. One of the points that was raised by the bottlers at the recent meeting that we attended was that the SNAP program and the reduction in benefits under the SNAP program could have an impact on lower convenience store traffic. So I just put that out as an additional possibility.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Yeah, I agree. And then the other one that has been, again, more anecdotal is the Trump effect just on Hispanic foot traffic into the convenience stores seems to have also dropped off a little bit.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Hi, everyone.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Hi, Judy.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Rodney, I had one clarification on Java and then a Hydro question. So on Java, when you said getting to the normal supply is going to take a few months. Are you commenting that maybe in third quarter we still see a drag of something like a $10 million to $15 million that we saw in the first and the second quarter, or basically that drag dissipates as you're kind of lapping the decline that you started to see last year? And then on Hydro, can you just update us on maybe what you're seeing from a distribution ramp perspective? Because if you look at the ACV, I think it's still below 40%, even though it's come up pretty nicely, and that's still below the number that you're seeing for the Green and the Ultra. Do you think that you can get to that level pretty quickly from a Hydro perspective?","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Just going back to the coffee question. We think that there still will be a drag from July, but we're seeing every month, we are seeing improved deliveries, and we think that we will be fully up to speed towards the end of the quarter. So we think that there will be \u2013 still be some drag, some reduction, shortages going forward, but we think it will be reduced, but to the extent we're not sure. And obviously, we're right in the phase now of getting production, and that means getting back our shelf space and that will take a bit of time.","With regard to Hydro, your point is noted, and that is correct that the ACV at the moment is at about 40%. So we've obviously still got some work to do to get Hydro out and get it \u2013 again, it was sort of launched a little bit off cycle. And so we are getting it into the chains and into the stores, but it is taking some time. But again, there are all sort of supplier constrictions on the number of packages we're able to put out. This obviously is of concern to us, but unfortunately, we do believe in the package. We feel that the package is important for the product to create the right image and the right personality around the brand and the product. So we are continuing to address the supply issues, and literally, we're selling all we can supply.","So we will continue to, I think, improve the supply situation and as that goes, so we will continue to supply \u2013 to increase and improve our distribution. But that's really a positive side of the brand, that it is pulling and it has received good consumer response. We are looking at addressing the brand with an additional package, which won't have the same supply constraints, a slightly larger-sized bottle. And we believe we'll be able to launch that and get that on the shelves at the same time as the can. And that will supplement we believe the can and consumer demand. The consumer will have a choice, but we do not want to replace the can with a similar-sized bottle. This will be a larger bottle where at the moment we haven't finalized the exact size, but it's probably likely to be about a 750 mL size, resealable.","So we're looking to have both products. We're also looking to have different flavors in the bottle. So there will be a choice of additional flavors and hopefully we'll be able to get to that and solidify our shelf space and therefore satisfy consumers and retailers so that there will always be a supply of Hydro on the shelves, even though there may at times be some shortages in the can size, until we get those supply issues rectified.","Operator","Thank you. Now we have a question from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Your line is open.","Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey, guys. Let's try that again. Can you hear me?","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Yes, this time we can.","Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Perfect. Hilton muted my line. That was the problem.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Yeah. We thought we got off lightly this quarter.","Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So I was curious if you could comment on the number of SKUs you're selling in international markets, just sort of broadly. I mean I know there are more in EMEA versus some other markets. But you see, call it 10, 15 SKUs in a typical shelf placement in the U.S. Where are you in other international markets? And sort of how do you think about that as an opportunity longer term? And how do you ultimately get incremental shelf space?","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Well, if you look at mass markets, it really is very varied. It depends on the maturity of the market. As you say, you've got most of the European markets with a lot more SKUs, but even within the European markets there is a tremendous disparity between what you've got on shelves in the UK and Germany and Spain versus other markets. And it varies pretty dramatically.","You also have a lot of the, what I call the sub lines, the strategic lines that we've got, the families that haven't yet even been launched. We've launched Ultra, but you really have no coffee and you have very little Rehab in Europe. And we've just sort of going up with Punch and repositioning the juice line. But again, we've launched Hydro pretty much in the United Kingdom and Ireland, but we are looking to launch Hydro quite quickly not everywhere but in a number of selected markets in Europe, including South Africa. We think there is a good potential for the brand.","So out of that you go to South America and Asia, the SKUs are much, much more limited. And so we've got just a lot of potential. Even if you go down to places like Chile where we're doing a lot of business there, there still is a pretty much a handful or so of SKUs. So there is a lot of potential.","But if you looked at it sort of on average, I would say you're looking at probably 30% to 40% of the SKUs on average in overseas markets versus the U.S., just as a very, very broad thumb suck (40:55) across a number of \u2013 but that's not on a weighted or on any sort of statistical analysis. That's just pretty much anecdotally our gut feel.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Thank you. Good afternoon, guys.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Hi.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","First question is on the U.S. market. So strong July growth sales update, 14.7%, FX neutral. Doesn't look like there's any adjustment needed for trading days, so that's great. Hilton, do you have the breakdown between U.S. and international? I guess as we're looking at the Nielsen data, the most recent data that we got for the last couple of weeks in July was up 8%, and you had spoken to some of the acceleration you're seeing. Is that sort of representative of the acceleration you're seeing? That's question number one.","And then, Rodney, for you, question number two. With respect to Java and Muscle Monster, as that supply comes back on, how are you ensuring that's all incremental? You called out the $13 million and $25 million year-to-date drag for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively, if I'm not mistaken, so that's a couple points to U.S. sales growth. So any comments there with respect to how incremental that could potentially be for the U.S. would be helpful. Thank you for both of those.","Hilton H. Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.","Okay. So as we look at our increase in July, and we always give a lot of caveats because it's very early in the month, that 14.7% that we spoke about that was internationally, that wasn't in the U.S. So I'm not sure, your reference to that being in the U.S., that's a group consolidated number. Also, we don't traditionally break down our increase in gross sales by market area, and I don't think we want to start that because I don't think we've done that in the past. So I'm not going to give that number, but the 14.7% is a consolidated number. As we said, it's 13.8% and 14.7% on a foreign exchange adjusted basis.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","All we can really say is that if you look at the Nielsen numbers, as you said, you are seeing that increase. We're seeing it as well. So we seem to be ahead of the Nielsen, generally, continuing to get share both internationally and in the U.S. So there's nothing that's inconsistent with our previous growth in the quarter that we're seeing in the month of July. It just is doing better generally across the board.","With regard to Java and Muscle Monster, where we sat incremental, I mean, we've lost shelf space, but even if you look at Java, I was looking at the numbers on all major channels. Even for our two main Java products which we've basically been in stock most of the time this year, our distribution is down at about 71%, whereas in our other top brands we're in the high 80%s and low 90%s. So they've clearly lost some distribution even for the two main SKUs.","The others, if we look at salted caramel, which we introduced quite a bit of time ago, that's at 40%. So we've got a lot of opportunity. We've just got to get supplies back and that is one of the reasons that we hesitated a bit earlier. Because it's one thing getting back supplies in line, it's another thing making sure that we have those supplies on a consistent basis before we go back out and reestablish shelf space and get back shelf space because we obviously don't want another hiccup with retailers.","So we really do have quite a bit of upside potential in just improving our supply channels, having products on shelf, getting back our listings for not only the line extensions, (44:50) and salted caramel and Irish, but even just getting back our distribution levels and consistency with Mean Bean and Loca Moca. So we look at that as being, positive and it is going to start basically taking place during this quarter. But it's going to be on an increased rolling basis and we think that by the fourth quarter, we will very much be back into where we were and we look at the coffee category growing pretty well. And that's been slowed down, I think even with the issues we've had and with our competitors. But we think that's going to continue to grow and move back into growth.","With regard to Muscle Monster, it's the same issue, which is supply. We are also looking and evaluating and going to relaunch and reposition the Muscle Monster in an aseptic plastic bottle, which will be a resealable bottle. So Muscle Monster is going move into a plastic bottle, we think hopefully still later this year. We've done some testing with the bottle and the labeling and hopefully that's going to be a position to start in the next few months. And so that transition we think will be a positive transition for Muscle Monster to also get it back and give it a kickstart again because we are positive about that sector, which we think we are under-represented in at the moment. So that's another source of, we think, some potential upside.","Hilton H. Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.","Yeah, just to be clear, we utilized the production capacity that was available to us with Java Monster for our top-selling SKUs. So we decided we were not going to bring those SKUs from Europe because we didn't want to disturb the flavor profile. We wanted to maintain the flavor profile. So those two products, the main two products in the Java Monster line, we kept with production here.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this ends the Q&A portion of today's conference.

Java Monster was 20.2% higher than in the comparable period last year and Starbucks Double Shot energy was up 20.9%. Sales of our noncarbonated Monster Rehab tea plus energy line, according to Nielsen for the 13 weeks ended July 21, 2012, represented approximately 13% of the sales of all Monster beverages sold in the convenience and gas channel.","According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended June 30, 2012, the energy drink category grew 11%, Monster sales increased 11% and our market share was at 24.9% versus the same as in the  comparable period last year. While Red Bull sales increased 7%, its market share decreased 1.3 points to 36.6%. Rockstar sales increased 47% and its market share increased 3.9 points to 16%. Rockstar's numbers continue to be skewed by the inclusion of sales of its Rockstar Recovery line this year, which is already in last year's numbers, or fourth in a period, as well as continued ongoing deep price promotions implemented by Rockstar in 2012.","According to Nielsen, the 4 weeks ended June 30, 2012, sales of energy drinks in Canada for the convenience and gas channel grew 8%. Over this period, sales of Red Bull increased 9% and Monster increased 9%, while sales of Rockstar increased 14%. We believe that the Nielsen reports for sales of energy drink category including sales of Monster in Mexico are incomplete and are also inconsistent with our own sales of Monster to our distributor in Mexico in 2012.","Sales of Monster through our distributor in M\u00e9xico in the second quarter of 2012 were 45.6% higher than in the comparable period last year. And for the 6 months to June 30, 2012, were 32% higher. Once we are satisfied that the Nielsen reports for Mexico are reliable and complete, we will resume reporting that information to you.","Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 30.1% to 600 -- sorry, $568 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2012, from $436.7 million in the same period in 2011. And contribution margin increased 30.1% from $150.5 million to $195.8 million.","Net sales for the company's warehouse segment decreased 3.4% to $24.6 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2012, compared with $25.5 million for the same period in 2011. The contribution margin increased 15.5% to $1.6 million in this quarter versus $1.4 million for the same quarter last year.","Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales of approximately 1% for the 3 months ended June 30, 2012, which was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain local currencies in which we conduct certain  of our  international business. We estimate that our net sales for the 3 months ended June 30, 2012 were positively impacted by approximately 1% due to initial inventory purchase by a distributor in Japan for the launch of the Monster energy brand in Japan during the second quarter of 2012.","For the 3 months ended June 30, 2012, gross sales to retail grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers represented 4% of gross sales, the same as in the comparable period in 2011. Gross sales to club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represented 9% of sales, down from 10% in the comparable period in 2011.","Gross sales to full-service distributors represented 62% of sales, down from 64% in the comparable period in 2011. Gross sales internationally increased to 23% from 19% in the same period in 2011.","Other sales were 2% for the period compared to 3% in the comparable period in 2011.","Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the second quarter of 2012 amounted to $153.4 million compared to $102.6 million in the same quarter in 2011. Included in such sales are sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas.","Net sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in the second quarter of 2012, in dollars, were 51.6% higher than in the same period last year. Excluding the effect of the strengthening dollar, such net sales would've been 65.4% higher.  Monster is continuing to gain momentum and market share in Europe. Our European, Middle East and Africa operations, overall, are now operating profitably, although the Central and Eastern European region is still incurring operating losses.","We are continuing with our expansion strategy into new international markets. We launched Monster Energy in Ecuador, Hong Kong, Japan, Macau and Slovenia in the second quarter of 2012. We are continuing with our plans to launch Monster in Chile, Peru, Philippines, Singapore and Taiwan as well additional countries overseas later in 2012 and in Argentina early in 2013. We're also planning to launch Monster in additional countries in Central and Eastern Europe later this year. Our planned launch of Monster in Korea continues to be delayed due to product approval and label issues, which have been ongoing and which we are continuing to address. Although the resolution of such issues is taking longer than we had initially anticipated, we believe that they will be resolved, and we are continuing with preparations for the launch of Monster in Korea in due course.","Sales in Japan in the second quarter exceeded our expectations. Sales of Peace Tea, ready-to-drink iced teas continue to meet and indeed exceed our expectations. In the second quarter of 2012, gross sales of Peace Tea increased 62.3% over the same period in 2011. We are continuing with our plan to introduce additional packages and container sizes for the Peace Tea brand during the second half of 2012. We are continuing to sell in market Worx Energy.","Gross profit margins achieved in the second quarter of 2012 were 51.8% versus 52.8% in the comparable quarter in 2011. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to geographic mix, increased promotional and other allowances as a percentage of net sales, production variances and product damages, primarily in connection with Japan and Korea.","Gross profit margins achieved in North America overall were, in fact, slightly higher than in the comparable quarter in the prior year. Although, we had already covered a large portion of our anticipated requirements for aluminum cans in 2012 as well as apple juice and sugar, we increased the portion covered. Consequently, we do not believe that at current levels, any increases in the cost of raw materials will have a material effect on our margins for the remainder of 2012.","Distribution expenses, as a percentage of net sales in the second quarter, were comparable with the same period in 2011. Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 11.6% from 12.9% in the same period in 2011. The decrease in selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, was primarily attributable to decreases in advertising, which is primarily Worx, and point-of-sale, and was partially offset by increases in sponsorships, trade development programs and the cost of merchandise displays in the second quarter of 2012 as compared to the same quarter in 2011. As previously reported, we are continuing to invest in the Monster brand internationally, in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, Asia and South America, particularly through trade development programs to supplement our distribution partners' respective sales forces and to service and merchandise the small independent store channel. The cost of product sampling teams and trade development personnel are included as part of our selling expenses and do not form part of our payroll costs.","General and administrative expenses increased 33.5% in the quarter. The increase in general and administrative costs was primarily attributable to increased payroll expenses and in particular, increased stock-based compensation expense, which was $7.1 million for the quarter compared to $4.1 million last year, and $13.6 million for the 6 months ended June 30, 2012 compared to $7.9 million for the 6 months period last year. As previously reported, we have continued to hold discussions with our distribution partner in Central and Eastern Europe to more equitably allocate the value chains in various countries between us. We have moved closer towards arriving at an agreement in this regard. While we are in the process of reducing our operating and promotional costs in Australia, certain promotional costs were previously committed, and we expect that the effect of such dips will not start to result until the third quarter. We continue to hope that we will be able to achieve improved results in Australia in the second half of the year, although following such measures sales were lower in Australia during the second quarter of 2012.","Sales were also low in Brazil in the quarter, primarily due to delays incurred in obtaining customs clearance for certain ingredients needed to produce our products and issues with our distributor, which we are addressing.","For the quarter ended June 30, 2012, operating income was negatively affected by combined operating losses of $2.6 million from our operations in Europe, Middle East, Africa, Australia and South America and Asia. This figure was, however, lower than the $5.8 million losses incurred for the same period last year.","Our effective tax rate in the 2012 second quarter was 35.3% compared to 36.5% in the 2011 second quarter. The decrease in the 2012 second quarter effective tax rate was primarily the result of recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits due to the completion of an IRS audit for earlier periods.","Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $419.2 million compared to $359.3 million at December 31, 2011. Short-term investments were $451.1 million compared to $411.3 million at December 31, 2011. Long-term investments comprised entirely of auction rate securities decreased  from $23 million -- $23.2 million at December 31, 2011, to $20.9 million.","Days outstanding for trade accounts receivables were 40.7 days at June 30, 2012, and 42.4 days at December 31, 2011, compared to 43.3 days at June 30 2011. Despite such reduction, as sales outside the United States continued to increase as a proportion of our overall sales, we expect that days outstanding for receivables will increase due to the different terms generally granted to customers internationally in accordance of local practices in their respective countries.","Inventories increased to $199.1 million from $155.6 million at December 31, 2011. Average days of inventory was 62.7 days at June 30, 2012, which was lower than the 71.6 days of inventory at December 31, 2011. At June 30, 2012, the company held auction-rate securities with a face value of $28.3 million, was $44.8 million at December 31, 2011, with an amortized cost basis of $20.9 million.","During the 2012 second quarter, the company did not repurchase any of its shares. Gross sales in July 2012 were approximately 25.3% higher than in July 2011.","We are encouraged by the continuing strong sales that have been experienced by the company in North America, Western Europe and Japan. We caution again sales in the single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall and the timing of promotions in retail stores, and should not necessarily be imputed to, or regarded as indicative of, results for the full quarter or any future period.","I'd like to open the floor to questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alton Stump with Longbow Research.","Philip Terpolilli - Longbow Research LLC","This is actually Phil Terpolilli calling in for Alton. Just a couple of quick questions. First off, with the July results. I think you said they're up 25%. Any sense of what's driving that growth, if it's more the new products you've launched over the last few years like Rehab, or if it's more of the traditional lines?","Rodney C. Sacks","Generally, we're continuing to see growth in our original market and our original product. For example, our green product, which is the original 16-ounce Monster Energy, grew as an individual SKU grew 24.9% in the 13 weeks in convenience -- in 13 weeks to July 21. So we are continuing to see growth in our original SKUs, but obviously, we are also getting benefits from the line extensions. One of the things we need to obviously, factor in on the numbers is that the [indiscernible] division although a small proportion is flat, and that does tend to take down that number slightly.","Philip Terpolilli - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Then just, I think you mentioned the gross sales number for international. So do you have a net number by chance for 2Q?","Rodney C. Sacks","I don't think we have a net number available. Sorry.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","One housekeeping question. So you called out the damages in Japan and Korea, how much was that?","Rodney C. Sacks","I don't think we are going to break that out, but we have had some challenges in shipping there. We have had different types of damage. There have some damages that are potentially reclaimable back from some of our can companies where you've had defects in cans. We've had some leakers, we've had some tab issues. We just had some general, some production issues. We also had some issues regarding just, which haven't been attributable to suppliers, but basically, just shipping -- damages during shipping, leakage which has had secondary damages. So there's just been numbers of issues and challenges in the product in going into Japan where we've launched, but we've had some high product costs. And those are the things we're obviously, learning and addressing. And with -- what we've experienced is that the obviously, the tolerance of the Japanese distributors and retailers is at a very different level to the U.S. And whilst we did appreciate that when we went in, but I mean, literally every can is inspected one by one. And if you have 3 cans which have leakers, out of 1 million cans in America, the local stores throws them away. I mean, here, there is an investigation with 200 people involved from all over the world in trying to get to the bottom of that -- very, very analytical and very precise. And that has just caused some issues. And that is one of the large issues for the slight drop in the gross margin variance. If you look at the 6-month numbers, that difference is very much smaller. And then in the case of Korea, there were some issues where we had produced products and sent in to Korea, and we believe they actually analyzed it incorrectly because they believed there was 1 of the ingredients -- we have in energy drink around the world, it's not permitted in Korea. We took it out. They reported -- they came back to say on a test they felt that they found this ingredient. We said it's not possible. We took it out. We actually had mass spec tests done in the U.S. and as well as in Korea. We've established, without any doubt that there wasn't any of that ingredient in the product. But the issue is it disrupted everything for 6 months. And so, you've had product damages because product got shipped to Korea, and some of them got shipped back and some has been stored. So there'd be a number of these issues. I mean, one of the issues we had obviously, often anticipated, commencing selling in Korea and the revenues from that anticipated launch were also obviously not realized in the quarter. But those were the main issues regarding product and product damages and's issues relating to production.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. Well, I guess all of that being said, if you could help us, at least, directionally with what the impact was to gross margins in the second quarter, and that would be helpful. And then second question, so if you do the math on what your gross sales were April and May, it implies a bit of a deceleration in June. Obviously, you talked about what you did on gross sales in July. So what explains the deceleration in June? Was it comparison -- I mean, what else is there, and can you talk a bit about how you think about the July number rebounding?","Rodney C. Sacks","Mark, just going back to the original question, and the amount. I mean, the amount makes up a large portion of the 1% change in the mix, and that is the geographic mix there's -- there were high costs of shipping and inspection cost relating to Japan, so our margins on the Japanese business that we launched were very much lower. We think some of those will be ongoing, there will be some recoupment. And then ultimately, the idea is obviously for us, the intention is to produce locally, which will change that whole business model. But geographic mix, with the main portion. The damages and costs that we've talked about, there was also some allowance or some of it was reclassification of certain commissions because some of our distributors, as we're paying some commissions to, for example, Anheuser-Busch, once they take over ownership of a particular branch, they then become our customer. That particular commission is then, basically, instead of being below the line, deduction really goes into lowering gross sales to net. So those things have all had an impact on that 1% change in the gross profit. But many of them are not -- we hope, we don't think they will be ongoing and they will be rectified. As we go forward, will be more of sort of normalized more.","Then, with regard to other part of your question, I think there was a deceleration, but a lot of that again, is a single month. It depends on the day in which -- the Fourth of July fell and then you're selling or to the Fourth of July, there is, I think, a day shorter in the month and measures like that. But there has been a little deceleration in the category. But the numbers are still very healthy as you can see from the numbers that we just discussed.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.","Rodney C. Sacks","Judy, before we finish go on with the question, one of the previous callers had asked for net sales. I have managed to get the information. Net sales figure to customers outside the United States amounted to $124.4 million, as compared to $78.1 million in the same period last year.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. My first question is really just in terms of your balance sheet, and I know you talked about this at the last conference call, and you talked about this at the shareholder meeting, but just in terms of how you guys are thinking about the use of cash and why is it taking so long to really make the decision in terms of just returning some of that cash to shareholders.","Rodney C. Sacks","That's a question I really am not in a position to answer. It's a board issue. There are other matters that -- and factors that come into that position. Obviously, we are aware of it, and we will take action when we believe it is in the best interest of the company. Bearing in mind, other discussions and other matters that are ongoing at the moment. And it is possibly likely to change in the near future. It will take some different decision, but really, I'm just not in a position to discuss that further.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I mean, is that thought process sort of any different today than 3 months ago, just given that your stock price obviously, has come down more recently? And you talked about this being a Board decision, but you guys are on the Board. So what are some of the things that you guys are kind of looking at and are there any timeline, or are there any milestones that you have to sort of achieve before you make the decision or this isn't about the...","Rodney C. Sacks","It's nothing of that nature. It is a Board issue. Sure, we are on the Board. But we're looking at the company and the share price is higher, or it's lower. Like any individual, we make a decision to buy or sell shares, we make a decision to buy or sell the company shares or not to sell, but in this case to buy. There are many factors that we look at, and we will review the company's position  [indiscernible] in the light of some other factors that we have been engaged in with the board as well as the share price, which is just another factor. But there's no hard fast rule that we have to make or will make a decision by any particular date. We'll see how -- well, depending on how the share price reacts, we may change our position. It's something that we just retain the right to be reasonably flexible on.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just in terms of the broader category trends. So just looking at some of the Nielsen numbers that you cited for the 4 weeks, a bit of a deceleration. If you can just maybe talk to us about sort of what's driving that -- some deceleration for the category. And then, it looks like maybe the promotional activity has heated up a little bit recently, would you agree with that view? And if so, kind of what's happening in terms of the promotional activity?","Rodney C. Sacks","I don't really think there is a lot of heat in the promotional activity. It is summer. There's been little -- a small drop in our average unit price over the quarter. But we don't believe that is out of the ordinary. It's on that side, Judy. As regards to the category, the category -- on the one hand, there has been a little deceleration, on the other hand, when you look at the category, the category's growth now, it's not very different to what it was last year around about this time. And what happened was the category decelerated from July to September last year. And then, started to sort of level the  [indiscernible] and started to pick up again, and then been in the high teens and then sort of really peaked in May. And then, it's sort of back to those levels. But I mean, they're very respectable mid-teens growth in the category. And so, we're also creating more bigger numbers as the category continues to grow. It's continuing to create bigger numbers, and so we still thing that it's a very healthy category. We don't believe that we can read into it too much at this stage from any trends. And if you look at our own numbers going forward for July comments, it's still up, a very healthy number.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with UBS.","Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I guess the first question is, that I'm following up on, what Judy was asking -- but between cash and marketable securities are pushing very close to almost $1 billion now. We think buyback, we think dividend. Outside of that, it's maybe M&A. But can give some more context on what other factors you're referring to?","Rodney C. Sacks","Obviously, we look and keep our eyes open for any potential acquisition that we may believe, would be beneficial over the long term, and when and if it comes along, we will do that. We have the resources to make that certain acquisition, but they haven't, and therefore we have not done it. There's been no bar to doing it or no impediment other than that. We look at the use of cash, and it's there, and we realize that cash could be used for either dividend purposes or repurchase, and that we've got to make out decisions as we go along and there are various factors that -- I think that we obviously favor the repurchase, that's pretty much more would be now modus operandi for many years. But we look at it conservatively and sometimes, the share price rises and gets away, and for whatever the reason, we've decided at that point in time not to go into the market. That will change on a daily basis, just as we look at the market and the company and look at that we are acutely conscious of the size of the cash and the fact that it is returning low income back to shareholders. But again, we've been able to make sure that we been able to finance the growth of the company without any restrictions and again, we will relook at the share -- at the buyback program and once we see where the share price goes after -- into the open period. Until now we've not been able to do anything.","Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. So it would be fair for us to infer, or at least, assume that if there was weakness in the stock price, it would be a lot more likely to buy back shares versus your last open period during the second quarter, where you didn't buy back any?","Rodney C. Sacks","You're putting words in his mouth.","Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I just asked to infer. But, let's move to Japan. Some of the things you talked about relating to Japan and in particular, to the rollout. Does it sound like those are onetime items during the launch or is Japan one of those markets that perhaps costs a little bit more to service?","Rodney C. Sacks","I think that, while we continue to export product from here to Japan, it will probably cost a little more than other markets to service because of the precision in which they operate businesses. Right from our distributor partner, right through to the retail chains. They are very conscious of any damage issues or defect issues and they literally simply do not have the same level of tolerance as we normally have when we conduct business in the United States. And but that being said, there's a learning curve both for us, and our canners and packers and how to ship products and how to make sure that it gets there less damaged, and how to, in certain cases, to use certain packers who are a little more precise in the way they actually pack the product and their measurements. But there were a number of things that happened at the same time. And some of them where in fact actual can issues as opposed to production issues. Some were shipping issues. We believe that it will go down as we continue to get -- and this is going down already, as we get more experience in this and as we fine tune our ability to trade in those areas. The Korea issues was just not a not of  a making of generally, of production as much. It was some issues just with labeling issues in Korea. We've been going through, basically, a new category, that the category only opened for energy drinks that contained taurine and the normal ingredients. And sort of even there we have to have a different source, you can't use regular caffeine. And so we're sort of, even the officials there  [indiscernible] as to what their regulations are, and how do they categorize our products and how do they categorize different products of ours. And so, that's been stop\/start and that was the experience of some of the competitive products that have been launched there that aren't manufactured in the country, have also got in and then ended up being taken off the shelves and having to be reimported and remanufactured. The big problem there was we actually, unfortunately, ended up with an analysis of -- a mistaken analysis of something that was in our product that wasn't there. We established that with absolutely conclusively. But it takes a lot of time, and so we're sort of re-gearing now because we're dealing with a product that's been sitting on the docks there and places for months and with having to reinspect, and there are leakers, so we're incurring certain costs and pretty much dealt with those are the issues that we are going through at the moment. Again once we get going in Korea we don't believe that these problems will be ongoing. We are slowly starting to get different SKUs approved now through the authorities that are now retesting them and agreeing that they don't contain any ingredients that shouldn't be in there. And so we are starting to reship and starting to re-prepare for our launch in Korea. So we believe it will settle down. But those have been really the issues -- the challenges we have actually faced in this quarter. But the market -- the receptions, if I could just add too, the sales in Japan have really been very, very positive and that is -- that trend is continuing.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Alec Patterson with RCM.","Alec Patterson","Two things. First question just you went through the gross margins, puts and takes, but I just sort of wondering, what you were referring to on the raw material trend and the hedging position if we sort of backed out the geographic mix, and the damages and all those other things. Would you say that your cost of goods per case is trending flat to down this year?","Rodney C. Sacks","It's trending flat to down in the U.S. In Europe it's been a little bit higher largely because of  production issues in Europe and in our export business, because of production issues. A lot of shipping to Japan, a lot of extra inspection costs until everybody gets comfortable from the Japanese side, gets comfortable with our products, et cetera.","Alec Patterson","Okay. All right. But the underlying seems fairly favorable.","Rodney C. Sacks","Yes. And that's why I did refer to the fact in the overall, in the North American market, which is our principal market, our actual margins are actually slightly up.","Alec Patterson","Got it. Yes, it makes sense. So, just looking into the back half of this year, you've been talking about Brazil and Korea for some time, and obviously, Japan gets in the mix here about things sort a being put on a bit of a delayed mode on the international markets. Is that affecting the way you're thinking about how things are ramping up in the expansion markets into the back half, or should we think of these things as a little deferred or not as much of an issue?","Rodney C. Sacks","I think it's probably -- it's just a little bit deferred. In the case of Brazil, we have a small distributor, and they just have struggled to get the resources in line to basically take advantage of the market to the extent that we believe we should be able to achieve as our fair share. And so, we are addressing that issue and that is taking some time, because it's a big country, Brazil, and we obviously want to make sure that however we address it with staff, with people, with a whole different ways. Obviously we're looking to that as being a potentially large market in the future, and we are still confident we will be able to achieve that. In the case of Korea, that's just really got deferred revenue. We think Korea is an exciting market. We think it will be very positive for Monster. We think that our margins will be -- hopefully, we think will be a little better there than we are in Japan, where it's just been a lot of cost of goods shipping to Japan, inspecting products, before they get released has been very costly. And we were hoping that just as we continue to settle down, those costs will reduce. What we are all trying to achieve, and we are having some issues about trying to find the right size cans and the right production plants, but once we get that, we can overcome that. Our plan is to produce in Korea and in Japan, as much of our requirements there as possible. And that will remove a lot of these issues. So that's not really a change. It's a question of -- it's timing, we'll get there. It's going to take a bit longer. But we will get there. The expansion plans into Europe, and everywhere else are ongoing along fine and they're continuing as planned. And those are the major markets, particularly, the U.K., Spain, Germany, they're all doing very well.","Operator","That does conclude our Q&A session. I'd like to turn back over to Mr. Rodney Sacks for closing remarks.","Rodney C. Sacks","Thanks very much. Just in closing, I'd like to sort of just relate back to the numbers where, I know we've had some issues, or looking at the issues on the growth and the category. But often, I think we get a little bit spoiled and carried away by some of the increased growth numbers that happen from time to time. But like everything else, this is a young and evolving category. And so, some of the growth rates are -- you see spikes in it and you see some drop-offs, but generally, the growth rates that we're seeing and the carry over, the past 12 to 15 months are much higher than the growth rates we saw probably the previous 15 to 24 months. So the category is still growing well. When you look at the volumes in North America in CSDs and other products, which are flat to negative, the product, the category is healthy and the brand is basically continuing to take share even though we really have a large share. So it continues to all do well for the company and the brand and this is our main markets, so we're very encouraged by that. As we've indicated, the European markets are really starting to get to a sort of level where they're actually starting to really kick in at a much better pace. The sort of -- the acceleration of sales we are seeing in the U.K. and Spain and even Germany now is really starting to show. And so we are pretty positive about our prospects going forward for those markets. And we are dealing with the operational issues and challenges we have. But in the long term, we are very, very encouraged by the fact that the Asian markets are very receptive to our brand, to the taste. So we again, believe that it is a journey but there's a good end game insight. And thank you for your support. And we are just going to continue to put our heads down and continue to hopefully, continue to deliver what we believe to be very good results as we head on in this quarter. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn you over to your host for today's conference, Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO. Mr. Sacks, you may begin.","Rodney C. Sacks","Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg our Vice President, is with me today; as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance.","Before we begin, I would like to remind the listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends.

Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed March 3, 2014, as well as our most recent report on Form 10-Q filed May 9, 2014, including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance.","The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated August 7, 2014. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section.","We reiterate that our products are safe. More than 12 billion Monster Energy drinks have now been sold and safely consumed around the world over the past 12 years. To put the level of caffeine in Monster Energy drinks in context, we again remind listeners that a medium Starbucks 16-ounce-sized brewed coffee contains approximately 330 milligrams of caffeine, which is more than double the approximately 160 milligrams of caffeine there is contained in the same-sized Monster Energy drink.","On April 30, 2014, that American Beverage Association formally adopted new U.S. model guidelines for energy drink companies that are supported by the company, as well as all other major energy drink companies in the USA. The litigation between the company and the City Attorney of San Francisco is proceeding through the discovery process stage. In the Kona federal securities case on July 29, 2014, the court issued an order granting preliminary approval of the proposed stipulation of settlement. When finalized, the settlement will resolve the litigation and result in the action being dismissed with prejudice. The proposed settlement contains no admission of liability or wrongdoing on the part of any of the defendants, each of whom continues to deny all the allegations. The full amount of the settlement will be paid by the company's insurance carriers.","The company assumes no obligation to update any statements made with respect to ongoing litigation and regulatory matters, including -- with respect to the foregoing disclosures, whether as to new information, future events or otherwise, other than as required by law.","Given the current litigation and pending regulatory requests, we will refrain from answering questions or commenting further on these specific subjects. We are happy, of course, to answer questions that you may have about our products in general or about the second quarter as best we can after we have concluded our discussion on the business.","Turning to the business, in the second quarter of 2014, the beverage market in the USA, our largest market, continue to experience softness. DSD volumes declined in all major channels, including the convenience and guest channel. In contrast, the energy drink category continued to grow in the mid-single digits. Together, the RTD coffee drink category and the energy drink category were the 2 best-performing sectors.","In the second quarter, the company achieved record gross sales of $779 million, up 7.6%. Net sales were $687.2 million, up 8.9%. Our Original Green energy drink continued to perform well and grew in excess of the growth of the category as a whole. Particularly noteworthy is that sales of our Ultra line continued to improve during the second quarter. We are still in the process of implementing the repositioning of our DUB line into our Punch Monster line, and we are also repositioning our Juice Monster line. New graphics and formulas for these lines are now finding their way onto retail shelves.","While we are pleased with the sales achieved in the second quarter, our revenues were affected by less robust growth rates for the Energy category as a whole, both in the U.S.A., as well as in our international markets. While sales in the U.S.A. of our Ultra line were accretive, that did result in some cannibalization generally across our existing SKUs, primarily Absolutely Zero and Lo-Carb. However, during the quarter, Lo-Carb made up a portion of its previous sales losses.","Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was up 1.9 percentage points to 55.2% from 53.3% in the second quarter of last year. This increase was primarily due to lower allowances compared to the prior year, increased sales of our Ultra line, as well as lower cost of goods, particularly in North America, due to lower sweetener costs. Increased selling prices for our Monster 24-ounce line and increased prices for our Peace Tea line, which is now sold primarily in non-pre-packed priced cans.","Operating income was up 20.3% to $215.8 million. During the second quarter, our operating income was positively affected by the operating profit contributed by international operations, particularly the Europe, Middle East and Africa regions.","Additionally, our operating results improved in Asia-Pacific and South America, principally due to improved profitability in Japan and Chile, and a reduction in losses in Australia. Operating income in Mexico was also higher.","Consolidated selling expenses in dollars were below last year. While sponsorship fees were higher, costs of our TDM met program were lower, driven by the reduction in Europe. Additionally, premiums were lower as our 2013 Gear program was not repeated. Point-of-sale costs were also lower.","Foreign currency losses were substantially lower than last year. The effective tax rate decreased from 39.3% to 34.7%, primarily due to profits earned in foreign subsidiaries that had no related tax expense and as a result of the prior establishment of valuation allowances on the deferred tax assets.","Net income was $141 million, up 31.9% over net income of $106.9 million earned during the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share increased 31.5% from $0.62 to $0.81 in the second quarter of 2014.","According to Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through July 26, 2014, for all outlets combined and the convenience grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the Energy Drink category, including shots, increased by 5.3% versus the same period a year ago. Sales in Monster grew 9% in the 13-week period, while sales of Red Bull increased by 4%. Sales of Rockstar decreased by 0.08%. 5-hour's decreased by 2.5% and AMP decreased by 11.1%. Sales of NOS increased by 25.3%, and Full Throttle increased 3%.","According to the Nielsen reports, for the 4 weeks ended July 26, 2014, sales of energy drinks in the convenience and gas channel in dollars increased by 4.6% over the comparable period in 2013. Sales of Monster increased by 6.6% over the comparable period last year, while sales of Red Bull increased by 4.3%; NOS was up 30.5%; Rockstar was down 7.2%; 5-Hour was down 3.6%; and AMP was down 1.8%.","According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended July 26, 2014, Monster's market share in the Energy Drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased by 0.6 points over the comparable period a year ago to 34.6% against Red Bull's share, which was lower at 35.3%. Rockstar share was lower at 6.9%, 5-Hour's was lower at 9%, while NOS share was higher at 3.5%","According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended July 26, 2014, sales in Energy + Coffee Drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 9.1% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 4.9% higher than in the comparable period last year, while Starbucks Doubleshot Energy was 16.1% higher. Java Monster sales continue to exceed those of Starbucks Doubleshot Energy.","According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12-weeks-ended June 28, 2014, the Energy Drink category grew 2%, while Monster sales increased 16%. Our market share increased 3.5% points to 27.9% over the comparable period last year. Red Bull sales increased 4%, and its market share increased 0.of a point 9 to 38.8%. Rockstar's sales decreased 11% and its market share decreased 2.2 points to 14.9%.","According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the Energy Drink category grew 12.2% in the month of June 2014. Monster sales increased 6.6%. Our market share decreased 2 points to 38.6% against the comparable period last year. Red Bull sales decreased 18%, and its market share decreased by 9 points to 24.4%. Boost's sales increased 15.4%, and its market share increased by 0.4 to 13.7%. Drivet100, new in 2013, has grown to 12.2% market share, while Coke market share represents Burn and Gladiator together decreased 2.9 points to 6.6%.","The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and\/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain, in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.","Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased by 9.8% to $660.1 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2014 from $601 million in the same period in 2013. Operating income for the DSD segment increased 19.1% from $215 million to $256.1 million. Gross sales of our Original Monster Green energy drink continue to increase in the quarter, as did sales of both the Ultra and Java Monster lines. However, the increase in sales of these products was partially offset by lower sales in certain SKUs, including Monster Energy, Absolutely Zero, Lo-Carb Monster Energy and the Monster Rehab line and import. Net sales for our Peace Tea line was higher.","Net sales for the company's warehouse segment decreased 9.5% to $27.1 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2014, mainly due to reduced sales of Hubert's Lemonades in glass bottles.","Operating income increased 16.9% from $1.9 million to $1.3 million this quarter. Net sales of Peace Tea for the second quarter were higher than in the comparable period in 2013. We continue to believe that the Peace Tea brand has good growth potential.","For the 3 months ended June 30, 2014, gross sales to retail grocery specialty chains and wholesalers represents a 4% of growth sales, up from 3% in the comparable period in 2013. Gross sales to club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represent 9% of sales, down from 11% in 2013.","Gross sales to full-service distributors represented 62% of sales, the same as in the comparable period in 2013. Gross sales internationally represented 23% of sales, up from 22% in 2013. Other sales of 2% for the period were also consistent with the comparable period in 2013.","Gross sales to customers outside of the United States in the second quarter of 2014 amounted to $180.2 million compared to $160.4 million in the same quarter in 2013. Included in the sub-sales are sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and cargo-shipped to the military and their customers overseas.","Net sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in the second quarter of 2014 in dollars were $80.3 million, 14.6% higher than in the same period last year. Once we continue to gain momentum and increase its market share at retail in EMEA and, in particular, in Greece, Spain, Belgium, Sweden, Germany and South Africa.","We're now starting to see the benefits of the strategic changes implemented in the second quarter of last year. Overall, our EMEA division traded profitably during the second quarter of 2014, which contributed to the reduction in the effective tax rate of the company.","Central and Eastern Europe contributed in operating profit before allocation of corporate overhead for the first time. Gross sales in the Africa Pacific region grew 29 -- sorry, Asia Pacific region grew 29.9% versus the comparable quarter last year. Gross sales in Mexico were higher for the quarter. During the quarter, Japan contributed an operating profit to the division, and sales there continued to increase satisfactorily. In addition, significant progress was made in Chile. Our distributor in Brazil continues to secure increased distribution in sales for month-to-month.","We are continuing with our expansion strategy in international markets. In the quarter, we launched Monster in Angola, Serbia, Macedonia and Bahrain. In addition, we are planning to launch Monster in a number of additional countries later this year, including Bosnia, Georgia, Oman, Qatar and Nigeria. We are continuing with our strategy to secure local production in certain of our international markets in order to improve gross margins, reduce rates, reduce damages and assist in mitigating the effects of exchange rate fluctuations.","Production in Japan commenced in February and contributed to the improved results earned last year in the quarter. In addition, we are continuing to make good distribution progress in India. Our plans to produce Monster Energy Drinks in India, as well as in South Africa, are progressing.","Gross profit as a percentage of net sales achieved in the second quarter of 2014 was 55.2%. This is 53.3% in the comparable quarter in 2013. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially due to lower allowances, product mix and lower cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales due to higher percentage of our sales that was represented by the Ultra line, as well as lower cost of goods, particularly in North America due to lower sweetener costs, increased selling expense prices of our Monster 24-ounce line and increased prices of Peace Tea, which is now sold primarily in non-pre-priced cans.","Gross profit percentages achieved in the second quarter, both in North America, as well as outside North America were higher than in the comparable quarter in 2013.","As indicated on our last conference call, we have covered a significant portion of our anticipated requirements for aluminum cans in 2014, as well as a significant portion of our anticipated requirements for apple juice and sugar over the same period. We do not believe that our current levels increases in costs of any raw materials will have a material negative effect on our margins.","Distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales in the second quarter were 4.4% versus 4.5% in the comparable quarter in 2013. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 10.5% in the quarter versus 11.6% in the comparable period in 2013. While sponsorships and endorsement costs, as well as commissions and merchandise displays were higher. Costs of premiums, point-of-sale and allocated trade development and TDM met program were lower during the quarter.","General and administrative expenses increased 8.9% in the second quarter. The increase in general and administrative costs was primarily attributable to increased professional service costs for legal, accounting and other professional costs, other expenses incurred in connection with the regulatory matters and litigation regarding our Monster Energy drinks. We are continuing to work towards reducing our overall operating costs in our international markets.","Our effective tax rate in the 2014 second quarter was 34.7% compared to 39.3% in the 2013 second quarter. The decrease in effective tax rate was primarily the result of profits earned in foreign subsidiaries that have no related to tax expenses as a result of the prior establishment of a valuation allowance on their deferred tax assets.","During the 2014 second quarter, no share repurchases were made under the board-authorized share repurchase program.","Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $373.1 million compared to $211.3 million at December 31, 2013. Short-term investments of $454 million compared to $402.2 million at December 31, 2013. Long-term investments, of which option rates securities comprised $12.8 million increased to $51.7 million from $9.8 million at December 31, 2013.","Accounts receivable net increased to $395.5 million from $291.6 million at December 31, 2013. Days outstanding for trade accounts receivables were 45.3 days at June 30, 2014, and 42.8 days at June 30, 2013, compared to 40.1 days at December 31, 2013.","Inventories decreased to $207.9 million from $221.4 million at December 31, 2013. The average days of inventory was 60.8 days at June 30, 2014, which was lower than the 71.3 days of inventory at June 30, 2013, and lower than the December 75.6 days of inventory at December 31, 2013.","We are planning to launch Monster Unleaded, a new non-caffeinated energy drink in the Monster line in the U.S.A. later this year, as well as Ultra Sunrise, which is an extension to our successful Ultra line. Ultra Sunrise has a citrus-based flavor. Our new Monster Energy Valentino Rossi energy drink that was positioned as a summer promotion in selected countries in Europe and South Africa, has been well-received by both retail buyers and consumers. We are in the process of introducing an Ultra Black variant as a summer promotion with 7-Eleven in the U.S.A.","In the ordinary course, we introduced additional existing SKUs in various countries around the world from time to time. However, I would like to specifically mention that we are planning a full launch of Monster M3 in glass bottles in Japan later this month, as well as a Coffee Monster Energy drink in Japan later this year.","Gross sales in July 2014 were approximately 7.9% higher than in July 2013. The increase in gross sales in the United States was, in fact, higher than this percentage. The increase in gross sales was partly offset by decreased sales in certain international markets in July as compared to last year mainly due to destocking that occurred in some countries.","We caution again that sales in a single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall and the timing of promotions in retail stores and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of our results for the full quarter or any future period.","In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. North American and international gross margins are healthy. Our 2014 second quarter gross margins in North America, as well as international, generally were higher than in the comparable quarter in 2013. U.S. Nielsen market statistics show the energy category continues to grow in the mid-single-digits and that Monster Energy's growth is still outpacing the growth of the category is all. The new additions to the Monster family that were introduced during 2013 and earlier this year are continuing to gain market share and contributing positively to the overall increase in the company sales.","We believe our recently repositioned Punch Monster and Juice Monster lines will appeal to a broader consumer demographic and will be positively received by our distributors and consumers in 2014. We believe that Monster Unleaded will appeal to consumers since the true caffeine, who until now were not consumers of energy drink, as well as to consumers who would like to limit their daily consumption of caffeine but wish to increase the consumption of Monster, particularly later in the day or early evening.","Our new strawberry and peanut butter cup Muscle Monster energy drinks are performing well and should further enhance the Muscle Monster line in 2014. We are now rolling out our peanut butter cup Muscle Monster drink to the general market.","Turning to international markets. We are pleased with the performance of our international expansion, particularly in Japan. Spain, South Africa, Greece, Belgium, Germany, Brazil and Chile. According to the Nielsen, in the 4-week period to the end of June 2014, the actual days of the 4-week period vary by a few days between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 21.6% to 22.9% in Spain, from 8.3% to 9.1% in Germany, and from 7% to 7.9% in Sweden. In France, our market share remains flat at approximately 16.8%. In Belgium, our market share increased from 7.1% to 8.2%, and from 9.9% to 10.3% in Great Britain. Monster's retail market share value for the 4 weeks ending May 2014, as compared to the same period last year, grew from 18.3% to 19.9% in South Africa, and according to IRI, from 19.5% to 24.1% in Greece.","I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country to country.","In Chile, in May, Monsters retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 7% to 11%, and in Brazil, in June, from 2.9% to 5.2% as compared to the same period last year. Sales of Monster in Japan are continuing to increase and remain encouraging.","I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So maybe just on international margins. The first time, I think, many of your markets actually showed profitability in the quarter. So I just wanted to get some color on what the key drivers of that improvement were in the quarter, how sustainable that improvement is? And if you look at the overall gross margins for the company in that 55%, do you think this is, at least, the sustainable level, at least for the foreseeable future?","Rodney C. Sacks","I think that Europe -- I think the improved profitability came from, I think, better distribution in -- largely, in existing accounts. I think we still have an opportunity to increase distribution in numerical number in additional accounts. So we've been trying to focus on improving the quality of distribution and we will continue to do so. And also, in some of the markets that are becoming more mature, we also, as we indicated earlier, we did review our operating model and took down some of the -- some of our marketing and costs that we had spent in establishing the brands in those markets. We felt that we were able to do so going forward, and so we will continue to do so on an ongoing basis.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Then just maybe on some of your innovation that you've have called out in the call. I guess the last comment you made at the shareholder meeting was really trying to be maybe more thoughtful about innovation and, perhaps, thinking about innovation being more incremental to your brand portfolio. So if you can help us kind of -- how you think about the upcoming innovation? Do you really think this is now more incremental to your existing portfolio? And as you go into the market, kind of thinking about how you would approach getting extra shelf space as opposed to taking one out and placing the new innovation with -- replacing with your existing brand?","Rodney C. Sacks","I think that, that is illustrated by the value we sort of believe in, for example, in the Punch Monster line. We believe there is a subset sort of set of energy, which is in Punch products. I believe that by focusing our brand back into that Punch line with 2 SKUs, it will, in fact, help us. It is, in fact, doing that. We believe we are increasing distribution on the Punch Monster line. It has taken a little bit of time to get the new graphics out. There are new flavors that are more fit the Punch profile a little bit, they've being tweaked a little bit. And so we believe that is more strategic and that will become a key subset for us. We also believe that -- and many years ago, when we had the Juice Monster product, we rolled them out and -- but I think there were less sort of strategically focused as being a subset. And again, we had some fall-offs just because they became older and less-exciting and people went on to newer and more exciting things. So we've -- Khaos has continued to do well, but the -- and maybe started a little bit -- it was probably a little bit too heavy as a drink. So again, we've looked -- people are really turning to, we believe, lighter, easier-to-drink product. So again, the focus that we've had is in changing and reducing the juice content of our drinks because the -- and maybe sort of had a connotation to that, added percent juice. We've taken the juice content down quite substantially. So we've changed the name to Ripper, which is in line with the -- that, basically, product that we have overseas. So again, we've now clearly delineated what the product is. They're in very bright-colored cans. They've got texture on them. We believe they'll stand out on their own. There will be 2 Juice Monsters. And once we can solidify some distribution losses that we had on M-80, which is now Ripper, and get the line into a solid distribution, at position, we will then strategically, probably, expand that line with one more juice product. But again, there is a strategy behind it. We think there is a place that it can go, but it needs to be able to be identified separately. It shouldn't blend in with the larger line now because there are many SKUs, and it should have its own identity. So those are, again, in the process of getting -- rolling out new product cans, which we think are really, really attractive, as well as having lighter, lower-content juice flavors, which we believe are far more drinkable and easily drinkable because they are still carbonated. Again, we've been -- we think we've been strategic. We understand what's been happening to the Ultra line. It's been very successful. And again, we've -- we're going to introduce a selected one this year, which is Ultra Sunrise. We have plans to introduce another one next year. We're going to decide on that. We're also going to go through a test on a summer promotion with our Ultra Black. Test that flavor. See how that flavor does and see how the product does. And either that will be the line extension for next year or we'll have another one, which we have in test at the moment. Internally, we'll make a decision on that. So that's really where I wanted to look at that. The Ultra Sunrise is, in fact, a very similar product to what we did in Europe with the Rossi can. The Rossi can, again, although it says summer promotion, and that has been our strategy for it, strategically, as we see the success of that can, we have the opportunity if we want to, obviously, to turn that into a more permanent SKU. It's called the Doctor, which is the nickname for Rossi, but -- the name by which he is known. It is a full-calorie drink. The Ultra Sunrise here is a low-calorie or 0-calorie drink so -- but the flavor profile is all the same. We think that's a great flavor profile. And so we think that those will -- both products will play well. Rossi is not as well-known. MotoGP is not as popular sport in the U.S. as in Europe, and so we believe that the Rossi product is more appropriate for Europe. It still gives us an opportunity, obviously, to use -- to introduce Ultra and the extensions, including Ultra Sunrise in Europe later. But for the moment, we were looking to see where we want to go with the Rossi product and then the Ultra Sunrise here. We also have 1 or 2 line extensions. We repositioned our Rehab line, which has been a little soft, and we've really emphasized and changed the can emphasis on the fact that it's an iced tea and an iced tea lemonade line. That is the focus. We've -- obviously, strategically, we're going out to secure distribution of that line in the tea door. And that's how we're trying to obviously obtain more real estate for our brands and to get -- improve the depth of distribution. As we go through that, we are revising some of the flavors and tweaking them in the Rehab line, and we probably are planning to introduce one more Rehab product next year. So again, that's the sort of line in which we are following on product innovation. I don't want to go too much into detail of what we might do in the future. But we also are looking at introducing I think it's one more product in the Java Monster line. The Java line is doing nicely. We have, again -- we've strategically reformulated and repositioned the Kona Cappuccino line. It was in a darker can. I think the Kona, sort of -- it was a little bit confusing to consumers because we had a Kona blend, which is our original product, which is simply a good quality but an original basic quality coffee product. And the -- so we've now changed the graphics, again tweaked the formula and made it in a very much larger can, in line with the multi-content in it. So we have a cappuccino product, which we are rolling out now with the new graphics. So those changes, we believe, are really -- they may seem small, but they've been done carefully, and we think that's important because when you look at our distribution levels, we still believe we have a lot of low-hanging fruit in the line extensions that have substantially less distribution than the top view. And we believe that, that will continue to help drive improved sales and profitability.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Kevin M. Grundy - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","So Rodney, my question is on broadly the energy drink category in the U.S., and we've seen some slowing here, and you look at the Nielsen data in the convenience and gas channel, and we've gone from low-double-digit growth to about mid-single-digit growth in the category. So my question is broadly, what is your consumer research telling you that's driving the slowdown here? What are your expectations for the balance of the back half of the year? Do you think that innovation is going to help drive an acceleration? And just broadly here, are you getting the sense now that some of the consumer health concerns that are hitting the carbonated soft drink market are kind of seeping into consumers' awareness here as well?","Rodney C. Sacks","Yes. We really don't have any market research on what is driving the trends. We obviously see the continued soft trend across beverages in general. We think that the Energy category is being slowed down a little bit by the negative growth that is being experienced by 5-Hour, which is an energy shot. We lump it in the same sort of category. So we think that is pulling down a little bit of the growth as well. The growth would be higher without the energy shots in the category as a category. But overall, we are just seeing that slowing trend. We think that it's -- it seems to be around the world. It seems to have slowed a little bit as well in some of the -- in most of the international markets. But we believe that eventually that will sort of settle down and ride itself. We think there have been some health concerns about CSDs, and then the CSDs have now translated into the dark CSDs, so illogically, because of some scares about sweetness. Again, we think this too will pass, and I think things will settle down. But there are certainly some changing consumer trends and preferences. And those are something that, I think, we'll deal with them. We will deal with some of them, I think, by adapting our products to be more drinkable, to be lighter, lighter in calories and lighter in taste. And that's the sort of profile that we have for the Ultra line, and that's what we're now doing in reformulating the juice line. On the other hand, there are a lot of -- a majority of consumers still like full-flavored, heavy-bodied drink, just as they like light wines, and they like heavy wines. So we're trying to obviously cater for the full gamut of consumers, and that is the reason we introduced Muscle Monster. We think there is a trend for consumers, again, on a broader-based and pure sports people or bodybuilders to actually have drinks with protein in addition to the having the energy component, and that is why we introduced that line. So these are lines that are starting to solidify themselves, and we think that they will continue to grow. And we have -- I think we're well-positioned because of the broad range of our line to actually address this as we go. But we don't have any specific ideas as to why some of these of things are happening. I think a lot of the beverage companies would like to be able to have a crystal and see, but we just don't.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ms. Bonnie Herzog from Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I just have a first quick follow up question on Ultra Sunrise specifically. Is your goal to merchandise this new product within the CSD door? And then how realistic do you think this will be if, in fact, that is your strategy?","Rodney C. Sacks","This product has got nothing to do with CSDs. It has nothing to do with CSDs. It's got nothing to do with Mountain Dew. This product is going to be merchandised in the Energy door with the other Ultra products. It is a citrus flavor, probably more aligned into an orange flavor. It's got nothing -- it's not designed to address Mountain Dew or Kickstart in any way. It is simply a lighter -- 0-calorie and a lighter-tasting and refreshing and easier-drinking energy drink, completely in line with the original Ultra White product. The whole Ultra line mantra is the same. That is the subset that we are focusing on. And we're not changing the characteristics of that product at all. So if anything, our product is probably -- this product is aligned more to an Orangina-type of flavor profile. And -- which is similar to, again, to the Rossi can, and not to any of the other CSDs.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan from Stiefel.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","So 2 questions on international. First, what drove the slowdown on easier comparisons, which continued into July? Could you quantify the impact from timing and\/or destocking? And then secondly, can you quantify the impact on international growth broadly from your focus on profitability?","Rodney C. Sacks","I think there were a couple of factors that occurred in July. We don't want to go into more details because it is a single month. But -- and it varies quite dramatically. We believe that a lot of the factors that happened in July will not recur and it will make itself up into August, so we're not particularly concerned with it. But we really don't want to go into more detail on that front. It really was mainly destocking and movement and changes in production from one month to another because some of the production -- or some, actually, it's on an increasing level of production, is being handled in some cases by our distributors. And so their planning cycles are not necessarily linked to our sales and they will produce when they have gaps in production or when they feel they need it and we all find it and we try to smooth it out with them. But if we are finding that they were overproducing one period and then go down in inventory levels to another month, and then suddenly, the beginning of the month, start up again. And that is having quite a dramatic effect on some of our numbers on a month-to-month basis. Internationally, generally, we're starting to see some slowing but we've also tried to focus on getting many of the countries profitable. We will look again to accelerating sales but focusing on the bottom line and ensuring that we don't go back into the red in those countries. And so we're trying to just balance that through. We think that there has been some slowdown, but many of the international markets are really doing very well and starting to improve. Sales, for example in -- although we had a slowdown in international in July, and as I indicated, the actual sales in the USA were actually higher than the average company sales, the sales out in many of our markets, particularly in EMEA, from our distributors to customers, were up actually in the double digits in the EMEA in July. But our sales to our customers were substantially lower than that. So it's just a mismatch in July of some of those numbers.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Bill Chappell from SunTrust.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to follow-up on the gross margin side and just -- was there a big contribution from local manufacturing in Japan and elsewhere? And is that expected to kind of continue as you open up in Korea and India? Or I mean, have we seen kind of most of the gains this quarter?","Rodney C. Sacks","We think that the effect of local production in Japan was substantial and that really did help us. Sweetener cost was a big contributor as well as we started packing again at Dr Pepper in Texas, which also helped us -- we had stopped for a period of time, which was also beneficial. As we go forward, as we said, Japan is now onstream, where we're launching M3 in Japan, we're launching that with the local production from the get go. When we launch Coffee Monster in Japan, that will be locally produced. So again, that is being improved. We have had some challenges in getting going in Korea and South Africa with local production, getting their production up to speed and up to our quality, and same thing in India. We're all working with it and we're all making progress. And as those countries come on board, it will obviously improve the results there quite substantially. We recently expanded our production facilities in Europe by adding another facility, which we have approved. And so as we continue to really rollout and become more well -- better well-established overseas, we clearly will continue to derive the benefits from better production in those countries. And also, the other thing that will help with our margin, Bill, was just mentioned back there, it was lower allowances. We were able to achieve these sales by not having to go as deep with our CMAs and other allowances we've had historically provided to retailers. We think that we will be able to manage that on a similar level going forward.","Operator","And there are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to turn the call back over to Rodney Sacks for closing remarks. Mr. Sacks, please go ahead.","Rodney C. Sacks","Thank you. On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continue to develop and differentiate our brands, and to expand the company both at home and abroad. We reiterate that our products are safe, are properly labeled, and the caffeine content of a Monster is approximately 10 milligrams per ounce. It's less than half the milligrams per ounce of caffeine level that's contained in Starbucks and other coffee house brewed coffee. Thank you very much for your attendance.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program, and you may all disconnect.

We are continuing to implement our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers worldwide. Our transition in Germany in July was successfully implemented and we are starting to see an improvement in the quality of our distribution with and execution by that bottler. We are also pleased to announce that we have reached an agreement with the Coca-Cola Hellenic Group that will be applied across 28 countries serviced by them for Coca-Cola. Monster is currently being distributed through the Hellenic Group in approximately 14 countries.","We are currently in the process of signing agreements and planning for the transitions and or launches of Monster in the remaining 14 countries within the Hellenic Group's distribution network. Of particular note are our plans to transition our brand from our existing distributors in Italy, Romania, Ukraine, Bosnia, Croatia, Serbia and Slovenia to Hellenic as well as to launch Monster in Russia through Hellenic before the end of this year.","Another substantial opportunity for us with Hellenic is the planned launch of Monster in Nigeria in 2016. We have commenced discussions regarding the production of Monster locally with Hellenic in Nigeria, which is one of the two largest energy drink markets in Africa, the other being South Africa. Besides the agreement with Hellenic we have also reached definitive agreements with the Coca-Cola bottlers in Spain and Portugal, which are large markets for Monster. We are planning to transition monster in Spain and Portugal from our existing distributors to Coca-Cola Iberia partners early in the first quarter of 2016.","We have had positive discussions with the Coca-Cola bottlers in Southern Africa and are in the process of commencing the distribution of Monster in a number of countries in Southern and Central Africa through Coca-Cola bottlers. We are planning to commence local production of Monster in South Africa in the next few months. We are also planning to launch Monster in China. We have filed applications for approval of our product and have commenced negotiations with the Coca-Cola bottlers for production and distribution of Monster in China. Although the approval process could take longer, we are still planning to launch Monster in China in the first half of 2016.","We are also pleased to report that we entered into a definitive agreement with Coca-Cola Beverage Company owned by Ladies and gentlemen Household & Health Care Limited in Korea to distribute Monster in South Korea and are in the process of making transitioned arrangements with them. We are continuing negotiations regarding the prospective transitioning of Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers in South and Central America as well as in Australia. While we have made good progress, many legal and financial issues still need to be resolved. We are hopeful that we will be able to make further progress over the next few months.","We are also engage in ongoing negotiations to transition monster to Coca-Cola bottlers in a number of smaller countries worldwide. We intend to continue to manage the Coca-Cola energy brands, which we acquired and refer to as our strategic brands, as a Concentrate business similar to the manner in which the Coca-Cola company operated such business prior to the closing of the transaction. Under the Concentrate model, concentrate and our beverage base is sold to bottlers who add other common ingredients in containers to produce the finished product. We will, however, continue to operate a finished product model for our own Monster energy drinks consistent with the manner in which we have historically run our business.","Such arrangements will form part of our Finished Products segment. As previously indicated our reportable segments will reflect our view of the business going forward. In this quarter we reported on three operating and reportable segments: one, Finished Products, the principle product of which include the company's Monster energy drink products, which previously comprised the majority of the former DSD segment; two, Concentrate, the principle of which include the strategic brands acquired from Coca-Cola; three, Other, the principle products of which include the brands disposed of as a result of the Coca-Cola transactions including those which previously comprised the majority of the former Warehouse segment and the Peach tea brand.","Sales in the quarter continued to be negatively impacted by foreign exchange movements as well as the uncertainty faced by many of our independent international distributors outside of the Coca-Cola network given the anticipated implementation of the transitions in their territories. Additionally our bottle in Great Britain experienced production issues causing production to be suspended for a number of weeks towards the end of the quarter and most of October resulting in loss sales to us both for the quarter and in October. Although substantial progress was made during the third quarter, results were still affected by out of stock retail, although at a lower level than in the previous quarter.","Gross sales for the 2015 third quarter were $862.4 million compared to gross sales of $738.1 million in the comparable third quarter of 2014, an increase of 16.8%. Net sales in the 2015 third quarter were $756.6 million as compared to $636 million in the same period last year, an increase of 19%. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of approximately $34.1 million on gross sales and approximately $28.6 million on net sales.","Gross and net sales were impacted by advanced purchases made by our customers in the quarter due to a price increase effective August 31, 2015 on certain of our Monster 16 ounce energy drinks. We estimate that approximately $12 million of gross sales and $11 million of net sales in the quarter were attributable to such advance purchases. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales were 61.5% as compared to 53.8% for the comparable 2014 third quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to net sales of the Concentrate segment, which has higher gross margins than the Finished Products segment as well as the sale of the non-energy brands, the price increase referred to earlier, lower cost of certain raw materials and changes in product sales mix.","Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.5% for the 2015 third quarter compared to 4.5% in the same quarter last year. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 10.7% compared to 10.1% in the same quarter a year ago. Advertising costs, sponsorships and endorsements as well as commissions and royalties were all higher in the third quarter. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales for the 2015 third quarter were 8.8% as compared to 9.2% for that corresponding quarter last year.","Parallel expenses were up $7 million due partially to increased staffing in connection with the Coca-Cola transaction. Stock-based compensation, which is a noncash item, was $8.9 million for the third quarter of 2015 compared to $7.4 million in the same quarter last year. Gross sales to customers outside the United States were $207.8 million in the 2015 third quarter compared to $173.2 million in the corresponding quarter in 2014, an increase of 20%. Net sales to customers outside the United States were $170.6 million in the 2015 third quarter compared to $136.3 million in the corresponding quarter in 2014, an increase of 25.2%.","Foreign exchange movements had an unfavorable impact on gross sales of approximately $34.1 million and our net sales of approximately $28.6 million. Included in gross sales to customers outside the United States are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transfer to the military and their customers overseas.","According to the Nielsen Reports for the 13 weeks through October 24, 2015 for all outlets combined, that'd be convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category including shots increased by 10.1% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 9.3% in the 13-week period while sales of NOS increased 6.8% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 6.7%. Sales of Red Bull increased 11.2%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 28.5%. Sales of 5-hour increased 2.8% and sales of AMP decreased 3.9%.","According to Nielsen for the four weeks ended October 24, 2015 sales in the convenience and gas channel including energy shots in dollars increased 8.6% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 4.3% over the same period last year while NOS is up 3.9% and Full Throttle sales decreased 5.5%. Sales of Red Bull increased by 11.2%. Rockstar was up 32.1%. 5-Hour was up 3.5% and AMP was down 6.6%.","According to Nielsen for the four weeks ended October 24, 2015 Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel including energy shots in dollars decreased by 1.5 points over the same period last year to 34.9%. NOS' share decreased by 0.2 of a point to 3.9%. Full Throttle's share decreased 0.2 of a point to 1.1%. Red Bull's share increased 0.8 points to 34.8%, slightly below Monster's share. Rockstar's share was up 1.5 points at 8.2%, which is similar to the market share Rockstar had two years ago. 5-Hour's share was lower at 8.2% and AMP's share decreased 0.3 points to 2%.","According to Nielsen for the four weeks ended October 24, 2015 sales of energy plus coffee drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 9.6% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 5.9% higher than in the same period last year while Starbucks Doubleshot Energy was 16.6% higher.","According to Nielsen in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended September 19, 2015 the energy drink category increased 8%. Monster sales were up 32% versus a year ago. Our market share increased 5.7 points to 30.4% over the same period last year. Red Bull sales increased 1% and its market share decreased 2.5 points to 39.1%. Rockstar sales increased 6% and its market share decreased 0.4 points to 16%.","According to Nielsen for all outlets combined in Mexico the energy drink category grew 31% in the month of August 2015. Monster sales increased 24%. Our market share decreased 1.8 points to 32.2% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn, one of our acquired brands, increased 8% although Burn's market share decreased 1.1 points to 5.2%. Red Bull sales increased 8% and its market share decreased by 3.7 points to 17.8%. Vive 100's market share increased 5.1 points to 26.9% while Boost's market share decreased 0.1 of a point to 13.1%.","The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.","According to Nielsen for the 13-week period ended September, 2015 the actual 13-week periods vary by a few weeks between different markets, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 11.4% to 12% in Great Britain, from 16.6% to 19.4% in France and from 8.9% to 12% in Germany. In the same period Monster's value share grew from 8% to 9% in Sweden, from 7.9% to 8.7% in Belgium and from 5.6% to 6.1% in the Netherlands.","Monster's retail market share in value for the 13 weeks ended in the August, 2015 as compared to the same period last year decreased from 17.6% to 15.7% in South Africa, although in local currency sales were higher. Monster's retail market share in value for the 13 weeks ending September, 2015 in Spain decreased from 22.75 to 22.1% and in Italy decreased from 12.6% to 10.3%. These latter three markets all have independent distributors. According to IRI Monster's market share in Greece increased for the 13 weeks to the end of September, 2015 from 28.2% to 29.4%.","I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and the IRI in the EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen for the month of September, 2015 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased to 18.3% as compared to 11.8% last year and in Brazil Monster's market share for the month of September declined from 5.7% to 3.7% as compared to the same period last year. According to INTAGE for the month of September, 2015 the convenience store channel in Japan, Monster's market share grew from 30% to 39.2%. The launch on Monster Energy Ultra in Japan has been positive and sales continued to be solid.","As stated earlier, the company has revised its reportable segments into Finished Products, Concentrate and Other. Net sales for the Finished Products segment, formerly the DSD segment but excluding Peach tea increased 15.5% to $686.7 million and operating income for the Finished Products segment increased 25.3% to $289.5 million in the 2015 third quarter.","Net sales for the Finished Products segment were negatively impacted by approximately $23.1 million of foreign currency movements and operating income for the Finished Products segment was negatively impacted by approximately $2.5 million of distributor termination costs.","Net sales for the new Concentrate segment were $69.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and operating income for the Concentrate segment was $45.3 million. Net sales for the Concentrate segment were negatively impacted by approximately $5.5 million of foreign currency movements. As a result of the Coca-Cola transaction, which closed on June 12, 2015, there were no sales for the Other segment during the third quarter of 2015 as compared to $41.6 million of net sales in the third quarter of 2014.","In Europe, the Middle East and Africa net sales in the third quarter in local currencies increased 45.4% and 19.9% in dollars over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 38% in the same period last year to 51.5% during the quarter. While Monster is continuing to gain momentum and increase market share in Europe, throughout the third quarter growth in Spain and Italy in particular were negatively impacted due to the uncertainty following the Coca-Cola transaction. We believe that this situation will be reversed once Monster is transitioned in these countries to the Coca-Cola bottlers.","Overall EMEA is now operating well and we have made good strides in achieving increased distribution levels and in-store execution. EMEA traded profitability during the third quarter. We are continuing with the launch of Mega Monster in 553 ML cans in limited additional markets in Europe. Response from consumers has been positive and we believe sales from Mega Monster are largely incremental to sales of our original Monster 500 ML size products. In particular in Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Netherlands, Poland and Sweden, Monster achieved increased sales gains as well as increased market share.","It is noteworthy that in many of our international markets where our distribution partners anticipate the Monster brand being transitioned to the Coca-Cola network, sales levels as compared to the same level last year were markedly lower than the sales levels in those markets which are being managed by the Coca-Cola bottler system also as compared to last year.","In Asia Pacific net sales in the third quarter increased 64% in local currencies and 42.6% in dollars over the comparable quarter last year. Net sales in Mexico, Central and South America and the Caribbean in the third quarter increased 65.8% in local currencies and 45.7% in dollars over the comparable period in 2014. Monster sales in Brazil were negatively impacted due largely to the overall difficult economic and market conditions in Brazil along with the uncertainty for the distributor there associated with the Coca-Cola transaction.","In Japan net sales increased by 11% in dollars and 34.1% in local currency during the quarter as compared to the same quarter last year. In Mexico net sales increased by 48.8% in dollars and 72.6% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. Both Japan and Mexico contributed meaningful operating profits to the region in the third quarter of 2015. India continues to be impacted by regulatory issues and we continued to incur losses in the first quarter. We are addressing these issues and hope to achieve a resolution in the near future.","We continue to be actively involved in discussion with prospective Coca-Cola bottlers in numerous countries around the world regarding distribution opportunities for our Monster Energy drinks. We are also evaluating a large number of local production opportunities with Coca-Cola bottlers but in the U.S. and internationally which we believe will yield cost reductions. As previously reported, we have reformulated and repositioned our Muscle Monster line. In September a new Juice Monster drink named Pipeline Punch was launched exclusively with 7-Eleven.","During the 2015 third quarter the company purchased approximately 2.9 million shares of the common stock and every purchase price of $134.43 per share. Purchases were made under a prior repurchase program authorized by the Board which has been exhausted as well as under the new 500 million share repurchase program announced in September 2015. Subsequent to the close of the 2015 third quarter, the company purchased an additional 0.6 million shares.","Hilton Schlosberg","0.06.","Rodney Sacks","0.06 million shares at an average purchase price of $134.12 per share. The company has approximately $250 million available under its current board authorize repurchase program.","Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $1.2 billion compared to $370.3 million at December 31, 2014. Short-term investments were $1.5 billion compared to $781.1 million at December 31, 2014. Long-term investments decreased to $34.4 million from $42.9 million at December 31, 2014. Including short and long-term investments our auction rate security is $1.5 million, which are now being redeemed in full.","Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 43 days at September 30, 2015 and 36.4 days at December 31, 2014 compared to 38.5 days at September 30, 2014. Inventory decreased to $159.7 million from $174.6 million at December 31, 2014. Average days of inventory was 49.4 days at September 30, 2015 which was lower than the 57.4 days of inventory at December 31, 2014 and lower than the 62.9 days at September 30, 2014.","In November we will be launching Pipeline Punch as well as Ultra Black nationally. Our reposition of Monster Energy Rehab, Juice Monster and Punch Monster lines all continue to make good progress. We are planning to launch additional new products early in 2016.","Gross sales in October 2015 in dollars adjusted for the advance purchases I referred to earlier were approximately 6.8% higher than October 2014. In local currencies gross sales in October adjusted for the advanced purchases I referred to earlier were approximately 10.6% higher than in October 2014. October 2014 included the old warehouse division and Peach Tea. October 2014 comes to a high. October also had one less selling days in October 2014 and was also negatively impacted by the production issues experienced in Great Britain.","We caution again that sales in a single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period.","In conclusion I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. One, we continue to be pleased with the Coca-Cola transaction and the opportunity that this presents to the company. Two, North American and international gross margins are healthy and continue to improve. Three, the U.S. Nielsen market statistics show that the energy category is continuing to grow. Four, the new additions to the Monster family continue to gain market share and add to the company's sales. Ultra continues to perform well, we believe that the changes made to and the repositioning of our Rehab, Juice and Punch Monsters lines have been positive.","With regard to international markets, we are particularly pleased with the performance of a number of our international markets, particularly Japan, Great Britain, Germany, France, Belgium, Sweden, Chile, Ireland and Greece.","I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen on the phone lines [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Kevin Grundy","Hey, thanks. Good evening, guys.","Rodney Sacks","Good evening.","Kevin Grundy","So first a broader question and then just a couple brief modeling questions. First, can you talk about the investment that you think is going to be necessary specifically in Russia and China with your big opportunities, but relatively going to be new markets for you? Talk about what sort of lift you're expecting there, how you're defining success and then if you could touch on the investment piece?","And then a modeling question for you, Hilton. Just margins were particularly strong in the quarter. What we should expect there for the balance of the year going forward? And then some guidance on the long-term tax rate. Thank you very much.","Rodney Sacks","I think that much of what you're asking is really forward-looking, which we have historically not given and we're not going to give. So the large part of your question will remain unanswered. We don't believe there is - at this point, our intention in launching in Russia is not going to be different to the way we have historically launched.","And there may be some changes in China but it's too premature for us to even make that decision. We've not made it. We are at the moment evaluating the market and how we're going to go to market in Russia. Again, we do not believe that those would be extraordinarily high or different in any way to how we've gone in the past but it really is premature for us to give you any real indication on that.","With regards to the tax rate, Hilton will give you some response on that going forward and I'll hand over to him.","Hilton Schlosberg","Okay. Kevin, there were two questions you asked. One was about margins and, as you know, we do not give guidance. However, what I can tell you is that we took a price increase on certain of our Monster 16-ounce line effective August 31. So we had one month of sales with increased prices and there were buy-ins in that period as well, which we referred to, and there were some buy-ins in September. So you can factor that into your analysis. The second thing is we have looked at the tax rate and we believe here and obviously we stand corrected but we think our tax rate should be more normalized at about 37.5%.","Kevin Grundy","Very good. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Your line is now open.","Mark Astrachan","Yeah, hey. Good afternoon, guys.","Rodney Sacks","Hi, Mark.","Mark Astrachan","Just a couple of logistics modeling type questions. Could you give the split of your legacy business sales in the U.S. and international so we can get a sense of the comparisons there? And then separately, just curious how you think the price increase has impacted your market share and volumes just broadly?","And then sort of market dynamics, I know there's been a lot made of a strange weeks' worth of data in the scanner services. So curious if you could comment on that. And obviously in the context of the weaker results in October, sort of hearing what you're saying, how much of that is the pieces that you were talking about, the moving parts versus underlying weakening and in demand for you or just the category broadly?","Rodney Sacks","Yeah, just to start with the Nielsen in October, the months particularly of October was sort of a choppy month. And we just think that it's the timing of promotions, the timing of launches. Things are sort of - with all these other factors, we think they did have some influence over it. We don't believe that it will be ongoing but we believe that the rest of the quarter will improve. But we still see strength in the category. We have a number of new products launches planned for the beginning, early next year and running through a number of quarters next year.","So we believe that you just should not have that high regard or influence on the single month's numbers. With regard to the split between the legacy, we've given you that split throughout the company. We haven't divided it into the U.S. versus the rest of the world. And I don't have that debt number about what we've done it. We look at it in country by country and regions. So I don't have that really but I'm not sure that we should be providing that information at this point we know because then that starts creating other issues and segments. And so at this point we'd like to just leave it at the Finished Products and Concentrates segments as a group going forward.","Mark Astrachan","Okay. Thank you.","Rodney Sacks","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Caroline Levy of CLSA. Your line is now open.","Caroline Levy","Could you just clarify, when you said October's up 7%, was that including international? That was a worldwide number?","Rodney Sacks","Yes.","Caroline Levy","Okay. And 10 if you exclude the advanced purchases?","Rodney Sacks","Forex.","Caroline Levy","Oh, that was forex?","Rodney Sacks","Yeah.","Caroline Levy","Okay. Sorry, sorry. Would you be able to give us the breakup - I mean your case sales seem to include Concentrate, which then distorts what your Finished Product, we can't get at what Finished Product grew or what net revenue per Finished Product case looks like. Would you be willing to share that?","Rodney Sacks","So you're looking for a break out again of the Finished Product cases and we, again, this is...","Hilton Schlosberg","We haven't - you'll see the statement information. You'll see Finished Goods and you'll see Concentrates in the Q, which we're hoping to release tomorrow or Monday. So you'll have that then. And we're looking forward as whether it will make sense to give case numbers.","Caroline Levy","Because I think it's very hard to model something if we don't have an idea of what volume pricing - and you give us contact I think by division, but we need that volume in pricing by division, if at all possible. So anyway just lastly, could you talk - getting back to share loss, which is what we're seeing in the measured data and we actually haven't seen that for several years. And then a few months ago Red Bull started growing significantly faster than you guys. And I thought maybe with the price increase you would catch up but it doesn't appear to be happening. So are there any other dynamics over the past couple of months that would have affected that other than launch timing?","Rodney Sacks","Well, again it depends on how you, you've got to look at the two-year step numbers and where we were. So those have quite a big impact on share, or if you take share loss. Red Bull's numbers are basically been a percent or two above ours generally. And but again, they had - they took a price increase in January at a slightly higher level which seems to have stuck. We are really just starting to try and get the - our price level solidified. But if you look at cases and units, then our market share in fact increased and ahead of Red Bull's.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question...","Hilton Schlosberg","So and that's what I'm a little confused about, Caroline, because we mentioned on the call today that in convenience, which is a major sector, our share's actually higher than Red Bull's. So what you're looking at is year-on-year historical 2014 versus 2015. But if you look at the actual share, our share in convenience according to Nielsen is bigger than that of Red Bull.","Rodney Sacks","And it's been trending that way for the last three months. We've been increasing share. So these figures are sometimes - you've got to read, depends how you read them.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Pablo Zuanic of SIG. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. This is - good afternoon. This is actually Atisha on behalf of Pablo. I have more of a strategic level question. For the markets where you're planning to keep your distributors, what kind of emphasis will be played on the energy drink brands acquired? And can we expect any kind of attrition cannibalization of those brands? And on the flip side, where you will be moving to the new Coke system in the countries, should we expect some attrition for those brands? And if not, how will those brands be segmented in those countries.","Rodney Sacks","I think that we don't believe there will be any attrition in our business. The whole strategy is that in those countries that we stay with our existing distributors like Japan, then they will stay with whatever portfolio they have and if we have portfolio that we've acquired, in Japan there just isn't one but in other countries where there is one then that will be managed through the Coke bottler.","We've taken assignment of the Coke distribution arrangement or contract and that will simply be managed. In the cases where we are going to transition Monster, we are going to transition them and the outputs are managed separately. You've got Monster going into that bottler and we obviously have bought and paid for the strategic brand and we are going to manage those brands. It is our job basically to try which is different to how Coke obviously looks at their competitors, but now that we have both brands in our country, we're going to look to try and segment them and position them differently.","But they both are important brands they both are, in each country good contributors to our bottom line and to our growth as a company and to giving us a stronger position, overall in the energy category in that country if you aggregate the two brands, in many countries it gives us a very strong and leading position, which I think also helps us.","And obviously from a management point of view, where we can use the same stop we will try to rationalize it. But in some cases we feel you do need additional stops to take in focus on their own brand in a country. So I don't' think there will be attrition. The attrition will come from if the brand is not strong enough in a particular country to sustain its distribution or shelf space then there will be attrition but obviously we're going to try and put focus on this and try to avoid that.","So at the moment, obviously we are going through a learning curve with some of then we brands. We are repositioning the new brands, we are looking to redesign them and reevaluate their size, containers, and whether we need a different size or a single size. Some of them there are too many size containers and different flavors in different countries for the same brand. We are trying to rationalize some of these and improve some of the flavors.","We have plans to introduce some innovation and some new flavors for these brands, these strategic brands in 2016. So we are positive about them and that they will be managed differently and they will be managed separately, but we obviously are looking to put support behind and to do our best with all of the brands that we have in our portfolio with the energy focus. That remains our focus in that category.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Judy Hong","Thank you. Hi, everyone.","Rodney Sacks","Hi, Judy.","Judy Hong","I have two questions. One is, Rodney, just a little bit more color on China as you think about 2016. One, just in terms of the clarification on where you are on the approval process. I think you said you're still expecting to launch in the first half. Any risk that it gets delayed into the back half? And then just in terms of distribution opportunity, just given the strengths of the Coca-Cola system in that country, do you expect to see distribution ramp up pretty quickly in China versus some of the other countries that you've entered?","And then the second question is really on return of capital that you, in prior calls, you have commented on the Board actively looking at ways to return more cash to shareholders. Obviously, you still have a pretty sizeable cash balance on your balance sheet. But any sort of update in terms of the Board's willingness to actually take on some leverage and return even more cash to shareholders?","Rodney Sacks","I'll let Hilton answer the second one. I'll address the first one, which divides the questions up. On distribution in China, we are looking at going into China not very differently to how we've addressed most of the markets where we believe we have the best prospect of success. And again, without having taken a final decision, it is unlikely that we're going to have some sort of massive national launch with big TV campaigns behind it. We like to go into a country, we'll take a number of areas or types of chains or class of business and focus on that and roll it out. And it may mean that it takes some time. It doesn't - it may not go through all of the provinces. China is very, very big.","It's like saying in America, how would we launch? Well we launched in America in one county, in San Diego. And we launched in one county in Northern California. And then you sit down and grow from there and develop it. We think that that type of launch, and not necessarily one county, I mean one city, but that type of launch is far better. If it's a smaller country, it's a lot easier to get your distribution up. But China is a massive country, it's like a continent.","And we're still working through the strategy as to how do we launch, where do we launch, what cities do we launch in, do we launch a little slower in two different or three different types of cities, more modern or a little more traditional, get the responses and see how we position the brand. We're going into a new market with new culture and new consumers. And it is very, very, we believe, a great opportunity for the company and enormous growth. But we need to do it correctly and we need to do it right. And we're right in the middle of this process, so it's premature for us to give you any further direction.","As to the process, there are a number of alternative categories in which we believe our drinks can conform. We've made applications in two places for our products in two or three different categories. Those are currently being processed. I don't know how long it'll take. We don't think that they will take that long. We think - we are hoping in the next few months to start getting some positive response and maybe get some approvals but we really don't know how long it is. We've not done it before so we don't know. And we do have different ingredients and therefore a different time line. We can't just simply look back and compare a soda and say, how long does it take for a soda to get approved? It's a different product with different ingredients. But we still believe that we have a good prospect of launching the first half, perhaps a little later than we thought maybe a few months ago but we still think that we have a good shot of going in the first half of launching in China. And perhaps, Hilton will then take your other question.","Hilton Schlosberg","Judy, the Board is still reviewing options with regard to return of capital to shareholders and we will update shareholders once this decision has been finalized. At this time, no final decision has been taken how best to accommodate a buyback. You also asked a question about leverage and I think my answer is the same answer I've given in the past. Some of us may have a - personally have an aversion to that but it's a Board decision and the Board will determine what's in the best interests of shareholders and the company. So just watch this space. That's all I can say.","Judy Hong","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our Q&A session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Sacks for closing remarks.","Rodney Sacks","On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company.","We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy, and remain committed to continuing to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad. We are particularly excited by the new opportunities that we have going forward with a robust portfolio of energy drink products throughout the world comprised of our Monster Energy brand together with our newly-acquired strategic brands.","We believe that our agreements with the Coca-Cola Company will enable us to focus on our core energy business while leveraging the strength of The Coca-Cola Company's powerful distribution and bottling system on a worldwide scale. Thank you very much for your attendance.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Have a great day, everyone."],"14811":["Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST) Q1 2013 Earnings Call May  8, 2013  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Rodney C.

You've joined the Monster Beverage Corporation First Quarter 2013 Financial Results Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference may be recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Chairman and CEO of Monster Beverage Corporation, Mr. Rodney Sacks. Sir, you may begin.","Rodney C. Sacks","Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, is with me today, as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance.","Before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends. Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company, that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed March 1, 2013, including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statement, for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance.","The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated May 8, 2013. A copy of this information is also available on our website, www.monsterbevcorp.com, in the Financial Information section.","Once again, we reiterate that our products are safe based on both our and the industry's long track record and the scientific evidence supporting the safety of our ingredients. We estimate that about 50 billion cans of energy drinks have been sold and safely consumed worldwide over the past 25 years, including more than 9 billion Monster Energy drinks over the past 11 years.","In 2012, we sold some 2 billion cans of Monster Energy drinks in approximately 90 countries. Put it in another way, more than 5 million cans of Monster Energy drinks are sold and safely consumed around the world everyday. To the best of our knowledge, the FDA's position is that it continues to believe that there is a long history of safe use of products containing caffeine in the U.S. and that the average amount of caffeine consumed by the U.S. population has not increased in spite of the entry of energy drinks into the marketplace. The FDA has stated that available studies do not indicate any new previously unknown risks associated with caffeine consumption. The FDA has announced that it intends to convene a third-party review panel to help determine whether energy drinks pose particular risks to teenagers or people with underlying health problems, which we anticipate will take place later this year. The FDA has also announced last week that it will investigate the safety of caffeine in food products, particularly its effects on children and adolescents, in response to a trend in which caffeine is being added to a growing number of products such as gum.","Unfortunately, inaccurate, speculative and biased articles continue to be published in the media regarding energy drinks and, in particular, the caffeine levels therein. The simplest and most effective way of addressing those comments is to compare the caffeine levels in Monster Energy drinks from all sources to the caffeine levels of coffeehouse coffees, such as, for example, Starbucks or Caribou, as this comparison is easily understood by and is meaningful to consumers.","Coffee has been and continues to be extensively and safely consumed everyday in the U.S. by many tens of millions of consumers, many of whom are teenagers. In making such comparison, we believe it is appropriate to use Starbucks' 16-ounce medium-sized brewed coffee, which is the same size as a regular 16-ounce Monster Energy drink. A Starbucks 16-ounce brewed coffee contains approximately 330 milligrams of caffeine, which is double the approximate 160 milligrams of caffeine in the same sized Monster Energy drink. A 16-ounce Caribou brewed coffee contains between 305 and 370 milligrams of caffeine. Based on statistics provided by the research firm, NPD, we believe that coffee consumption in the U.S. by teens under 18 is significantly higher than their consumption of energy drinks.","With respect to the Fournier case, which we are continuing to vigorously defend, discovery is proceeding. At this time, we do not have any further update to provide on that case.","In October 2012, the city attorney of San Francisco wrote to the company, requesting information concerning the advertising and marketing of its Monster Energy drinks and specifically concerning the safety of its products for consumption by adolescents.","In December 2012, the company provided a detailed response to that letter. In March 2013, the city attorney of San Francisco sent a demand letter to the company, in which he threatened claims against Monster, unless Monster agreed to reformulate its products to lower the caffeine content, provide additional warning labels, cease promoting over consumption in marketing, cease the alleged use of alcohol and drug references in marketing and cease allegedly targeting minors. From that demand letter and other correspondence, it appeared that he had disregarded the established body of authoritative literature that had previously been submitted to him and other facts and information in the company's December response. The demand letter also made bold, unsubstantiated allegations against the company.","While Monster, nevertheless, was willing to meet with the city attorney and his staff to discuss ways in which we could genuinely seek agreement on a number of issues of concern, in preparation for the meeting that had been scheduled, the city attorney presented the company with a proposed stipulated injunction that would have imposed a wide range of onerous, unfounded and unacceptable limitations on the company's ability to market and sell its products. After receiving the proposed injunction, the company concluded that notwithstanding the active involvement of the FDA and the clear delegation by Congress to the FDA of the power to deal with issues involving food safety and labeling, neither evidence-based discussions nor statutory or constitutional limitations on the city attorney's jurisdiction were likely to dissuade the city attorney from his misguided crusade against the company. Therefore, we determined that court intervention was necessary. Consequently, the company filed a complaint against the city attorney in federal court in the United States District Court Central District of California, Eastern Division, seeking, among other remedies, declaratory and injunctive relief to protect the company's interests.","In response, on 6th of May, 2013, the city attorney of San Francisco filed a complaint against the company in state court in San Francisco, in which he claims that the company has engaged in unfair and unlawful business practices under the California Consumer Protection Law Section 17200 and requests an injunction against the company restoration of moneys [ph] to consumer and penalties. The company intends to vigorously defend against that action. The company continues to deal with various clause-action [ph] complaints that have been received by it over the past few months regarding the labeling and\/or safety of our energy drink products but which the company believes to be without merit. The company intends to vigorously defend against those claims.","The company assumes no obligation to update any statements made with respect to ongoing litigation and regulatory matters, including with respect to the foregoing disclosures, whether it's new information, future events or otherwise, other than as required by law.","Given the current litigation and pending regulatory requests, we will refrain from answering questions or commenting further on these specific subjects. We are happy, of course, to answer questions you may have about our products in general or about the first quarter results as best as we can after we have concluded our discussion on the business.","Turning to the business. In the first quarter of 2013, the beverage market continued to experience softness in general. In particular, the 3 major soft drink companies in the U.S., in connection with their respective quarterly reports, reported that the CSD volumes in the U.S. were down in the first quarter of 2013. The softness in the energy drink market that I alluded to in my previous conference call on February 27, 2013 continued through the first quarter of 2013, we believe, partially due to the ongoing negative publicity that continues to appear in the media, questioning the safety of energy drinks and suggesting limitations on their ingredients, including caffeine and\/or the levels thereof and\/or minimum age restrictions for consumers.","In some of our international markets, the energy drink category also appears to have slowed in the quarter. The successful launch of Monster Ultra Zero in the third quarter of 2012, while contributing to the increase in sales of the company, resulted in some cannibalization generally across existing SKUs. According to the Nielsen report for the 13 weeks through April 27, 2013, in the convenience and gas channel, Zero Ultra has become our second best-selling SKU after our Original Monster Green.","During the first quarter, our operating income was negatively affected by costs incurred by us to terminate certain of our prior distributors in parts of New York and San Diego amounting to $8.3 million. Such costs were expensed in full in the quarter. The amount that will be received from our new distributors for those areas will be approximately equal to such costs. However, such amounts are required to be accounted for as deferred revenue and may only be recognized as revenue, ratably, over the anticipated life of the respective distribution agreements, generally 20 years. On a cash flow basis, however, those transactions are, in fact, neutral to the company.","During the quarter, we incurred foreign currency transaction losses of $4.7 million, primarily related to our operations in Japan and South Africa. Additionally, during the quarter, we incurred increased professional service costs of $4.9 million, net of insurance reimbursements, of which $3 million is related to regulatory matters and related to litigation concerning the company's Monster Energy brand energy drinks, which, we believe, are extraordinary in nature. The net effect of all of these items on the operating income of the company amounts to approximately $16 million. We're already seeing the benefits of the distributor changes in New York and San Diego and are hopeful that our sales and market shares in those respective territories will increase during the remaining quarters of 2013.","The company continued to make progress in the first quarter and achieved record first quarter gross sales up 7.3% to $555 million, with net sales up 6.5% to $484.2 million.","Operating income was down 15% to $107.3 million. Our tax rate was slightly lower this quarter at 39.8% versus 39.9% in the same quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share decreased 10.4% from $0.41 per share in the first quarter of 2012 to $0.37 per share in the first quarter of 2013.","While we are pleased with the results we achieved in the first quarter, our revenues were affected by less robust growth for the energy category as a whole and Monster Energy in our principal market, United States, as well as in Canada and Mexico, in the first quarter. Sales of our new Monster Zero Ultra, which did result in some cannibalization generally across our existing SKUs, sales of Worx Energy Shots were also lower. Relatively flat sales in our Warehouse division, less robust growth of the energy category overall in Europe, Middle East and Africa. Despite such slowdown, Monster was still able to achieve 34% growth in dollars in that region.","As discussed on previous conference calls, we will be reporting on Nielsen's extended sample of outlets, which includes Wal-Mart; dollar stores, such as Family Dollar, Dollar General and Fred's; DeCA military stores; and club stores, namely Sam's and BJ's, but excluding Costco.","According to the Nielsen report for the 13 weeks through April 27, 2013, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, on an expanded basis I just described, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including Shots, increased by 2.8% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 7.1% in the 13-week period, while sales of Red Bull increased by 9.5%. Sales of Rockstar decreased by 2.5%, and sales of 5-Hour decreased by 13.1%. Sales of AMP were down 20.8%. NOS increased 7.3%, and sales of Full Throttle decreased 3%.","According to the Nielsen report for the 4 weeks ended April 27, 2013, sales of energy drinks in the convenience and gas channel, in dollars, increased by 3.5% over the comparable 4-week period in 2012. Sales of Monster increased by 6.5% over the comparable period last year, while sales of Red Bull increased by 13.7% over the same period. Rockstar was down 2.8%, while 5-Hour was down 14.7%.","According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended April 27, 2013, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased by 1 point over the comparable period a year ago to 32.9% against Red Bull's share of 35.9%, Rockstar's share of 7.4%, 5-Hour share of 10.2% and AMP's share of 3.1%.","According to Nielsen, in the 13 weeks ended April 27, 2013, sales of energy plus coffee drinks, in dollars, in the convenience and gas channel increased 7.8% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 18.3% higher than in the comparable period last year, while Starbucks Double Shot Energy was down 1.9%. Sales of Java Monster exceeded sales of Starbucks Double Shot Energy drinks.","According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended April 6, 2013, the energy drink category grew 7%. Monster sales increased 6%. Our market share is 24.8%, which is point -- 2 points lower than in the comparable period last year. Red Bull sales increased 11%, and its market share increased 1.3 points to 37.6%. Rockstar sales increased 7%, and its market share remained flat at 16.3%.","According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 5 weeks ended March 30, 2013, sales of energy drinks grew 9%. Over this period, sales of Red Bull increased 15.4%, sales of Monster decreased of 2.6%, while sales of Rockstar increased 28.6%.","According to Nielsen, in all outlets combined in Mexico for the month of March 2013, the energy drink category grew 6.8%. Monster sales increased 1.2%, but our market share decreased 1.9 points to 33.8% from the comparable period last year; while Red Bull sales increased 10%, and its market share increased by 1.1% to 37.6%. Boost's sales increased 20.3%, and its market share increased 1.3 points to 12%; and Gladiator sales increased 1.8%, and its market share decreased by 0.7 points to 13.4%.","Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 6.7% to $460.2 million for the 3 months ended March 31, 2013 from $431.2 million in the same period in 2012, and contribution margin decreased from $149.1 million to $139 million.","Net sales for the company's Warehouse segment increased to $24 million for the 3 months ended March 31, 2013 compared to $23.4 million for the same period in 2012, but contribution margin decreased to $0.4 million this quarter from $2.2 million in the same quarter last year.","For the 3 months ended March 31, 2013, gross sales to retail, grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers represented 3% of gross sales, down from 4% in 2012. Gross sales to club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represented 10% of sales, the same as in 2012. Gross sales to full-service distributors represented 62% of sales, down from 65% in 2012. Gross sales internationally increased to 23% from 19% in the same period in 2012. Other sales were 2% for the 3 months ended both March 31, 2013 and 2012. Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the first quarter of 2013 amounted to $130.7 million compared to $100.6 million in the same quarter in 2012. Included in such sales were sales to the company's military customers which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas.","Net sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa in the first quarter of 2013, in dollars, was -- were 34% higher than in the same period last year.","Monster is continuing to gain momentum and market share in Europe and South Africa. In particular, the U.K., Germany, Spain, and South Africa all experienced substantial sales and market share gains. We are continuing with our expansion strategy into new international markets. We launched Monster Energy in Romania and Albania in April 2013 and are planning to commence sales in India shortly. We are planning to launch Monster in additional countries in Central and Eastern Europe later this year. Sales in Japan in the first quarter continued to exceed our expectations. Although product damage has been substantially reduced, the weaker yen negatively affected our gross margins in Japan during the quarter. Our plan to commence local production in Japan, Korea and India is progressing satisfactorily.","Sales in Brazil through Ambev commenced at the end of January. In the results, sales in the first quarter in Brazil were substantially higher than in the comparable quarter last year. Sales of Peace Tea ready-to-drink iced tea has continued to progress. Gross sales increased by 11.3% over the same period in 2012. We recently launched certain flavors of Peace Tea in 8.4-ounce cans in 12-unit multi-pack containers and 64-ounce multi-serve PET plastic bottles.","We are continuing to sell Worx Energy, although sales levels have decreased substantially. In the Warehouse division, sales of Hubert's Lemonades in glass bottles continue to make good progress, although sales of sodas were weaker.","Gross profit margins achieved in the first quarter of 2013 was 52.1% versus 53.1% in the comparable quarter in 2012, but higher than the gross profit margin achieved in the fourth quarter of 2012 of 51.7%. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially attributable to geographic mix. Gross margins achieved for international sales, other than those sold from the United States, were lower in the first quarter of 2013 than in the comparable quarter in 2012. Gross margins achieved in the quarter in North America in 2013 were slightly higher than in the comparable quarter last year.","We have now covered a significant portion of our anticipated requirements for aluminum cans in 2013, as well as a significant portion of our anticipated requirements for apple juice and sugar. We did experience cost increases in certain raw materials in the first quarter of 2013 and expect to continue to experience limited increases during the remainder of the year. However, we do not believe that, at current levels, the increases in the cost of raw materials will have a material negative effect on our margins.","Distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales in the first quarter were 4.6% versus 4.3% in the comparable quarter in 2012, primarily due to excess freights incurred in North America, as a result of the temporary cessation of production at a plant in Texas which resulted in product being shipped into that state from California and elsewhere.","Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 13.5% from 12.3% in the same period in 2012, primarily due to increased social media and Internet marketing costs, premiums, sponsorships and point of sale. Additionally, costs of trade development programs to supplement our distribution partners' sales forces to service and merchandise a small independent store channel, particularly in Europe, were substantially higher in the first quarter than in the comparable period last year. The cost of trade development, personnel and sampling teams are included as part of our selling expenses and do not form part of our payroll costs.","The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased payroll expenses and, in particular, increased professional service costs for legal, accounting and other professional costs. These costs, net of insurance reimbursements, were $4.9 million higher than in the comparable quarter of 2012. Additionally, travel costs were substantially higher in the first quarter than in the comparable quarter last year. Many of the increases in SG&A spending were planned based on increased budgeted sales, which did not fully materialize.","Operating income was negatively affected by combined operating losses of $2.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2013 from our operations in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, South America and Asia, as compared to operating losses of $4.3 million for the same period last year. As I mentioned earlier, the increase in operating expenses was partially attributable to increased expenditures for terminating existing distributors and professional service costs. In addition, the increase in operating expenses was due to increased payroll expenses of $2.9 million, increased outbound freight and warehouse costs of $2.6 million, increased expenditures of $2.4 million for other marketing expenses, increased expenditures of $2 million for premiums, increased expenditures of $1.9 million for sponsorships and endorsements and increased expenditures of $1.7 million for allocated trade development.","Our effective tax rate in the 2013 first quarter was 39.8% compared to 39.9% in the 2012 first quarter. The decrease in the 2013 first quarter effective tax rate was primarily the result of establishing a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of our foreign subsidiary established during the first quarter of 2012. The decrease in the effective tax rate was partially offset by the establishment of a full valuation allowance against a tax capital loss recognized on the sale of certain available for sale auction rate securities, as well as the higher effective tax rate in certain foreign jurisdictions.","Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $242.5 million compared to $222.5 million at December 31, 2012. Short-term investments were $102.1 million compared to $97 million at December 31, 2012. Long-term investments comprised entirely of auction rate securities decreased from $21.4 million at December 31, 2012 to $13.6 million.","Trade accounts receivables are now presented on a gross basis, as are promotional allowances owed to those customers that the company does not allow a net settlement, such as our full-service distributors. We continue to present that portion of the promotional allowances owed to those customers that the company allows net settlement on a net basis. Trade accounts receivables increased to $308.7 million from $236 million at December 31, 2012. Days outstanding for receivables, consistent with the above treatment, were 50.4 days at March 31, 2013 and 39.2 days at December 31, 2012 compared to 44.8 days at March 31, 2012.","As sales outside the United States continued to increase as a proportion of our overall sales, days outstanding for receivables are expected to increase due to the different terms generally granted to customers internationally in accordance with local practices in their respective countries.","Inventories increased to $215.3 million from $203.1 million at December 31, 2012. The average days of inventory were 83.5 days at March 31, 2013, which is higher than the 80.3 days of inventory at December 31, 2012 and 75.5 days at March 31, 2012. At March 31, 2013, the company had auction rate securities with a face value of $19.5 million worth $27.8 million at December 31, 2012, with an amortized cost basis of $17.4 million. Gross sales in April 2013 were approximately 5.7% higher than in April 2012. We caution again that sales in a single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall and the timing of promotions in retail stores and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period.","During the 2013 first quarter, the company purchased an additional 0.3 million shares of its stock at an average purchase price of $51.99 per share, which exhausted the availability under the then current repurchase plan. Subsequent to quarter end, the Board of Directors approved a new repurchase plan of $200 million. The company has not repurchased any of its shares pursuant to the April 2013 repurchase plan.","In March, the company launched a new Monster Ultra Blue line extension, as well as a Kona Cappuccino line extension to the Java Monster line. Additionally, in March, the company launched a new line of 3 energy shakes called Muscle Monster that contain 25 grams of protein in 15-ounce cans, as well as the new Tea + Pink Lemonade + Energy Monster Rehab line extension. Additionally, the company launched Monster mini take-home 12 packs, containing 8-ounce cans, as well as Peace Tea take-home 12 packs containing 8.4-ounce cans.","In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. One, North American gross margins remain healthy. Our 2013 first quarter gross margins for North America were actually higher than in the comparable quarter in 2012 and in the fourth quarter of 2012. U.S. Nielsen market statistics show that Monster Energy's growth is still outpacing the growth of the category as a whole. Three, new distribution arrangements with Big Geyser for the Greater New York area and Anheuser-Busch distributors for the San Diego areas have been implemented, and the initial results from both areas have been positive. Four, new product line extensions that have been launched are receiving good reception from both the trade, as well as from consumers. Five, turning to international markets, we are satisfied with the performance of our international expansion and investments, particularly in the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, South Africa, Japan and Brazil. Six, even though the energy drink category has been in existence in Europe for over 25 years, our EMEA markets are still, on average, experiencing solid growth, and the Monster brand continues to grow well in excess of the category. Seven, according to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended March 23, 2013, Monster's market share in Great Britain increased to 10.3% from 7.4% in the same period last year. In Spain, Monster's market share in the 4 weeks through February 28, 2013 increased to 18.5% from 12.9% in the same period last year. In Germany, in the 4 weeks through February 28, 2013, Monster's market share grew to 9.3% from 5.9% in the same period in the previous year. And in South Africa, Monster's market share in the 4 weeks through February 28, 2013, grew to 16.8% from 11.9% in the same period last year. Sales of Monster in Japan remain encouraging, and the brand has achieved substantial value share in the market in the modern convenience trade channel. Nine, we have launched Monster Energy in Korea, and the commencement of sales of Monster in India is anticipated shortly and which we view as an exciting future growth opportunity for Monster. Finally, ten, Southern Brazil, through our new distribution partner, Ambev, has been strong since they commenced distribution at the end of January.","I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go to the next question, which comes from Kaumil Gajrawala of UBS.","Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Your trends have tracked Nielsen much more closely in the quarters and years in the past, yet, that wasn't the case in this quarter. Was there something unique going on in this quarter on why trends in the U.S. were -- seemed to be materially different from what was in the Nielsen data?","Rodney C. Sacks","Yes. We just don't -- we don't know.","Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Could it be something maybe tied to inventory levels or, particularly, with the change in the distributor in New York?","Rodney C. Sacks","We don't think so. I mean, we did take back some inventory from our previous distributors. That came back in. But we don't think those would have materially affected the numbers. So we just don't have a -- we just don't have any reason for the differences.","Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. As you look at the Nielsen data that you cited on the call earlier today, it did feel like, as you went country-by-country, that the current data seems to be in line with how your trends are doing?","Rodney C. Sacks","Generally, the -- our sales out [ph] just seemed to be lagging a little bit in North America, but not by much. But they do seem to be generally in line.","Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Understood. And then, finally, on Zero Ultra, is the shelf space incremental, or is it coming from maybe pruning some of the brands in your portfolio?","Rodney C. Sacks","It's very difficult to tally. it varies from store to store. In order to get the product on shelf quickly, obviously, a lot of our distributors cut into existing shelf space because we had -- we have a certain number of shelves that we've agreed, and we have the shelf space so they would have cut into that to get a single facing. And then, because of [indiscernible] two facings. But as we continued to get shelf programs for 2013, we have continued to expand and take that into account. So in some cases, it's -- we've had to sort of juggle the shelf space because there's only so much space available on the shelves. In other cases, in other chains, we have picked up some incremental space through that and other -- the other sort of line extensions. So it's mixed. I don't have any express answer.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Faucher of JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just want to talk a little bit about the cadence within the quarters. Most companies, we get concerned when we feel like, okay, trends are better in the last month of the quarter because they're struggling to make the numbers. You guys have had sort of the opposite situation, where the first month of the quarter starts out really strong and then maybe not as strong as we go through the quarter. Do you guys have any thoughts in terms of maybe what's causing that type of shipment pattern? Is it new product launches? Is it new distributors starting in the beginning of the quarter? Any color, so we can get a better handle in terms of why the trend seemed to decelerate through the quarter?","Rodney C. Sacks","We really don't have any explanation. It changes from quarter-to-quarter. They simply are what they are and sometimes quarters end stronger and sometimes they don't. The trends just change from month to month. We really do have a volatile set of numbers from month-to-month, and that's why we continue to caution that these numbers are single months. And we just -- they just are what they are. As you indicated, they change from quarter-to-quarter.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. And then, with Red Bull launching their first flavored new products in a long time, you're getting a sense from your retail customers, it seems though there's an opportunity that, that could bring more news to the category and potentially reaccelerate the category. I realize it's still early days from that standpoint. Are you seeing any impact to the category trends from these competitive launches?","Rodney C. Sacks","Not really. The -- I think that Red Bull has got a lift in their sales, as you can see from some of the Nielsen numbers, and we think that, that is largely due to the introduction of these new additional flavors. A lot of that is trial. A lot of that is -- they're different for the first time. The first time they've had a new flavor for a long time. There are other flavors. Even the Total Zero is very similar to their -- the profile of their existing Red Bull. So this was a complete change. And so, ultimately, you're going to get trial extra shelf space from -- there's a lot of promotion going around the 8 oz. We can see the promotional activity in the Red Bull sales numbers and dollar sales they have -- they are promoting quite heavily, their 8 oz. quite heavily. So it's too soon to tell where it's going to go. In Europe, generally, they've not really succeeded in driving incremental sales and even shelf space. But certainly, incremental sales on a longer-term basis, but we are seeing some trial. And so, we've just got to wait a little while. I think it's just premature. And so, that -- overall, I think that it may help the category to basically bring in additional consumers. I think that will be so. But the extent of that, we don't know.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Chappell of SunTrust.","Sarah Miller","This is Sarah Miller on for Bill. I was just wondering if we could get a little bit more color around the local manufacturing that you're setting up in Japan and Korea and kind of how that's going to affect the cadence of gross margin trends for the rest of the year?","Rodney C. Sacks","Well, as soon as we are able to get those production facilities up and running, we will -- we believe, we will achieve substantially improved margins in those areas. We'll also eliminate, we believe, a lot of the -- or a large portion of the damages we're incurring in shipping beverages those long distances. In the case of Japan, it's been necessary for us to contract with a can manufacturer to actually make the specific can sizes we are using in Japan, as they're not otherwise available. And at the same time, we are working with 2 production facilities to qualify them to run those cans for us. And so, it is taking some time, but we're making good progress in that regard, particularly in the light of the -- that being the largest volume area for us in that region. We're, obviously, looking to try and get that production up and running as soon as possible. We're hoping to -- towards the middle of the year to start looking at being able to do a test run and produce. We are also probably a little more behind that in Korea and in India. But in those -- both of those countries, it may be easier to get cans less complicated because of the fact that we do have and can buy certain cans in those countries, but those will probably be a little behind that. And so, we're working on all 3 fronts, but the -- our focus is on Japan because of the larger volumes that we are doing in that country. We are also in the process this week of launching Absolutely Zero, which is a new line extension in Japan. So we are looking positively to Japan going through the rest of the year.","Sarah Miller","Okay. And then, my one follow-up question is, I remember, with Europe last year, it was pretty cold and pretty wet through the spring and summer. I'm just wondering if you have kind of an estimate of how weather might have helped you in the EMEA region this quarter and what your comps look like for the rest of the year?","Rodney C. Sacks","We -- I'm not sure that weather has had a material impact. I think the weather hasn't been great this first quarter as well in Europe. They had some pretty cold spells until recently, particularly in Great Britain. So I just don't think that will have an impact. I think there was just -- there has been a little bit of a general slowing. Again -- but I think that the month of April was probably a little slower for us in Europe than the first quarter, but we believe that will improve as we -- going into the remainder of the quarter. But again, it's still too early to tell. I mean, there's nothing I can give you specifically on those numbers and directions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Caroline Levy of CLSA.","Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I wonder if you could tell us -- it looks to us, like, net sales were only up a couple of percent in the U.S. and about 30 overseas. If you could help me understand if I'm on the right track with that and also, will the professional fees will probably run at a similar rate through the year from where you sit today?","Rodney C. Sacks","Your estimate is pretty close on the numbers. I think that on -- that's on the sales side. On the professional fees, we're not sure. It depends on a number of factors. We think that if the FDA has its scientific hearing and things, sort of, start becoming a little clearer, I think a lot of things will clear up and I think a lot of the -- there may be a falloff in the professional fees. It's -- we've had to deal with a number of challenges from different quarters. And that's just [indiscernible] the engagement of a lot of lawyers. We've also had to undertake some -- and get some other market research reports and surveys underway in order to, obviously, prepare the company for any challenges and to support our positions, which we are confident in. And those costs are all sort of incurring initially, which we don't think will necessarily be repeated. But it's very difficult to tell how long that will go on for -- I mean, we -- for example, we've engaged with many consultants to, obviously, consult with us on some of the litigious matters, but also to deal with the PR issues, and all of those costs and lobbies [ph] of things that we've not normally dealt within the past, and we believe that will settle out down, and then those costs will settle down a little more than they have been in the first quarter. But again, I just don't know.","Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And just a follow-up with the -- on the international losses. Could you repeat, I think there was $4.3 million in the last first quarter, what they were this one and why the change?","Rodney C. Sacks","I think it was $2.1 million for this quarter versus $4.3 million. And so, what has happened is that I think that sales have improved. Our costs per case have gone down. But because of the increased sales, you still had a small loss. But the results are improving, and the losses are improving. As we go into the summer, we believe those results will continue to improve.","Operator","Our next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","First, just -- the comment about the April trend being up 5.7%. I know it's not appropriate to really look at 1-month data, but I know you're lapping a 39% comp with the Japan sales. So can you maybe give us a little bit color of that 5.7% U.S. versus international, and how much of the drag the pipeline fell last year when Japan had on that number?","Rodney C. Sacks","Well, Japan clearly had an effect on it because we were selling into Japan prior to our launch there. So that is the one -- clearly, the one issue, Judy, which you, obviously, have alluded to. In the quarter, all I would like to really say is that the North American numbers are up in that -- in the month compared to the quarter, and the European numbers were slightly down in that month compared to the quarter. And I think that, that was a -- we think that, that is an anomaly in the European numbers. We think they will improve again and pick up in May. But there has been an improving trend in North America in the month.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And that was the -- can you quantify if that's more representative of what we're seeing in the Nielsen data?","Rodney C. Sacks","I'm not keen to go more in detail. I just don't have an exact amount available to you right now. But it is closer to the Nielsen data, I think.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. And then, just -- you've talked about some of the weakness in Canada and Mexico. I mean, they're obviously profitable margins for you within the international markets. So can you talk about what's going on in those markets? And then, if you think about the international margin progression for the rest of the year, just the weakness in Canada and Mexico...","Rodney C. Sacks","Let me just refer to Canada. Canada, towards the end of the quarter -- and in the numbers that I referred to in the Nielsen's, part of that weakness, we believe, is due to the fact that, last year, we introduced and launched Rehab in the same period. So you -- again, you're citing off a period or a comparable period where we had an introduction, and we didn't have any comparable introductory products in Canada in that -- in this year's comparable period. In the case of Mexico, again, a short period is quite affected by the OXXO chain. The OXXO chain comprised a very big proportion of the total market and, again, depending on who is in promotion in [ph] OXXO has quite a material impact. If you looked at the number that we had for the month previously for Mexico, I think we were ahead of Red Bull. And then you look at this month, we are behind Red Bull. And in other words -- and very largely, if not all, but largely attributable to the fact that we were on promotion, I think, earlier in the year in OXXO and in sort of March, April, Red Bull were on promotion. I think March, Red Bull were on promotion. So that affects the numbers quite dramatically in Mexico. So that really accounts for a lot of the detail. So although Canada was down, Mexico has -- is up. There's also has been some price challenge in pricing from Rockstar in -- particularly in Canada where they're being quite aggressive, they've come off their pricing but there has been some pricing challenges in Canada.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, lastly, just Brazil, can you quantify how much of sales went through Brazil in the first quarter? And then, maybe if you can you broadly talk about what you're seeing with your partnership with Ambev, how much of the improvement do you expect to see as you continue....","Rodney C. Sacks","You've got less than 5 weeks of sales within the quarter under the Ambev stewardship. But what we are seeing is that we're getting -- it's a large organization. We're getting a large sales force behind the brand. We're getting substantial, additional new listings every week. And so, we are seeing it in that way. We're seeing the momentum, and we're seeing it's sort of coming. And so, we are very positive about it. But the actual effect in the quarter was not that much, it's only 5 weeks of sales. Try -- the sales initially trending before we switched. There's a part, I don't know, we're lower than last year and then there was pickup once we switched, and we ended up with about -- just under $1 million in additional sales. But again, it's not an easy comparison because we did -- we were trending lower, and we went through a difficult period once we were actually undergoing the switch off to when we announced the deal. But we're definitely seeing improved numbers of outlets selling and the actual volume going into Ambev from us. And that's continuing through April.","Operator","Our final question of the hour comes from Wendy Nicholson of Citi Research.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Two questions. First, just following up on the international profitability, can you give us a sense sort of directionally how big of a gap the gross margin for the international business is for the -- compared to the U.S. business? In other words, assuming the international business continues to outgrow the U.S., how is the gross margin pressure going to continue to be an ongoing impact?","Rodney C. Sacks","Yes, it will be. We think if the margins are closer to the 40% level, where the North American margins are north of 50%. So there is a differential.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then, just second question, with the sort of prolonged potential slowdown in the category -- I know part of what's driven the category growth over the last few years has been increased sort of a linear shelf space at a lot of convenience stores and other retailers in the U.S. Do you see any of the stores talking about now going the other way and taking shelf space away from the energy drink category and giving it back to other sectors of the LRB market, or is that static at this point?","Rodney C. Sacks","We don't see that. We see this category as still being profitable for retailers. We still see better growth in this category than in the other -- in other categories with better margins and better dollar rings -- substantially, better dollar rings per SKU. So we see no reason for retailers to restrict the space. On the contrary, we think that, in fact, space is continuing to expand. If you want, for example, to go look at the space being allocated last year and this year and going forward at -- like Wal-Mart, which is pretty much the biggest retailer in the country, you will see that they're allocating, we believe, more space to energy, and we believe that will continue. We believe there has been a dampening of the category due to all of the media and publicity. But we think that, that is the major factor that has been affecting the category. We believe that, that will eventually start becoming, and indeed we are starting to see less and less impact of that, as consumers just continue to see the same stories being repeated over and over in different ways but without really having any real substance to them, and we believe that eventually, that we'll be able to overcome that and that the growth will resume. But it has taken a toll in the meantime.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","But is it fair to say that, in the near term, your promotional spend are going to be -- I see it's gone up a fair bit in the first quarter. But is it fair to assume that you'll continue to spend more not only because of Red Bull being a little bit more competitive, but to offset some of those, sort of, whatever PR headwinds that you're facing?","Rodney C. Sacks","I don't think so. I think the -- those sort of headwinds are headwinds. I don't think that's going to change the way we spend. I think that, just on the spending side, we're obviously going to look at our spending. Our spending -- increase in spending as a proportion of CMAs [ph] and allowances is very much in line with last year. We think we're going to continue within that range. Where we did have additional spending is in the marketing and size. Obviously, we anticipated -- we felt that our increase would be higher than in fact, it has been -- come through in the first quarter. So we're going to look at where we can, obviously, address this upfront and balance our expenses a little more carefully. But other than that, I don't think we're going to change the way we're doing business. We think that it is a near-term headwind. And we think that it will ultimately settle down and normalize again. And when it normalizes, we believe we will be able to see additional growth resume. But obviously, we are looking to try and manage our expense lines a little better and to try to improve our bottom line going forward.","Operator","And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Sacks for any closing remarks.","Rodney C. Sacks","Thank you. On behalf of Monster, I would like to thank everyone for their continued support for the company.

More than 13 billion Monster Energy drinks have been sold and safely consumed around the world over the past 13 years. In August 2014, Monster Beverage and The Coca-Cola Company entered into definitive agreements for a long-term strategic partnership that we believe will accelerate growth for Monster in the global Energy Drink category. Under the agreements, The Coca-Cola Company will acquire an approximate 16.7% ownership interest in Monster, following the issuance of shares to The Coca-Cola Company and will transfer ownership with worldwide energy business to Monster, which in turn will transfer its nonenergy business to The Coca-Cola Company.","Monster and The Coca-Cola Company will amend their current distribution coordination agreements to expand distribution with Coca-Cola Bottlers into additional territories.

We are actively engaged in preparations for the implementation of the contemplated arrangements. The waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 with respect to the transactions expired on October 15 2014, and in addition, all necessary approvals and consents from foreign antitrust authorities have been obtained.","In accordance with this existing agreements with applicable third-party distributors, on February 9, 2015, the company sent notices of termination to certain affected third-party distributors in the U.S. providing for the termination of their respective distribution agreements to be effective at various dates beginning in March 2015. The associated distribution rights are expected to be transitioned to Coca-Cola's distribution network in each applicable territory as of the effective date of the termination of the applicable third-party's rights in such territory.","We've also commenced negotiations with certain international Coca-Cola Bottlers with a view to transitioning distribution rights from Monster to such bottlers. The closing of the transactions is still subject to customary closing conditions, but is expected to close in the second quarter of 2015. We're excited by the addition of The Coca-Cola Company energy brands to our Monster portfolio, which will provide us with complementary product offerings in many countries, access to new geographies as well as access to new channels, including vending and specialty accounts. As previously communicated, we plan to review all options available after the transaction closes, and we receive the funds due to the company in terms of the agreements to return a substantial amount of cash to our shareholders.","Turning to the fourth quarter results. Throughout the fourth quarter and continuing into the 2015, the beverage industry, in general, has continued to show weakness. However, sales in the Energy Drink category appear to have accelerated, particularly in the U.S. towards the end of 2014 and into 2015.","In the fourth quarter, the company achieved record gross sales of $696.3 million, up 12.1% from $621.1 million. Net sales were $605.6 million, up 12% from $540.8 million. Our Original Monster Green energy drink continued to perform well and grew well in excess of the growth of the category in the United States as a whole during the fourth quarter. Sales of Zero Ultra also continued to show good growth in the United States during the fourth quarter. Zero Ultra has become our second best selling item. At the end of the third quarter, we launched Ultra Sunrise, which was well received by retailers as well as consumers, and quickly became one of our top-performing SKUs.","Sales of Java Monster also grew in the quarter. During 2014, we redesigned the graphics for our juice-based M-80 and Chaos energy drinks. Those products have been repositioned as our Juice Monster line. M-80 was renamed RIPPER, and the juice content was lowered, which has improved their drinkability. Sales of these products have showed healthy increases since this exercise was completed. Sales of our repositioned Punch Monster line have also increased.","Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was up 3.6 percentage points to 54.8% from 51.2% in the fourth quarter of last year. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to price increases on our 24-ounce Monster Energy brand energy drinks and our Peace Tea line, changes in product sales mix, lower cost of certain sweetness and other raw material as well as an increase in production efficiencies. Operating income was up 43.2% to $192.9 million from $134.8 million in the 2013 comparable quarter.","During the fourth quarter, our operating income was positively affected by the operating income contributed by international operations, particularly Europe and Japan, as compared to an operating loss from these operations in the fourth quarter of 2013. In fact, our operations outside of North America delivered operating income of $13.8 million in the 2014 fourth quarter as compared to an operating loss of $4.4 million in the same quarter in 2013.","Consolidated selling expenses in dollars were lower in the quarter than last year. While sponsorship expenses were marginally higher than last year in dollars, in the quarter, they were lower as a percentage of net sales. Results for the 2014 fourth quarter continued to be impacted by expenses related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sales of the company's Monster Energy brand energy drinks. Such expenses were $2.9 million in the 2014 fourth quarter compared with $4.7 million in the -- for the 2013 fourth quarter. Foreign currency losses during the fourth quarter decreased, primarily due to our foreign currency transactions in Japan and South Africa.","Our effective tax rate decreased from 42.2% to 34.7%, in the fourth quarter, primarily due to profits earned in certain foreign subsidiaries that have no related tax expense as a result of the prior establishment of valuation allowances on their respective deferred tax assets.","Net income was $125.3 million, up 64.7% over net income of $76.1 million earned during the fourth quarter of last year. Diluted earnings per share increased 63.2% to $0.72 from $0.44 in the 2013 comparable quarter.","Turning to the full year results. The company achieved record growth sales of $2.8 billion for the 2014 full year, up 9.3% from $2.6 billion in 2013. Net sales were $2.5 billion, up 9.7% from $2.2 billion. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 54.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014 from 52.2% for the year ended 2013. Operating income was up 30.5% to $747.5 million from $572.9 million in 2013. Our operations outside of North America delivered operating income of $37.8 million for the 2014 full year as compared to an operating loss of $13.4 million in the same period the previous year.","In the full year, expenses related to regulatory and litigation concerning our Monster Energy drinks were $20.6 million as compared to $17.9 million in 2013. Our effective tax rate decreased from 39.9% in 2013 to 35.2% for the full 2014 year. Net income was $483.2 million, up 42.7% of a net income of $338.7 million in 2013, and diluted earnings per share increased 41.9% to $2.77 from $1.95 in 2013.","According to the Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through January 24, 2015, all outlets combined, namely, convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the Energy Drink category, including Shots, increased by 7.1% versus the same period a year ago.

Coke's market share represented by Burn and Gladiator together decreased 3.4 points to 6.1%.","The Nielsen statistics for Mexico covers single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and\/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.","According to Nielsen in the 13-week period ended January 2015, the actual 13-week periods vary by a few weeks between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 10.5% to 12.8% in Great Britain, and from 17.4% to 18.3% in France.

According to IRI, Monster's market share increased for the 13 weeks through December 28, 2014 from 24.5% to 29.2% increase. I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country to country.","According to Nielsen for the month of January 2015, in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased to 14.4% as compared to 9.4% last year, and in Brazil, Monster's market share for the month of January grew from 4.6% to 5.2% as compared to the same period last year. According to INTAGE which provides tracking and market statistics in Japan, for the month of January 2015, in the convenience store channel in Japan, Monster's market share grew from 29% to 32.6%.

Net sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in the fourth quarter of 2014 in dollars were 17.5% higher than in the same period last year. Monster is continuing to gain momentum and increase market share in Europe. In particular, in Great Britain, Germany, The Netherlands and Greece, Monster achieved sales gains and continue to increase its market share.","Overall, our Western European and Africa divisions are now operating well, and we have made good strides in achieving increased distribution levels and in-store execution. We are continuing to see the benefits of the strategic changes implemented at the end of 2013 and into 2014. Our EMEA division traded profitably during both the third and fourth quarters of 2014, which contributed to the reduction in effective tax rate of the company. Net sales in Asia-Pacific grew 11.1% versus the comparable quarter last year, while net sales in South America decreased 17.1% over the comparable 2013 fourth quarter, mainly due to foreign exchange differences and competitive price adjustment in Chile to offset an indirect tax and issues with our Columbian distributor. Japan contributed a meaningful operating profit as sales there continued to increase.","We are continuing with our expansion strategy in international markets, although we decided to defer proposed launches in certain countries for the future following the strategic partnership that was entered into with The Coca-Cola Company during the third quarter. We are continuing with our strategy to secure local production in certain of our international markets in order to improve gross margins, reduce rates, reduce damages and assist in mitigating the effects of exchange rate fluctuations. We are planning to produce Monster in India shortly. Distribution expenses on a consolidated basis as a percentage of net sales in the fourth quarter were 4.1% versus 4.5% in the comparable quarter in 2013. Other selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 9.3% in the quarter versus 10.8% in the comparable period in 2013. While sponsorships and endorsement costs were marginally higher in dollars, they were lower as a percentage of net sales. TDM MAT program costs were lower during the quarter, both in dollars and as a percentage of net sales.","General and administrative expenses decreased 3.3%, although payroll costs were slightly higher, including general and administrative costs in the quarter was $1.2 million related to The Coca-Cola transaction. We are continuing to work towards reducing our overall operating costs in our international markets. During the 2014 fourth quarter, no share repurchases were made under the board-authorized share repurchase program.","Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $370.3 million compared to $211.3 million at December 31, 2013. Short-term investments were $781.1 million compared to $402.2 million at December 31, 2013. Long-term investments increased from $9.8 million to $42.9 million at December 31, 2014. Included in short-term investments are auction rate securities of $3.9 million. Days outstanding for account receivables were 36.4 days at December 31, 2014, and 40.1 days at December 31, 2013 as compared to 40.5 days at September 30, 2014. Inventories decreased to $174.6 million from $221.4 million at December 31, 2013. Average days of inventory was 57.4 days at December 31, 2014, which was lower than the 75.6 days of inventory at December 31, 2013 and lower than the 62.9 days at September 30, 2014.","As discussed on the last call, we are currently in the process of launching Monster Energy Ultra Citron and Monster Rehab Peach Tea +\u00a0Energy. Due to the strong response we received to our 2014 summer promotion of the Monster Energy Valentino Rossi drink in Europe and South Africa, we have converted that item into a permanent SKU in existing countries, in which it is being sold and are planning to launch it in additional European countries in 2015.","Gross sales in January 2015, were 11.2% higher than in January 2014. We caution again that sales in the single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall and the timing of promotions in retail stores, and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period.","In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points North American international gross margins are healthy. Our 2014 fourth quarter gross margins in North America as well as internationally, generally were higher than in the comparable quarter in 2013. U.S. Nielsen market statistics show the Energy category continues to grow and that Monster Energy's growth is still outpacing the growth of the category as a whole. The new additions to the Monster family that were introduced during 2014 are gaining market share and contributing positively to the overall increase in the company's sales.","Our repositioned Punch Monster and Juice Monster lines were positively received by distributors and consumers during 2014 and both distribution and sales of those lines are improving. We believe that Monster Unleaded and Ultra Sunrise lines will continue to increase their contribution to sales throughout 2015.","Turning to international markets. We are pleased with the performance of our international expansion, particularly in Japan, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, The Netherlands and Chile.","I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and year. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just trying to understand some of the drivers on the top line and sustainability, I think you alluded to at the Analyst Day that lower gas prices were having a benefit, but didn't know if there was seeing that accelerate as we move through the quarter and into this quarter, are if there's anything else? And then also on the Coke partnership now that you've sent out the termination letters, can you kind of give us an idea around the world, are you largely going with a Coke by network, are there some exceptions. Is it 80-20? Just trying to get an idea about that?","Rodney C. Sacks","Just to deal with the gas prices. I don't think there's been a change since we really discussed it last time. And in fact, you're seeing a little bit of an increase in gas prices. For us -- to say anything more, just be speculative. With regard to the transition, I think it's premature for us at this stage to go -- I think that all would be to ready to say that we have sent out notices to probably the majority, of the AB distributors in the U.S., it's not to all the distributors. We are still negotiating with a number of international distributors and I just think at this point, it would be sensitive and premature to go into more detail on that. But obviously, the idea as we've indicated, in general, when there will be exceptions, will be to move to the Coke system.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Faucher with JPMorgan.","Brian Doyle - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Quick question. If you can give us an idea, I guess, 2 questions. If you can give us an idea in terms of the impact of FX on the international numbers in the fourth quarter, and then it seems as though FX is probably fully baked in the January numbers. So it would seem as though that the underlying growth actually probably accelerated a little bit if you exclude FX, so can you give us a little bit of an idea in terms of how the FX is impacting the top line numbers? And then can you talk a little bit about the change in the international profitability levels, how much of that is coming from, let's say more local production versus how much is coming from the more efficient spending that you guys have talked about over the last 12 months internationally?","Rodney C. Sacks","I think that the earnings change, impact has probably been -- overall probably being about a percent or a little less. We think that again, it's probably going to be of that order going in the first quarter. But again, we're not sure. I just -- I think that at this point, we should speculate on the first quarter going forward, more on that. So your second question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Amit Sharma with BMO Capital.","Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Quick question on operating leverage. We saw a pretty solid operating leverage, favorable leverage here. Can you talk about what's driving that and as you absorb some of Coca-Cola's Energy brand, should we expect that to accelerate even more from this level?","Rodney C. Sacks","I didn't hear the last part, did we expect?","Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets Canada","As you absorb Coca-Cola's Energy brands, are you expect it to be even higher from our operating leverage perspective? And then a tax rate question as well. As you grow profitability in the international market, should we continue to expect tax rate to come down?","Hilton H. Schlosberg","So the acquisition of the Coca-Cola brand will be a concentrated model. So it'll be very different to the finished goods model that the company operates at this time. And the Coca-Cola brand that coming into the company will be shown as a separate segment in our financials. So when you talk about operating leverage, the basis of the structure of the income statement will be very different between the 2 entities, because in one case, we sell the finished goods. And in the other case, Coke sells a concentrate, which we'll continue selling the concentrate.","Operator","Our next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I think John's question was really more my question, which is really related to the international profitability ramp up that you've seen in the last few quarters. Is there way you can give us a little bit color on how much of that is coming from the local production versus some of the selling expense leverage that you're seeing from the investments that you've made and the scale that you're getting in those markets? And then my second question is specific to Asia. I think your sales were up 11.4%. You talked about positive performance in Japan. It is a slowdown from the last quarter, where I think you had 70% plus growth. So a little bit more color just in terms of specifically to Asia was FX a big impact. What are you seeing in terms of the underlying performance in Japan and any other major markets in Asia that you're seeing some traction?","Rodney C. Sacks","I think that the improved profitability is coming from both, and I don't think -- we don't have the breakup available to provide to you at this point, Judy. With regard to Asia, the results in Japan continued to do well. We did have some slowdown in some of the other countries. In the last quarter, Australia was lower, and that offset the increase somewhat. Just to add a little bit of color, Judy, on your first question. Remember that in Europe, improvement in operating performance there is -- there has been no change because we have been producing locally for some time. So it's only in Japan that we have recommenced production that has obviously impacted positively the numbers in Japan.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Kevin M. Grundy - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","So 2 quick ones for me. The acceleration in the category that we're seeing in the U.S., can you kind of point to what you think, other than lower oil prices, might be driving some of the balance that we see in the category? And then second unrelated question. Cash investments is building on the balance sheet. You guys haven't bought back stock recently, but I guess, that's sort of the expectation once the Coke deal closes. Can you talk about your decision not to buyback stock and what we should expect?","Rodney C. Sacks","I think that the acceleration is really -- there is a slightly improved feeling generally in the U.S. and petrol prices are down, the gas prices are down. But other than that, we've just seen that, that bounce back and as we've indicated, it doesn't seem to be followed through in all categories of beverages.","Hilton H. Schlosberg","On the second point, Kevin. We with the inflow of funds from the Coca-Cola transaction, the board is examining or will be examining various ways to return that cash to stockholders. And we've been pretty consistent about that for some time since the deal was announced.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","I wanted to ask about the disruption in the business from a transition of distribution standpoint. So you sent out the letters earlier this month, so it's been a few weeks since then. So I'm curious what you're -- or what the reaction has been in terms of in-stock out-of-stock that sort of thing? And then broadly before that, obviously, a lot of the distributors knew it was coming. And so could you talk about whether there was any impact in the December, quarter month of January, has it accelerated, as speculation has mounted in sort of not just what the impact has been, but how do you maintain the focus here as you go into end of March on a transition?","Rodney C. Sacks","We took steps at the offset to communicate with the AB Distributors, and gave them certain assurances regarding inventory purchases that we would repurchase, they wouldn't get stuck with inventory. Also, you will appreciate that their are severance fee is dependent on their sales in the 12 months, immediately preceding the termination. So it is in their interest, obviously, to continue increasing their sales out in order to maximizing their own severance payments, and we felt that by giving them the assurance that we would pick up all or buyback all several inventories that there was no reason for them to start trying to rationalize their inventory or try and cut down and only focus on the main SKUs and not carry the supporting brands. And we've had -- we think we had a good effect. This correspondence had a good effect. And we've really not experienced any noticeable disruption from the AB Distributors as compared to our other distributors. I think that continued to perform nicely, you can see that from the results and we are not seeing any despair or differences between the AB Distributors on the one side and Coke distributors or some of the independence on the other side. The trend that we had from these distributors before the notice has continued into the fourth quarter and continued even in the first couple of 2 months of this year. So we aren't seeing that, we are being able to manage that reasonably comfortably. Going forward, obviously, we will see how that goes. We're hoping that by giving the AB Distributors quite a lot of notice, being able to manage these inventory issues and pick up issues, will enable us to also make sure inventory is in place at the Coke plants and at the Coke branches so that when the change over occurs, they will be ready to go with the inventory as well. So we obviously are trying to minimize the disruption that will occur at that point in time. And it will occur slightly, at a slightly different dates, it's not -- the lot of principal dates are probably closer to the early April, there are dates that take place at different times.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Hilton, can I just ask one follow-up? You said that the board is going to make a determination, about what to do with the cash at some point in time. Is that going to be before or after you have 2 Coke appointees on the board?","Hilton H. Schlosberg","Well, the board can't make a decision, I would believe, until the cash comes into the company. So we have to wait for the close to make a final decision, a final determination. And I imagine that the 2 Coke appointees will be part of that decision. The board's been considering it and continues to do so.","Operator","Our next question comes from Caroline Levy with CLSA.","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Limited, Research Division","A couple of questions. The fourth quarter profits in the United States were bigger than the third quarter for the first time I've ever seen. And I'm just wondering if there was any sort of overshipment of anticipation of any other change over that happened at that point? Or, in fact, you had the acceleration in growth rate in the fourth quarter and if you look at 11% in January, that's actually a slight deceleration. So was there anything going on in the fourth quarter that inflated U.S. profits?","Hilton H. Schlosberg","Just lower expenses. There were no, there were absolutely -- there's no issue with product in any quarter not been related to that quarter.","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Limited, Research Division","And would the -- is the lower profit, there wasn't anything onetime -- I'm sorry, the lower expense, there's nothing onetime about that, that we're going to have to lack next year?","Rodney C. Sacks","I'm just looking right now.","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Limited, Research Division","And then while you're looking, if I might just ask, when you -- when Coke's deal is finished, and you look at territories where you already have full distribution, like CCE or the U.S. where you are fully distributed, but now you'll be a Coke brand and a Coke system, do you anticipate an acceleration of growth just as a result of the whole system being firmly behind you? Are there opportunities for an acceleration and growth from that?","Hilton H. Schlosberg","We've been consistent, we've actually said there would be.","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Can you tell us how?","Rodney C. Sacks","Well, we think that there is an alignment, there's an alignment with them on their own brands in each country now as we go forward. There is a -- a longer term, I think commitment where we will be -- our brands, and we as a company, I think will be viewed as part of the group and as part of the longer term, the brands are also will be viewed as more. As part of the longer-term plans. I think outside of the system, I think even the bottlers and distributors have a much shorter horizon for -- vision for the brands. And so I think, they restrict some of their capital investments and efforts, because they just have a different attitude to the brand. We think that we will have a for -- mal focus on cooler programs and vending on those are the things and some of the specialty accounts where they go into key accounts, we will be part of that now those were things that we really didn't ever really participate in before.","Hilton H. Schlosberg","And I think one of the big things as well, if I may just add one comment to what Rodney said, which is correct, was the fact that we now control their inventory brand. I think will enable us to prevent a certain degree of duplication, a certain degree of possible retaliation from one brand to the other. So we'll be able to manage those brands as a system. And then, Karen, I looked at your -- we quickly did a review, Tom and I, and I can't see anything that particularly hits as a one-off issue in the quarter. There seemed to be numbers that really pretty consistent there. Obviously, the only thing that comes up from time-to-time but there's nothing material that I could even put my finger on.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the call back to Rodney Sacks for any closing remarks.","Rodney C. Sacks","On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continue to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad. We are particularly excited by the new opportunities that we have going forward with a robust portfolio of energy drink products comprised of our Monster Energy drink line, together with The Coca-Cola Company's Energy brands, and in particular, NOS, which grew its sales and market share in the United States in 2014. We believe that our agreement with The Coca-Cola Company will enable us to focus on our core energy business, while leveraging the strength of The Coca-Cola Company's powerful distribution and bottling system on a worldwide scale.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call will be recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead.","Rodney C. Sacks","Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, is with me today; as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance.","Before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends.","Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call.","Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed March 2, 2015, including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements, for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated May 7, 2015. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section.","As previously disclosed, in August 2014, Monster Beverage Corporation and The Coca-Cola Company entered into definitive agreements for a long-term strategic partnership that we believe will accelerate growth for Monster in the global Energy Drink category.","Under the agreements, The Coca-Cola Company will acquire an approximate 16.7% ownership interest in Monster, following the issuance of shares to The Coca-Cola Company, and will transfer ownership of its worldwide Energy business to Monster, which, in turn, will transfer its non-Energy business to The Coca-Cola Company. The Coca-Cola Company and its bottlers will become Monster's preferred distribution partner globally, and Monster will become The Coca-Cola Company's exclusive energy play. We believe that this partnership will strategically align both companies for the long term by combining the strength of The Coca-Cola Company's worldwide bottling system with Monster's dedicated focus and expertise as a leading energy player globally.","We are actively engaged both in preparations for and the implementation of the contemplated arrangements. As previously reported, all necessary approvals and consents from the relevant antitrust authorities around the world have been obtained. In anticipation of the closing of the transactions, to date, Monster has transitioned approximately 84% of its targeted distribution rights in the U.S. to The Coca-Cola Company and its bottling partners, and an additional 5% will be transitioned during May 2015.","Thus far, such transitions were accomplished with only minor interruptions, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the many persons involved in the transition, both on Monster's and Coke's respective teams.","We've also commenced negotiations with certain international Coca-Cola Bottlers with a view to transitioning distribution rights for Monster Energy to such Bottlers after the closing. While the closing of the transactions is subject to customary closing conditions, we anticipate closing the transactions early in June 2015.","We are excited by the addition of The Coca-Cola Company Energy brands to our Monster Energy portfolio, which will provide us with complementary product offerings in many countries, access to new geographies as well as access to new channels, including vending and specialty accounts. As previously communicated, we plan to review all options available after the transactions close and we receive the funds due to the company in terms of the agreements to return cash to our shareholders.","Turning to the first quarter results. We believe that the first quarter of 2015 was negatively impacted domestically by events relating to the closing of the transactions and the transitioning of our brands in the U.S. from existing distributors to The Coca-Cola Company and its bottling partners, as well as internationally, due to the uncertainty inherent in the anticipated closing of the transactions.","At this time, we cannot quantify what impact the transactions, including the transitions, will have on our second quarter.","In addition to our GAAP condensed consolidated statement of income and other information and our GAAP condensed consolidated balance sheet for the company for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, attached to our press release is a non-GAAP adjusted condensed consolidated statement of income and other information adjusting for certain of the selected items discussed in the press release impacting profitability, which we believe should be considered in assessing our performance in the quarter. We believe that it would be helpful to shareholders on this call to address our results on an adjusted basis after giving effect to such items in addition to and not in lieu of our GAAP results.","Excluding the acceleration of deferred revenue of $39.8 million, gross sales for the 2015 first quarter were $670.4 million, an increase of 9.2% over gross sales in the comparable first quarter of 2014.","Net sales in the 2015 first quarter, as reported, was $626.8 million. Excluding the acceleration of deferred revenue, net sales for the 2015 first quarter were $587 million, 9.5% higher than net sales of $536.1 million in the same period last year.","Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of approximately $15 million on gross sales and approximately $12 million on net sales.","After adjustment for the acceleration of deferred revenue, gross profit as a percentage of net sales were 56.1% as compared to 53.5% for the comparable 2014 first quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to changes in product sales mix, lower cost of certain sweeteners and other raw materials as well as an increase in production efficiencies.","Excluding distributed termination costs of $206 million, operating expenses for the 2015 first quarter were $155.3 million as compared to $138.0 million in same quarter last year. Excluding both the acceleration of deferred revenue and distributed termination costs, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the 2015 first quarter were 26.5% as compared to 25.7% in the same quarter last year. We are continuing to work towards reducing our overall operating costs in our international markets.","Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales, excluding acceleration of deferred revenue, were 4.4% for the 2015 first quarter compared to 4.7% in the same quarter last year. Excluding acceleration of deferred revenue, selling expenses, although higher in dollars, as a percentage of net sales, were 10.6% compared to 10.7% in the same quarter a year ago. The increase in selling expenses was primarily due to a $3.7 million increase in cost of premiums and a $3.7 million increase in sponsorships. TDM and MAT program costs were lower during the quarter.","General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales for the 2015 first quarter, excluding the acceleration of deferred revenues and distributed termination costs of $206 million, were 11.4% as compared to 10.3% for the corresponding quarter last year.","Operating income after adjustment for acceleration of deferred revenue and distributed termination costs would have been 16.8% higher at $173.8 million as compared to $148.9 million in the same period last year.","Excluding the acceleration of deferred revenue and distributed termination costs on a tax effective basis, net income would have increased by 13.9% to $108.5 million from $95.3 million in the same quarter last year.","Excluding acceleration deferred revenue as well as distributed termination cost, the effective tax rate for the 2015 first quarter would have been approximately 38.1%. The effective tax rate for the 2015 first quarter adjusted for the previously discussed items was higher than in the comparable quarter last year primarily due to a decrease in the company's domestic production deduction due to the exercise of certain stock options.","Excluding acceleration of deferred revenue as well as distributed termination costs on a tax effective basis, earnings would have increased to $0.62 per diluted share, 13.8% higher than $0.55 per diluted share earned in the comparable quarter in 2014.","Results for the 2015 first quarter continue to be impacted by expenses related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sales of the company's Monster Energy brand Energy Drinks. Such expenses were $4.9 million in the first quarter of 2015.","Stock-based compensation, which is a noncash item, was $6.4 million for the first quarter of 2015 compared to $7 million for the same quarter last year.","Professional services and other transactional costs related to the Coca-Cola transaction was $3.6 million. Also, additional payroll taxes of $7.2 million were incurred following the exercise of certain stock options.","If in addition to making the adjustments discussed earlier, professional service costs relating to the Coca-Cola transaction and the additional payroll taxes are excluded from operating costs, operating income would have been $184.6 million, 24% higher than operating income earned in the first quarter of 2014. On that same basis, net income on a tax effective basis would have been $115.2 million or 21% higher than net income for the first quarter of 2014, while earnings per diluted share would have been $0.66 per diluted share, 20.9% higher than earnings per diluted share of $0.55 for the same quarter in 2014.","The effective regulatory-related expenses on earnings per share is approximately $0.02 per diluted share in the quarter. Note also, there was a foreign exchange impact of net sales of approximately $12 million.","Gross sales to customers outside of the United States were $141 million in the 2015 first quarter compared to $144.3 million in the corresponding quarter in 2014. Net sales to customers outside the United States were $113 million in the 2015 first quarter compared to $115.8 million in the corresponding quarter in 2014.","As stated earlier, gross sales and net sales to customers outside the United States were higher in local currencies by approximately $15 million and $12 million, respectively. Included in geographic sales reported are our sales for the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transhipped to the military and their customers overseas.","According to Nielsen report, for the 13 weeks through April 25, 2015, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the Energy Drink category, including Shots, increased by 9.7% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 9% in the 13-week period, while sales of Red Bull increased 13.7%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 8.8%; sales of 5-Hour increased by 0.4%; and AMP decreased 12.2%. Sales of NOS increased 28.3%; and sales of Full Throttle increased 4.3%.","According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended April 25, 2015, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, increased 10.3% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 7.3% over the same period last year, while sales of Red Bull increased by 16.5%. NOS was up 21.8%; Rockstar was up 13.2%; 5-Hour was up 1.3%; and AMP was down 17%.","We do want to point out that increased processing as well as the trading-up of SKUs of their flavor extensions by Red Bull to 12-ounce had the effect of increasing revenues per unit sold for Red Bull. We have assessed the increase in Red Bull processing that has took effect earlier this year, and we will be taking up processing of our products later this year.","According to Nielsen, in the 5 weeks ended April 25, 2015, Monster's market share of Energy Drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, decreased by 1.0 points over the same period last year to 34.4% against Red Bull's share, which increased 1.9 points to 36.6%. Rockstar's share was up point -- 0.2 points at 7.2%; 5-Hour's share was lower at 8.5%, while NOS' was higher at 3.9%.","According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended April 25, 2015, sales of Energy + Coffee Drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 11.8% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 8.5% higher than the same period last year, while Starbucks Doubleshot Energy was 17.1% higher.","According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended April 4, 2015, the Energy Drink category increased 3%. Monster sales were down 5% versus a year ago. I just want to point out that we are cycling on a lot of innovation that we introduced the first quarter last year.","Our market share decreased 2.2 points to 26.1% over the same period last year. Red Bull sales increased 4%, and its market share increased 0.4 points to 37.5%. Rockstar's sales increased 26%, and its market share increased to 2.5 points to 13.7%.","Another note is that it's just timing of promotions. We will be embarking on quite an extensive promotional campaign during the second trimester. Some of our competitors' promotions this year were slotted in the first trimester.","According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the Energy Drink category grew 17.2% in the month of March 2015. Monster sales decreased 2.5%. Our market share decreased 6.5 points to 32.1% against the comparable period last year. Red Bull sales decreased 9.5%, and its market share decreased by 5.9 points to 20%. Vive 100's market share increased 11.6 points to 20.9%, while Boost's market share decreased 2.2 points to 14.3%. Coke's market share represented by Burn and Gladiator together increased 0.6 points to 7.7%.","Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more Energy Drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.","According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended March 2015, the actual 13-week periods vary by few weeks between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 10.1% to 12.1% in Great Britain; from 17.8% to 18.5% in France; from 8% to 10.7% in Germany; from 7.5% to 8.2% in Belgium. In the same period, Monster's value share grew from 7.8% to 9.2% in Sweden; from 5% to 5.6% in the Netherlands; and from 21.2% to 21.3% in Spain.","Monster's retail market share in value for the 13 weeks ended February 2015 as compared to the same period last year decreased from 19.3% to 17.3% in South Africa. According to IRI, Monster's market share increased for the 13 weeks to the end of March 2015 from 25.2% to 29.3% in Greece.","I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country to country.","According to Nielsen, for the month of March 2015 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased to 15.3% as compared to 9.4% last year. And in Brazil, Monster's market share for the month of March 2015, grew from 4.3% to 4.7% as compared to the same period last year.","According to INTAGE, which provides tracking and market statistics in Japan, for the month of March 2015 in the convenience store channel in Japan, Monster's market share grew from 28% to 33.8%.","Excluding the acceleration of deferred revenue and the distributed termination costs, net sales for the DSD segment increased 10% to $566 million, and contribution margin for the DSD segment increased 20.1% to $223.9 million from $186.5 million in the 2014 first quarter.","Net sales for our DSD segment were negatively impacted by approximately $12 million due to foreign currency movement. Net sales for the company's Warehouse segment decreased 3.6% to $21 million for the 3 months ended March 31, 2015, from $21.8 million for the same period in 2014. Contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was negative by $0.04 -- I'm sorry, by $4 million -- $0.04 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to $0.3 million in the first quarter positive of 2014.","Net sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa in the first quarter of 2015 in dollars were 2% lower than the same period last year. In local currencies, net sales in the region were 14.7% higher than in the same period last year.","Monster is continuing to gain momentum and increase market share in Europe, in particular, in Great Britain, Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Greece. Monster achieved sales gains and continue to increase its market share.","Overall, our Western European and African divisions are now operating well, and we have made good strides in achieving increased distribution levels and in-store execution. We are continuing to see the benefit of the strategic changes implemented at the end of 2013 and in 2014.","Our EMEA division traded profitably during the first quarter. The Monster Energy Valentino Rossi drink, which is now available in the majority of markets in Europe and South Africa, continues to perform well as a permanent SKU and was launched in 5 additional markets in the first quarter of 2015.","During the quarter, we also launched Mega Monster, a resealable 553 ml SKU of our original Monster Green Energy drink in a number of EMEA markets. Early indications show positive sales contribution from Mega Monster.","Net sales in Asia-Pacific decreased 9.5% in dollars but increased 1% in local currencies versus the comparable quarter last year. While net sales in South America decreased 15%, 6.2% in local currencies over the comparable period in 2014. Mainly due to foreign exchange differences, a competitor price adjustment in Chile to offset an indirect tax and issues with our Colombian distributor, sales also decreased in Brazil ahead of the anticipated closing of the Coca-Cola transactions although our market share in March increased for Nielsen.","In Japan, net sales increased 11% in local currency. Japan contributed meaningful operating profits in the first quarter of 2015. In Mexico, net sales increased 35% in dollars. Similarly, Mexico contributed meaningful operating profits in the first quarter of 2015.","We are continuing with our expansion strategy in international markets but have deferred proposed launches in certain countries in the -- for the future following the strategic partnership that we are entering into with The Coca-Cola Company. We will address the implementation of such deferred launches following the closing of the transactions. We are continuing with our strategy to secure local production in certain of our international markets in order to improve gross margins, reduce freight, reduce damages and assist in mitigating the effects of exchange rate fluctuations. We believe that our partnership with The Coca-Cola Company may result in additional local production opportunities for us and may accelerate our local production strategy.","Our original Monster Green Energy Drink continued to perform well and experienced good growth as did our entire Ultra product line. Unfortunately, we experienced a quality issue relating to the texture of our Muscle Monster product line. This issue has been addressed, and the line has been reformulated. We are refreshing the packaging of that line as well. As a result, however, sales at Muscle Monster during the quarter was substantially lower than the first quarter of last year and, obviously, negatively impacted our sales.","During the 2015 first quarter, no share purchases were made under the board-authorized share repurchase program. However, 20 -- I'm sorry, 2.2 million shares were purchased from employees during the quarter in lieu of cash payments for options exercised or withholding tax as due.","Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $362.8 million compared to $370.3 million at December 31, 2014. Short-term investments were $647.3 million compared to $781.1 million at December 31, 2014. Long-term investments decreased to $41.2 million from $42.9 million at December 31, 2014. Included in short- and long-term investments are auction rate securities of $3.9 million.","Days outstanding for accounts receivables were at 46.4 days at March 31, 2015, and 36.4 days at December 31, 2014, compared to 48.1 days at March 31, 2014. Inventories increased to $197.9 million from $174.6 million at December 31, 2014.","Average days of inventory was 69.1 days at March 31, 2015, which was higher than the 57.4 days of inventory at December 31, 2014, and lower than the 73.7 days at March 31, 2014.","We have now launched Ultra Citron, our fruity SKU in the Ultra product line and Rehab Peach Tea + Energy, which have been well received by consumers. Our repositioned juice and punch products continue to show healthy gains. We are planning to launch additional products later in 2015, but it is premature for us to discuss those products at this time.","We believe that the transitioning of a substantial majority of our targeted distribution rights in the U.S., effective April 6, 2015, orders by the Coca-Cola system to implement the transitions, the accounting for returns from terminated distributors, the timing of the transitions as well as uncertainty with our independent international distributors given the imminent implementation of the transaction, are among the factors that impacted our sales levels in March and April 2015. It is premature for us to finalize our April sales and to comment thereon at this time.","In conclusion, I'd like to summarize the recent positive points. North American and international gross margins are healthy. Our 2015 first quarter gross margins in North America as well as internationally generally were higher than in the comparable quarter in 2014. U.S. Nielsen market statistics show that the Energy category continues to grow. The new additions to the Monster family that were introduced during 2014 continue to gain market share and contribute positively to the overall increase in the company's sales.","Our repositioned Punch Monster and Juice Monster lines have been positively received by distributors and consumers, and both distribution and sales of those lines continue to improve. We believe that our Monster Unleaded, Ultra Sunrise and Ultra Citron lines as well as was Rehab Peach Tea + Energy will continue to increase their contribution to sales through 2015.","Turning to international markets. We are pleased with the performance of our international brand expansion, particularly in Japan, Great Britain, Germany, France, Sweden, Denmark, Greece and Chile. We believe that the Coca-Cola transition, particularly a successful transition, will afford us ongoing opportunities in 2015 and beyond.","I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So I guess just first in terms of the 84% of the volume that you've transitioned to the Coke distribution, just give us a little bit of kind of what you're seeing as you've transitioned. I know you called out some of the disruptions, but are you starting to see some changes in terms of what's happening on the shelves? And you've obviously highlighted the opportunity in the vending and specialty channels. Can we see those channels getting more traction more quickly? And then in international market, it sounds like the disruptions related to just the pending transition is perhaps a little bit more pronounced maybe than the U.S. markets. So can you verify if that is the appropriate reads that we should think about at this point? And are there any sort of any big markets? You're seeing a little bit more of the transition disruption in those international markets?","Rodney C. Sacks","Judy, with your second question first. I think you are correct in that assumption. I think international markets have just been a little more affected. I think there's just a little more skepticism amongst the distributors and anticipation of what the future will be and whether they will continue to be -- distribute the brand. And I think that has affected their investment in the brand, investment in securing distribution and sales and, in general approach, I think in attitude. With regard to the transition to the U.S., we think that the transition has gone relatively smoothly from a retailer point of view. There were a few disruptions, minor where retailers hadn't -- weren't able in time to make changes or the distributor to make changes, so that, in some cases, products being taken into stores were still being shown as being supplied by the previous vendors, so there were some issues. But generally, we thought that the transition went well. But again, a lot of that will only come through to us with time. We've heard of small -- a few instances, but obviously, we don't hear of everything, certainly not in the first few weeks of it taking place. So I think that even to really understand the issues and the opportunities, is going to take some months to pan out and be -- for us to be able to really make more sense of it. Just to comment on any doubtful things, I think would not be sensible and not accurate enough.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan from Stifel.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","The first question, the price increase, should we think about that as sort of in line with the mid-single-digit price increase that Red Bull took?","Rodney C. Sacks","I think it's probably going to be similar, yes. I just think that having seen how they've managed this and the effect and the response from the trade and consumers, we think that's probably what we are likely to do. We'll finalize the actual numbers a little later, but we'll do that. We're looking to try and do that early in the fall.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great. And then the tax rates, so should we expect also that to go back to where it was trending over the last year or so following this quarter? And then just one sort of broader question...","Rodney C. Sacks","Yes. It's hard for us to determine what the tax rate would be. But we -- there was a -- there was this factor. This was quite a large stock option exercise that might've -- there maybe some that flow through. But then eventually, on a longer-term basis, those will ameliorate quite substantially. That will affect the tax rate. And I think as we continue to settle down and grow international business, both for our own brand as well as the brand, the KO acquired brands, we think that the tax rate will be positively affected. But we -- at this point, we just -- there's too many uncertainties for us to try and point to exactly where that will end up. But we do think we will be able to make some headway in lowering the rate.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And then just lastly, how are you envisioning international distribution in terms of percent of volume in the Coke system and away from the Coke system? I know it's early, but just sort of how do you think about that?","Rodney C. Sacks","Again, I think that's been really difficult to give you an answer on because it's just taken time to get to meet the international bottlers around the world to assess their appetite, where we will be with them, what their appetite is for the brand. And there are also, obviously, economic issues and factors as to whether we are happy making the change, if -- based on margin requirements and cost requirements. So there are a number of factors, and we are working through those. But the U.S. was an easier transition in -- to do in mass clearly and was the main focus for us to get done. The other focuses, we've been -- to visit them, we've traveled around them, we're starting negotiations with them. But many of them are -- don't know Monster, don't know the system. And it's -- and each negotiation takes on its own course because of different factors that apply in each of these different countries. And this quite varies. There isn't a one formula fits all for the different countries. So that is taking a bit more time, and we're going to have to work our way through it. Obviously, we are looking at that as -- on a positive point of view, we would like to transition substantial amount of that distribution, but that will pan out later in the year over the next 3 to 6 months.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Kevin M. Grundy - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Question on G&A. So OpEx in the quarter was a little bit higher than we had modeled, and I understand there's some noise in there, regulatory professional services, et cetera. Should that normalize? I guess the thinking was you'd get better SG&A leverage, particularly with the top line pretty resilient. Should we be expecting G&A to sort of normalize for the balance of the year? And then with respect to FX, perhaps you could give us a little guidance there. I guess it was about a 2 point headwind in the top line. What are you expecting for the balance of the year?","Rodney C. Sacks","Just on the G&A, I think that the regulatory side will eventually go, but it is there. We're going to see that for a little while still until we resolve some of these -- the pending regulatory matters. With regard to the payroll taxes, again, we think that there may be 1 or 2 quarters, but that generally will also I think regulate -- might disappear and become much more normalized. One of the other costs that we -- or a couple of the other costs that I would just mention, that I did mention, the premiums was high this quarter. What happened was we took premiums into our books in the first quarter. A lot of it designed or earmarked for second quarter premiums. So there was a slight switch in when you're going to see the benefit of it, but is this the right -- we needed to account with an accordance with our policies. Also, in the -- in sponsorships, there was a -- there was an increase, which we think will level out over the year. What -- in certain types of sponsorships, we had allocated these sponsorships over the period of the actual events due to certain changes in the way we -- our contracts with the -- particular events. Now we are amortizing those more spread over the 12-month period. So that had a bit of an effect of increasing costs in the first quarter because a lot of the events start towards -- the annual events start towards the second quarter or earlier than that -- end of the first quarter. We also had an increase in -- we signed an agreement, a sort of major sponsorship with UFC this year, which had the effect of also increasing and coming into the first quarter. So those -- again, we think those will normalize somewhat and probably get us more in line with what we've been going in the future. What we don't know is how those effects will -- those will all be effective once we obviously bring in the KO brands with -- because the whole model for the KO brands will be a concentrate model. There'd be different cost criteria, and that may change things up a little bit.","Hilton H. Schlosberg","And one thing we didn't actually address is the professional services costs related to the Coca-Cola transaction. And of course, that should wind down when the transaction closes.","Rodney C. Sacks","Yes. Absolutely. And then ForEx, perhaps if you'd like to comment on, the floor is yours. Your thoughts on that, Hilton?","Hilton H. Schlosberg","Yes. ForEx, in the quarter, we commented that gross sales we believe were affected by about USD 15 million and the net sales by USD 12 million. And depending on what happens in the subsequent quarters, it's difficult to comment on what those numbers will look like going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Amit Sharma from EMO Capital Markets (sic) [BMO Capital Markets].","Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets Equity Research","Rodney, if we look like 12 to 18 months in the future and then you look at your international business, what are some of the key markets that you're focusing on? And as we look at the time line of getting traction in those markets, should we assume a normalized time line or a little bit accelerated now that you have a partner of large scale in some of those markets?","Rodney C. Sacks","Well, the major international markets that we sort of already are in the with large enough, and I'd say, major sort of Energy Drink markets are U.K. and Europe, Germany, where we're in now, Spain, so we are -- we're continuing to focus in those markets. Those markets won't -- obviously GB and Spain are with the same Coca-Cola Bottlers. We -- obviously, Germany isn't at the moment, and that will be a decision on -- if and when we change in Germany, which is likely and imminent. The opportunities also in the other big markets, which are sort of -- as a market but we don't know the size of the Energy category for probably premium. The market is very big for -- in Energy, for example, in China, which we've mentioned before, is a really big -- we think is a big future opportunity. But it's in a lower-priced product at the moment. And so whether the premium section and how, where we want to position our brand is still uncertain and we've not come to a final decision. But clearly, that is a market we're going to focus on. We do believe there's good opportunity to grow much more than we have in a market like Brazil, which is also a big market. Obviously Japan, we're doing nicely. And so we're going to try and focus on the larger markets where we're already there. And then obviously, newer markets, we will be -- we will go into, but it wouldn't be as much authority, probably other than China, which we do regard as a priority for us. And we are looking at that and taking steps to actively look at the market and ascertain when we can get into that market. So I think that we will see some benefits, but we just got to get more information and have more time to meet with all the bottlers. That's a pretty gigantic task when you look at -- there are a number of independent bottlers around the world in the Coke system. It's not a matter of getting together with a half a dozen of them. And we are working our way through them at the moment and making good progress. But each country has its own issues. And one of the things that complicate international, which we believe is important for the long term, is we are looking, as in many cases when we're talking to distribution, to the bottlers there, we are also talking to them about production, local production because we believe that will be important to reduce our costs. And then just important to also get them more aligned with us to be real partners and produce locally and -- as well as sell locally. So -- production has its own issues, and we need to deal with those things. That just adds complexity. But ultimately, we'll get there, and we believe it will be in the long-term benefit to do it this way.","Thomas J. Kelly","I mean, that was one of the reasons why we did this transaction was to be able to capitalize on the opportunities that Coca-Cola presents to us through international distribution.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Powers with UBS.","Stephen Powers - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I guess, maybe a follow-up on that just with regards to your progress moving to local production in overseas markets. We've talked a lot about it, and you just mentioned it there. I just was wondering if there's any update to your thinking just given the Coke deal is pending. I guess, specifically, are you now holding back on that transition anywhere where you instead anticipate a move to local production via the Coke system instead of your current...","Rodney C. Sacks","No. It's -- again, it's a mixed bag, and there are clearly more opportunities to get local production through the Coke bottlers that we have talked to and we anticipate talking to. In some countries, we were very advanced in discussions with independent Coke packers to actually pack our products. And in some cases, we need to and we will continue with those arrangements and implement them because a, it'll help secure local production on a -- at a quicker date because it does take some time to get a Coke-packing plant up to speed and to make certain equipment changes that might be necessary or was usually necessary in order to run our products. And in some case in countries, there may well be a need for backup or 2 production plants. So again, it depends on the country. It depends on the circumstances, but there is a really good appetite from the Coke bottlers who are enthusiastic about wanting to do production and -- which is very beneficial for us. So we are reviewing and running down dual policies in some countries where 2 -- the independent packers that we already started on, plus Coke packers, and then in other countries, just looking -- starting from a fresh with Coke -- with the Coke packers or Coke bottlers.","Operator","I'm showing no further questions in the queue. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Rodney Sacks for any closing remarks.","Rodney C. Sacks","Thank you. On behalf of Monster, I would like to thank everyone for their continued interest in our company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continue to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company, both at home and abroad.","We are particularly excited by the new opportunities that we are -- that we have going forward with a robust portfolio of Energy Drink products comprised of our Monster Energy Drink line, together with The Coca-Cola Company's energy brands throughout the world.

A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section.","The global beverage industry generally continues to face headwinds although the energy category continues to gain momentum. In the third quarter, net sales were $909.5 million, up 15.4% from $788 million in the third quarter of 2016. The company recorded third quarter gross sales of $1.04 billion, up 14.1% from $913.3 million in the third quarter of 2016.","Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the third quarter was 62.6% as compared to 63.8% for the comparable 2016 third quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to geographic sales mix as our international operations generally have lower profit margins, product sales mix as well as the increases in other costs.","Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.2% for the 2017 third quarter as compared to 3.1% in the 2016 third quarter. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.7% compared to 12.1% in the same quarter a year ago. The increase was primarily due to increased sponsorship and endorsement costs, commissions, merchandise displays and trade development.","General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 11.8% as compared to 11.7% in the same quarter last year. Included in general and administrative costs were distributor termination expenses of $15.9 million and $4.7 million for the 2017 and 2016 third quarters, respectively. General and administrative expenses excluding distributor terminations were 10.1% of net sales for the 2017 third quarter compared with 11.1% of net sales for the comparable 2016 third quarter.","Payroll expenses were up $6.5 million, primarily due to head count growth internationally, including to support the launches in China and other countries and stock-based compensation and non-cash item was $1.1 million higher. Legal expenses relating to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $2.9 million in the 2017 third quarter as compared to $4.9 million in the 2016 third quarter.","Our effective tax rate decreased from 33.8% in the 2016 third quarter to 31.9% in the 2017 third quarter, primarily due to profits earned by foreign subsidiaries in lower tax jurisdictions. Net income was $218.7 million in the 2017 third quarter compared to net income of $191.6 million in the 2016 third quarter, an increase of 14.1%.","The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 583.3 million for the third quarter of 2016 to 578.4 million for the third quarter of 2017 as a result of share buybacks. Diluted earnings per share for the 2017 third quarter increased 15.1% to $0.38 from $0.33 in the third quarter of 2016. We estimate that distributor termination expenses in the 2017 third quarter reduced reported earnings by approximately $0.02 per share after tax.","We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. We are also making good progress in the U.S. in non-traditional channels, including food service, accounts and e-commerce. In EMEA, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Georgia and Kuwait in the third quarter of 2017, and in Ghana and Morocco in October 2017. Additional launches are planned during the fourth quarter of 2017 and in the first quarter of 2018.","In the third quarter of 2017, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Nicaragua, and in October, we transitioned Monster Energy in the Bahamas, Grenada and Jamaica, the latter not to a Coca-Cola bottler. We also are planning to launch in and or transition to additional countries in the Caribbean and Central and South America in 2018.","In China, during the third quarter of 2017, we launched the final two operating units and are now focusing our efforts towards establishing Monster in the country with an emphasis on key cities and accounts. We also transitioned Vietnam and have begun distribution in Taiwan. We are also planning to re-launch Monster in India. Raw material cost savings from the AFF transaction were approximately $27.7 million in the third quarter of 2017 as compared to $23.3 million in the third quarter of 2016.","According to Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through October 21, 2017, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 2.6% versus the same period a year ago.

Sales of Red Bull increased by 5.1%, Rockstar was up 1%, 5-Hour was down 6.6% and Amp was down 39.4%.","We pointed out that the energy shot category has been slowing for some time. If we exclude energy shots as well as energy coffee and energy protein drinks where we have experienced production capacity shortages, for the four weeks ended October 21, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channel in dollars in fact increased by 5.8% over the same period last year with sales of Monster increasing by 11%.","According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended October 21, 2017, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars increased by 1.5 points over the same period last year to 37.2%, NOS's share increased 0.1 points to 4.1% and Full Throttle share decreased 0.1 points to 0.9%.

Sales of Java Monster were 12.2% lower than in the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Doubleshot Energy were 4.8% lower.","We have worked through our production capacity shortages for both Java Monster and Muscle Monster. We've secured additional production of Java Monster and Muscle Monster in the United States which came online in the third quarter of 2017. Those products came off allocation at the end of the quarter. Such production to give (10:27) additional production available to us in Europe, has eliminated our shortages for Java Monster and Muscle Monster. Together with our bottling partners, we are currently focused on regaining lost shelf space for these products.","According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended August 19, 2017, the energy drink category increased 2% in dollars. Monster sales increased 5% versus a year ago. Our market share increased 0.8 share points to 32.1%, Red Bull sales remained the same, and its market share decreased 1.4 points to 37.8%.

Sales of Burn decreased 46.4%, Burn's market share decreased 2.4 points to 2.5%, Red Bull sales decreased 1.6% and its market share decreased by 0.8 points to 10.8%. Vive 100 market share decreased 4 points to 40.2% while Boost market share decreased 0.5 point to 8.8%.","The Nielsen statistics for Mexico covers single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and\/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain, by one or more energy drink brands, during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen's statistics for Mexico.","I'd like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers for EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI for EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen in the 13-week period ending October 8, 2017, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 14.3% to 18.5% in Great Britain, from 8.7% to 13.2% in Italy, and in France from 22.7% to 24%.","According to Nielsen for the 13-week period ending October 8, 2017, Monster's retail market share in value decreased from 10.4% to 10.1% in Sweden, although the retail sales value in sales grew 25.7% in the same comparative period.

We remain confident about the potential of this brand. We launched Mango Loco, a new flavor in the Monster Energy juice family, exclusively with the convenience store customer in June and launched to the general market nationally in September 2017. We also launched Monster Energy Fury in September 2017 in Nigeria.","We are in the process of launching Espresso Monster in two flavors as well as NOS Nitro Mango in the United States. Sales of Monster Hydro, which was launched in a 550 ml PET bottle in the United Kingdom and Ireland during the second quarter of 2017, have been encouraging. The Lewis Hamilton signature Monster Energy drink launched in the second quarter and is now available in 22 EMEA markets including South Africa. We are planning to launch the Lewis Hamilton drinks in Australia in early 2018. We remain confident about the potential for this product.","We estimate October 2017 gross sales to be approximately 19.9% higher than in October 2016. On a foreign exchange adjusted basis, we estimate October 2017 gross sales to be approximately 18.6% higher than in October 2016. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as for example selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affect the dates on which we invoice such bottlers.","We note that in October 2017 there were 22 selling days as compared to 21 selling days in October 2016. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.","On February 28, 2017, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. During the third quarter, we purchased 4.5 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $54.91 per share for a total of $248.8 million, excluding broker commissions.","In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. We recognized a reduction in raw material costs of $27.7 million in the third quarter as a result of our acquisition of AFF. North American and international gross margins remain healthy. The U.S. Nielsen convenience market statistics for the four weeks ended October 21, 2017 reflect that the company achieved its highest market share in the energy category in dollars at a 42.3% market share and that the Monster Energy brand achieved its highest market share in the energy category at a 37.2% market share.","Equivalent market statistics for many countries around the world show that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category. The new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. We're excited about the prospects for our new product launches. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets, and reiterate the growth potential for us in China, one of the largest energy drink markets globally. We have successfully launched or transitioned Monster Energy Drinks to Coca-Cola bottlers in a number of markets this year, and anticipate further transitions and launches.","I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our first question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs. Question please?","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Hi, everyone.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Hi, Judy.","Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.","Hi, Judy.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So, I guess, I wanted to just start off with the gross margin question. Rodney, you called out a few factors that negatively impacted the quarter. I just wanted to get a little bit better sense of some of the callouts, specifically product mix, and then I think you said other costs. So hoping you can elaborate a little bit more? And then how much of those are really more transitory and one-time if it's something about getting the Java back online.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Well, Judy, we've always said that the international margins are lower than domestic margins. So the quarter was more pronounced because there was a larger growth in sales internationally. So that accounted for a significant portion of the reduction in overall gross margin.","We had some other issues relating to input costs, some cost increases \u2013 I shouldn't say issues \u2013 cost increases in relation to input costs. And there was some impact as well of product mix where we have different products that we sell that have different \u2013 every SKU has a different margin. So on balance, this quarter there was \u2013 and with the Java coming back on stream, there was a reduction in the overall margin because of those items. So those are the three major factors that contributed to the reduction in gross margin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Chappell of SunTrust. Question please?","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks. Just to follow up on the U.S. markets. I understand the issues with Java Monster and what have you, but the overall energy drink category has kind of had the whole year low at low-single digits. Are you seeing from the competition, Red Bull in particular, just lack of innovation? Are you seeing an overall slowdown? And are you just gaining share? Or \u2013 and maybe with that, what are you seeing out of the c-store channel? We had heard earlier in the year that that had slowed down, but it seems to maybe be picking back up. So kind of any comments on kind of the state of the U.S. energy market overall, not just you gaining share and getting products back?","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","I think that as we have said on previously calls, there had been a slowing of the convenience category, which traditionally had grown at a higher rate than the other categories, and we were sort of \u2013 everybody was sort of scratching their heads a little to try and find out why. And we didn't really \u2013 weren't able to really put our finger on it. We are seeing a pickup back in the convenience category sales, and they do seem to be starting to turn around and come back, as I indicated earlier on, on the numbers. So we are positive about the category and about the convenience traffic as well. That does seem to be doing better.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivien Azer of Cowen.

LLC","So I know you guys aren't in the habit of offering guidance, but given the volatility that we've seen around Java Monster, which has historically been such a good growth driver, can you give us a sense of how we should think about distribution coming back online? Thanks.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Yes. I'm not sure we can give you very much a guidance. Obviously the energy and coffee category has continued to grow through our difficulties. We, obviously, lost sales and we lost some market share. And as we indicated at the end of the quarter, everybody is \u2013 we are back with products in inventory, we're shipping orders in full to our bottlers, and they are now \u2013 and we are together now getting product back on the shelf.","So we've got to, obviously, fight back and get back the shelf space that contracted during that period, but we are \u2013 we're quite encouraged that we'll get back shelf space quite quickly. We are positive for the coffee category, and that is why we're right in the throes literally this week of starting to sell and launch Espresso Monster, and we will be coming \u2013 launching, early in the new year, we'll be launching Caf\u00e9 Monster in glass bottles. So we think there is good growth potential for the coffee category and the coffee plus energy category. We still think those are good \u2013 it's a good growth category beverages, generally and for us. And with getting back into our inventory position and eliminating our shortages, we think that from the fourth quarter we will start to see the benefits come through. So we are positive about it. But to what extent and how quickly, obviously, we're not going to give guidance on that because it is uncertain anyway to us even at this time.","Unknown Speaker","Yeah. All we can say is that our bottler partners are committed to getting the shelf space back and committed to the product.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI. Question please.","Robert Ottenstein - Evercore Group LLC","Great. Thank you very much. I'm wondering if you can give us an update on Hydro, how it's doing in the marketplace, and whether you've gotten by the supply issues at this point, and maybe perhaps compare Hydro's reception in the market with Mutant. Thank you.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","I think they're two very different products. Let's just focus on Hydro for the moment. Hydro we've had a really good response, both to the package and to the ingredients and taste. So both of them have risen rather (31:08) well, which makes us very positive for this sort of sub-brand or subcategory.","We have continued to experience production challenges and being able to get enough cans and that's been a challenge. So while we look at distribution and sales numbers, we think those numbers have been negatively affected by the fact that they don't actually relate or give the full story because we're out of stock a lot of the time. If you're out of stock, it doesn't show in the Nielsen numbers. So we believe the results have actually been more positive than are reflected in the actual sales purported to (31: 35) in the Nielsen, and that is consistent with our feedback from the market and the field and from retailers.","So we are very positive about that. The way we've \u2013 addressing that is we will be launching a line of four SKUs; one \u2013 we're probably going to take one of the existing three SKUs and convert that into a 750-ml bottle, and we're going to have three other 750-ml PET bottles, one of which will be a zero calorie, zero-sugar product. So with those four products being launched early in 2018, then we will continue to maintain our sales of the cans. We are looking and are engaged in negotiations to secure additional capacity and additional production facilities to make the plastic can, the PET can, because we do believe that is a very attractive package and it is, I think important for the brand.","So, ultimately, once we get that rectified, we'll obviously expand the offerings in the PET can. So going out probably early point next year, we will have PET cans and a 750-ml, a 25-ounce plastic bottle. So we believe that that will cater for the out of stocks and the erratic supply, because you'll have one or the other products in stock pretty much at all times in stores, and we are positive about Hydro as being a new category for us and a new growth area for us in 2018.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Question please.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you, gentlemen \u2013 and ladies and gentlemen there. Just on the \u2013 if you can comment a little bit on China and what are the impressions now that you've probably reached where you wanted to be. And I know you can't compare with last year, but if you can tell us how it's tracking against plan. And if you \u2013 I think building with the last question, if you can talk a little bit about Mutant. Thank you.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","China is a great opportunity for us. It's a logistically very, very big and complex country, and we are continuing to make progress. We are learning how to market and promote our products, distribute our products in China. We had some challenges in basically securing space for us. Basically there's no real energy category. So it's not as though you can focus on the energy category and say you've got an energy product. They just put your new product in the energy category. And so there has been some struggle with the Coke bottlers where their focus and perhaps the easier way where they believe they were doing an adequate job is to \u2013 if they're struggling to find a position for the product, they find a position in the Coke cooler and your product goes into the Coke cooler.","Now that seems to sound fine, but ultimately, if the other products like the Red Bull Gold, which is the leader in the category and are being sold in an independent cold door, even on the warm shelf, the consumer is not expecting to go into the Coke cooler and find an energy drink. And we're really going through a learning curve with our bottlers to try and explain to them that the first prize is not actually being in the Coke cooler. The first prize is actually being \u2013 and the essential distribution point is to be right next to Red Bull. And if you get a secondary point of distribution which is obviously always positive, then you're going to the Coke cooler with that secondary distribution point.","So that is just an educational challenge to really get and communicate that to the very, very big sales force. So on the one hand, you've got this really big sales force available to us, which is a very big positive. On the other hand, they're used to selling and putting their product into the Coke door and into the Coke cooler where they have many of them. We're really having to refine that and tweak that slightly, and that's part of the challenge we have. So we remain very positive, and we believe that it's going to continue to grow. Our sales are going to continue to grow, and it is a very, very important market for us. It's just going through a learning curve and getting everything down as we continue to progress.","So that is really all we can say on China is the sales are good. They're substantial. If you look at our other markets and comparable other markets that we've launched at, the sales are higher, but we are working through these operational challenges and we'll get through them. There's no doubt. It's just a question of getting them and having the time to train everybody and understand what the priorities are. So that's really an update on China.","Unknown Speaker","And I always \u2013 when I look at China, I always look at what happened in other countries where we launched, and generally we sustained losses in those countries in the earlier years. You can look at Europe and track through the various Qs and Ks, and China I don't believe will be any different. So we will sustain a loss in China this year and it's something we were prepared for and is not a shock to us.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","So we still remain ultimately at the end of the day positive that that's going to be a large contributor to the company and to the brand going forward in future years.","With regard to Mutant, we're still putting our heads down. We are sort of looking at expanding our distribution and our channels. We believe that the brand has got a good potential. We are continuing to put promotional efforts behind the brand this year, and we have the bottlers' support, and we will continue to put focus on Mutant. And we see that as a long-term potential benefit and good opportunity for the company. But it is, again, if we're looking at an analysis, you look at the brands in the soft drink industry and the average age of the brands of old \u2013 decades old that we're going up against. We're doing quite well if you look at where we are in relation to the other brands, and we are going to continue to \u2013 we will continue to make progress against them as we continue to develop the brand.","We're doing some testing at the moment. We're going out to test a 38 ml cap as opposed to the 26 ml, which is really \u2013 really looks good on the product. It does transform the visual image of the product and its position. And as soon as we get some input back from some key channels and key accounts we're testing this larger cap formatting, we will determine whether we actually transition all the production into the larger cap or stay with the traditional 28 ml or 26 ml cap that you normally use for soda products. So that's the one thing we are looking at in the Mutant line, and we think this is so far out from our own feeling internally is that we think that this cap will be quite a positive addition to the line going forward.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes our Q&A portion. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Thank you. On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy, and remain committed to continuing to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad, and in particular to expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottling system internationally.","We are particularly excited by the new opportunities that we have going forward with the portfolio of energy drink products throughout the world, comprised of our Monster Energy brand together with the strategic brands as well as Mutant.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO. Sir, you may begin.","Rodney Sacks","Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I\u2019m Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President is with me today, as is Tom Kelly, our Executive Vice President of Finance.","Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended and are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends.

The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes and designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated May 2, 2019. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section.","Consumer beverage preferences and tastes continue to evolve, and we are endeavoring to address them through our ongoing innovation of new products. In the first quarter of 2019, net sales were $946 million, up 11.2% from $850.9 million in the first quarter of 2018. Net sales in the first quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $22 million of foreign currency movements.","Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 60.6% for both the three months ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018. For the quarter ended March 31, 2019, gross profit as a percentage of net sales was positively affected by increased sales prices of our product sold in North America, and to a lesser extent, product sales mix. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily negatively affected by geographical sales mix and increases in certain input costs.","Distribution costs, as a percentage of net sales, were 3.8% for the 2019 first quarter as compared to 3.9% in the 2018 first quarter. Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 11% for the 2019 first quarter as compared to 11.5% in the same quarter in 2018.","General and administrative costs, as a percentage of net sales, were 12.9% for the 2019 first quarter as compared to 12.3% in the same quarter in 2018. In the quarter, payroll expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 7.7% compared to 7.5% in the same period in 2018.","Payroll costs increased $8.6 million, primarily due to headcount growth, both domestically and internationally as well as an increase in payroll taxes. Stock-based compensation, this is a non-cash item, was $15.3 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $13.4 million in the same quarter of 2018.","Our effective tax rate decreased from 23.3% in the 2018 first quarter to 16.8% in the 2019 first quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in the deductions for equity compensation as well as the increasing profits earned by certain foreign subsidiaries in lower tax jurisdictions than in United States.","Net income was $261.5 million in the 2019 first quarter compared to net income of $216.1 million in the 2018 first quarter, an increase of 21%. Diluted earnings per share for the 2019 first quarter increased 26.7% to $0.48 from $0.38 in the first quarter of 2018.","We continue to make good progress on the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola Bottlers globally. In March 2019, we agreed to the assignment of the Kalil Bottling Group\u2019s distribution territories to Coca-Cola Bottlers in the southwestern United States.","We incurred no distributed termination costs and received no deferred revenue connection with this assignment. We transitioned the distribution of Monster Energy drinks from Big Geyser\u2019s territory, which is located in the New York metro markets to Liberty Coca-Cola in early April 2019. As of April 6, 2019, the United States has been fully transitioned to all Coca-Cola network bottlers.","In the second quarter 2019, Monster Energy will be launched in Azerbaijan and Saudi Arabia. We are planning further international launches later this year in EMEA. We launched Predator, our strategically preferred affordable energy brand, in Namibia and Mozambique in the first quarter of 2019.","We're also planning launches of Predator in certain markets in Eastern Europe in the second quarter of 2019 as well as in selected additional markets in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa throughout the second half of 2019.","We launched Monster in Bolivia in the first quarter of 2019. We also launched Monster in Paraguay last week, and anticipate launching in the Dominican Republic in the second quarter. In China, we completed the rollout of Monster Ultra in the first quarter.","During the first quarter, we also began the launch of Monster Mango, which will continue throughout the second quarter of 2019. We\u2019ve significantly expanded our shelf space for Monster with these three SKUs in our targeted top 40 cities and key accounts.","We continue the rollout of Monster across India, and Monster is now available in approximately 90% of the country. We are planning additional SKU launches in India later in 2019. I'll now provide a quick update on our arbitration with The Coca-Cola Company.","As we\u2019ve stated, our various agreements with The Coca-Cola Company restrict The Coca-Cola Company from competing in the energy drink category, with certain exceptions, including an exception relating to the Coca-Cola brand.","Coca-Cola has developed three energy drink product that it believes it may market under an exception, relating to the Coca-Cola brand. We believe that the exception does not apply.","By mutual agreement, the issue was submitted to arbitration at the end of October 2018 for a determination of whether Coca-Cola is permitted to manufacture, market and distribute these products.","The arbitration proceedings are still ongoing on the schedule the parties agreed two months ago. Monster expects a decision from the arbitrators before the end of the second quarter. Although Coca-Cola has announced it is proceeding to launch new energy drinks in certain countries without waiting for the arbitration panel to rule on the issue, Coca-Cola\u2019s entitlement to continue to sell such drinks will be governed by the outcome of the arbitration. We reiterate that whatever the outcome of the arbitration, we will continue to cooperate and work together as partners.","I also wanted to take a moment to address a matter that has received some attention. Monster's litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., VPX, the maker of Bang energy drinks. Monster filed a lawsuit against VPX in September 2018 for false advertising, including false and unsupported claims that Bang contains ingredients that it does not have and provide benefit that it does not generate. VPX has continually attempted to delay our lawsuit. In April, we filed a motion for preliminary injunction, which is scheduled for hearing in June 2019.","In March 2019, VPX filed a trademark lawsuit against Monster. I have two comments to make. Firstly, the lawsuit is meritless. Months after Monster publicly announced the launch of Reign Total Body Fuel beverages in mid-January 2019, a company related to VPX allegedly purchased an unrelated Reign trademark for a different class of products, namely powered dietary supplements.","Monster holds trademark and use priority over VPX for its Reign Total Body Fuel beverages in the clause that covers these beverages. We recently filed a reply to VPX\u2019s complaint, which set forth our opposition in detail, and asserts counterclaims against VPX for trademark infringement and unfair competition.","Secondly, this lawsuit will not impede or slow the launch Reign Total Body Fuel. As our litigation with VPX and the arbitration with Coca-Cola are subjudicate, we will not be answering questions on these matters on the call.","According to Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks to April 20, 2019, all assets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, merchandise, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 9.8% versus the same period a year ago.","Sales of Monster grew 1.9% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS decreased 2.4% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 8.6%.

Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month.","Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide, because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA, vary from country to country.","According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending January 2019, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 11.5% to 13.2% in Belgium from 25.6% to 26.4% in France, from 16% to 17.2% in Germany, from 18.7% to 20% in Great Britain, from 7% to 7.1% in the Netherlands, from 16.3% to 18.8% in Norway, from 8.3% to 12.4% in Poland, from 15.6% to 16.3% in South Africa, from 29.3% to 30.3% in Spain and from 12% to 13.2% Sweden.","According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending February 2019, Monster\u2019s retail market share in value, as compared to the same period the previous year, grew from 11.7% to 12.9% in the Czech Republic, from 32.7% to 34.4% in Greece, from 13.7% to 15.3% in Ireland, and from 13.8% to 17.8% in Italy.","According to Nielsen, for the month of March 2019, in Chile, Monster\u2019s retail market share in value increased from 34.4% to 35.9% compared to the same period the previous year.

Average days of inventory were 72.7 days at March 31, 2019 compared to 67.2 days at December 31, 2018.","We have successful launched Monster Energy Ultra Paradise a line extension in our Monster Ultra family in February 2019 as well two -- an additional two flavors of Hydro, Hydro Manic Melon and Hydro Mean Green in 25.4-ounce PET bottles.","In addition, we booked out the last family in the quarter with the launch of NOS Sonic Sour and the re-branding of NOS Rowdy Punch to NOS Power Punch. We also extended the Java Monster Swiss Chocolate lead launch from 2018 to all customers in February 2019 and added two flavors in our Dragon Tea line Green Tea and Yerba Mate which launched in March.","We have repositioned our Monster Rehab White Dragon Tea to be included in the new Monster Dragon Tea line. Finally in March, we launched Reign Total Body Fuel in six flavors, initial results have been positive.","During January 2019 in Canada, we launched two additional line extensions of Monster Hydro, namely Purple Fashion and Zero Sugar, as well as Monster White Dragon Tea. In March, we launched our Caff\u00e9 Monster line in 13.7-ounce re-sealable glass package.","In Mexico, we launched Mango Loco in April 2019. During the first quarter of 2019 we launched Pacific Punch in the Caribbean and extended our range in Puerto Rico. In Chile, during the first quarter of 2019, we launched Monster Absolutely Zero. In Argentina, we launched Monster Ultra. The initial results have been positive.","In the first quarter of 2019, we launched Monster Mango Loco in Norway, the Netherlands, Poland, Italy and the Baltics. Monster Mango Loco will be launched in another 12 EMEA markets in the second quarter 2019. Monster Pipeline Punch was launched in Ireland.","We also launched Espresso Monster and Espresso Monster Vanilla in Germany and Spain. We are planning to continue to rollout of our Espresso Monster line across Western Europe in the second quarter of 2019. We launched Black Monster Ultra in Russia in the first quarter of 2019 and continued the rollout of additional SKUs in the Monster Ultra range in EMEA markets, specifically in Monster ultra blue and gray Brazil in Ireland and Monster Ultra Violet in the Baltics in the first quarter of 2019. There is SKUs in the Monster Ultra line 39 EMEA markets.","In Australia we successfully launched the new flavor across in February with good initial results. We launched Monster Mango in China in March and continue with our rollout of Monster Ultra. We plan to launch a number of products in Asia Pacific later this year.","As I mentioned earlier, we implemented a price increase of approximately 4% on our Monster Energy portfolio to our used customers effective November 1, 2018. We are satisfied with the initial results for the implementation of this price increase. For Monster expenses as percentage of gross sales decreased in the first quarter of 2019. We increased the prices of our concentrate for NOS and Full Throttle effective January 1 2019 by approximately 1.5%.","We also implemented a price increase of approximately 3% to our Canadian customers effective February 1, 2019 for the Monster Energy NOS and Full Throttle lines. We estimate April 2019 gross sales to be approximately 15.6% higher than in April 2018.","On a foreign currency-adjusted basis April 2019 gross sales would have been approximately 18.9% higher than comparable April 2018 gross sales. It was one more selling day in April 2019 than in April 2018.","In this regard we cautioned the guiding that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors. Such as for example selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and for promotional retail stores.","Distributing incentives as well as shift in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules which affects the day which we such bottlers as very inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons.","We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even two months should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.","During the 2019 first quarter, the company purchased approximately 2.6 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $54.18 per share for a total of $139 million excluding broker commissions. As of May 2, 2019 approximately $520.6 million remains available for repurchase under our previously-authorized repurchase program.","In conclusion I'd like to summarize a recent positive points. One, retail sales statistics from many countries around the world demonstrate that the Energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category in line with earlier periods.","Two, the new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company sales. Three, we are excited about the prospects for our brands and our new product launches.","Four, in particular initial results for our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks which launched in March are positive and we are encouraged by the prospect for this line.","Five, we are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India. Six, we're continuing with our plans to launch Monster Energy drinks with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain new markets.","Seven, we're also proceeding with our plans for future launches of our affordable energy brands internationally and also evaluating the launch of Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in countries outside of the USA in the second half of 2019.","I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Stephen Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Stephen Powers","Hey, guys. Thanks. I guess, it's worth asking about, but I guess maybe just start on your thoughts on U.S. pricing relative to the competition. And now that you've got your innovation out in the marketplace, should we expect to see incremental promotional dollars allocated to those initiatives?","And I guess, how much do you think those initiatives will be allocated against Reign versus against the base Monster franchise? I guess, what I'm really asking about is, how much if at all do you think incremental promotional investment is likely to offset the list price increases you took late last year as you go forward throughout the balance of 2019?","Rodney Sacks","Okay. Steve you will see that in this quarter when results that we actually improved promotional allowances in this quarter. So the promotional allowances are reducing. However in the next quarter we're planning and this is really planned, nothing to do with any sales or sales mixes, but we had already planned a BOGO which is a buy one get one ready to get Reign exuviated more intensively than it was in the -- with the launches.","Part of the launching plan and you will see that happen in the second quarter. Apart from anything else, we are watching the market. We're watching Red Bull's crossing very carefully.","And we'll make adjustments if we think it will have a long-term impact. However, what we see and you'll see that as well is the majority of Red Bull's growth is actually coming from innovation.","Stephen Powers","Okay. Great. So just a follow-up quickly. The big incremental innovation is tied to the launch of Reign which I think makes sense. And then now you have Ultra Paradise and some of your newer Monster SKUs in the marketplace. Any incremental promotion? It sounds like from your -- from what you just said, we should assume goes to those new innovations as opposed to -- against the base SKUs. Is that a fair way to think about it?","Rodney Sacks","I'm not sure I said that. When we promote Monster, we promote the line. But what I did say was that with regard to Reign, you'll see a special promotion in the ensuing quarter which will be due to a previously planned BOGO which is buy one get one to really kickstart the launch of Reign.","Stephen Powers","Perfect. Okay.","Rodney Sacks","During the quarter we will be -- we had some timing differences on our promotions last year in the first quarter where we didn't have the same depth of promotion this year. But going into the second quarter, we will be promoting Monster pretty much in accordance with the normal promotional schedule that we plan for summer.","Tom Kelly","I think Steve Kristen was -- because of the pricing the increased pricing it will be more access of coming on through this Monster.","Rodney Sacks","Correct.","Stephen Powers","Yes. Okay. That's clear. Thanks guys.","Rodney Sacks","Yes. Okay.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Judy Hong","Thank you. Hi, everyone.","Rodney Sacks","Hi, Judy.","Judy Hong","I guess, I wanted to ask about Reign more specifically whether or how much it contributed to 1Q sales as well as the April sales, because obviously there is a pretty big divergence in terms of the Nielsen numbers and your reported numbers?","And then I guess more broadly on Reign, can maybe just talk a little bit more about the performance of the brand so far? How much do you think it take your share away from Bang versus maybe expanding the category? Or how much is sort of cannibalizing your brands? And how quickly do you think that we can to full distribution?","Rodney Sacks","On the contribution of Reign, Reign contributed about $25.5 million of sales to the first quarter.","Tom Kelly","Net sales. ","Rodney Sacks","Net sales. Yes. We don't have the -- we're not going to go into the number in April that's just a -- we give the gross numbers as opposed to breaking that up. And I think Judy to answer the balance of your question I think it's just too early for us to tell exactly what is taking from what. You can see the numbers from Nielsen has been some affected since.","Obviously, there is a new entrant and participant in the category. It's taking share from all the products. But ultimately we do believe that Reign will continue to increase itself and establish itself that is the reason why we're actually looking at the first promotion we got with Reign. It hasn't been promoted until now.","And so you got to get the first promotion coming through in the second quarter on Reign. And we will continue to pull out. We did get some pretty good distribution initially from the Coke bottlers, but it will continue to hold out as we go into the second quarter.","Judy Hong","Thank you.","Tom Kelly","Just to add to that Judy, it\u2019s really the launch exceeded our expectation.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Mark Astrachan","Hey, afternoon guys.","Rodney Sacks","Hi, Mark.","Mark Astrachan","I wanted to ask a question on white space and opportunity for products. So you commented on Ultra being available in I think 38 EMEA markets. It got me thinking so, how do you think about U.S. innovation in terms of what the white space would be for existing franchises as well as just new franchises where you're putting the stuff on shelves. Meaning, it seems like Reign is getting on the new shelf. Is that fair? How do you think about the existing energy shelves?","And then outside of the U.S., how do you think about taking successful innovation like Hydro, Java and taking it global. Where are you in the rollout of SKUs versus where it would be? Obviously, there is a lot of that and still maybe just kind of broader strokes of how you think about what the opportunity can be. I think that would be helpful.","Rodney Sacks","I think you mentioned this Mark on previous calls, where the determination is made together with the local management about -- in each country thought which SKUs we should launch, which SKUs are appropriate to the consumer needs in that country.","And there is a rollout which is dependent on opportunities and you've seen we've done that. I mean, on this call we mentioned a number of countries where we have launched additional SKUs. And we will continue to do so.","But one thing we will not do is roll out all our SKUs in all our countries, because that's not a good approach to addressing the market. In China, for example, we already have three SKUs. We have the original Monster.","We have Ultra. And we have Mango. So we have three SKUs now in China. And if you look at other countries we success for the -- and success we\u2019ve done that. In EMEA, we've done that and we continuing to do that.","Tom Kelly","In most of these countries, we really are -- there isn't a cookie cutter sort of formula. We look at the countries. We obviously try and launch with Monster Green to establish the Monster brand, because that's what it's stands for. But from then on we look at the individual countries.","They flavor preferences, and you'll find that our second or third SKU many countries differ from country-to-country. And then depending on the response we get. In some countries, we get really good response to Ultra.","We then change the track and basically start to launch more of the Ultra product. And perhaps some years ago, we were launching more of the juice product. And so the order is changed a little bit. Mango has got very well received. Popcorn is being very well received.","And so we really elevated those SKUs basically looking in some countries. There are some countries where we are finding directly there is a good reception to our Rehab line.","Now Rehab, it may not go into that format. It may go in the form of a tea likers. Rehab has less meaning in foreign countries than it has in the U.S. because of the origin of Rehab. But there is some opportunities for tea lines in some countries and we are looking at that into non-core.","And as you've been seen we have taken the step also some testing to look at coffee. In Europe we think that market is -- we're going to expand that market with Espresso. And we're also looking at some other potential coffee products into the UK market. Again looking at shelves and keeping abreast of growth and innovation. In those markets, we do see good opportunities for that.","And once we look at that, and again reach the right progression in other countries we will look at other growth opportunities in -- but we're going to follow our policy of looking at it country-by-country as we have launched in the country as the bottle is able to handle it and we feel it's right to continue to grow. That we'll continue to build out over years our portfolio is going to continue to grow, continue to build out internationally.","In the U.S., while we've launched, we believe there is -- the energy shelf is pretty impacted at the moment. So we're looking to get new space for this high-performance category incremental. In some cases in order to -- because of timing and because of reset in order to get products on shelf, it has been put onto the energy shelf.","But in many cases, we are achieving additional space and we also have -- we believe most of the retailers are agreed that there should be additional space allocated to this high-performance category. It is a profitable category for the retailers. It's a high ring. And so we believe we will see additional space being allocated to energy basically to accommodate the new high-performance products that we believe we will end up with -- overall end up with increased shelf space.","Rodney Sacks","And Mark, to reinforce that earlier comment that certain flavor profiles that do really well overseas and don't do well in the U.S. For example, one of my favorite Monster products is the Ultra Citron. And a decision was taken that we would probably should discontinue it in favor of other Ultra products.","And that Ultra Citron has been launched in the bunch of international countries Japan, Korea and a bunch of countries across Europe because of its less sweet profile. So each country will determine -- with obviously with direction from the Senate, the product that best suit the consumer needs in those countries. ","Tom Kelly","Just to add, I think it hasn't been launched yet in Japan or Korea.","Mark Astrachan","Thank you.","Tom Kelly","It has.","Rodney Sacks","Between us they are not certain with\u2026","Tom Kelly","I believe it has. Yes.","Rodney Sacks","Okay.","Tom Kelly","And again\u2026","Rodney Sacks","Yes.","Tom Kelly","The concept that a major product that will see in other countries that we may not even launch in the U.S. or they may launch in, they just -- we discontinued in the U.S.","Rodney Sacks","Yes, agreed.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Amit Sharma","Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.","Rodney Sacks","Hi.","Amit Sharma","Rodney if we take Reign out from Q1 sales and look at the rest of the US portfolio around 4.2 - growth, all right. And most of that coming from pricing? And you talked about that you will watch Red Bull price like at what point do you get worried about the volume performance of the core Monster brand in U.S. and not just price accordingly?","Rodney Sacks","I think we've got a whole beverage portfolio. And you're going to take the portfolio as a whole in time. I think that we did mention I think earlier that for timing reasons they were certain promotions that we've done last year that fairly to earlier periods where we had some Nielsen updates that didn't get repeated this year. They are falling into -- probably into the second quarter now.","So we \u2013 overall, we are comfortable with the brands. There is a sort of change going on in the industry at the moment. There's a change in \u2013 obviously, finding shelf space, people are trying some of these new high-performance drinks. We think a lot of that will stop. The noise will stop settling down. We think there will be growth.","Overall, we're still -- we're comfortable with our innovation. Ultra Paradise is now got on to shelves and is really doing well. Innovation in coffee. The Swiss coffee is doing well. We have additional innovation planned in the months to line later in the year. And so we are comfortable that overall we will continue to grow.","Tom Kelly","Yes. Amit just remember that our launches took place February the 21st for Hydro. So there's two new flavors in seven 50. For Java the Swiss Chocolate; for Ultra Paradise, last Snapple that is all February the 21st.","And in March the 21st, we had Reign and we had Dragon Tea. So the launches took place really towards the end of the quarter. And -- but as I said earlier, we will be monitoring Red Bull and we'll take whatever steps necessary to ensure that the business continues to grow.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now open.","Laurent Grandet","Yes. Good evening Rodney and Hilton. Congrats on a strong quarter. I would try to have a second shot at Crane, because we don't have so much, I mean, Nielsen reliable numbers for now. So I think you said Reign was representing about 2.5% in the last week of April when Bang was about 8.3% I guess\u2026","Rodney Sacks","Correct.","Laurent Grandet","Yes. That's correct, yes. So it seems like","Rodney Sacks","The Market share yes.","Tom Kelly","Market share in convenience. ","Laurent Grandet","Market share, yes, in market share. So it seems like since you had those two, it feels like a 23% of the new \u2013 rain represent about 22% of the new category. That's a great result just after six-week especially as you are roughly in just half of those stores, Bang is available and why you can't? So do you have any qualitative feedback at least from retailer in terms of sales especially in stores that sell Boost, Bang and Reign that you could share with us that would be helpful? Thank you.","Rodney Sacks","Well, we've got some information from some of our major convenience retail partners on SKUs \u2013 competitive SKUs. And they are trending by and large at a higher percentage than is shown in the Nielsen numbers. But because of the fact that we bought and it's not something that we generally go into and verify as carefully, we don't want to quote them on this call.","But we do -- the numbers we are seeing out of the top change is showing a higher comparable number, which is positive for us and I think we just got to be a bit patient and wait for the numbers to start coming through generally. And then we'll start seeing the south point as well as the distribution overall.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Rodney for any closing remarks.","Rodney Sacks","On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to innovate, develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad. Any particular spend distribution of our product through the Coca-Cola Bottlers system international. We are also particularly excited about new opportunities that we have going forward with a portfolio of energy drink products throughout the world, comprised of our Monster Energy brand together with our strategic brands as well as Hydro, Mutant, Predator and Reign. Thank you very much for your attention and attendance.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference.

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Please begin.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, is with me today; as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27-A of the Securities Act of 1953 as amended, and Section 21-E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1954 as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends.","Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call.

The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements with as results of new information, future events or otherwise.","An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes and designated with asterisks in the consolidated statements of income and other information, attached to the earnings release dated February 28, 2018. A copy of this information is also available on our website at www.monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section.","Global beverage industry generally continues to face headwinds, although the energy category continues to gain momentum. In the fourth quarter, net sales were $810.4 million, up 7.5% from $753.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net sales in the fourth quarter were positively impacted by approximately $7.3 million of foreign currency movements. The company recorded fourth quarter gross sales of $954.8 million, up 10.1% from $848.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.","Gross sales in the fourth quarter were positively impacted by approximately $9.3 million of foreign currency movements. Net sales and gross sales in the fourth quarter were adversely affected by inventory reductions in the quarter by certain of our international distribution partners in Europe, Chile and Japan. We estimate that the impact of such inventory reductions was approximately 2% on net sales in the 2017 fourth quarter.","The actual impact on net sales and gross sales could differ significantly from the current estimate which includes estimates of certain distributors' own inventory levels. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the fourth quarter were 62.1% as compared to 66.1% for the comparable 2016 fourth quarter and 62.6% for the 2017 third quarter.","As a reminder, lower promotional allowances as a percentage of sales in the 2016 fourth quarter together with the reduction in Java Monster sales had the effect of increasing the gross profit percentage by approximately 2% in the 2016 fourth quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2017 fourth quarter compared to the 2016 fourth quarter was primarily attributable to sales mix, primarily increased sales of Java Monster, inventory reserves in China, lower allowances as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter of 2016, as well as the increases in other costs, primarily increases in sweeteners and aluminum cans, as well as logistical costs from imports.","Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.6% for the 2017 fourth quarter as compared to 3.2% in the 2016 fourth quarter, largely due to distribution inefficiencies with certain products as well as duplicative storage costs due to the transition to our new 1 million square foot warehouse and distribution center in Southern California.","Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 13.6% compared to 12% in the same quarter a year ago. The increase was primarily due to increased sponsorship and endorsement costs, advertising, mainly for NOS, increased costs relating to in-store demos, merchandise displays, commissions, and trade development.","General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 11.9% as compared to 17.5% in the same quarter last year. Included in general and administrative costs were distributor termination expenses of $46.3 million in the comparable 2016 fourth quarter. General and administrative costs excluding distributor terminations were 11.4% of net sales for the comparable 2016 fourth quarter.","In the quarter, payroll expenses were up $10.8 million compared to the same period last year, primarily due to head count growth both domestically and internationally, including to support the launches in China and other countries. Payroll taxes increased $3.5 million in the quarter compared to the same period a year ago. And stock-based compensation, a non-cash item, was $0.9 million higher.","Legal expenses related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety, and sale of the company's products were $2.5 million in the 2017 fourth quarter as compared to $5.1 million in the 2016 fourth quarter. Operating income was adversely affected by losses in China and India. The losses in India were due to establishment costs in advance of the launch, which has taken longer than anticipated for technical reason, as well as inventory reserves.","Our effective tax rate decreased from 29.9% in the 2016 fourth quarter to 24.8% in the 2017 fourth quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was due primarily to an increase in the stock compensation deduction. The amount of excess tax benefits recorded in income for the 2017 fourth quarter was $82.9 million compared with $13.7 million in the fourth quarter of last year.","The decrease in the effective tax rate was partially offset by a provisional charge of $39.8 million included in the provision for income taxes in the fourth quarter of 2017 and a $2.1 million charge for a one-time deemed mandatory repatriation of post-1986 earnings and profits as a result of the Tax Reform Act signed into law on December 22, 2017.","Under the Tax Reform Act, the U.S. corporate income tax rate will be reduced from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018. The provisional charge was attributable to the revaluation by the company of its net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017.","Net income was $201.3 million in the 2017 fourth quarter compared to net income of $172.9 million in the 2016 fourth quarter, an increase of 16.4%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 580.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 to 575 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of share buybacks. Diluted earnings per share for the 2017 fourth quarter increased 17.5% to $0.35 from $0.30 in the fourth quarter of 2016. We estimate that distributor termination expenses in the comparable 2016 fourth quarter reduced reported earnings by approximately $0.05 per share after tax.","We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. We're also making good progress in the U.S. in non-traditional channels, including foodservice accounts and e-commerce. In the U.S., we transitioned Monster in parts of Minnesota and Arkansas. And with the recent transition in the first quarter of 2018, Minnesota is now fully transitioned to Coca-Cola bottlers.","In EMEA, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Ghana and Morocco in the fourth quarter of 2017. Additional launches are planned in the first quarter of 2018 in Armenia, Belarus, and Tanzania. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in the Bahamas and Grenada, as well as in Jamaica with an independent bottler. We plan to launch Monster in Argentina in the first quarter of 2018 and in Ecuador and Uruguay during the second quarter of 2018.","In China, we are now focusing our efforts towards establishing Monster around the country, with an emphasis on key cities and accounts. We also transitioned Monster Energy in Vietnam and have begun distribution of Monster Energy in Taiwan. We're also planning to relaunch Monster in India, initially in a limited territory, and are currently engaged in production trials. We recorded a loss for the quarter in India, which I referred to earlier. We plan to launch Mutant, an affordable energy brand that is positioned differently than in the U.S., where Mutant is positioned as a Super Soda, in Pakistan, Cambodia, Myanmar, and Vietnam in 2018.","Raw material cost savings from the AFF transaction were approximately $25.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared with $22 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.","According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through February 17, 2018, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 4.5% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 12.2% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS increased 5.5% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 2.8%. Sales of Red Bull increased 2.8%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 0.1%.

Sales of Java Monster were 26.9% higher than the same period last year while sales of Starbucks Double Shot Energy were 8% lower. The production capacity shortages that we experienced in the second half of 2016 for both Java Monster and Muscle Monster were largely worked through by the fourth quarter of 2017. Both Java Monster and Muscle Monster came off allocation in the quarter. Together with our bottling partners we are currently focused on regaining lost shelf space for these products.","According to Nielsen in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended February 3, 2018, the energy drink category increased 8% in dollars.

Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.","According to Nielsen in the 13-week period ending January 2018, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year, grew from 15.9% to 18.8% in Great Britain, from 27.4% to 28.6% in Spain, and in France, from 22.5% to 25.5%.","According to Nielsen in the 13-week period ending December 2017, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 10.7% to 11.6% in Belgium. From 10.1% to 13.9% in Ireland, from 10.9% to 11% in Sweden. From 5% to 7.1% in the Netherlands, from 15.1% to 15.9% in Germany, from 10.8% to 15.7% in Norway, and from 31.5% to 33.5% in Greece and from 8.8% to 13.5% in Italy.","For the 13-week period ended December 2017, Monster's retail market share in value decreased, however, from 16.1% to 14.9% in South Africa, although the retail value sales actually grew 10.6% in the same comparative period. And from 12% to 11.3% in the Czech Republic although retail value sales grew 0.8% in the same comparative period.","I'd like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers for EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI for EMEA vary from country-to-country. According to Nielsen for the month of December 2017 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 26.1% to 33.2% compared to the same period last year. And Monster's market share in value in Brazil for the month of December increased from 5% to 15.2% as compared to the same period last year.","According to IRI in Australia, Monster's market share in value grew from 6.3% to 7.1% in December 2017, as compared to the same period last year.

We will again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months may often be materially influenced positively and\/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those months.","Net sales for the Monster Energy drink segment for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 7.6% from $684.4 million to $736.1 million from the comparable period last year. Net sales for the Monster Energy drinks segment in the fourth quarter were positively impacted by approximately $5.8 million of foreign currency movements. Net sales for the strategic brand segment were $69.6 million for the fourth quarter as compared to $64.5 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales for the company's strategic brand segment were positively impacted by approximately $1.5 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter. Net sales for the other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, were $4.7 million in both the 2017 and 2016 fourth quarters.","Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $210.4 million in the 2017 fourth quarter compared to $193.5 million in the corresponding quarter in 2016. Foreign exchange had the effect of increasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $7.3 million. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas.","In Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, net sales for the fourth quarter increased 10.2% in dollars and 4.1% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 47.5% compared to 52.8% in the same quarter last year and 50.9% in the third quarter of 2017, in part due to increases in raw materials, aluminum and co-packing costs, as well as lower allowances as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter of 2016.","The increase in sales in the fourth quarter in EMEA was negatively affected by inventory reductions at the end of the quarter by our largest distribution partner in the region. The inventory reductions resulted in substantially higher sales to that distribution partner in January 2018 as compared to January 2017. It is significant to note that sales out by our distribution partners to customers in the quarter increased by approximately 24% in EMEA, which was in line with the retail sales reported by Nielsen and IRI for that period.","We are pleased with the rollout of certain SKUs in the Ultra range in EMEA markets. In 2017, we added certain SKUs of Ultra across EMEA with the introduction of Ultra Citron, which is now available in 10 additional EMEA markets in 2017. Various SKUs in the Ultra range are now sold in 35 EMEA markets. We are also pleased that Monster continued to perform well and gained market share in Belgium, Denmark, France, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, and Spain.","In Asia-Pacific, net sales in the fourth quarter decreased 5.3% in dollars and 1.9% in local currencies over the same period last year, mainly due to a correction in inventories by our bottler partners in China. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 32.4% versus 44.1% over the same period last year, largely driven by product reserves in China and India. In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 2.2%, or 10% in local currency, as compared to the same quarter last year, due to the timing of production which effectively resulted in a reduction in inventory by our distribution partner at the end of the fourth quarter. As with a number of our other overseas distributors, sales by our distributor to the retail trade and retail sales to consumers remained strong and in line with earlier periods.","In South Korea, net sales increased 43.1% or 44.9% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea, and Guam, net sales increased 25.2%, or 23.2% in local currencies, as compared to the same quarter last year. As previously mentioned, we are engaged in production trials in India with a view towards reentering the market, initially in a limited territory.","In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, gross sales in the fourth quarter increased 25.5% in dollars and 21.4% in local currencies. Net sales in the fourth quarter increased 18.9% in dollars and 14.4% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 47.1% versus 52.5% over the same period last year and 47.6% in the 2017 third quarter.","The decrease in gross profit was in part due to a decrease in sales of Burn in Brazil and Mexico as well as product returns in Peru. In Mexico, promotional allowances were higher in the fourth quarter of 2017 relative to the same quarter in 2016. Net sales increased in Brazil by 82.8% in dollars or 79.3% in local currency, largely due to the transition of Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers, which took place on November 1, 2016.","Net sales in Chile increased 1.8% in dollars but decreased 3.8% in local currency, primarily due to inventory reductions by our Coca-Cola distributors in the fourth quarter. Sales to the retail trade by our distributors in the fourth quarter increased by approximately 49% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.","Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $528.6 million compared to $377.6 million at December 31, 2016. Short-term investments were $672.9 million compared to $220.6 million at December 31, 2016. Long-term investments were $2.4 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016.","Accounts receivable increased to $449.5 million at December 31, 2017, from $448.1 million at December 31, 2016. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 43.8 days compared to 48.2 days at December 31, 2016. Inventories increased to $255.7 million from $162 million at December 31, 2016. Average days of inventory was 75 days at December 31, 2017, which includes increased inventories of Java Monster, as well as in advance of their launches, Caff\u00e9 Monster and Muscle Monster in bottles, compared to 57 days at December 31, 2016.","Monster Energy continues to innovate with new beverages and new packages. We launched Espresso Monster in two flavors and NOS Nitro Mango in the U.S. at the end of 2017. In the first quarter of 2018, we launched Caff\u00e9 Monster, a ready-to-drink energy coffee in 13.7-ounce glass bottles in three flavors, and relaunched Muscle Monster in a 15-ounce plastic bottle in two flavors.","In the first half of 2018, we plan on rebranding our two Monster extra strength SKUs into the Monster MAX line. Beginning in the second quarter of 2018, we will be discontinuing one of our two existing SKUs in this line and adding two new flavors. We are also launching Rehab White Dragon Tea. Finally capturing on the 2017 excitement of Monster Hydro in a 16.9-ounce can, we are expanding Monster Hydro into a re-sealable 25.4-ounce bottle and adding three new flavors.","In Canada in the fourth quarter, we launched Monster Energy Ultraviolet with a large customer and also launched Mutant Super Soda nationwide. In the first quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Energy Ultraviolet nationwide and Monster Hydro in a 550 ml PET bottle in three flavors, as well as Full Throttle Orange in 16-ounce cans.","We launched Monster Hydro in a 550 ml plastic bottle in United Kingdom, South Africa and Ireland during 2017. We also launched Monster Hydro in Sweden and Germany in the first quarter of 2018. We are launching Monster Energy Ultraviolet in the first quarter of 2018 in the Czech Republic, Germany, Ireland and the United Kingdom.","The Lewis Hamilton signature Monster Energy drink launched in the second quarter 2017 and was available in 24 EMEA markets by the end of 2017. We are launching the Lewis Hamilton signature Monster Energy drink in Australia and New Zealand in the 2018 first quarter.","We estimate January 2018 gross sales to be approximately 27.9% higher than in January 2017. On a foreign exchange adjusted basis, we estimate January 2018 gross sales to be approximately 25.1% higher than in January 2017. In this regard, we estimate that less than half of such increase is attributable to A, the increase in January 2018 sales following inventory reductions by certain of our international distributors that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2017; and B, initial shipments of Caff\u00e9 Monster and Muscle Monster in bottles which were launched in January 2018.","We caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores. Distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons.","We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even longer, should not necessarily be imputed to, or regarded as indicative of, results for a full quarter or any future periods.","On February 28, 2017, the company's board of directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. During the fourth quarter we purchased 0.02 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $54.99 per share for a total of $1.1 million excluding broker commissions, leaving a remaining authorization of approximately $250 million.","On February 27, 2018, the Board authorized an additional repurchase program to bring the aggregate amount available to $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock.","In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. One, we recognize the reduction in raw material costs of $25.1 million in the fourth quarter as a result of our acquisition of AFF. Two, our gross margins remain healthy. Three, U.S. Nielsen convenience market statistics for the four weeks ended February 17, 2018, reflect that the company achieved its highest market share in the energy category in dollars, and at 42.9% market share including the strategic brands. And that the Monster Energy brand achieved its highest market share in the energy category at a 38.2% market share.","Four, despite inventory reductions by certain of our international distributors, retail sales statistics from many countries around the world demonstrate that the Energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category in line with earlier periods.","Five, the new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. Six, we're excited about the prospects for our new product launches. Seven, we are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India, despite operating losses recorded during the quarter for India and China of approximately $9 million. We have successfully launched or transitioned Monster Energy drinks to Coca-Cola bottlers in a number of markets last year, and anticipate further transitions and launches this year.","I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The first question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust. Your line is now open.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yes. Thanks. Good afternoon.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Good afternoon. Hi, Bill.","Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.","Hi, Bill. How are you?","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi. Just on the gross margin side, is the three factors that impacted the fourth quarter, China reserves, raw materials having higher material costs, and then the mix, would you expect kind of all of those to have a similar impact as we move into 2018 or any of them being mitigated? How should I look at especially on the higher material costs and how should I look at that in 2018?","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Well, the higher material costs we expect to continue, particularly for aluminum. I think, you've seen in the announcements that are in play regarding aluminum and aluminum costs, so we expect an increase in aluminum. Sweetener, we'll continue to experience costs in sweeteners this year, so the only factor that will possibly diminish is inventory reserves in China. Those we don't expect to continue.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Your line is open.","Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yes. Hey. Good afternoon, guys.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Hi, Mark.","Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So I guess I wanted to ask about these inventory reserves. So what exactly is going on in China, I guess most specifically, but also why you're doing that in India? And then just sort of more broadly, I guess I get the moving parts on what you talked about from inventory reductions by bottlers outside of the U.S. but I guess if you look at it within the U.S. as well, the numbers were still on a reported basis lower than what the end demand or scanner data would have indicated. So I guess I'm curious how you're thinking about that. Is that catch-up? Did you over ship in prior quarters and sort of how did you think about that from an inventory standpoint now going forward?","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","I think, the issue in China was the demand was misjudged in summer and we ended up with excess inventory which we've needed to work through and we've made provisions for that.","In India, we've also been running some test runs and trials, and we've been having some challenges in some of the testing of ingredient levels. They use a different testing set of tests for what we do and we use around the world, and we've been having a number of debates about what the testing levels are because we were comfortable with the ingredient levels that we put in, but yet they were coming out on testing levels because of the way they extrapolate the results a little differently. But yet, that is the method that is used in India, and that has caused us some hiccups and delays in getting going because we're just struggling with the testing levels. And that's resulted in, again, some inventory and stock write-offs.","With regard to the scanner data in the U.S., I think there's been an increase in the scanner data more recently. I think the numbers are coming up. And I think that's just indicative of where the market has been, but it has improved from the latter part of last year.","Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.","We've never said that there's a perfect science between our sales to our distributors and the sales at retail. But over a period of time, one does see the correlation. And then one other thing I wanted to add on India is there are some new can regulations, labeling regulations that are being put in place, which was another reason for certain reserves in India.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Right. I agree.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Hi. Good afternoon there. I just want to clarify. You obviously said that the impact of the extra inventory could be about less than 50%, so I'm trying to do the math. Would you say it's like in the mid-teens growth and then you had an extra selling day in January 2018? So what should we be thinking on a normalized basis like you will run through or run rate on the top line product to date?","And then the other question is regarding your gross margin. I understand all the puts and takes. But in your view, you're still going to see pressure from these items into 20 \u2013 bigger pressure into 2018 on the gross margin, but it's mostly on a mix effect and on aluminum. But if you can help us guide us through the impacts, that would be great.","Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.","So on the gross margin, we don't give guidance, and it's something that the company has never done. We give the information as we have it, as we see it through the quarter. But if you wanted a kind of gross margin, a conservative gross margin looking forward, I personally, and this is a personal feeling, I would just use the gross margin for the quarter.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","That's helpful, thank you. And on the top line, I'm just trying to see it from the extra day, and obviously you said less than 50% impact. So I'm trying to reconcile the 25% or 27% FX-neutral on a quarter-to-date. Is that something we should be thinking on the mid-teens normalized days, or a bit less because of the extra day?","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","We actually described it as less than half. And the reason we did that was that what we don't know is \u2013 while there was, we believe, additional purchases by these distribution, by the distributors, we're not sure all of those additional purchases took place in January because we haven't done the analysis of specific SKUs and the purchases. And so we believe that it was less than 50%, but that is our best estimate on those numbers at this time.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Laurent Grandet of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Laurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yes, good evening, Rodney and Hilton. On the international business, how should we think about the right level of growth in the international segment? So 5% organic growth in the quarter seems extremely low. Would a yearly growth level at 25% be right, and the 30%-plus we saw in the first three quarters to be inflated by gradual increase of inventory? So I'm trying to figure out what is the right level of inventory in international to figure out the right growth level in that segment. Thank you.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Again, we described on this call what had happened with regard to inventory reductions. We also spoke about some issues with regard to China. We don't give guidance, but I think there's sufficient information for you to look at historical information and honestly make up your own estimates because we don't give guidance. It's really difficult to sit here and answer these questions where you guys are looking for guidance. We don't give guidance.","Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.","And I think we did mention that. And that's why we actually have given a lot of the Nielsen information and sales out because that is less affected by purchases of inventory and timing and production timings. And so if you look at EMEA, which is probably our largest international market, we've given you, it's close to, Nielsen's are up in EMEA close to mid-20s. And we've given you Nielsen's for the other areas as well. So those were the numbers that are showing where we expect the numbers to continue. And so when we look at the demand in ongoing sales levels for internationally, they're pretty much in line with the Nielsen numbers and the numbers that have been reported by us in previous quarters. It's clearly a choppy quarter. But that's why we think that the sales out numbers, depletions from our distributors and the best number of all is, obviously, the sales into the markets, which are measured generally reasonably reliably measured by Nielsen are the numbers that you guys should be looking to going forward.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","And that's why we give these numbers.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Caroline Levy of Macquarie. Your line is open.","Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thanks, hi there. This is on distribution and selling expenses up as a percent of sales. Could you just explain to us in an environment where there's a shortage of truckers and distribution costs are going up, how it works for you guys? Are you all third party? Are your contracts longer term? And then on the selling side, how much of that big percentage increase versus sales was relating to the China India markets?","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","So on distribution costs, we relocated our warehousing to our new warehouse in California during the quarter, and that impacted distribution costs. Regarding trucking, we have our own fleet that we operate mainly for local markets, but we depend extensively on third-party trucking. And then, Caroline, your other question was how much of the distribution costs were related to China and India, and I don't have that to hand, I'm sorry. In India, obviously it wasn't much because we're still in production trials.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good evening, guys.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Good evening.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Two quick points of clarification just because the quarter was a little bit noisy with the distributor issues. So one, just to be very clear. It seems like it was just sort of a one-month issue that not only do you not expect it to persist, but it already seems like its begun to reverse out in the month of January. So if you could just clarify on that?","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Right.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","And then point number \u2013 okay. Perfect. And then question number two, it doesn't seem like there's anything quantitatively that changes your view on the outlook for your international business. The POS data, the Nielsen data sounds very, very strong. So if you could just confirm that and include it in that response, could you also include China and whether you have a change in view there and what the company's outlook, and what it's capable of achieving in that market? Thank you.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","I think that generally international is in line with Nielsen and what we've already indicated. We are comfortable with that and we think that basically our sales momentum remains intact for the brand.","In the China market, that has been a challenging market, and it's been costly and we've incurred \u2013 obviously incurred losses.","We knew we would do so, and your question is hard, and not dissimilar to any other companies who have entered the Chinese market. We are continuing to persist with it. We've obviously \u2013 we have the resources, we've put resources behind the brand. We've put marketing and promotion behind the brand. And those are continuing to obviously impact our bottom line. But we see those as long-term opportunities, and we've got to look to establishing the brand in the long-term in China. That's our objective and we are confident we'll get there, but we just got to have \u2013 it's going to take time to do so.","And again, India we are \u2013 we don't believe India in the shorter term is as big a market or potential as China, but it also has just been again some ups and downs in getting going. We are confident that we will get going, but it has \u2013 we've set up with staff, we've set up with operations there, and that clearly has affected our bottom line. Those amounts will start eventually to improve as we continue to increase our sales and are able to manage our expenses in those countries more efficiently going forward.","Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.","Yes. I'd just like to add that the group that has worked with this company for a number of years will remember that it took a number of years for us to become profitable in Europe and in EMEA generally, and there are a lot of lessons that are being learned in China every day. We've got some of our own executive staff over there, on secondment, and our bottling partners are just very much on board and we haven't heard anything negative about the long-term potential for the brand from our partners.","Operator","Thank you and this concludes the Q&A session. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Sacks for closing remarks.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Thank you. On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company.

Sir, you may begin.","Rodney Sacks","Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, is with me; as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance, and trends.","Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the Company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call.","Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission; including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed today including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and forward-looking statements, for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes and designated with asterisks in the consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated March 1, 2017. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section.","On October 14, 2016, we announced a three-for-one stock split of the company's common stock to be effective in the form of a 200% stock dividend. The common stock dividend was issued on November 9, 2016, and the company's common stock began trading at the split adjusted price on November 10, 2016. Accordingly all per share amounts; common stock outstanding, and common stock repurchase, presented on this call have been adjusted retroactively where applicable to reflect the stock split.","Sales in the beverage industry in the fourth quarter continued to be soft globally. In the fourth quarter, net sales was $753.8 million, up 16.8% from $645.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The company achieved record gross sales of $848.8 million, up 14.2% from $743.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The comparative net and gross sales of $645.4 million and $743.2 million respectively for the 2015 fourth quarter were impacted by advanced purchases made by the companies customers due to a pre-announced price increase, effective August 31, 2015, on certain of the company's Monster Energy brand energy drinks. The company estimates that both net and gross sales for the 2015 fourth quarter were reduced by approximately $11 million and $12 million respectively, as a result of such advanced purchases. Net and gross sales for the 2016 fourth quarter after adjusting the 2015 fourth quarter comparatives for advanced purchase increased by 14.8% and 12.4% respectively.","Unfavorable currency exchange rates reduced net sales by approximately $3.3 million and gross sales by approximately $5.9 million in the 2016 fourth quarter.","Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the fourth quarter was 66.1% as compared to 62.5% for the comparable 2015 fourth quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to cost of goods savings as a result of the AFF transaction and product mix as well as reduced promotional allowances as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter. We estimate the lower promotional allowances as a percentage of sales as compared to prior periods, together with the reduction of Java Monster sales had the effect of increasing gross profit percentage by approximately 2% in the fourth quarter.","Distribution cost as a percentage of net sales were 3.2% compared to 2016 and 2015 fourth quarters.","Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12% compared to 12.9% in the same quarter a year ago, they increased in absolute dollars. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increased sponsorship and endorsement costs and premiums.","General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 17.5% as compared to 11% in the same quarter last year. General and administrative costs excluding distributed termination expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 11.4% in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 10.5% for the 2015 fourth quarter.","Payroll expenses were up $12.3 million primarily to support the strategic brands that we acquired from Coca-Cola and stock-based compensation, which is a non-cash item, was $3.1 million higher.","Distributor termination expenses were $46.3 million in the fourth quarter as compared to $3.3 million in the 2015 fourth quarter. Regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, commercial ingredients, used safety and sale of the company's products were $5.1 million in the 2016 fourth quarter as compared to $6 million in the 2015 fourth quarter.","Our effective tax rate in the quarter decreased from 39.5% in the 2015 fourth quarter to 29.9% in the 2016 fourth quarter primarily due to an increase in the domestic production deduction as well as an increase in the stock compensation deduction as a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance effective January 1, 2016, under which excess tax benefits are recorded in net income.","Net income was $172.9 million in the 2016 fourth quarter compared to net income of $138.7 million in the 2015 fourth quarter, an increase of 24.7%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 617.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 to 580.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, as a result of share buybacks, including the modified Dutch tender auction, which was completed in June 2016. Net income was impacted by the substantial increase in distributor termination expenses previously mentioned above.","Diluted earnings per share for the 2016 fourth quarter increased to 32.6% to $0.30 from $0.22 in the fourth quarter of 2015. We estimate that distributor terminations expenses in the 2016 fourth quarter of $46.3 million negatively affected diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.05 per share after tax. Distributor termination expense for the 2015 fourth quarter had no effect on diluted earnings per share after tax.","We refer you to the press release for the specific factors affecting profitability for the 2016 and 2015 fourth quarters respectively.","Turning to the full-year results. The company achieved record gross sales of $3.5 billion for the full-year, up 12.2% from $3.1 billion in 2015. Net sales were up 12% from $2.7 billion to $3 billion. Gross and net sales for the year were adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, totaling $31 million and $22.3 million respectively for the year.","Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 63.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 60% for the year ended December 31, 2015.","Operating income was up 21.4% to $1.1 billion from $893.7 million in 2015. Our effective tax rate decreased to 34% in 2016 from 38.7% in 2015. Net income was $712.7 million, up 30.4% over net income of $546.7 million in 2015, and diluted earnings per share increased 25.6% to $1.19 from $0.95 in 2015.","We refer you to the press release for the specific factors impacting profitability for the 2016 and 2015 financial years respectively.","We have made good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola Bottlers globally.

According to Nielsen, Monster's new medical distribution in the traditional freight channel grew from 10% in January 2016 to 24% in January 2017.","The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single month which was a short period that may offer be materially influenced positively and\/or negatively by sales in the offshore convenience chain which dominate the market.","Sales in the offshore convenience chain turn to be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drinks brands during a particular month. Consequently such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.","According to Nielsen in a 13-week period ended December 2016, the actual 13-week periods varied by a few weeks between different markets.

We remain confident about the potential of this brand.","We are planning to launch of our new Hydro line which is a non-carbonated largely treated energy drink, is packaged in a unique 16.9 ounce PET can, the size which is exclusive to us in the U.S. at this time.

On a foreign exchange adjusted basis, we estimate January 2017 gross sales to be approximately 11.6% higher than in January 2016. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances where our boxes are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates of which we invoice such bottlers. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.","With regard to litigation between the Company and the San Francisco City Attorney, we advice that the action was settled in January 2017 on terms acceptable to company. The settlement does not include any penalty under California's Unfair Competition Law, any funding or admission of liability or wrongdoing or any change in the formula -- to the formulation of Monster Energy Drinks or to whom the drinks may be sold.","In consideration of release of clients and dismissal of the action with prejudice, the company agreed to maintain the various current marketing and labeling practices for its energy drink products through December 31, 2018.","On February 28, 2017, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. No availability remains under the previously authorized share repurchase programs.","In conclusion I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. One, as previously reported our acquisition of AFF represents an important milestone for the company and gives us ownership of our proprietary formulas for our principal products. We recognize the reduction in operating costs of $22 million in the fourth quarter as a result of the acquisition.","Two, North American and international gross margins remained healthy.","Three, while the U.S. Nielsen market statistics showed that the energy category slowed in the U.S. towards the end of the fourth quarter equivalent getting of the first quarter -- equivalent market statistics from many countries around the world showed that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category. Currency exchange rates continue to affect our results.","The new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum, and add to the company's sales. We are excited about the prospect for our new product launches. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China, one of the largest energy drink markets globally. We have successfully transitioned additional international countries to Coca-Cola bottlers in the fourth quarter and will be transitioning a number of other markets to Coca-Cola bottlers in 2017.","I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions].","Thank you. And our first question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Bill Chappell","Just a little more color around the fourth quarter on both tenants. You said, lower promotional allowances and then also on the top-line. On the promotional allowances, is that something that that was more year-over-year comparison or is that something that we should expect in general going forward in 2017? And then on the top-line was there, you may be could you break out was there much benefit from kind of the Mutant sell-in, from the China sell-in or was that negligible to kind of the top-line growth?","Rodney Sacks","I think most of the answers comparatively based on a quarter by -- comparable quarter for last year.","Bill Chappell","Okay. You said it was a benefit to gross profit that's why I was wondering.","Rodney Sacks","I think we made the point, Bill, when we spoke about gross profit that the additional promotional allowances in the quarter and other items had the impact of increasing gross profit margin by approximately 2%. So in that I think what we try to suggest that these promotional allowances, the reduction in promotional allowances may not necessarily endure over the quarters in 2017.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Mark Astrachan","Hey guys, just one housekeeping. I think you still need to answer Bill's other question on I think Mutant sell-in. Also my question is just on general sell-in and sell through trends, so you touched on this at the Investor Meeting in January about untracked channels contributing more than you'd seen historically, obviously that disconnect had widened pretty substantially here. So may be if you could sort of touch on what you think is contributing to that and I'm talking specifically about the U.S. may be sort of methodology gathering what you're doing in universities, foodservice, vending et cetera, just sort of much specificity there if you could give would be helpful? Please.","Rodney Sacks","We're just dealing with Mutant. Mutant we went through this a few times. We repositioned Mutant in selected channels at full pricing. We've not been aggressive in our promotion. If you look at the average pricing in Nielsen, Mutant is at average pricing in all the different periods depending which period you look at it's still above 196. If you compare that, that's quite a substantial premium to the other soft drinks and its main competitive soft drink that we're looking at competing, with which is Mountain Dew. And so we have strategically not promoted Mutant during the winter period. We are taking steps to deal with expanded distribution. We will obviously increase our promotional and other activities around the brand as we continue to go into spring and summer.","So when we look at the numbers and we look at the sales per point, we think the sales per point are pretty good in relation to a lot of the other well established brands in the area. If you look at the last four weeks that has dropped off a little bit again because of the -- we believe the lack of promotional spend and behind the brand that that was intentional in this period of time.","It is a soda and we are looking to as I expand distribution, expand the channels and also become substantially more active in the promotion that's driving us starts going into spring now. So we are still positive about the brand and its prospects and sell to particularly where we have seen at the substantial price premium, we've seen substantial sales per point that are higher than a lot of very well established brands that are being around for a long time.","Hilton Schlosberg","I think there is one other point that we need to focus on and that is that the permanent shift will be done and the placements will be done in March. So we launched Mutant off-cycle, which means that in many cases the product is on space where the bottlers could find space for the product. And in March, the sets, the new sets will become available in the convenience and gas channel where the product is sold.","Rodney Sacks","There are another, couple of other key channels where we have secured listings and we will be. Those are things will start coming through in April and May. So we do have ongoing plans to basically ramp up for put effort and focus behind the brand.","Hilton Schlosberg","I think it's also anticipated that the -- this is not a full blowing launch; it is also called a bubble up launch. There is only launch in convenience retail in chains in convenience retail that was rolled out to Mom and Pop to a limited degree and that's where we're at this time. As Rodney said, there will be further listing that have been secured that will take place starting in April.","Rodney Sacks","Then just talking about the Mark's question, there is a bigger divergence but that is the fact of matter is that the non-major channel are continuing to expand for us. We are dealing in the non-major area. We also have some concerns about the accuracy and the represented nature of the convenience data which does seem to us to be a little more inaccurate in relation to as compared for example to grocery where we think there is a closer correlation and a better read. And that's just a fact of life. But we are where we are on our sales and we continue to see increases, although clearly there is some softening in the convenience channel.","Hilton Schlosberg","And also don't forget that the Java's shortages that we experienced, they also affect.","Rodney Sacks","Yes, affect the whole channel and whole category.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Amit Sharma","Hi, just a quick navigation going back to the question there is no case to sort of like the inventory build-up in the channels because of divergent Euro [ph] sales?","Rodney Sacks","Sorry. Just say that again?","Amit Sharma","So we shouldn't view there is inventory build-up in the channel as suggested by the divergent Euro sales and slowdown in channel, you're not seeing inventory build-up there?","Rodney Sacks","No, not that we've seen. And I think that the bottlers would be -- will be building up inventory of Monster in their system either.","Amit Sharma","Got it. And then as we think about Hydro launching later this year, would you expect Hydro also to be a bubble up launch or would you expect that to be a little bigger launch more in line with your traditional products?","Rodney Sacks","I think it would be -- it will be more in line with our traditional launches. But again we generally do launch through a bubble up process, somewhat more or less extensive but that's generally how we've always launched our products, it's regarding to selective chains and into launch but it will be a more extensive launch than we had for Mutant. Mutant was very exceptional launch and it was very limited by design and by strategy and being off cycle Hydro will be a more broader based launch going out. But clearly initial focus will be on the convenience and gas and independent channels, et cetera.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Kevin Grundy","Thanks. Good evening guys. First one, housekeeping question just point of clarification on the January gross sales update, if I'm not mistaken, there is an extra selling day in the month of January and then I think that there is one less in the first quarter. So Hilton perhaps if you could just clarify that that would be helpful. And then the broader question on Brazil, which looks like it's starting to bounce back now with the distributor change behind you. How high can that share go, how quickly can you guys ramp in that market. Can you give us any sort of parameters for which you think you can grow market share it's like the 27% that you have in Chile is that, is that reasonable and over what period of time. Thanks.","Rodney Sacks","I think there is an extra selling day in January.","Hilton Schlosberg","Extra selling day in January, that is correct.","Rodney Sacks","Yes. And I'm not sure about the quarter but in my review one less in the quarter. We know there is one less in February but we haven't done the exercise. So I think just mathematically that is right.","Hilton Schlosberg","Yes, exactly. We're -- just to be clear, I mean, we run our business quarter-by-quarter and while selling days obviously are important because sales have generated on each day. We've never looked at our business and never tried to explain our business based on one or less selling day and I just want to be clear on that.","Rodney Sacks","On Brazil, Brazil a very unique market. The country at the moment is struggling obviously talk of it being almost in the depression and so there are challenges. We also have a group of 10 bottlers; it's a little bit different to Chile. Chile there were two main bottlers they really, we started to have some pretty -- we really had some pretty good momentum for the brand. It was well established, it doesn't have a deep distribution but where it was, it was already selling into the high-teens and doing pretty nicely.","So when the two Coke bottlers in Chile took it over, they really didn't price the brand and obviously we're able to sort of more structured market, we're able to expand the market, rather up probably more quickly and more I think efficiently than is the case in Brazil. And so the results have been very good. And we've been very encouraged by the results.","In the case of the Brazilian market, it is a much more non-traditional market you have literally well over a million of these little traditional stores all over the place and they are audit get you, audit of service and grow invariably, there is a very, very large and interpret wholesale system that helps get to these stores and it's just you're just not comparing apples-and-apples. So we've got to manage a group of 10 odd bottlers in a very different environment, countries and also that is going through tough financial conditions at the moment. But that being said, we think that will take some time, but as it has in many of the current markets where you do deal with these very big bottlers or basically groups of bottlers it takes time for them to get coordinated and get their system going. But when it does start going, it does really work, it does improve and so we're very encouraged by what we've seen.","We are at a point now where we are selling at a rate which is higher than we've ever sold even when we were with our previous distributor at the peak before we announced the KO transaction and they tended to lose interest in the brand and stop putting the effort behind this because they were also a good distributor. And so we're encouraged by where we're going but it will take time to build up. The good news is that it's a big energy market. We do quite nicely with Burn there and really these by far the largest player is Red Bull. That is really our main competitor and we are at sort of a similar price point, which for us means that we would -- gives us a lot of opportunity to grow into that market against the Red Bull share which is at a premium price and is not at the low-end. They do have low end brands but at least we know there is a lot of good business to be gone off at this but it's going to take time to develop.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Laurent Grandet","Hi Rod, hi Hilton. A quick follow-up on Mutant and you mentioned earlier this year the share that you would be launching in Mutant in Wal-Mart in Q2 this year. Could you please give us a bit more color my understanding was it, it would be about 1,000 stores from April, with its first shipment in March. Should we think now differently or --?","Rodney Sacks","I'm not sure, not sure where you got that from.","Laurent Grandet","Okay. Well that's I mean a question I ask at some point and to some retailers and so are you; are you confirming or not confirming?","Rodney Sacks","Not confirming anything.","Laurent Grandet","Okay. So I've got a chance then for a second question. Regarding the on-premise, I mean you mentioned, I mean you're making lots of progress there. Two quarters ago, you mentioned, I mean you are testing in McDonalds and Dunkin Donuts my understanding here is that you would be launching in Dunkin Donuts. So could you abate us on those two tests and either any other big customers we should think off from that you are making progress?","Rodney Sacks","Well McDonalds the test is continuing, they don't make mutinous decision, so that test is continuing. And with Dunkin Donuts, we are distributed in a number of their outlets, so that's not. I mean we alluded earlier to the fact that we were launching Mutant in a number of -- number of chains later this year and you can read into that, but certainly one of them is a major retailer.","Hilton Schlosberg","I think it's premature at this time to give more detail on that launch. We'll start going through, as we said in spring and then I think that would be in a much better position to give you much more color on Mutant's and the activities that we have then behind it when we report our first quarter results in the first week of May.","Operator","Thank you. And this concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Rodney Sacks for any closing remarks.","Rodney Sacks","On the half of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the Company. We continue to believe in the Company and our growth strategy, and remain committed to continuing to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the Company, both at home and abroad, and in particular, to expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottler system internationally.","We are also particularly excited by the new opportunities that we have going forward, with a portfolio of energy drink products throughout the world, comprised of our Monster Energy brand, together with the strategic brands, as well as Mutant. Thank you very much for your attendance.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect.

A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section.","In August 2014, Monster Beverage and The Coca-Cola Company entered into definitive agreements for a long-term strategic partnership that we believe will accelerate growth for Monster in the fast growing global energy drink category. Under the agreements, The Coca-Cola Company will acquire an approximate 16.7% ownership interest in Monster, following the issuance of shares to The Coca-Cola Company and will transfer ownership of its worldwide energy business to Monster, which in turn will transfer its nonenergy business to the Coca-Cola Company.","Monster and The Coca-Cola Company will amend their current distribution agreements in the U.S. and Canada to expand distribution into additional territories. Additionally, the Coca-Cola Company will become Monster's preferred distribution partner globally and Monster will become The Coca-Cola Company's exclusive energy play.","We believe that this partnership will strategically align both companies for the long term by combining the strength of The Coca-Cola Company's worldwide bottling system with Monster's dedicated focus and expertise as a leading energy player globally. We believe that this distribution arrangement will accelerate Monster's opportunity to grow internationally. The transaction, which is subject to customary closing conditions, is expected to close in early 2015. We're excited by the addition of The Coca-Cola Company energy brands to our Monster portfolio, which will provide us with complementary product offerings in many geographies as well as access to new channels, including vending and specialty accounts.","As previously communicated, we plan to review all options available after the transaction closes, and we received the funds due to the company in terms of the agreements to return a substantial amount of cash to our shareholders.","Turning to the business. During the third quarter, trends in the beverage industry continued to show weakness, although sales in the energy drink category continued to grow in the mid-single digits. In the third quarter, the company achieved record gross sales of $738.1 million, up 7.5% from the $686.6 million.","Net sales were $636 million, up 7.7% from $590.4 million. Our original Monster Green energy drink continued to perform well and grew in excess of the growth of the category in the United States as a whole. Sales of our Ultra line continued to show good growth in the United States during the third quarter. During the quarter, we launched Monster Energy Ultra Black as a summer promotion with 7-Eleven. This promotion was successful, and we are evaluating whether to launch Ultra Black as a permanent item in 2015.","We launched Monster Energy Unleaded, which is a carbonated version of our Green energy drink but contains no caffeine, at the end of the quarter. We also launched Monster Energy Ultra Sunrise, a carbonated energy drink, which contains 0 calories and 0 sugar and which is our fourth permanent item in our Ultra line at the end of the quarter.","Finally, during the quarter, we launched M3 Monster Super Concentrate in glass bottles as well as a coffee Monster Energy drink in Japan.","During the quarter, we also repositioned \u00dcbermonster, which was previously sold in 500 ml glass bottles, into 18.6 ounce resealable cans and lined price \u00dcbermonster with Monster Energy import.","In addition, our repositioned Punch Monster and Juice Monster lines are both achieving increased distribution and sales.","Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was up 1.7 percentage points to 53.8% from 52.1% in the third quarter of last year. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to lower cost of certain sweeteners and certain other raw materials, price increases in our 24-ounce Monster Energy brand energy drinks and our Peace Tea line as well as changes in product sales mix.","Gross profit percentages achieved in the third quarter both in North America as well as internationally were higher than in the comparable quarter in 2013. Operating income was up 25.4% to $189.9 million from $151.4 million in the 2013 comparable quarter.","During the third quarter, our operating income was positively affected by the operating income contributed by international operations, particularly Europe and Japan. Operating income was also higher in Mexico.","In fact, our operations outside of North America delivered operating income of $9.4 million as compared to an operating loss of $5.2 million in the same quarter last year. Consolidated selling expenses in dollars were lower than last year although general and administrative expenses were higher due to increased payroll expenses.","While sponsorship expenses were marginally higher than last year, in dollars, they were lower as a percentage of net sales. Cost of our TDM MET program were lower, largely driven by reductions in those programs in Europe. Additionally, premiums in point-of-sale costs were lower.","Results for the 2014 third quarter continued to be impacted by expenses related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion ingredients, usage, safety and sales of the company's Monster Energy brand energy drinks. Such expenses were $4.9 million in the 2014 third quarter compared with $6 million for the 2013 third quarter.","Foreign currency losses during the quarter increased primarily due to our foreign currency transactions in Australia, Canada, Chile, Japan, Mexico and South Africa.","The effective tax rate decreased from 38.8% to 35.6%, primarily due to profits earned in certain foreign subsidiaries that had no related tax expense as a result of the prior establishment of valuation allowances on their respective deferred tax assets.","Net income was $121.6 million, up 31.9% over net income of $92.2 million earned during the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share increased 31.7% to $0.70 from $0.53 in the 2013 comparable quarter.","According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through October 25, 2014, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including shots, increased by 4.8% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 8% in the 13-week period while sales of Red Bull increased by 6.2%. Sales of Rockstar decreased by 8.6%. 5-Hour decreased by 6.1%, and AMP decreased by 9.6%. Sales of NOS increased by 33.9%, and Full Throttle increased by 5%.","According to Nielsen reports, for the 4 weeks ended October 25, 2014, sales of energy drinks in the convenience and gas channel in dollars increased by 4.8% over the comparable period in 2013. Sales of Monster increased by 7.4% over the comparable period last year, while sales of Red Bull increased by 6.8%. And NOS was up 14.7%, Rockstar was down 13.3%, 5-Hour was down 8.1%, and AMP was down 9.5%.","According to Nielsen for the 4 weeks ended October 25, 2014, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, increased by 0.09 points over the comparable period a year ago to 36.3%, against Red Bull's share, which was lower than Monster's market share at 34%; Rockstar's share was lower at 6.7%; 5-Hour's share was lower at 8.7%; while NOS' share was higher at 4.1%.","According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended October 25, 2014, sales of Energy + Coffee Drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 11.7% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 6.3% higher than in the comparable period last year, while Starbucks' Doubleshot Energy was 18.7% higher. Java Monster's sales continued to exceed those of Starbucks' Doubleshot Energy.","According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended October 18, 2014, the energy drink category declined 1%, while Monster sales decreased 11%. Our market share decreased 2.7 points to 26.2% over the comparable period last year. Red Bull sales increased 3%, and its market share increased 1.7 points to 38.9%. Rockstar's sales increased 14%, and its market share increased 2.3 points to 17.5%.","Monster's market share was negatively impacted over this period by Red Bull's summer edition launch with 7-Eleven and Monster's failure to have a comparable promotional activity this year with 7-Eleven, due to conflicting priorities from our distribution partner in Canada.","According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 17.6% in the month of September 2014. Monster sales increased 18.2%. Our market share increased 0.2 points to 33.8% against the comparable period last year. Red Bull sales decreased 14.8%, and its market share decreased by 8.8 points to 23.1%. Boost's sales increased 7.1%, and its market share decreased 1.4 points to 14.1%. Vive 100, new in 2013, has grown to 19.1% market share, while Coke's market share, represented by Burn and Gladiator together, decreased 3.9 points to 6.4%.","The Nielsen statistics for Mexico covers single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and\/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.","According to Nielsen in the 13-week periods ended September and October 2014 -- the actual 13-week periods varied by a few weeks between different markets and countries -- Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 7.8% to 7.9% in Belgium; from 8.3% to 9.8% in Germany; From 10.6% to 11.4% in Great Britain; from 22% to 22.7% in Spain; and from 7.2% to 8% in Sweden. Monster's retail market share in value for the 13 weeks ending September\/October 2014 as compared to the same periods last year decreased from 21.1% to 19% in South Africa, although volume was up; and in France from 17.5% to 16.7%. According to IRI, Monster's market share in Greece for the 13 weeks to the end of September increased from 22.9% to 27.3%.","I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in the EMEA vary from country to country.","According to Nielsen for the month of September 2014, in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased to 11.8% as compared to 8.8% last year; and in Brazil, Monster's market share for the month of September 2014 grew from 3.5% to 5.7% as compared to the same period last year.","Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 7.6% to $609.9 million for the 3 months ended September 30, 2014, from $566.8 million in the same period in 2013. Contribution margin for the DSD segment increased 19.4% from $194.9 million to $232.7 million. Gross sales of our Original Monster Green energy drink continued to increase in the quarter, as did sales of both our Ultra and Java Monster lines. The increase in sales of these products was partially offset by lower sales in certain SKUs, including Monster Energy Absolutely Zero, Lo-Carb Monster Energy and the Monster Rehab line and Import.","Gross sales of Peace Tea for the third quarter were higher than in the comparable period in 2013. Net sales for the company's Warehouse segment increased 10.1% to $26 million, from $23.7 million for the 3 months ended September 30, 2014, primarily due to increased sales by volume of aseptic juices and Hubert's Lemonades. Contribution margin increased from a loss of $2.2 million in the prior year third quarter to a profit of $0.6 million.","For the 3 months ended September 30, 2014, gross sales to retail groceries, specialty chains and wholesalers represented 3% of gross sales, down from 4% in the comparable period in 2013.","Gross sales to club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represented 10% of sales, up from 9% in the comparable period in 2013.","Gross sales to full-service distributors represented 62% of sales, down from 63% in the comparable period in 2013.","Gross sales internationally represented 24% of sales, up from 22% in 2013. Other sales of 1% for the period were lower than the 2% in the comparable period in 2013.","Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the third quarter amounted to $173.2 million compared to $151.6 million in the same quarter in 2013. Included in such sales were sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas.","Net sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa in the third quarter of 2014 in dollars were at $75 million, 7% higher than the same period last year. Monster continues to gain momentum and increased its market-shared retail in EMEA and in particular, in Greece, Spain, Great Britain, Italy, Germany and Sweden. We're continuing to see the benefits of the strategic changes implemented last year.","Our EMEA division traded profitably during the third quarter of 2014, which contributed to the reduction in the effective tax rate of the company.","Net sales in Asia-Pacific grew 79.4% versus the comparable quarter last year, while net sales in South America grew 65.6% over the comparable 2013 third quarter.","In Mexico, growth sales were marginally higher for the quarter.","Japan contributed a meaningful operating profit as sales there continued to increase. Our distributor in Brazil continues to secure increased distribution in sales.","We are continuing with our expansion strategy in international markets. Although we decided to defer proposed launches in certain countries for the future following the strategic partnership that was entered into with The Coca-Cola Company during the quarter. We are continuing with our strategy to secure local production in certain of our international markets in order to improve gross margins, reduce freight, reduce damages and assist in mitigating the effects of exchange rate fluctuations. The Coca-Cola Company partnership should also help in achieving this objective. In the interim, we are continuing with our plan to produce Monster in India as well as in South Africa.","Distribution expenses on a consolidated basis as a percentage of net sales in the third quarter were 4.5% versus 4.6% in the comparable quarter in 2013. Other selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 10.1% higher in the quarter versus 12% in the comparable period in 2013. While sponsorships and endorsement costs were marginally higher in dollars, they were lower as a percentage of net sales. Premiums, point-of-sale costs and the TDM MET program costs were lower during the quarter, both in dollars and as a percentage of net sales.","General and administrative expenses were lower, although payroll costs was slightly higher, with the result that overall general and administrative costs increased 1.4% in the third quarter. Included in general and administrative costs were increased professional service costs, of which $2.6 million related to The Coca-Cola transaction. We are continuing to work towards reducing our overall operating costs in our international markets.","Our effective tax rate in the 2014 third quarter was 35.6% compared to 38.8% in the 2013 third quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of profits earned in foreign subsidiaries that have no related tax expense as a result of the prior establishment of valuation allowance on their deferred tax assets.","During the third quarter, no share repurchases were made under the board-authorized share repurchase program.","Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $408.3 million compared to $211.3 million at December 31, 2013. Short-term investments, of which auction rate securities comprised $4.8 million were $588 million compared to $402.2 million at December 31, 2013. Long-term investments increased to $28.4 million from $9.8 million at December 31, 2013. Accounts receivable net increased to $330.2 million from $291.6 million at December 31, 2013. Days outstanding for trade accounts receivables were 40.5 days at September 30, 2014, and 44.7 days at September 30, 2013, compared to 40.1 days at December 31, 2013.","Inventories decreased to $205.4 million from $221.4 million at December 31, 2013. Average days of inventory was 62.9 days at September 30, 2014, which was lower than the 78.7 days of inventory at September 30, 2013, and lower than the 75.6 days of inventory at December 31, 2013.","We are planning to launch Monster Energy Ultra Citron and Monster Rehab, Peach Tea and Energy early in 2015.","Due to the strong response received to our summer promotion of the Monster Energy Valentino Rossi drink in Europe and South Africa, we have decided to convert that item into a permanent SKU in the existing countries in which it is being sold and to launch it in additional European countries in 2015.","Gross sales in October 2014 were approximately 9.2% higher than in October 2013. The increase in gross sales in the United States were 7.4% and the North America was 9.1%. We caution again that sales in a single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall and the timing of promotions in retail stores, and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period.","On the litigation front, the litigation between the company and the City Attorney of San Francisco is proceeding through the discovery process stage, the court has issued an order setting the case for a 2-week bench trial beginning in February 8, 2016. On August 6, 2014, the Attorney General for the State of New York issued a second subpoena seeking additional documents and the deposition of a company employee. The company has moved to quash the second subpoena. The briefing on the motion is currently ongoing.","In the Kona federal securities case, plaintiffs have filed a motion seeking approval of the settlement. The settlement class members have until December 1, 2014, to object to opt out of the settlement and the final approval hearing is scheduled for January, 29, 2015. Again, once finalized, the settlement will result in the action being dismissed with prejudice. The proposed settlement contains no admission of liability or wrongdoing on the part of any of the defendants, each of whom continues to deny all the allegations. The full amount of the settlement will be paid by the company's insurance carriers.","The company assumes no obligation to update any statements made with respect to ongoing litigation and regulatory matters, including with respect to the foregoing disclosures, whether as to new information, future events or otherwise other than as required by law.","Given the current litigation and pending regulatory requests, we will refrain from answering questions or commenting further on these specific subjects. We are happy, of course, to answer questions that you may have about our products in general or about the third quarter as best as we can after we've concluded our discussion on the business.","In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. North American and international gross margins are healthy. Our 2014 third quarter gross margins in North America as well as internationally, generally, were higher than in the comparable quarter in 2013. U.S. Nielsen market statistics show the energy category continues to grow, that Monster Energy's growth is still outpacing the growth of the category as a whole.","The new additions to the Monster family that were introduced during 2013 and this year are continuing to gain market share and contributing positively to the overall increase in the company's sales. Our recently repositioned Punch Monster and Juice Monster lines were positively received by distributors and consumers, and both distribution and sales of those lines continue to increase.","We believe that Monster Unleaded and Ultra Sunrise lines that were introduced at the end of the quarter will commence contributing to sales in the fourth quarter and through 2015. Unleaded with no caffeine is designed to attract new consumers, as well as to increase usage occasions by existing Monster Green energy drink consumers.","Turning to international markets. We are pleased with the performance of our international expansion, particularly in Japan, Spain, Germany, Great Britain, Sweden, Greece and Brazil.","I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bill Chappell of SunTrust.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just on the international business. Trying to understand 2 things. One, how much of an impact did the Canadian, I guess, 7-Eleven issue have on the total business? And then two, kind of longer term, as we look at the Coke partnership, does that change your near-term plan? Do you pullback? Do we expect some transition issues until it's signed? Just trying to understand if maybe there were countries that you were planning on going into or planning on expanding that you might, kind of, put on hold until everything is done. And how we should look at that over the next couple of quarters.","Rodney C. Sacks","I think the Canadian impact was not substantial but it was there during the quarter. And I think you could see from the numbers that we showed for North America in October, that you saw the improvement coming through from Canada. And that's just timing and promotional issues. And we will do a promotion, I think, with 7-Eleven but it didn't fall into the quarter with Ultra Black. That is still -- that is being planned for Canada. With respect to the transition: The markets were not, at this point, major markets or markets that, I think, would really impact the results in -- certainly in the near term, but we just, obviously, felt it was important for at least -- make the disclosure that we had in fact deferred some of those introductions. Going forward, we just believe that we are going to continue to go forward pretty much as planned. There always is, obviously, a little bit of an effect on this -- on our results through the interim stage, because while we, obviously, are encouraging our distributors to continue giving the brand the same level of attention and investment, and we've tried to assure them that we will, obviously, compensate them appropriately, there is still some distributors who will naturally pull back and because of concerns as to whether they will continue to keep the brand and when there will be a transition. So that uncertainty, clearly, will have some effect. Although we don't believe it will be major, we do believe there will be some effect. But we really can't tell more than that. We are obviously starting to make plans for the transition. But again, until the transaction closes, there is -- we are limited in what we can do. But we are looking to close the transaction early in 2015 as we previously have indicated.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just 2 quick ones for me. On Rehab, Rodney, I was wondering if you could provide any perspective on that? And are there any plans there to kind of get that brand reinvigorated? And then the second question is our understanding is trends in the energy drink category are really taking off at Walmart and I was just hoping you can provide some context on kind of what's going on there. Is it just more cold cooler placement up by the register? If you could just give us some context on that?","Rodney C. Sacks","I think that if you look at Rehab, the drop off that we -- or the decrease that we had experienced at the time we introduced -- or pretty much close to the time we introduced the Ultra line, has fallen off and the numbers are looking much better. That's still a major line for us. We have taken steps to just focus consumers on what the product is and to try and communicate better to consumers that it's an iced tea, that it's not carbonated. We are looking at some slight changes to the graphics, probably to align it more with a tea product, as opposed to, sort of, a carbonated energy drink, which has a stronger presence in a black can, traditionally. And we also believe that by some other minor adjustments, which we'll make to the line, we believe that we will have a good prospect of, basically, improving sales going forward. We are also introducing the Peach Tea, which is a nice variant. And so we believe that, that line will continue to grow again, but that's part of what we're doing. There was obviously some impact on that line from the introduction of the Ultra. We are seeing more of a comeback on -- also on our Lo-Carb now in the last quarter, that had dropped off more significantly in previous quarters and the numbers are improving on that product as well. And then finally, with regard to Absolutely Zero, which did have some fall off as well from the -- at that same time as we introduced the Ultra line, we have -- we're also taking steps to redesign the can and do things, and we're actually making some further improvements to the redesigned can. So we are hopeful we'll be able to get those sub lines or -- growing again.","Thomas J. Kelly","Maybe I just could comment on Walmart. What's happened at Walmart is that they expanded the category both on the warm and on the cold shelf. We've invested in cooler placement with the organization, and I really would encourage you to visit a few stores and see the expanded sets and the positioning that we have now in the Walmart stores. It's actually very, very interesting, and we're excited with it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Amit Sharma of BMO Capital Markets.","Rodney C. Sacks","Hello?","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Powers of UBS.","Rodney C. Sacks","We're not -- we're hearing silence.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Faucher of JP Morgan.","Rodney C. Sacks","Seems to be something wrong with the line. We are not getting any of the participants. We can't hear anything.","[Technical Difficulty]","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So just 2 quick questions here, I hope. One, can you talk a little bit about foreign exchange and the impact on the international business as we look at it? Obviously, there's been a lot of volatility. So can you talk a little bit about -- less so on the top line but more so on the margins, how you feel like you're situated to deal with some of this volatility in terms of transactional FX, et cetera? And then a separate question, which is as you talk about returning some of this cash to shareholders, can you talk about what your criteria are going to be and how we should think about that as we head into 2015?","Rodney C. Sacks","Hilton will discuss the foreign exchange, John.","Hilton H. Schlosberg","John, we hedged our balance sheet transactions in various currencies and the results -- the overall results in the fourth -- in the third quarter was not a material amount, and you'll see that in the Q that will be released, hopefully, tomorrow. Turning on -- turning to the cash that we are -- that we're discussing and we'll be discussing more with the board tomorrow, there are a number of programs that we are looking at and a number of opportunities to return cash to shareholders that is kind of premature at this stage as the board will be in discussions on this point tomorrow.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. If I can just follow up on the FX piece in terms of -- less so on the balance sheet transactions but more so, let's say, on dollar-based raw materials in foreign countries and finished goods and things like that. Is that something where you think that can have a meaningful impact on some of the international profitability, again, given some of the swings you're having in these currencies?","Thomas J. Kelly","It hasn't to date, and we don't anticipate that it will to any significant degree. You're talking, in the quarter, of a foreign exchange loss in basically of the order of $1 million that was expensed against the income statement.","Operator","Our next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","[indiscernible] additional growth in the third quarter; 14%, pretty solid. It looks like EMEA was a little bit softer but you had very good growth from Japan, Asia Pacific and Brazil. So can you just talk about maybe some of the underlying market trends that you're seeing in some of your key European markets. And then how much benefit you're seeing in markets like Japan's, where you've had some of the innovations rollout and whether there was any timing benefit in that number. And then I guess on a longer-term basis, I know we've talked about the Coke partnership enabling you to become more profitable in international markets. But just wanted to see if you can give us any, kind of, road map as to how quickly you can envision the profitability ramping up in those markets once the deal closes?","Rodney C. Sacks","The international markets are quite a mixed bag. While the growth, obviously, was slower in EMEA, overall, there were some markets that were nice and then some markets faced some competition in some cases from some lower-priced entrees, for example, in South Africa. And the same thing even in South America. These results, again, were led by a number of countries, but there were countries within the region that were also softer and some of that is just to do with timing. In the case of France, if you look at the numbers, there was -- if you remember, at the end of last year, there was a buy-in before -- in advance of the introduction of a tax in France. And then during the quarter, there was a lower stockholding this quarter than had been compared to last year, where there was, sort of, an increased larger stockholding. So that affected the French results. So these are things that are making or resulting in our results being quite choppy. We're hoping that as we are able to go forward and as the brands get bigger and more established in these countries, that sort of influence from stockholding -- changes in stockholdings will continue to diminish. Again, some of the stockholding buy-ins and longer delivery times for some of the South American and Asian markets also affected the results, because we were -- if you also look at the stockholding levels and if you look at sales out, they remain healthy in a number of countries. We're positive, but if you look at the sales in at any one quarter, you may find that the results are actually negative. And so you've got to look at the actual underlying business. And while the trends remained solid, we are having this choppiness in some of the results from various countries. So we think that will start getting smoothed out better as we continue to become more -- both effective -- becoming more established in these different countries and also in many countries going into the Coke system. We don't really have a program yet. We're still at the very preliminary stages of actually understanding the Coke system. We need to be able to have discussions and meetings with various Coke bottlers. We need to achieve a consensus and agreement on margin -- the value chains and margins, and making decisions exactly when we're going to switch to which and in which countries. And that, at the moment, is a complicated matrix and we really can't, I think, speculate to that going forward. I don't know if you'd like to add anything on that, Hilton.","Hilton H. Schlosberg","I just would like to -- yes, I'd like add to Judy about a comment on Europe, which was spot on, in fact. There was a destocking, we believe, that took place in July in Europe -- with our distribution partners in Europe. And that was quite -- that was quite noticeable.","Rodney C. Sacks","I think that's all. You can see the numbers, obviously, you gain from the October numbers. Again, it's a single month but yet we have seen a pickup in October in Europe, particularly.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vivien Azer from Cowen and Company.","Vivien Nicole Azer - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","My question has to do with your average net sales per case and the 2.5% growth that you saw in the third quarter. You mentioned price increases on the 24-ounce packaging. So I'm curious whether you could give us a sense for the balance between pricing and mix, in terms of that 2.5% growth in average net sales per case?","Hilton H. Schlosberg","It's in the Q. The Q will be released, as I said, hopefully, within next 24 hours, if not, on Monday. So it's all there.","Vivien Nicole Azer - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. Then maybe a bigger picture question that relates to that metric. It's impressive the growth that you're seeing in your average net sales per case but at the same time, you're seeing consistent deceleration in terms of your net sales growth. So can you talk, kind of, high level how you think about the balance between volumes versus pricing and mix? And how important it is for you guys to generate outsized volume growth because the 5% growth that you saw this quarter is the weakest that we've seen in a number of years.","Hilton H. Schlosberg","I think that's actually a situation that is relating to where the market has been and where the market is going. We spoke a little bit about where the October numbers are, and the growth in October. At this time, we're not planning to have any price increases on our major [ph] product lines, but that, in fact, may change as we move forward into next year. So from our perspective on pricing, it's steady as she goes. We'll be absorbing the Coca-Cola transaction early in 2015. That's a concentrate model and that will affect average pricing as well. So I hope that answered your question, but I'm not sure what specific issue you were getting at.","Operator","There are no further questions in queue.","Rodney C. Sacks","On behalf of Monster, I would like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. Continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continue to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad. We are particularly excited by the new opportunities that we are going -- we have going forward with a robust portfolio of energy drink products comprised of our Monster Energy drink line together with The Coca-Cola Company's energy brands. We believe that our agreement with The Coca-Cola Company will enable us to focus on our core energy business while leveraging the strength of The Coca-Cola Company's powerful distribution and bottling system on a worldwide scale. We reiterate that our products are safe, are properly labeled and the caffeine content of the Monster is approximately 10 milligrams per ounce, less than 0.5 milligrams per ounce of the caffeine labels contained in Starbucks and other coffee house brewed coffee. In other words, a medium Starbucks 16-ounce sized brewed coffee contains approximately 330 milligrams of caffeine, which is more than double the approximately 160 milligrams of caffeine that is contained in the same sized Monster Energy drink. More than 12 billion Monster Energy drinks have been sold and safely consumed around the world over the past 12 years. Thank you very much for your attendance.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference to Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO. You may begin.","Rodney Cyril Sacks ","Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for attending this call. I\u2019m Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, Vice Chairman and President, is with me today, as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance.","Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management, with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance, and trends.","Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call.

A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section.","At the outset I should mention that the release of our quarterly results and this call are almost a week earlier than normally scheduled. The reason for this change is that Hilton and I will be attending the Coca-Cola Global System Meeting that starts early next week. We will revert to our normal schedule for the second and subsequent quarters.","We are continuing to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers worldwide. We have successfully concluded negotiations with Coca-Cola bottlers in many countries, and are planning to launch Monster with these bottlers in most of their international markets in the near future. As previously reported we have concluded agreements with Coca-Cola Amatil, which distributes Coca-Cola products in Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Fiji. We will be launching Monster in Australia on May 1 and in New Zealand on May 9 with Coca-Cola Amatil.","Additionally as previously reported we have concluded agreements with BTIG the 100% owned Coca-Cola bottler that operate in a number of international markets for the distribution of Monster in certain of these markets. Further to these agreements we are planning to launch Monster on May 13 in Singapore.","Our plans to launch Monster in China are continuing to move forward with the Coca-Cola System. In Shanghai we have received the required product approval and manufacturing license and are planning for production of Monster there. In Beijing, we have received the required product approval and are awaiting the manufacturing license. We have commenced the required approval process in Xiamen in Southeast China. We are full planning to launch monster in China later this year, but as previously discussed the launch could be delayed by various factors including regulatory approvals and finalization of distribution agreements.","We are targeting a relaunch of Monster in India later this year following discussions with their regulatory authorities. We continue to make good progress in our discussions with FEMSA, Arca and other bottler operating in South America. We have signed a distribution agreement with the Coca-Cola bottler with Lindley, which is controlled by Arca for distribution of Monster in Peru and are planning to launch the Monster in Peru on June 2nd. We are also planning to launch or transition a number of other international markets to Coca-Cola bottlers in the insuring quarters.","We continue to make good progress in the repositioning, repackaging and reformulation of many of the Coca-Cola energy brands that were required as a result of the Coca-Cola transaction. We successfully completed our acquisition of the concentrate and flavor business operated by American Fruits and Flavors for $690 million in cash on April 1, 2016. We remain excited by this acquisition, which aligns us with our principal flavor supplier and will enable us to expand and secure most of our flavors at an economical cost.","The integration of the acquired business is proceeding well. Consistent with the company\u2019s previously announced plan to return capital to shareholders in 2016, the company currently intend to commence a tender offer in May to purchase up to $2 billion in value of its common stock through a modified Dutch auction tender offer at a price range to be specified. The company will fund the tender offer with cash on hand.","In the first quarter sales in the beverage industry in general and of carbonated beverages in particular continue to show weakness. However, sales of Monster product accelerated during the quarter. In the first quarter of 2015 in anticipation of the closing of the Coca-Cola transaction we transitioned approximately 84% of the targeted distribution rights in the U.S. to the Coca-Cola System. With an additional 5% transitioned in May 2015.","Consequently the results of the comfortable first quarter of 2015 were impacted by the acceleration of deferred revenue of $39.8 million, distribution termination cost of $206 million and Coca-Cola transaction cost to $3.6 million. Our ensuring discussion compares our 2016 first quarter results with our 2015 first quarter results after adjustment for the acceleration of deferred revenue, distribution termination process and Coca-Cola transaction costs referred to about.","In the first quarter the company achieved gross record sales of $777.5 million, up 16% from $670.4 million in the first quarter of 2015. Net sales were $680.2 million, up 15.9% from $587 million in the first quarter of 2015.","Net sales in the first quarter were adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately 12.3 million. Our original green energy drink Monster Energy Drink continues to perform well at retail. Retail sales of the Ultra line continue to show good growth in the United States during the first quarter, as did our Java Monster line. ","Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 62.2%, as compared to 56.1% for the comparable 2015 first quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to increased net sales of the Concentrate segment, which has higher gross margins than the Finished Products segment, the disposal of our non-energy brands, and the price increase on our 16-ounce Monster Energy drinks effective August 31, 2015.","Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.4%, as compared to 4.4% in the same quarter last year. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 10.2% compared to 10.6% in the same quarter a year ago. Sponsorship and endorsement costs, merchandise display costs, and social media expenses were all higher in the first quarter as compared to the first quarter of 2015, while commissions were lower.","General and administrative costs excluding distributor terminations costs and Coca-Cola transaction cost as a percentage of net sales for the 2016 first quarter were 10.6% as compared to 10.8% for the corresponding quarter in 2015.","Payroll expenses were up $1.5 million consisting of $5 million increase in payroll due partially to increased staffing in connection with our acquisition of the strategic brands and an increase in stock-based compensation, a non-cash item of $3.7 million, which were offset by a reduction of payroll taxes of $7.2 million following the exercise of certain stock options in the first quarter of 2015. Also including general and administrative costs is amortization of trademarks a non-cash item of $1.8 million attributable to our acquisition of the strategic brands. ","Distributor termination costs were $3.4 million in the first quarter as compared to $206 million in the 2015 first quarter. Regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company\u2019s products were $5.4 million in the 2016 first quarter as compared to $4.9 million in the 2015 first quarter. In addition, other legal costs were $2.4 million higher for the 2016 first quarter.","Our effective tax rate decreased from an adjusted 38% to 35.8% in the first quarter primarily due to the domestic production deduction. On an ongoing basis, we expect that our normalized tax rate will be approximately 36%. Net income was $166.1 million, compared to net income of $110.8 million during the first quarter of last year, an increase of 49.9%. However, despite the substantial increase in the number of shares on a fully diluted basis from $173.8 million to $206.9 million following the issuance of shares to Coca-Cola, diluted earnings per share increased to $0.80 after adjusting for distributor termination expense for the first quarter from $0.64 in the 2015 comparable quarter.","Gross sales to customers outside the United States were $184.4 million in the 2016 first quarter compared to $141 million in the corresponding quarter in 2015. Net sales to customers outside the United States were $149.1 million in the 2016 first quarter compared to $113 million in the corresponding quarter in 2015.","As stated earlier, gross sales and net sales to customers outside of the United States were higher in local currencies by approximately $15.1 million and $12.3 million respectively, including geographic sales reported are our sales to the company\u2019s military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas.","According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through March 2016 all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category including energy shots increased by 7.1% versus the same period a year ago.

Java Monster was 18.4% higher than the same period last year, while Starbucks Doubleshot Energy was 25.2% higher. We\u2019d like to mention there have been some changes in the dollar base we use to report on this category. ","According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended March 05, 2016, the energy drink category decreased 2%. Monster sales were unchanged versus a year ago, our market share increased 0.3 share point to 27.8%, Red Bull sales decreased 1%, and its market share increased 0.7 points to 37.3%.

Monster sales increased 8.3%, our market share decreased 5.7 points to 25% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn, one of our acquired strategic brands increased 4.9%, although Burn\u2019s market share decreased 1.7 points to 6.5%. Red Bull sales increased 0.7 of a percent, and its market share decreased by 5.1 points to 15.7%. Vive 100\u2019s market share increased 14.3 points to 34.9%, while Boost\u2019s market share decreased 3.4 points to 11.3%.","The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced, positively and\/or negatively, by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in their chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. ","According to Nielsen in the 13 week period ended March 2016, the actual 13 week periods vary by a few weeks between different markets, Monster\u2019s retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 12.1% to 13% in Great Britain, from 9.3% to 11% in Sweden, from 8.4% to 9.7% in Belgium, from 6.5% to 9% in Norway, from 5.7% to 7% in the Netherlands and from 18.4% to 20.9% in France.","For the 13 week period ended February 2016, according to Nielson Monster\u2019s retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 11.1% to 13.6% in Germany and decreased from 17.5% to 16.4% in South Africa although value sales were 19.3% higher according to Nielsen.

Monster\u2019s retail market share in value for the 13 weeks ending February 2016 in Ireland increased from 7.4% to 8.7% and from 21.5% to 24.8% in Spain. According IRI Monster\u2019s market share in Greece decreased in the 13 weeks at the end of February 2016 from 29.3% to 29.1%. ","I would like to point that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide, because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen for the month of March 2016 in Chile Monster\u2019s retail market share in value increase to 20.4% as compared to 15.3% last year.

EMEA sales were negatively impacted by supply disruptions that were encountered by CCE in Great Britain Monster\u2019s largest market in the EMEA during the quarter following the implementation of new software.","Monster continue to gain momentum and increase market share in Europe in the first quarter. Overall EMEA is now operating well and we have made good strides in achieving increased distribution levels and in-store execution, including securing distribution by Coca-Cola bottlers in new countries and territories within the region.","We are pleased with the launch of Ultra in Europe.

Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 39.8% in the same period last year to 41.1% during the 2016 first quarter.","Net sales decreased in Brazil largely due to the overall difficult economic and market conditions together with the ongoing uncertainties for our distributor relating to the Coca-Cola transaction. In Mexico net sales decreased impart due to customer destocking during the quarter and delivery disruptions during the month of March. However, as reported by Nielsen Monster sales at retail in Mexico grew during the quarter. In Chile net sales in the quarter increased 52.3% in dollars and 74.9% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. ","As previously mentioned we are moving ahead with planning for local production in India and anticipate reentering the market in India later in 2016. As mentioned earlier we are optimistic that we will be able to finalize agreements with Coca-Cola bottlers in numerous countries in the near future. We are also continuing to evaluate production opportunities for Coca-Cola bottlers both in the U.S. and internationally, which we believe will yield cost reductions.","Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $2.5 billion at March 31, 2016 prior to the close of the AAF conception compared to $2.2 billion at December 31, 2015. Short-term investments were $508.2 million compared to $744.6 million at December 31, 2015. Long-term investments decreased to $7.4 million from $15.3 million at December 31, 2015.","Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 48.7 days at March 31, 2016, and 43.2 days at December 31, 2015 compared to 46.4 days at March 31, 2015. Inventories increased to $165.9 million from $156.1 million at December 31, 2015. Average days of inventory was 58.1 days at March 31, 2016, which was higher than the 58 days of inventory at December 31, 2015 and lower than the 69.1 days at March 31, 2015. ","During the 2016 first quarter, we launched our new Gronk energy drink and Salted Caramel Java Monster initial consumer response has been positive. We are planning to launch Mutant, an exciting new beverage that will be positioned as the refreshment energize in the third quarter of 2016. For competitive reasons we intend to provide further information on this new beverage at the stockholder meeting on June 14. As previously disclosed we also have additional new products plan for later this year.","As this call is a week earlier than usual we can only provide the estimate for April 2016 gross sales. Based on gross sales through April 28, 2016 we estimated April 2016 gross sales in dollars will be approximately 15% higher than in April 2015. In local currencies we estimate April 2016 gross sales will be approximately 16% higher than in April 2015. We note that April 2015 sales included the old Warehouse segment and Peace Tea and April 2016 includes the Concentrate segment.","We caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period.","In conclusion, I\u2019d like to summarize some recent positive points. Our acquisition of AAF is exciting and represents an important milestone for the company through the ownership of the proprietary formulas for our principal product. This transaction will be accretive to the company\u2019s earnings from the closing of the transaction on April 1, 2016. Consistent with the company\u2019s previously announced plan to return capital to shareholders in 2016 the company currently intends to commence a tender offer in May to purchase up to $2 billion in value of its common stock through a modified Dutch auction tender offer at price range to be specified. ","The company will fund the tender offer with cash on hand, while Hilton and I may participate in the offer for asset diversification reasons we will continue to earn a substantial majority of our current holdings following any successful tender offer. North American and international gross margins remained healthy and continue to improve. The U.S. Nielsen market statistics and equivalent market statistics from many countries around the world show that the energy category is continuing to grow, and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category.","The new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the company\u2019s sales. We are excited about the prospects for our new Mutant beverage, which we are planning to launch in the third quarter. We are particularly pleased with our performance in our international markets. We have successfully transitioned a number of international countries to Coca-Cola bottlers and we have reached an advanced stage to transition many more markets to Coca-Cola bottlers from the second quarter of 2016.","I\u2019d like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year please note that we will not be taking any questions with respect to the tender offer on this call. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is now open. ","Kevin Grundy","Thanks, good morning, guys. ","Rodney Cyril Sacks ","Good morning. ","Kevin Grundy","I want to start with China given the importance of your launch in that market, can you talk a little bit about building upon the timing of that around the brand positioning, the investment that\u2019s going to be required for trial there to raise brand awareness that would be helpful. Thank you. ","Rodney Cyril Sacks ","To give most of the information that you are asking would be giving future estimates and indications and even more difficulty in a market that we are just going into. We are -- all I would like to say about China is that we are planning to enter China in a similar way to which we have entered other markets. We look at building distribution on a store-by-store basis, we are going into the market with one SKU which is Monster green primarily our main product.","As I indicated in the call, we are still looking to finalize negotiations with our distribution partners on the distributions agreements and those negotiations have been taking -- have taken some time. We are progressing with registrations. So we are in a new country it\u2019s -- we are looking at -- obviously we don\u2019t have a lot of experience there because we\u2019ve not been there. And so to say more than that I don\u2019t know we are looking to continue later this year, but there could be some delays in getting the registrations, but we are continuing to focus on China and I just don\u2019t believe that there is more at this point that we will be able to say. Obviously, we will need to make investments in the market, which we will do as appropriate to establish the brand, but it\u2019s a slow traditional build for us going into China. ","Kevin Grundy","Can I ask a follow-up? ","Rodney Cyril Sacks ","Yes. ","Kevin Grundy","Thank you. Just switching gears to the U.S. some of the Nielson data has slowed a bit broadly for the category and some of this may have been that we\u2019ve cycled the pricing that Red Bull has taken and you want to cycle that into the fall, but can you talk a little bit about some of the slowing that we are seeing broadly in the category in the U.S. whether that\u2019s concerning at all or whether you think it\u2019s a bit of blip and then what is our expectations broadly for the category for the balance of the year? Thank you. ","Rodney Cyril Sacks ","The category, might be seeing a slowing slightly, but obviously it\u2019s still growing at a good positive rate, you have got to look at the category in the context of beverages generally, I think the point you made is one of the important points is that part of that category\u2019s growth is that we are cycling on price increases now and if you look at the growth and it\u2019s largely is influenced -- the category growth largely gets influenced by the growth that obviously Red Bull enough contribute to the category as the major participants in the country. And you have seen a slowing in the Red Bull numbers and that really has probably a large influence on that category.","So we don\u2019t see much difference, we are positive about the category, but obviously we can\u2019t tell where the category will grow, what sort of innovation will come from our competitors, we have innovations as I have indicated coming. It is going to come later in the year, but we do have quite a robust innovation pipeline.","Operator","And our next question comes from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. ","Judy Hong","Thank you, good morning. ","Rodney Cyril Sacks ","Good morning, Judy.","Hilton H. Schlosberg","Good morning, Judy. ","Judy Hong","So broadly speaking it seems like your international sales growth has accelerated in Q1 versus Q4 and I was just hoping to get a little bit more color just in terms of how much is this really lapping some of the inventory issues that you have had and are we now mostly behind some of that issues? How much are you getting growth in some of the transition market and as you look over the next six months markets like Australia where you are transitioning to Amatil and then you got Nigeria and some of the newer markets you are entering just your expectation in terms of how quickly you can see growth accelerating just broadly from an international perspective?","Rodney Cyril Sacks","Again, like everything in life everybody would like things to happen instantaneously, but it takes time and as we transition we are starting to see once you have had an opportunity to settle down with the particular bottler in that market we all starting to see good progress. But again is also depends on the commitment of a bottler and each bottler has his own priorities, his own commitments and it is varied, but if you look at the trend Judy, which is clearly from what we have given the indication on each of the countries on our market share. The trend generally is continuing to be positive and we are continuing to take market share.","Hilton H. Schlosberg","I would say look at the German numbers Judy that we spoke about on the call and also South Korea. Those are two markets that have been transitioned to the Coca-Cola System. Those may give some indications but the other markets that we have not seen that amount of growth and those are some of the Hellenic markets. So as Rodney said it does differ from country to country. So those are two good indications here.","Rodney Cyril Sacks","So we just think generally it\u2019s positive and as we go forward obviously we do look work our way through the choppiness and the transition issues that we had in the past.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question come from Mark Astrachan from Stifel. Your line is open.","Mark S. Astrachan","Hey, good morning, guys.","Rodney Cyril Sacks","Hi, Mark. Good morning.","Hilton H. Schlosberg","Good morning.","Mark S. Astrachan","I wanted to ask about the Concentrate business. So it still seems to be a little bit weaker I think than it was originally trending going into the deal close. I guess I\u2019m curious if you were to try to parse it out sort of differently maybe there is some questions have been asked about it in the past. How much of the under performance has been driven by some of the larger brands like Relentless in particular, but also like Burn in terms of what has happened from relaunches, repositionings, potential reductions in shelf space in favorable Monster and the like. In other words is there a way to sort of think about it split up by the bigger brands and maybe even comment on some of those smaller brands that could be getting discontinued?","Hilton H. Schlosberg","I think it\u2019s a mix bag. I actually have done full analysis of these strategic brand. Like you we also need to understand what the position is with regard to those brand. Some of it is relating to weakness in the brand themselves that we are addressing in various ways. Some of that of course is a foreign currency and there is another factor in that in certain countries we have been unable to structure ourselves in a way that we could actually self concentrate and what we do in certain countries is we get a royalty from the Coca-Cola Company, which equates to effectively what we would have done had we sell the Concentrate. The struction is sitting up various countries to accommodate the Concentrate business.","So there is a whole lot of factors that one has to take into account in evaluating the Concentrate business. But largely there is some weakness, but you are not seeing in these numbers the full extent of the Concentrate business because of some of these adjustments that have to take place.","Rodney Cyril Sacks","I think that one other thing we did mentioned previously that we did find that in some of the cases the investment in the strategic brands prior to and during the transition had been trimmed and cut back and that did affect sale. So we did see a reduction in sales in those countries as a result we believe of that. So what we\u2019ve had to do is not only just go in and blindly obviously reinvest in marketing, but we\u2019ve had to relook at how we repositioning these brands and at the same time get the repositioning done both in repackaging, in designs, in flavors and then obviously then recreate marketing plans to fit those the new positioning that we have looked at four of these brands particularly the Burn brand and Relentless are two of the large brands that did have some weakness. We\u2019ve also in many ways repositioned NOS a little bit in the U.S. although we haven\u2019t changed packaging, we all are going to modernize that packaging and that\u2019s still coming through now.","So this is a long process because there were many brands in many countries and laid on top of our own staffing and our own business obviously at Monster it takes a long-term to get a lot of these reposition done. So we think that\u2019s partially the reason for it and yes, it has been weaker than we had estimated but we are -- we have been doing the repositioning, we have doing some focusing, we are starting to see some strong signs and we do believe that that will continue to be positive.","Some of the other brands although smaller again it\u2019s a mix big you can\u2019t put it into one category because in some cases the brands are smaller and may go away, but in other cases some of the smaller brands are very good, very strong brands and we are actually looking to long-term growth from those brands, but again it\u2019s going to be a positioning and a build. It\u2019s not going to happen overnight. But there are some really good brands that we see in the mix that we do believe we will see growth from going forward.","Hilton H. Schlosberg","Does that answer your question? So it\u2019s a kind of mixture of volume decreases in certain brands that are being addressed and other factors that...","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Chappell from SunTrust. Your line is open. ","William B. Chappell","Thanks, good morning. Rodney can you talk a little bit about Mexico from kind of the numbers you were reeling off I couldn\u2019t tell if they were just some short-term turbulence or can you give a little more color, what\u2019s going on there?","Rodney Cyril Sacks ","There were obviously some challenges in March as we indicated, that is a market that has not transitioned so there is obviously some uncertainty relating to the market. The market we have still grown just short of 10% and so the brand has continually grown quarter-to-quarter, but there is the emergence of a low cost brand Vive 100 in the market that have been very aggressive and they have really expanded the market and that\u2019s why when we look at the market we say our market share has decreased, but is it of a very much increased market and may be a little bit different. And then we had a debate earlier as to does Vive 100 really put into category or do well we really in the premium category and Vive 100 is in a lower price category are they really different and should we be splitting them.","And as we think we have traditionally put them into the one category, but that really what\u2019s happens. So if you look at the underlying market bearing the uncertainties et cetera it is still growing and obviously one of the issues is ForEx and affordability, but we are still growing. So we are comfortable with end market, we think it\u2019s a good market and we think that in the future we will continue to see pretty good growth from there.","Hilton H. Schlosberg","So since you like numbers, let me quote the number enough for Vive 100, there 340 ml PET which is their leading product in pesos sells for 10 pesos. Our product, a 473ml U.S. product that sold in Mexico sells for 30 pesos to 32 pesos. So that\u2019s the comparison in pricing. It\u2019s a very, very aggressive competitor and we don\u2019t want to go down and we will not go down to that type of pricing for Monster. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from John Faucher with JP Morgan. Your line is open. ","John A. Faucher","Thank you. Just want to follow-up on the last couple of questions. You\u2019ve talked about sort of preaching patients in terms of getting these bottler deals done totally understand that. Can you tell us what goes into the negotiations, it sounds like some of these sort of brand shifts what the underlying support levels are the transition may be out of some of the Coke Concentrate brands into the Monster brand and how you manage that transition? It sounds like that\u2019s part of the negotiations and so is that why this is taking longer? And so I guess sort of a little bit of color in terms of kind of what you need to nail down with the bottlers as you do these deals? Thanks.","Rodney Cyril Sacks "," I think you put into two different buckets, the one bucket is although we are trying to get us have ourselves the hope further that we will become more integrated into the Coca-Cola System. We are still nevertheless an independent publicly traded company and as a result it\u2019s been important for us to continue to negotiate agreements on terms that we believe will put us in a position where we can take protect ourselves and our brand if things -- the relationships didn\u2019t go as planned.","And so the contract that we have agreed to with the company as a principle and obviously now you take that to the individual bottlers they have their own lawyers, they have their own local laws and they have their own view of license, very respectfully many of them are not used to signing a contract of this nature, which is more akin to a finished product distribution agreement as oppose to a manufacturing concentrate bottler agreement, which puts a lot more discretion and decisions in the hands of the bottler whereas we tend to keep or want to keep most of those decisions about global marketing, about some of the local marketing and a number of things. ","The other thing is that we obviously got to be very cautious that we don\u2019t get into a situation, we have a large line of products for example and we don\u2019t want to be in a position that if the bottler decide he wants to take one skew or three skews and not the rest that we are kept out of the market for the rest of the SKUs. So there are bones of contention that keep going up and down between the legal agreements and we\u2019re getting through them, but it\u2019s in many case that it\u2019s really a question of literally educating a bottler in a country with their lawyers about why our agreement is in the form that why we need the protections?","Then the other obviously is -- the other bucket is just goes back to the old life money, how do you share the value chain that\u2019s available in the country and it\u2019s just arm wrestling between us and the bottlers as to how do we get to a fair value share and in some cases we are at odds with the bottlers on what we believe we want out of the value share and we\u2019re not going to compromise the value share and take less in order to simply try and get deals done.","Because you want to move quickly I mean what we going to negotiate is going to stay with us for 20 or 30 years or whatever long the agreement are. So we really do want to have a fair relationship and a fair share of the value chain bearing in mind that we spend and do a lot more than it\u2019s normally done by Coca-Cola Company in a bottler relationship when they split whatever the split is when they split their value chain the bottler picks up a lot more of the obligations. In our case we do and we don\u2019t want to be in a position where we split the chain and we end up with still the lion share of the marketing and other expenses, which aren\u2019t fairly shared. So it\u2019s been in the negotiation and we just -- we\u2019re getting through them one-by-one and I think that\u2019s really the color I have got I don\u2019t know Hilton if you would like to add to it?","Hilton H. Schlosberg","No, I think that\u2019s absolutely right. One of the big issues the legal stuff can be negotiated and it is but it\u2019s got to be a fair agreement in terms -- on commercial terms for us and a fair agreement for the bottler and often the bottler feels he is entitled to more and we as a brand owner have substantial expenses, have substantial marketing expenses and we have to ensure that after those marketing expenses we do a good deal for our shareholders. So it is a bit of a hedging, but as you can see from the agreements that have been finalized we\u2019re moving forward and we\u2019ll move forward in due course with some of the other bottlers or we won\u2019t. And if it\u2019s not there are other distribution partners that we\u2019ll be working with. ","Rodney Cyril Sacks ","Yes I agree. ","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from Caroline levy from CLSA. Your line is open.","Caroline Levy","Thanks so much, good morning. My question relates to margins which were just outstanding in the quarter 840 basis points improvement I believe and as you move into the next four quarters I believe you\u2019ll get about a 250 basis points left from the benefit of the acquisition. So I just want to\u2026","Hilton H. Schlosberg","So it\u2019s your estimate.","Caroline Levy","Yeah I just want to be sure that within the margin expansion we did see there were no unusual items in the first quarter and obviously there is the benefit of the acquisition which will continue I think through most of the second quarter. But if there are any moving parts you can elaborate on little bit more on margins or is this the new status quo the\u2026","Rodney Cyril Sacks ","We spoke about the price increase number one; number two, we\u2019ve got the Concentrate business has now kicked in it wasn\u2019t in the first quarter of last year. So those are two factors that influenced margin in this quarter. There is product mix, which has also influenced margin so apart from those I\u2019m not aware of anything unusual apart from those that influenced margin in the quarter.","Caroline Levy","And I'm wondering if you could\u2026","Rodney Cyril Sacks ","And in going forward yes we will have the benefit of the AFF transaction.","Caroline Levy","Yeah just because I think the strategic is the million dollar question on the company is do you think overtime international margins get pretty close to domestic and I mean we could talk in 5 or 10 year increments I guess is there a reason why international structurally would always be below the U.S.?","Hilton H. Schlosberg","Well pricing differs from country to country obviously and we have very good pricing in the U.S. and in some countries internationally we don\u2019t benefit from the same pricing structures. So what we\u2019ve done we don\u2019t give projections as you know, we don\u2019t give guidance, but what we\u2019ve done in this quarter is we\u2019ve actually given you the margins in the international territories in aggregate so you can see the trends in margin in EMEA and the trends in Asia Pacific and Central and South America.","Rodney Cyril Sacks ","I think I\u2019d like to just add is that if you look at international margins I think we should expect them to be lower than U.S. because of pricing and in many of those cases our cost of goods seems to be higher, we\u2019re producing out of the U.S. particularly for the -- in the immediate future when volumes really get to the levels of the U.S. we\u2019ll see some reduction but even then I think we should expect cost of goods to be higher internationally. ","The other thing is that we go through the -- in looking at the mix it\u2019s a mix bag Caroline because even internationally we\u2019ve obviously got Concentrate business, which has got traditionally the higher margins, but as Monster and we think that ultimately the growth in the long-term for the company is that the Monster brand will grow while again we think we will get growth from the new brand there is some nice brands in the strategic group that will continue to grow as well.","If you looked -- if we looked at it we think that ultimately the larger growth will come from Monster and then as Monster there will be a -- because they\u2019re international there will be some slight reduction in overall margin, but you want to take the mix\u2026","Hilton H. Schlosberg","Because it\u2019s a finished goods margin. ","Rodney Cyril Sacks ","Correct. And that\u2019s [indiscernible]. So again I just want to bear that in mind so there I am conscious like a I think just a straight line and then take the incremental margin we should get from AAF and should be applied going forward. So while we do expect there to be an improvement in some immediate factors that one should take into account. ","Hilton H. Schlosberg","And we don\u2019t give predictions. ","Operator","Thank you and I'm showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back to Rodney Sacks for any further remarks. ","Rodney Cyril Sacks ","On behalf of Monster I\u2019d like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad and in particular to expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottler system internationally.

Net sales for the 2018 fourth quarter were negatively impacted by $8.5 million due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606. Under ASC 606, commissions paid to The Coca-Cola Company based on our sales to certain of the company's customers, which The Coca-Cola Company accounts for under the equity method or consolidates, are now included as a reduction to net sales. Whereas, prior to January 1, 2018, commissions based on sales to those customers, which Coca-Cola accounts for under the equity method, were included in operating expenses.","Net and gross sales for the three months ended December 31 2018, were negatively impacted by advanced purchases made by our customers in the third quarter of 2018 due to a pre-announced price increase effective November 1, 2018, on certain of our Monster Energy brand Energy Drinks in 2018 which affected our fourth quarter. The company estimates such impact to net and gross sales was approximately $16 million and $18 million, respectively.","In the fourth quarter of 2018, net sales were $924.2 million, up 14.1%, from $810.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 15.1%. Net sales in the fourth quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $14.4 million of foreign currency movements.","The company recorded fourth quarter gross sales of $1.06 billion, up 13.7%, from $934.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Gross sales in the fourth quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $16.2 million of foreign currency movements.","Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, for the 2018 fourth quarter was 59.7%, compared with 62.1% in the 2017 fourth quarter. The gross profit percentage, as adjusted for ASC 606, would have been 60.1% for the quarter.","The decrease in gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was primarily attributable to increases in certain import costs such as aluminum cans, freight in and other input costs, geographical sales mix as a result of our international sales increasing as a percentage of total net sales, our foreign operations generally have lower gross margins.","Domestic product sales mix and the $8.5 million of commissions accounted for as a reduction to net sales due to the adoption of ASC 606. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially offset by increases in domestic sales process as well as the decrease in promotional allowances as a percentage of gross sales.","Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.7% for the 2018 fourth quarter as compared to 3.6% in the 2017 fourth quarter. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.3% for the 2018 fourth quarter as compared to 13.6% in the same quarter in 2017.","General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 11.5% for the 2018 fourth quarter as compared to 11.9% in the same quarter in 2017. In the quarter, payroll expenses as a percentage of net sales were 7.2% compared to 7.7% in the same period in 2017. Payroll costs increased $4.9 million, primarily due to headcount growth both domestically and internationally.","Stock-based compensation and non-cash item was $14.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to $13 million in the same quarter in 2017. Operating income was adversely affected by losses in China of $3.1 million in the quarter. Our effective tax rates decreased from 24.8% in the 2017 fourth quarter to 23.1% in the 2018 fourth quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the reduction in the U. S. Federal Statutory tax rate as a result of The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act with The Tax Reform Act signed into law on December 22, 2017 as well as a reduction in certain foreign income that is subject to U.S. taxation.","In addition, the comparative 2017 fourth quarter effective tax rate included a one-time provisional charge related to the revaluation of the company's deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017, and a one-time charge for the deemed mandatory repatriation of post 1986 earnings and profits as a result of The Tax Reform Act. The decrease in the provision for income taxes was also partially offset by a decrease in the stock-based compensation tax deduction.","Net income was $239.1 million in the 2018 fourth quarter, compared to net income of $201.3 million in the 2017 fourth quarter, an increase of 18.8%.

In the second quarter of 2019, Monster Energy will be launched in Azerbaijan and Saudi Arabia. We are planning further international launches later this year in EMEA. We launched Predator, our strategically-preferred affordable energy brand in South Africa in the fourth quarter, and plan to launch in certain surrounding countries in the first quarter of 2019.

Monster is now selling in approximately 90% of the country with marketing initiatives now in full swing.","I wanted to take a moment to address an issue previously covered on our law school, and that's our Investor Presentation in New York in January concerning our arbitration with The Coco-Cola Company. As we reported, our various agreements with The Coco-Coal Company restrict the Coco-Cola Company from competing in the Energy Drink category with certain exceptions. Coco-Cola has developed three energy products that it believes it may market under an exception relating to the Coco-Cola brand. We believe that the exception does not apply to those energy products. As a result, we have a disagreement with Coco-Cola over the interpretation of that exception. By mutual agreement to obtain clarification, the issue was submitted to arbitration at the end of October 2018, and that process is underway with the parties participating cooperatively. Coco-Cola has indicated that it has suspended the proposed launch of its proposed energy products until April 2019. We cannot predict the certainty when the result of the arbitration will be published, but reasonably expect the resolution of the issue in the second quarter of 2019. We reiterate that whatever the outcome of the arbitration, we will continue to cooperate and work together as partners.","According to the Nielsen Reports for the 13-week through January 26, 2019, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the Energy Drink category including Energy Shots increased by 11.3% versus the same period a year ago.

This year our innovation in the U.S. namely Monster Ultra Paradox and Java Monster Swiss Chocolate is being launched nationally this week, and Reign and two additional varieties of Monster Dragon Tea will be launched in March. The increase in January 2019 sales over January 2018 sales mentioned about should be evaluated in the context of the above factors that impacted January 2018 sales.","In this regard, we are cautioned again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor in terms of what's shipped in the timing of production, and this is where our bottles are responsible for production, and will accurately determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained via distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short-term such as a single month or even two months should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.","During the 2018 fourth quarter, the company purchased approximately 9.4 million shares of common stock, at an average purchase price of 56.99 per share for a total of $536.9 million excluding broker commissions.

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of Macquarie. Your line is open.","Caroline Levy","Thank you very much, good afternoon.","Rodney Sacks","Hi, Caroline.","Caroline Levy","Hi, Rodney. Just a quick question on -- a clarification if you could repeat the January sales, that would be helpful. I think I heard 2% and 4%, but just want to clarify. And then if you could just tell us a little bit more about how things are going in China. You mentioned about $3 million in losses in the quarter, how does that progress over the course of last year? Are the losses about where you expected them to be, do you think we will have another lost year next year and how do you feel about the progress in China overall?","Hilton Schlosberg","Okay. Let's just deal with the January sales. January sales were up -- sorry, 2.7% in January and on a foreign currency adjusted basis 4.6%.","Rodney Sacks","So Caroline, you got the point about January '18 sales being higher than ordinarily they should have been. So we spent a bit of time just talking about that.","Caroline Levy","Yes.","Rodney Sacks","Go back to the same call we had a year ago and pick up some of those sentiments that we expressed exactly the same at that time.","Caroline Levy","Okay. Oh, got it.","Rodney Sacks","And I think obviously -- and then taking that into account, we have obviously also given you the Nielsen numbers for January and you obviously February, so we do caution about this being a single month on a highly stacked January from last year. Thanks.","Hilton Schlosberg","So Caroline, just talking very briefly about China, the loss for the quarter was very much in line with what we'd expected. We are seeing a lot of what we call green shoots in China in the major chains, our volumes per outlet are very respectable compared to what we've seen for Red Bull. And the launch of Ultra was particularly pleasing and it's growing in strength. As regards this year, we again are adjusting for a loss in China and we absolutely committed to success in that territory. So we know it'll be an investment and we know it'll take some time to realize profitability in China and our co-colleagues have expressed and shared with us similar sentiments, but we are committed and we would believe that we will be successful in China.","Rodney Sacks","I'd like to just add one thing to Hilton's comments on China that since introducing Ultra White we've got only about three months of information in some of the modern trade, the bigger accounts. And what we are also seeing is that Ultra is being accretive. It's not cannibalizing Green, which is also positive for us and actually has been well-received from a taste profile. So we're quite positive about Ultra and are actually very excited about the launch of Mango Loco there, which has got a really attractive can. We think that the three products in the Black, White and Turquoise cans -- Turquoise Blue cans will start to have a much bigger impact on shelf and give us much more recognition on the shelf. So we are continuing to be positive about China and the prospects for increased sales in China.","Hilton Schlosberg","And just to add that the bottlers, likewise, are excited about the opportunities that the Monster brand presents for them in China.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Your line is open.","Mark Astrachan","Hey, hey guys.","Rodney Sacks","Hello, Mark, hi.","Mark Astrachan","So I guess, maybe one question broadly on gross margins. I don't want to ask you for guidance or anything like that, Hilton, but I guess, the numbers were still a little bit weaker than we or probably others would've expected. So how much of it is aluminum? I mean, I get the freight piece, I think most of it will get the freight piece, but what we don't see is how much inventory for aluminum you bought in 2008 potentially at much higher prices. So maybe if you could talk a bit about the cadence of that kind of cycling through and when kind of directionally some of that should lessen so without actually getting guidance, but just in terms of the inputs, puts and takes to how long before you start seeing lower price inventory kind of work through would be helpful.","Hilton Schlosberg","Well, you know, as we look at aluminum, aluminum did start coming down to us a ladder quarter of last year. We from time to time execute hedges with our aluminum can companies and we had some hedges in place for the fourth quarter of last year ready to protect ourselves against Aluminum going significantly up as it had been for most of the year. So that's the picture of aluminum. Aluminum coming down, re-buying it at various processing, including one of our hedges hitting in at a higher price than the market price for a portion; not for all, but for a portion of our Aluminum. So as we head into 2019, Aluminum in our books would definitely start coming down. By how much I really can't say, and I'm not at liberty to say, but it will be coming down in 2019. ","Operator","Thank you, our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Andrea Teixeira","Thank you. Good afternoon. Hi. I appreciated your updates on the price increase internationally, and you mentioned Canada up 3% starting on February 1st. Do you think I'm just laying your comments before that your price, respect for your price elasticity in some places. So do you think we should be thinking of that being the last price increase so far given what Hilton just said about aluminum potentially coming down, or is that\u2026","Rodney Sacks","No, I think that there are some selected countries in EMEA where we are we have taken certain price increases, and will continue to take some price increases this year. But I just don't have a list of them with me and at this point we wouldn't like to expand further on that. So there will be some. But obviously, we will also take that into account when we look at the Aluminum prices in what it costs us going forward. ","Operator","Thank you, our next question comes from the line of Amit Sharma of BMO Capital Markets. Your question please.","Amit Sharma","Hi, good afternoon everyone.","Rodney Sacks","Hi.","Amit Sharma","A quick clarification, and then a question on -- from a EMEA -- the supply chain disruptions and production issues, how much did it cost in terms of your sales growth for that segment, right, in the quarter. And then, as we think about the gross margin in U.S., it's clearly a little bit weaker than what we were expecting, and I hear your point on the commodity, but there's also a sales mix aspect of it. Can you unpack that a little bit, provide us some clarity that how much of a headwind that is, and how it could continue even after you overcome the commodity headwinds?","Rodney Sacks","Okay. So regarding EMEA, it's not a precise science, and unfortunately, I just don't want to give you a number for what the impact of these supply chain issues in EMEA were in the fourth quarter. We have made some stabs at the number. We've been reviewing it continuously since the middle of 2018, but I'd rather just stay away from giving some indication of what that number is. I don't think it would be appropriate to do so. But what I can say to you is that we believe the number was in excess of a million cases, and I'm going to stop there in the fourth quarter.","Amit Sharma","Got it. Perfect, thank you. And then gross profit impact from sales mix in U.S?","Rodney Sacks","So there definitely is an impact on sales in the U.S., and if you what we try to do is on the call is prioritize the reasons for the decrease in gross profit and you'll notice from the call that number one was the increases in certain input costs such as aluminum cans, freight in and other input costs. Secondly was our geographic sales mix, where our International sales are increasing as a percentage of our total sales and our foreign operations generally have lower gross margins as you heard on the call. And the third reason was the domestic product sales mix.","So, while it was definitely a factor and will continue to be a factor with the different products that the company has launched, but in the fourth quarter, it was the number, the third reason and was not the first or the second reason. And I'd also like to stop there because when you look at our new products that will be rolled out this year particularly the new Ultra Paradise and the Reign products they will all be at the more traditional launch the margins and not at the coffee margins. So they will be higher than the coffee margins.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet of Guggenheim. Your line is open.","Laurent Grandet","Yes, good afternoon Rodney and Hilton. I do have a question on Reign. I noticed on the packaging doesn't carry any reference to Monster the clue or even on the back it says I mean the company manufacturing it is the Reign beverage company, so I'm curious to understand why you are not leveraging your brand name as it would be a bit more A&M intensive to launch a new brand from scratch, I'd like to understand also the first reaction from the trade on the Reign?","Rodney Sacks","Well, let me just talk about that. We the positioning of Reign is different to the positioning of Monster and we've made the strategic decision to not in fact make Reign a line extension of Monster. It needs to we think it should be positioned have its own positioning, its own marketing, create its own personality and that we believe will give its best chance of success. We already have an extensive range of products in Monster that appeal to consumers.","They have their own personality and identity. So we just felt that this was the appropriate thing for us to do. This doesn't mean that in the future depending on this performance category, its longevity and the size that it grows to what we believe it will expand the energy category. What it does, we will look to what we want to do in the Monster range. There is no limitation on us in having line extensions or maybe a subfamily of products in this performance energy range with BCAAs or whatever else we want to do with a sort of a slightly different energy formula formulation.","And that's something that we're looking at and open to doing, so that doesn't preclude us. We just feel that and in fact it's better. And it does enable us to position the brands differently and get more shelf space. We think that would have been more pressure on our existing shelf space had we simply launched line extensions and we do have a number of additional line extensions which we are planning for months that we've already described a number of them to you that are being launched. We actually have additional launches and sub launches planned for Monster later in the year. So we've got quite a full plate for Monster and you can't do everything under one brand and that's the reason that we've positioned it as we have.","Hilton Schlosberg","And I think it's also important to note that we're continuing with rollouts of Friends under the strategic brands and new flavors. So we're not neglecting the strategic brand segment either.","Rodney Sacks","Just as regard to retailers again, where it's being rolled out in March. So it's premature but the acceptance from retailers and to the brand to the positioning to the taste profile that we've done in the packaging has been very positive. We're actually very happy with it and we are going to have a focused and concerted rollout in March.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Your question please?","Kevin Grundy","Thanks. Good afternoon.","Rodney Sacks","Hi, good afternoon Kevin.","Kevin Grundy","Quick cleanup question I hope, I know your inclination and the pension historically has not been to guide but Hilton can you just confirm for us that given the moving parts and you understand the comments are in input cost and mix and but you have full-year pricing going in, do you expect gross margins to be higher and you could just confirm that that would be helpful. And then Rodney on pricing, can you talk about Red Bulls pricing posture. So from a U.S. perspective, they clearly haven't followed yet. Is that concerning? Is there a point at which you consider rolling back pricing or promoting it back through trade and then maybe internationally, what are you seeing from them. Do you think will be further opportunity to price beyond what you've outlined on this call? Thank you for that.","Rodney Sacks","Kevin, I'll just take the last question first. Red Bull obviously has made a strategic decision once we had announced our increase to be aggressive in some of the promotions, more so that in previous years and to try and pick up some volume in share.","Would that be losing for some time. We've seen that, it doesn't affect us. We've I think been successful at what we strategically intended to achieve and we're not intending to roll back any pricing at this time. We're satisfied with where we've got with pricing and we think the pricing is fine. And so we don't believe that Red Bull will continue because it's going to hurt their margins and they won't continue indefinitely. But that's -- we can't speculate as to what's in their heads but whether they do so or not. We don't believe that would be a factor for us or any materiality quite frankly and so we're moving forward with our plans.","Hilton Schlosberg","So just to add a little bit to that, the price increase that was planned was really carefully planned in relation to Red Bulls pricing where there were significant gaps between our price on shelf and where Red Bull was at that time. And what we were able to do with our price increase was move us closer to the Red Bull pricing. So if you look at the -- at the pricing in the 4% that we implemented, the objective was to get pretty close to where Red Bull had their products priced in the market. And obviously we're only talking about the U.S.","And then on your other point on gross margin, you know Kevin, I didn't have to give you guidance because we don't give guidance, but you've got all the facts, you know that aluminum is coming down. We've said that freight costs are continuing to increase. You know our geographical sales mix because we've spoken about that there and we've also spoken about our new products and that the new products are largely going to be focused on better margin products. So you can come to your own conclusion. I think you know where I'm heading, and how can I give any guidance or any discussion on margin, but I think that's enough for you to able to work it out.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes our Q&A session. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Sacks for any closing remarks.","Rodney Sacks","Thank you. On behalf of Monster, I would like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the past. We continue to believe in this company, and our growth strategy remains committed to continuing to innovate, develop, and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad. And in particular, expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottler system internationally. We are also particularly excited about new opportunities that we have going forward with the portfolio of Energy Drink products throughout the world comprised of our Monster Energy Brand together with our Strategic Brands as well as Hydro, Mutant, and in particular Predator and Reign.","Thank you very much for your attention and your attendance.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time.","As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO. Sir, please begin.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.","Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, is with me today, as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance.","Before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends.","Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call.","Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed March 2, 2015, as well as our most recent report on Form 10-Q filed May 11, 2105, including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.","An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures which may be mentioned during the course of this call is provided in the notes designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated, August 6, 2015. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section.","As previously announced, the transaction with The Coca-Cola Company finally closed on June 12, 2015. Under the agreement, The Coca-Cola Company acquired an approximate 16.7% ownership interest in Monster following the issuance of shares to The Coca-Cola Company. The Coca-Cola Company also transferred ownership of its worldwide energy business to Monster and Monster in turn transferred its non-energy business to The Coca-Cola Company. We are excited about our partnership and believe that it will strategically align both companies for the long term by combining the strength of The Coca-Cola Company's worldwide bottling system with Monster's dedicated focus and expertise as a leading energy player globally.","We are now actively engaged in implementing our strategic alignment and have commenced discussions with Coca-Cola bottlers in many countries around the world. Our first international transition to a Coca-Cola bottler was accomplished in Germany in early July. There are a number of hurdles to be overcome, both legal and financial, in finalizing the award of distribution rights to new international bottlers.","We intend to continue to manage The Coca-Cola energy business, which we refer to our as our strategic brands, as a Concentrate business as The Coca-Cola Company did prior to the closing of the transactions. We will, however, continue to operate a finished product model for our Monster Energy drinks consistent with the manner in which we have historically run our business.","Under our historical Finished Products model, we sell Finished Products to our distributors. Under the Concentrate model, Concentrate and\/or beverage base is sold to bottlers who add other common ingredients and containers to produce the finished product. As a result, we have revised our reportable statements to reflect management's view of the business.","In this quarter, we report on three operating and reportable segments. First is the Finished Products segment, the principal product of which include the company's Monster Energy drink products, which previously comprised the majority of the former DSD segment. Second is Concentrate, the principal product of which include the strategic brands acquired from Coca-Cola. And the third is Other, the principal product of which include the brands disposed-off as a result of The Coca-Cola transactions, including those which were previously comprised the majority of the former warehouse segment and the Peach Tea brand.","We are endeavoring to accelerate the pace of our negotiations with Coca-Cola bottlers with a view to be able to transition a number of additional international markets to Coca-Cola bottlers in the future.","Sales in the quarter were negatively impacted by foreign exchange movements. The impact of the transitions of a substantial majority of our Monster distribution rights in the United States earlier this year, the lower inventory levels maintained by Coca-Cola bottlers versus the Anheuser-Busch distributors, and the uncertainty faced by many of our independent international distributors outside of The Coca-Cola network, given the anticipated implementation of the transactions, all negatively affected our sales growth during the second quarter.","Both the Nielsen numbers, which reflect retail sales to consumers, as well as distributed depletions, which reflect sales out by distributors and bottlers to their customers, were substantially less affected by the transition.","Results during the second quarter were also negatively affected by out-of-stocks, which occurred in certain geographies due to the learning curve associated with the transitions to The Coca-Cola network. Also the transition has progressed relatively smoothly in the United States; there is always some disruption when transitioning distribution. This learning curve is not dissimilar to what we experienced when we transitioned a large part of our distribution in the United States to The Coca-Cola bottlers some six years ago. But it was temporary. They got up to speed relatively quickly and we believe that the same will occur here.","In addition to our GAAP condensed consolidated statement of income and other information and our GAAP condensed consolidated balance sheet for the company for the quarter ended June 30, 2015, attached to our press release is a non-GAAP adjusted condensed consolidated statement of income and other information adjusting for certain of the selected items discussed in the press release impacting profitability, which we believe should be considered in assessing our performance in this quarter. We believe it would be helpful to shareholders on this call to address our results on an adjusted basis, after giving effect to such items in addition to and not in lieu of our GAAP results.","Gross sales for the 2015 second quarter were $789.9 million compared to gross sales of $779 million in the comparable second quarter of 2014. Net sales in the 2015 second quarter were $693.7 million as compared to $687.2 million in the same period last year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of approximately $29.9 million on gross sales and approximately $23.9 million on net sales.","Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 56.9% as compared to 55.2% for the comparable 2014 second quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to net sales of the Concentrate segment, which has higher gross margins than the Finished Products segment as well as changes in product sales mix and lower cost of raw materials.","Excluding distributor termination costs of $12.2 million and transaction expenses of $11.5 million, operating expenses for the 2015 second quarter were $166.1 million as compared to $161.9 million in the same quarter last year, excluding termination costs of $0.5 million and transaction costs of $1.1 million.","Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales excluding these items were 23.9% for the 2015 second quarter as compared to 23.6% in the same quarter last year. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 4.1% for the 2015 second quarter compared to 4.4% in the same quarter last year. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 10.4% compared to 10.5% in the same quarter a year ago.","Commissions and royalties in the quarter were lower, partly offset by a $1.6 million provision for marketing funds for the new Coca-Cola energy business and an increase of $3.6 million in sponsorships and endorsements.","General and administrative costs excluding distributor termination costs and the transaction costs as a percentage of net sales for the 2015 second quarter were 9.5% as compared to 8.6% for the corresponding quarter last year. This increase was primarily attributable to increased payroll expenses of $8.4 million, due to additional payroll taxes paid by the company following the exercise of certain stock options by senior management, as well as the addition of certain employees to manage and service the new strategic brands.","Stock-based compensation, a non-cash item, was $8.5 million for the second quarter of 2015 compared to $8.1 million in the same quarter last year. Payroll taxes were $6.4 million for the second quarter of 2015 as compared to $1.6 million last year in the same quarter, an increase of $4.8 million. Total transactional costs related to The Coca-Cola transactions during the second quarter were $11.5 million as compared to $1.1 million in the comparable quarter in 2014.","Gross sales to customers outside of the United States were $187.2 million in the 2015 second quarter compared to $180.2 million in the corresponding quarter in 2014. Net sales to customers outside the United States were $151.3 million in the 2015 second quarter compared to $148 million in the corresponding quarter in 2014. Foreign exchange movements had an unfavorable impact on gross sales of approximately $29.9 million and on net sales of approximately $23.9 million. Included in gross sales to customers outside the United States are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transhipped to the military and their customers overseas.","According to the Nielsen report for the 13 weeks through July 25, 2015 for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category including shots increased by 10.3% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 10% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS increased 14.9% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 0.2%. Sales of Red Bull increased 14.1%, sales of Rockstar increased by 13%, sales of 5-Hour increased 2.1% and sales of Amp decreased 5.8%.","According to Nielsen for the four-weeks ended July 25, 2015, sales in the convenience and gas channel including energy shots in dollars increased 10.7% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 9.1% over the same period last year, while NOS was up 11.5% and Full Throttle sales decreased 0.9%. Sales of Red Bull increased by 13.5%, Rockstar was up 21.7%, 5-Hour was up 4.8% and Amp was up 0.4%.","According to Nielsen for the four weeks ended July 25, 2015, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel including energy shots in dollars increased by 0.5 points over the same period last year to 34.2%. NOS' share remained the same at 3.8% and Full Throttle's share decreased 0.1 points to 1%. Red Bull share increased 0.9 points to 36.3%. Rockstar share was up 0.7 points at 7.6%. 5-Hour share was lower at 8.6% and Amp's share decreased 0.2 points to 2.2%.","According to Nielsen for the four weeks ended July 25, 2015, sales of energy plus coffee drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 9.6% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 10.9% higher than the same period last year, while Starbucks Doubleshot Energy was 9.1% higher.","According to Nielsen in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended June 27, 2015, the energy drink category increased 5%. Monster sales were up 6% versus a year ago. Our market share increased 1.4 points to 27.8% over the same period last year. Red Bull sales increased 3% and its market share decreased 0.8 points to 38.2%. Rockstar sales increased 37% and its market share increased 4.1 points to 19.2%.","According to Nielsen for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 20.4% in the month of June 2015. Monster sales increased 1.1%. Our market share decreased 6.2 points to 32.2% against the comparable period last year. Our strategic brands market share represented by Burn increased 0.3 points to 6.2%. Gladiator has been discontinued in Mexico. Red Bull sales increased 4.3% and its market share decreased by 3.2 points to 20.9%. VIVE 100's market share increased 7.8 points to 21.7%, while Boost's market share decreased 0.2 points to 14.2%.","The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and\/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.","In the month prior, which is May 2015, for example, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 28.7% in the month and Monster's sales increased 25.6%. Our market share decreased 0.9 points to 35.3% against the comparable period last year. Red Bull sales decreased 0.8% and its market share decreased by 6.1 points to 20.4%. Vive 100's market share increased 6.5 points to 19.6%, while Boost's market share decreased 1.8 points to 13.9%. Coke's market share represented by Burn and Gladiator together increased 1.1 points to 6.2%. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended June 2015, the actual 13-week periods vary by a few weeks between different markets.","Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew some 10.5% to 12.4% in Great Britain, from 15.8% to 18.7% in France, and from 7.6% to 11.5% in Germany. In the same period, Monster's value share grew from 7.9% to 8.7% in Sweden, from 8.2% to 8.8% in Belgium, and from 5.9% to 6% in the Netherlands. Monster's retail market share in value for the 13-weeks ended June 2015, as compared to the same period last year decreased from 18.7% to 16.8% in South Africa and from 22.4% to 21.9% in Spain, and from 11.7% to 11.2% in Italy. All three of these markets had independent distributors.","According to IRI, Monster's market share in Greece increased for the 13-weeks to the end of June 2015 from 25.4% to 27.8%. I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country-to-country.","According to Nielsen, for the month of May 2015 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased to 15.6% as compared to 11.3% last year. And in Brazil, Monster's market share for the month of June 2015 declined from 5.3% to 3.9% as compared to the same period last year. We believe that our distributor in Brazil has lost focus on our brand as a result of The Coca-Cola transaction.","According to INTAGE, which provides tracking and market statistics in Japan, for the month of June 2015 in the convenience store channel in Japan, Monster's market share grew from 24.1% to 32.7%. Additionally, within the last few weeks, Monster launched its Monster Energy Ultra energy drink in Japan. Early indications are very positive.","As stated earlier, the company has revised its reportable segments into Finished Products, Concentrate, and Other. Net sales for the Finished Products segment or the DSD segment, but excluding Peach Tea, increased 1.2% to $651.2 million, and operating income for the Finished Products segment before taking into account corporate and unallocated amounts decreased 1.1% to $251.6 million in the 2015 second quarter. Net sales for the Finished Products segment were negatively impacted by approximately $22.8 million of foreign currency movements, and operating income for the Finished Products segment was negatively impacted by approximately $12.2 million of distributed terminations.","Net sales for the company's new Concentrate segment were $13 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015, and operating income before taking into account corporate and unallocated amounts for the Concentrate segment was $9.1 million. You will appreciate that that covers the period only \u2013 between the closing of the transaction and the end of the quarter, which is not a full quarter.","Net sales for the company's third segment, Other, decreased 32.6% to $29.5 million for the three months ended June 2015 from $43.8 million for the same period ending June 30, 2014. The 2015 second quarter's results for the Other segment are through June 12, the date The Coca-Cola transaction closed. Operating income for the Other segment before taking into account corporate and unallocated amounts and excluding the gain on the sale of our non-energy business was $2.2 million in the second quarter of 2015 compared to $3.1 million in the second quarter of 2014.","Net sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in the second quarter of 2015 in dollars were 4.8% higher than the same period last year. In local currencies, net sales in the region were 32% higher than in the same period last year. Gross sales were 10% higher in dollars and 38% higher in local currencies. Monster is continuing to gain momentum and increase market share in Europe.","However, growth in Spain, South Africa, and Italy were negatively impacted due to the uncertainty regarding the impact of The Coca-Cola transaction. Overall, EMEA is now operating well, and we've made good strides in achieving increased distribution levels and in-store execution and traded profitably in the second quarter.","We are continuing to see the benefit of the strategic changes implemented over the past two years. The Monster Energy Valentino Rossi drink, which is now available in the majority of the markets in Europe and South Africa continues to perform well. During the quarter, we launched Mega Monster in additional EMEA markets. Results continue to be positive. In particular, in Great Britain, Germany, Greece, Sweden, Ireland, Hungary and Poland, Monster achieved sales gains and continued to increase its market share. In our international markets where our distribution partners anticipated transition occurring, there is a notable difference in our sales levels versus our markets that are already operating in The Coca-Cola system.","Net sales in Asia Pacific increased 28.7%, a 49.9% increase in local currencies versus the comparable quarter last year, while net sales in Mexico, Central and South America, and the Caribbean decreased 3.5% in dollars but increased 5.8% in local currencies over the comparable period in 2014 mainly due to foreign exchange differences, a competitive price adjustment in Chile to offset an indirect tax, and continuing issues with our Colombian distributor.","Sales in Brazil for the second quarter were disappointing, as referred to earlier. In Japan, net sales increased by 41.8% in dollars and 66.5% in local currency. In Mexico, net sales were flat both in local currency and dollars. Both Japan and Mexico contributed meaningful operating profits to the division in the second quarter of 2015. India has been impacted by losses in the second quarter following regulatory issues which are currently being addressed.","We're actively involved in discussions with prospective Coca-Cola bottlers in numerous countries around the world regarding distribution opportunities for our Monster Energy drinks. We are also evaluating many additional local production opportunities with Coca-Cola bottlers which we believe will yield cost reductions.","We have experienced a decrease in sales of Muscle Monster that we believe is principally attributable to a quality issue relating to the texture of our Muscle Monster products. I did mention this on our previous call. We have addressed the issue by reformulating those products and are currently shipping new Muscle Monster products with new graphics to our distributors.","Following the confirmation of the transactions with The Coca-Cola Company, the company received substantial cash funds. The Board of Directors is considering options with regard to the return of capital, including share repurchases.","Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $1.7 billion compared to $370.3 million at December 31, 2014. Short-term investments were $1.2 billion compared to $781.1 million at December 31, 2014. Long-term investments increased to $52.4 million from $42.9 million at December 31, 2014. Included in short- and long-term investments are auction rate securities of $3.2 million.","Days outstanding for account receivables were 42.6 days at June 30, 2015, and 36.4 days at December 31, 2014, compared to 43.5 days at June 30, 2014. Inventories increased to $180.9 million from $174.6 million December 31, 2014. Average days of inventory was 54.4 days at June 30, 2015, which was lower than the 37.4 days of inventory at December 31, 2014, and lower than the 60.8 days at June 30, 2014.","In the fall, we are planning to launch a new Juice Monster called Pipeline Punch and a new banana-flavored Muscle Monster as well as Monster Ultra Black as a permanent SKU. We have also reformulated our Rojo Tea + Energy Rehab product as a Raspberry Tea + Energy product, which is currently in the process of being introduced. We have additional new product launches planned for the beginning of 2016. Our repositioned Juice Monster and Punch Monster lines continue to show healthy gains.","Gross sales in July 2015 in dollars were approximately 14.1% higher than in July 2014. In local currencies, gross sales in July were 19.2% higher than in July 2014. July 2014 included the old Warehouse division and Peace Tea. Specifically, the Finished Product segment, which comprises our Monster Energy brand products, grew 10.2% in July in dollars and 14.5% without a foreign exchange impact.","We caution again that sales in a single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall and the timing of promotions in retail stores and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period.","In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. We are pleased that The Coca-Cola transaction closed on June 12 and are excited with the opportunity this presents to the company. North American and international gross margins are healthy and, in fact, have continued to improve. The U.S. Nielsen market statistics show that the energy category continues to grow.","We believe that the majority of the increases in dollar values achieved by Red Bull are attributable to their price increase which they implemented in January. In units, sales of Red Bull in the United States increased by 5.5%, which is lower than the 9.1% increase in units achieved by Monster. We think that the resilience shown by consumers to Red Bull's increased pricing augurs well for our planned price increase in September.","Importantly, on a unit basis, Monster continues to outperform Red Bull this year, which we believe is significant. The new additions to the Monster family that were introduced last year continue to gain market share and add to the company's sales. We believe that our Monster Ultra lines and additions and changes to our Rehab and Juice Monster lines will continue to add to sales.","Turning to international markets, we are pleased with the performance of our international expansion, particularly in Japan, Great Britain, Germany, France, Sweden, Ireland, Greece, and Chile. We are pleased with the improvement in July in our sales growth.","I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Hi, everyone.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.","Hello, Judy.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So if I look at your second quarter international trends, and I think you talked about local currency growth in some of the markets like EMEA and Japan, it actually looks very healthy despite some of the transition issues that you called out in a few of the markets. So, number one, can you just talk about what's driving some of that underlying improvement? Maybe it's the Coke System doing better or it's some of the new markets you're entering? And then even the improvement that you saw in July, what's driving that?","And then the markets that you're having some challenges, like Brazil and Italy and maybe even other markets that were having discussions about the transition, can you elaborate on how much progress you're making? What are some of the early learnings as you're talking to these bottlers and thinking about the pace in which you can transition some of the bottlers to the Coke System? Thanks.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.","Let me take the last question first. In many of these markets, it's not a question of what we can do. The question is, you've got existing distributors and bottlers who obviously have heard about the Coke transaction and believe that their territories will ultimately be transitioned to Coke. So what they've generally have really pulled back on their investments in their markets, in investing in putting extra effort. And although we've tried to obviously work with them and assure them and it effects their buyout to some extent, they really mentally are not in the same place as they were when they were fully engaged as our full-time distributors.","So the challenge we've got is in basically being able to conclude arrangements with the Coke bottlers as soon as possible to transition those markets. And we've referred to that there is a learning curve with the international Coke bottlers, not only from a point of view of learning about our products, but the way we go to the market, the way we operate, the terms of our agreements using a Finished Product model, all of these things are not usual generally to the Coke bottlers. They have very different business models and existing contractual relationships with The Coca-Cola Company.","So there are some complex issues both with regard to the legal terms of the agreements and the economics and working out the value chains. And these are being done and attended to and we are having these discussions, but it is taking some time. And unfortunately, we've just got to be patient. But what we do clearly see is there is a very big difference in both our sales in and sales out from distributors to please their depletions in markets where they are what we call non-transition markets where the distributors know that they are going to stay with the brand, for example, the Coke, the CCR markets in Europe. Those markets are generally performing well and performing at a much higher level than the markets where there is a likelihood of a transition.","There are some markets, on the other hand, where we've not made a decision to transition, and we've communicated that and been able to assure our distributor. Those markets are performing well, particularly you call out a market like Japan where our partner has \u2013 we've talked with them and we're focused on continuing to operate with them and there, the market has done very well and they are continuing to perform fully. That is in international. I mean that is not a dissimilar situation in the U.S. If you take our markets in the U.S. with it in some cases, in most cases, our existing Coke bottlers, but in some cases we have some independent bottlers here, distributors or bottlers.","And, again, you're seeing a clear difference between the results of both our sales in and the sales in were obviously also affected by the lower stock holding levels held by Coke bottlers versus the AB, the new ones we've gone to here. That was an additional factor. But even if you take that into account or put it to the side for the moment, when you look at the depletions by the Coke bottlers in the transition territories, the depletions are lower than in the same company's non-transition territories.","And it's clear that what's going on is that there is a learning curve. There were some out of stocks both from our side and in retail, but it's also a learning curve because the new sales teams have basically got to learn the Monster business, the velocities, those accounts that are higher in velocity don't necessarily replicate the accounts that are higher in velocity for traditional beverages. And so we think that that's a transitory thing and this is the quarter where they've gone through it. It's the first 90 days of the transition to the Coke System in the U.S. And so we think these are things that are just going to have to work their way out of it.","And we believe we're starting to see improvements and some of that is now being reflected in the numbers that we're showing in our sales numbers for July. But obviously what you also can see is, if you look at the Nielsen over this whole period, the Nielsen numbers in the U.S. have been pretty consistent on our sales out in units, et cetera, which shows that from the consumer point of view, there is still similar retail pull in all these markets.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, hey. Thanks. Good afternoon, guys.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.","Hi, Mark.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I guess just two questions. One is sort of a follow up on the last one. If you could talk maybe about directionally, did the July number benefit from restock? Or did you see more of that in, call it, months of May and June, and so the July number is more of a representation of demand? I guess you could see that from the scanner data, but maybe if you could give us a bit of commentary on that, that'd be helpful.","And then secondly on cash, I appreciate your commentary from a board standpoint, but $3 billion in cash is obviously an awful lot. So what prevents you from going into the market, call it, Monday, Tuesday, whenever the window opens up next week, to buy back a lot of stock? Or how should we sort of think about the share repurchases? Is it going to be in open market for some period of time? Will there be an ASR tender? If you could just sort of help us directionally on that, that'd be great too. Thank you.","Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary, Monster Beverage Corp.","Well, Mark, if I could answer that question on cash there, there will be a return of cash to shareholders. The board is meeting tomorrow and it's one of the issues that will be tabled on the board meeting. And I can't say what route the board will take, but there are certainly a number of options open to the board and they will make their decision in due course.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.","Yeah. It's obviously clear that we have the excess cash, and we will address it, but we need to address it in due course. There are a number of reasons as to what we need to do or how to do it and we will look at that, Mark. It's just premature at the moment. I know everybody is keen to get us to deal with it and address it, but it just has to be dealt with in due course.","Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary, Monster Beverage Corp.","And then your first question was about the July sales and I think there's a general view here that the stock reductions are past us and that the July sales really are a factor of demand. And that's a view, it's not something that one can take to the bank but it's certainly the view that we hold here.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.","Yeah. And we also think that that's being influenced by the fact that, again, some of that learning curve is now improving and some of the out of stocks that initially occurred because of unknown order patterns for different products in our line which has quite a lot of products. Those things have \u2013 we think those are normalizing and we think that that is more indicative of our regular business.","Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary, Monster Beverage Corp.","And we have been having regular meetings with The Coca-Cola bottlers in the U.S. and these issues are being addressed.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.","Hi.","Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Only two questions. One, could you talk about what portion of your non-U.S. sales are going through non-Coca-Cola distributors at this time? And what's the level of decline with those? Any sort of help that would be great. And the second one is in non-U.S. markets where Coca-Cola does not have a contractual obligation to partner with you, unlike the U.S. market, are you seeing greater difficulty? Or it's just going through the process of finding out terms and conditions that are acceptable to both the parties?","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.","I think there is a general excitement amongst all of the Coke bottlers to take on Monster and to partner with us. And I think it's right through the Coke. I think there's a very good attitude throughout the Coke System. I think the issue is \u2013 as I indicated earlier, it's getting to be able to get them comfortable with the basis on which we do business which is different to the traditional Concentrate sort of model business that Coke has followed for centuries. And to get them to understand us and work through the legal issues such that we're getting through value chain issues.","And generally to the extent that we've worked with them, they're all comfortable with the value chain issues that there are satisfactory ways in which we can work to share the issue and they're excited by that. It's a positive for them. But we obviously have to negotiate and get through everybody, trying to muscle each other at the moment to take a position which will obviously be (38:30) going forward. So we're just having to work through those issues.","But we are hopeful that we'll get through in most of them. And if to the extent that we don't in any particular territory, we have options that we can go to. We have existing distributors, and a lot of the issues we are having with existing distributors if we were to not transition a territory and go back to those distributors and basically assure them that or give them a longer term contract and give them the assurance that they will have a longer term, that they have a number of years secured, we've got no doubt they will start to reinvest and re-engage in the brand. It's just that we've not been able to do that because we haven't wanted to mislead them or give them any false hopes. And so that's been the delicate tightrope we've been walking at the moment.","So again, it doesn't mean that in every territory we will go to a Coke bottler. But I don't think that that is an issue. The issue at the moment is just getting everybody and it's time to deal in all these different countries and get everybody on the same page and get them comfortable with us. We are making progress. And we obviously are going to try and step up the pace of those negotiations.","Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary, Monster Beverage Corp.","Yeah. I think I just wanted to add that the decisions that will be made for international distribution will be decisions that will be the best for Monster, for our company, and that will be assessed following the negotiations, the value chains, legal issues and other opportunities which we may have.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.","Now, on the percentages, I would say that probably got the \u2013 probably pretty much the majority of our sales are with existing Coke bottlers internationally, pretty close to half, and if you look at the numbers in many places other than Japan which is an exception, in other places you've got sales very much down and Chile is also a good market as well in that sense. These bottlers are working well with the distributor, but in Brazil particularly it's been very disappointing. They're just really not engaged and some of the wholesalers they work with seem to have disengaged as well.","And then in some of the markets which are non-Coke bottlers, when I say we're up, it's marginal, it's almost flat versus really nice healthy gains across the Coke bottler markets. So there is a very big distinction between those markets. But as to the percentage, I'm just guessing. I just don't have a number in my head or available at this point in time.","Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary, Monster Beverage Corp.","More than 50 billion is probably a good... (41:24)","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.","Yeah. And then the one distributor that did perform pretty well, which was a distributor in Germany, they also did perform reasonably well until we changed over, but that was quite a large volume market which have now changed to Coke. And in the first month there, we've been very satisfied with the result. It's been very positive.","Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary, Monster Beverage Corp.","And in Mexico, the July sales were actually very good.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.","And I should put Mexico into the same category as Japan and Chile. The distributor still continues to perform well. Some of the major problems markets are the ones I did allude to earlier. Thanks.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan Stanley (sic) [Securities] (42:10). Your line is now open.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Two quick questions here. The first is, and I apologize if you gave this in the numbers. Did you talk about the underlying growth of the acquired Coke brands in terms of how you think they're doing? And will the bottlers view them as reinvigorated as you take over responsibility for or ownership for them?","And then secondly, I had a question on the gross margin. Given the regional mix with weaker U.S. and stronger international, the gross margin was still up a lot. Any thoughts in terms of what's driving the gross margin expansion? Thanks.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.","Gross margin generally has probably been affected a little bit by the Concentrate division, which is the strategic brands which have higher gross margins. And we've just been able to achieve some lower costs, which we indicated, in our brands even though there is a balance between international and domestic. But what had happened is I think our international margins have also improved on this quarter versus previous quarters. So while they are perhaps a little bit lower than our domestic margins, the improvement in those margins have had an effect and have helped push up our overall margins.","Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary, Monster Beverage Corp.","And what we said earlier on the call, John, was that there were higher gross margins because in the Finished Products segment, which is largely a function of product sales mix and lower cost of certain raw materials. So we did refer to that earlier on in the call.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.","So could you repeat your first question, John? Hello?","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Can you hear me?","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.","Sorry, no. Can you repeat your first question?","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sure. So the first question was about the Coke energy brands that you acquired and what the underlying trends were for those businesses in July and whether the bottlers feel more reinvigorated given the fact that you are going to be probably providing a greater level of focus on those brands.","Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary, Monster Beverage Corp.","I just want to remind everyone that the Concentrate business was only in for two weeks in the quarter. We closed the transaction on the 12th, which is a Friday. From the 15th to the end of the month, the Concentrate sales were incorporated in the financial results for this quarter. So turning to July, I don't have those numbers for July. I think we had them earlier for the Concentrate division.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.","I think the sales for the Concentrate division or the brands have been a little choppy but it's been very early. We only got the brands recently. We then didn't have access to a lot of the underlying marketing information about the brands until we closed. We're still getting information and trying to understand the brands.","We have marketing guys working with us. Some of the people we took on from Coke but some of our own guys are having to travel to different markets to try and understand the brands. And we're still trying to put together our strategy on these brands. Obviously, we've talked with the Coke guys and we've reassured them that we're going to obviously focus on these brands and give these brands attention. And at the moment, I think they're doing fine, but I can't give you an indication of direction because it really just is too premature.","Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary, Monster Beverage Corp.","Yeah, I'm just looking at the numbers we have. We don't have them with us as to what happened in July with the Concentrate business last year. We know obviously what it was this year but we don't have it here.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.","I think we're just going to have to just spend some time before we start giving more direction. I mean, they are continuing to upgrade pretty decently in most markets. There are a couple of individual markets where the bottlers were sort of not happy and we've seen them want to discontinue some of the brands in some small markets and small brands. Like I mentioned earlier that they decided to discontinue Gladiator in Mexico and then Samurai was discontinued in the Philippines, which was a low-priced brand there.","But by and large, the markets are fine. And the most important markets are actually the U.S. with NOS. And we feel the brand is good. It has slowed a little bit. We think there may have been a little bit of a pulling back on some of the marketing spend behind the brand. But we believe in the brand and the bottlers in the U.S. also believe in the brand and I think we can obviously make that brand grow. So we are positive about the NOS brand going forward. And we think that there is a role for Full Throttle in the portfolio as well.","Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary, Monster Beverage Corp.","NOS has increased actually in the 12 weeks that we mentioned earlier as well in all outlets combined by 14.9%. So sales of Full Throttle were down 0.2% and the overall market was up by 10.3%. So NOS grew in excess of the market.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.","Yeah. So that continues to perform and we're excited about that \u2013 the NOS brand. And there are a number of the brands that we really see as very good opportunities around the world in the portfolio. Thank you very much.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.","On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continue to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad. We are particularly excited by the new opportunities that we have going forward with a robust portfolio of energy drink products throughout the world comprised of our Monster Energy drink line together with the newly acquired strategic brands.","We believe that our agreement with The Coca-Cola Company will enable us to focus on our core energy business while leveraging the strength of The Coca-Cola Company's powerful distribution and bottling system on a worldwide scale.","Thank you very much for your attendance.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference.

Sir, you may begin.","Rodney C. Sacks","Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, is with me, as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance. Before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends.

A copy of this information is also available on our website www.monsterbevcorp.com, in the Financial Information section.","Once again, we reiterate that our products are safe based on both our and the industry's long track record and the scientific evidence supporting the safety of our ingredients. We estimate that about 50 billion cans of energy drinks have been sold and safely consumed worldwide over the past 25 years, including more than 8 billion Monster Energy drinks over the past 11 years. Based on a third-party report, it is estimated that Red Bull sold more than 5 billion cans of energy drinks in 165 countries in 2012. In 2012, we sold some 2 billion-plus cans of Monster Energy drinks in approximately 90 countries.","To the best of our knowledge, the FDA's position is that it continues to believe that there is a long history of safe use of products containing caffeine in the U.S., and that the average amount of caffeine consumed by the U.S. population has not increased in spite of the entry of energy drinks into the marketplace. The FDA has confirmed that available studies do not indicate any new previously unknown risks associated with caffeine consumption. Unfortunately, inaccurate and speculative articles continue to be published in the media regarding energy drinks. We have endeavored to respond to those inaccuracies when practical by providing accurate and scientific facts to the media as has the American Beverage Association.","By way of illustration, we compare the caffeine levels in Monster Energy drinks from all sources to the caffeine levels of coffeehouse coffee, such as for example Starbucks or Caribou, as this comparison is more easily understood by and meaningful to consumers. Coffee has been and continues to be extensively and safely consumed everyday in the U.S. by many tens of millions of consumers. Some publications have erroneously suggested that energy drinks contain up to 500 milligrams of caffeine and have compared them to a 5-ounce cup of coffee that contains about 100 milligrams of caffeine. Monster Energy drinks do not contain anywhere near 500 milligrams of caffeine. A 16-ounce Monster Energy drink contains approximately 160 milligrams of caffeine. We do not believe that any of the leading coffeehouses sell 5-ounce cups of coffee, including Starbucks. A small Starbucks contains 12 ounces of coffee, a medium-sized Starbucks contains 16 ounces of coffee, and its large size, 20 ounces. While Starbucks also sells an 8-ounce size, we believe the size has very limited sales. We note that Starbucks also sells an extra large 31-ounce size.","In making a comparison to coffee, we believe that it is appropriate to use Starbucks' 16-ounce medium-size coffee, which is the same size as a regular 16-ounce Monster Energy drink. Starbucks' 16-ounce coffee contains approximately 330 milligrams of caffeine, which is double the approximate 160 milligrams of caffeine in the same size Monster Energy drink and a 16-ounce Caribou coffee contains between 305 and 370 milligrams of caffeine.","Some have criticized our comparison on the ground that coffee is bitter, hot and consumed by adults. These criticisms are misplaced. Coffeehouses provide free sugar and cream. A significant number of items listed on their menus are sweet and indulgent and available hot and cold. Adolescents do in fact, drink coffee extensively. One only needs to visit Starbucks, Caribou or any other coffeehouse store to confirm this. It is estimated that around 350 million cups of coffee are drunk every day in the U.S., equates to about 128 billion cups per year.","According to a study done by the research firm NPD, some 13% of coffee consumers are under 18. That translates to about 45 million cups of coffee that are drunk everyday by teenagers under 18 or approximately 17 billion cups per year. We estimate that the size of the energy drink market in the U.S. is about 5 billion cans a year. In other words, the coffee market is about 25x bigger than the energy drink market. Even if one were to consume -- were to assume that a higher percentage of teenagers under 18 consume energy drinks than coffee, which we do not believe is accurate, coffee consumption in the U.S. by teens under 18 is dramatically higher than energy drinks. The National Coffee Association of the USA in its 2012 national coffee drinks -- drinkers trends advise that more than 50% of coffee drinkers said they began drinking coffee at least once a week between the ages of 13 and 19.","We also do not accept that consumers tend to drink coffee more slowly than energy drinks, which has also been suggested. On the contrary, coffee cools quickly and consumers generally prefer to drink their coffee before it becomes lukewarm. Additionally, a large percentage of coffeehouse coffees are not consumed hot and are positioned as cold drinks, i.e., Frappuccino, iced coffee, mochas, et cetera. As an aside, the caffeine levels of coffeehouse coffees, which are generally double that of energy drinks are also not listed on menu boards or cups. Even McDonald's, one of the largest restaurant chains in the U.S., has been remodeling their stores to provide coffee drinks, both hot and cold, in many flavors, varieties and efficacy.","Monster Energy drinks have traditionally been marketed as dietary supplements as defined under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. However, as communicated in the past, Monster Energy drinks could also be marketed as conventional beverages because their ingredients are either FDA-approved food or color additives or substances that are Generally Recognized As Safe or GRAS at the levels used in the products.","We confirm that the company has made the decision to transition its Monster Energy drinks to conventional foods for a number of business reasons, including: To eliminate our competitive disadvantage in certain states, where energy drinks labeled as conventional food, like Red Bull, are exempt from sales tax and are also eligible for redemption with food stamps, while energy drinks labeled as dietary supplements like Monster are not. This change will have the effect of leveling the playing field with our major competitors. The company saw no reason to continue being subjected to the erroneous and misguided criticism that its Monster Energy drinks are being marketed as dietary supplements to avoid FDA regulation. As we have always said, dietary supplements are subject to as much if not more FDA oversight than are conventional foods and Monster Energy drinks could equally satisfy the regulatory requirements applicable to both regulatory categories.","Finally, we recently joined the American Beverage Association and will follow their recommendations to label energy drinks as conventional foods and to list the caffeine amounts on labels. The change will be put into effect as and when new packaging is manufactured and new products are introduced. The ingredients currently in Monster Energy drinks will continue to be included in those drinks in the future, save for some inconsequential changes in minor products. Following completion of this labeling change, we anticipate that only our Worx Energy products, which are packaged in 2-ounce bottles, will continue to be labeled as dietary supplements in accordance with the FDA regulations.","Discovery is continuing in the Fournier case. This is a very sad situation for the family, and we sympathize with them. However, the production of additional medical records and documents continues to confirm that there was no causal connection between Ms. Fournier's alleged consumption of a Monster Energy drink and her death. In addition to Ms. Fournier's serious hereditary heart condition, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, she also suffered from other significant structural defects of her heart, including mitral valve prolapse, fibrosis and myocarditis. Heart defects of these types are commonly known to cause cardiac arrest and sudden death. It is believed that these conditions, either independently or in concert with one another, caused her arrhythmia and ultimately her sad and untimely death. Caffeine does not appear to have been in any way connected with or the cause of Ms. Fournier's arrhythmia and cardiac arrest. Indeed, we believe that Ms. Fournier was accustomed to drinking a cup of coffee every morning. Again, we point out that no caffeine blood level test was ever performed, and there is no scientific evidence of the level of caffeine in Ms. Fournier's system at the time of her cardiac arrest, if any. We repeat that the levels of caffeine contained in our Monster Energy drinks are safe.","On December 20, 2012, the company responded to the letter received by it on October 31, 2012, from the City Attorney of San Francisco questioning the safety of our energy products and the marketing claims made by the company with respect thereto. On February 8, the company responded to the letter received by the company from Senators Durbin and Blumenthal and Representative Markey regarding the safety, labeling and marketing of the energy drink products sold by the company. In both responses, we provided citations to numerous examples of third-party scientific documentation substantiating the safety of our products. As we have previously stated, we will continue to provide appropriate responses to any regulatory or similar inquiries that we receive. The company has also received miscellaneous demands and\/or complaints over the past few months regarding the labeling and\/or safety of our energy drink product from various unscrupulous plaintiff's lawyers, and which the company believes to be without substance. The company intends to vigorously defend against those claims. The company assumes no obligation to update any statements made with respect to ongoing litigation and regulatory matters, including with respect to the afore-going disclosures, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, other than as required by law.","Given the current litigation and pending regulatory requests, I hope you understand that we will refrain from answering questions or commenting further on these specific subjects. We are happy, of course, to answer questions you may have about our products in general or about our fourth quarter results as best we can after we have concluded our discussion on the business.","Let me now turn to a discussion on the business. We believe that the softness in the energy drink market in the U.S. over the past few months may be due in part to the ongoing negative publicity and comments that continue to appear in the media questioning the safety of energy drinks and suggesting limitations on their ingredients, including caffeine and\/or the levels thereof and\/or imposing minimum age restrictions for consumers. In the face of these challenges, the company nevertheless continued to make good progress in the fourth quarter and achieved record fourth quarter gross sales, up 16.6% to $545 million, net sales up 15% to $471.5 million and operating income up 10.1% to $113.9 million.","Our tax rate was higher this quarter at 39.1% versus 38.3% in the same quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share increased 10.6%, from $0.35 per share in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $0.39 per share in the fourth quarter of 2012. While we are pleased with the results we achieved in the fourth quarter, our revenues were somewhat affected by less robust growth for the energy category as a whole and Monster Energy in our principal market, the United States, particularly in the latter half of the quarter. Lower sales of certain of our energy drinks, primarily our Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology energy drinks and Worx Energy shots and flat sales in our Warehouse division. As discussed on previous conference calls, we will be reporting on Nielsen's extended sample of outlets, which includes Wal-Mart; dollar stores such as Family Dollar, Dollar General and Fred's; DeCA military stores; and club stores, namely Sam's and BJ's, but excluding Costco.","According to the Nielsen report for the 13 weeks through February 16, 2013, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, on the expanded basis I just described, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including shots, increased by 5.7% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 8.1% in the 13-week period, while sales of Red Bull increased by 10.8%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 4.1% and sales of 5-Hour decreased by 7.7%. Sales of AMP were down 17.6%. NOS increased 11.7% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 2.3%.","According to the Nielsen report for the 4 weeks ended February 16, 2013, sales of energy drinks in the convenience and gas channel, in dollars, increased by 3.8% over the comparable 4-week period in 2012. Sales of Monster increased by 7.5% over the comparable period last year, while sales of Red Bull increased by 7.2% over the same period. Rockstar was up 4.4%, while 5-Hour was down 9.5%.","According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended February 16, 2013, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased by 1.1 points over the comparable period a year ago to 31.9% against Red Bull's share of 34.9%, Rockstar's share of 8.5% and 5-Hour's share of 10.6%.","According to Nielsen in the 13 weeks ended February 16, 2013, for all outlets combined, sales of energy plus coffee drinks, in dollars, increased 11.7% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 18.6% higher than in the comparable period last year, while Starbucks Double Shot Energy was up 7.4%. Sales of Java Monster exceed -- exceeded sales of Starbucks Double Shot Energy drinks.","According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended January 12, 2013, the energy drink category grew 1%. Monster sales increased 8%, and our market share at 26.4% increased 1.8 points over the comparable period last year. While Red Bull sales increased 2%, and its market share increased 0.5 point to 37.9%. Rockstar sales decreased 6%, and its market share decreased 1 point to 14%.","According to Nielsen in the 4 weeks ended January 12, 2013, sales of energy drinks in Canada for the convenience and gas channel grew 2%. Over this period, sales of Red Bull increased 6%, sales of Monster increased 12%, while sales of Rockstar decreased by 12%.","According to Nielsen, in all outlets combined in Mexico for the month of December 2012, the energy drink category grew 5.1%. Monster sales increased 11.9%, and our market share increased 2.1 points over the comparable period last year to 35%, while Red Bull sales decreased 2.8%, and its market share decreased 2.8 points to 34.2%. Boost sales increased 26.4%, and its market share increased 2.4 points to 14.5%.","Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 15.7% to $451 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2012, from $389.8 million in the same period in 2011 and operating income for the company's DSD segment increased 12.4% from $129.6 million to $145.6 million. Sales of our Monster Original green energy drink continued to grow in the quarter as did sales of Java Monster. However, the increase in sales of these products was partially offset by lower sales of certain Monster SKUs, including our Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology line, which was repositioned from 12-ounce cap-cans to 12-ounce sleek flat top cans and was priced in line with our regular 16-ounce drinks beginning September 2012. It will take some time for the effect of such repositioning to be realized. Sales of Worx were also substantially lower in the fourth quarter than in the same period last year.","Net sales for the company's Warehouse segment increased 1.9% to $20.5 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2012 due to increased sales of Hubert's Lemonades, but which was partially offset by reduced sales of apple juice. The Warehouse division experienced an operational loss of $320,000 in this quarter compared to an operating income of $750,000 for the same quarter last year, largely as a result of lower gross profit due to the impact of increased costs of apple juice concentrate and higher distribution and selling expenses.","For the 3 months ended December 31, 2012, gross sales to retail, grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers represented 3% of gross sales, down from 4% in the comparable period in 2011. Gross sales to club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represented 9% of sales, the same as in the comparable period in 2011. Gross sales to full-service distributors represented 65% of sales, down from 66% in the comparable period in 2011. Gross sales internationally increased to 21% from 19% in the same period in 2011. Other sales were 2% for the period, which was the same as the comparable period last year.","Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the fourth quarter of 2012 amounted to $115.2 million compared to $88.9 million in the same quarter in 2011. Included in such sales are sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas.","Net sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in the fourth quarter of 2012, in dollars, were 27.1% higher than in the same period last year. Excluding the effect of the strengthening dollar, such sales would have been 31.7% higher. Monster is continuing to gain momentum and market share in Europe. In particular in the U.K., Spain, Germany, Benelux and South Africa, Monster achieved substantial sales gains, as well as substantially increased its market share. In the United Kingdom, according to Nielsen, Monster's market share is now approximately 10%. Overall, our Western European and African operations are now operating well, and we have generally made good strides in increasing distribution levels and sales. The Central and Eastern European region is still incurring operating losses, although we are continuing to see improving benefits from the strategic changes we began to implement last year.","The launch of Monster Zero Ultra in 16-ounce cans in the third quarter of 2012 was very successful. We continue to believe in our growth strategy, particularly internationally, including entering new markets in which the company's products are not yet being sold. We launched Monster Energy in Slovenia, Peru, Chile, Korea and Singapore in the fourth quarter of 2012 and beginning of 2013, and are continuing with our plans to launch Monster in India, Romania, Albania and Croatia and in additional countries in Central and Eastern Europe later in 2013. We are reevaluating if and when to launch Monster Energy in Argentina in light of the low value chain available in that country for energy drinks.","Additional positive news is that the sales in Japan in the fourth quarter of 2012 continue to exceed our expectations. Although damages and resulting product losses in relation to the production and shipping of products for Korea and Japan were substantially reduced in the fourth quarter, such losses still negatively affected our gross margins during the quarter. Our strategy to secure local production in certain of our international markets will help us improve gross margins, mitigate the effects of exchange rate fluctuations, as well as reduce damages.","Sales of Peace Tea ready-to-drink iced tea continue to progress well. In the fourth quarter of 2012, gross sales of Peace Tea increased 10.8% over the same period in 2011. We are continuing with our plan to introduce additional packages and container sizes for the Peace Tea brand during the first half of 2013, and in fact, introduced new take-home multipacks of Peace Tea containing 8.4-ounce cans during the first quarter of 2013.","We are continuing to sell and market Worx Energy shots, although we have continued to experience a substantial drop-off in sales in this product line.","Although we still have a long way to go, we achieved reduced operating losses in Australia in the fourth quarter as compared to the same quarter last year. We have entered into a distribution agreement with Ambev for the distribution of Monster Energy drinks in Brazil. Ambev commenced selling our products at the end of January 2013. We recorded a distributor termination expense of $0.9 million in the quarter following the termination of our previous distributor in Brazil.","Gross profit margins achieved in the fourth quarter of 2012 were 51.7% versus 52.3% in the comparable quarter in 2011. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to geographic mix, product and production variances and product damages, primarily in Europe and Asia, including production cost increases passed on to us by our co-factory in the United Kingdom during the first half of 2012 and increased promotional and other allowances as a percentage of net sales. Gross profit margins achieved in North America overall were higher than in the comparable quarter last year.","Distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales were 4.7% and 4.4% in the fourth quarters of 2012 and 2011, respectively. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.5% for both the 2012 and 2011 fourth quarters. For the fourth quarter of 2012, selling expenses included increases in sponsorship and endorsements, trade development programs, marketing fees and merchandise displays. These increases were partially offset by decreases in commissions and royalty payments paid to noncustomers, premiums and advertising in the fourth quarter of 2012 as compared to the same quarter in 2011.","For the 12 months ended December 31, 2012, selling expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 11.9% from 12.9% in 2011. Sponsorship and endorsement costs and allocated trade development programs were higher than in 2011. Selling expenses were also higher due to increased marketing fees and merchandise display costs. The increase in selling expenses was partially offset by reduced selling expenses for advertising, commissions and royalty payments paid to noncustomers.","General and administrative expenses increased 17.6% in the quarter. The increase in general and administrative cost was partially attributable to increased professional services, including legal and payroll expenses, which includes stock-based compensation expense. Stock-based compensation expense were $6.8 million for the quarter compared to $6.6 million for the same period last year, and $28.4 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2012, compared to $19.4 million for the 12-month period last year.","In 2012, cost of goods in Western Europe were higher on a per case basis, while selling, general and administrative expenses were lower on a per case basis in local currencies than in 2011. We invested extensively in Central and Eastern Europe in 2012, particularly in newer markets throughout the region. Selling, general and administrative expenses in that region were lower on a per case basis in local currencies. We have successfully concluded agreements with our principal distributor in Central and Eastern Europe, which will result in a more equitable allocation of the value chain between us. As a result, we reduced our operating losses in Central and Eastern Europe in 2012, and we intend to build on those arrangements to continue to reduce operating cost and improve our operating results in 2013.","We are continuing to work with our Australian distributor to increase their contribution towards promotional costs going forward and have also reduced our overall cost of goods and operating costs in local currency in that market. We will continue to work towards achieving improved results in Australia in 2013.","Operating income was negatively affected by combined operating losses of $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, from our operations in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, South America and Asia. Following the strength of the U.S. dollar, we recorded a foreign-currency loss of $2.7 million for the quarter.","Our effective tax rate in the 2012 fourth quarter was 39.1% compared to 38.3% in the 2011 fourth quarter. The increase in the 2012 fourth quarter effective tax rate was primarily the result of increased losses in certain foreign subsidiaries for which there is no tax benefit. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2012, was 38.1% compared to 37.4% for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in effective tax rate for the year was also primarily the result of increased losses in certain foreign subsidiaries for which there is no tax benefit, the establishment of full valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets of certain foreign subsidiaries, as well as a higher effective combined state tax rate.","During the 2012 fourth quarter, the company purchased 6.7 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $50.86 per share for a total amount of $339.6 million, this excludes broker commissions. Over the full 2012 year, the company purchased a total of 13.5 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $54.47 per share for a total amount of $737.1 million, also excluding broker commissions. Subsequent to December 31, 2012, the company purchased an additional 300,000 shares of its stock at an average purchase price of $51.99 per share, which exhausted the availability under the current repurchase plan.","Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $222.5 million compared to $359.3 million at December 31, 2011. Short-term investments were $97 million compared to $411 million at December 31, 2011. Long-term investments decreased from $23.2 million at December 31, 2011 to $21.4 million. Included in short and long-term investments are auction rate securities of $23.2 million.","Days outstanding for trade accounts receivables were 39.2 days at December 31, 2012, and 42.4 days at December 31, 2011, compared to 38.7 days at December 30, 2011. Inventories increased to $203.1 million from $155.6 million at December 31, 2011. Average days of inventory was 80 days, which was higher than the 72 days of inventory at December 31, 2011.","Following the positive response that we received from consumers to the launch of Zero Ultra, we have decided to launch a new Ultra Blue line extension in the first half of 2013 and to defer the launch of the proposed Ultra Pink line extension for now. We are continuing with our plans to introduce Kona Cappuccino in the first half of this year, as well as a new line of 3, 15-ounce energy shakes called Muscle Monster that will contain 25 grams of protein per can. The Monster mini take-home multipacks containing 8-ounce cans were launched in the first quarter of 2013. Initial reception to those products, as well as the Peace Tea multipacks from both retailers and consumers has been positive. We will be launching an additional Monster Rehab line extension, Pink Lemonade + Tea + Energy during the first quarter of 2013.","Gross sales in January 2013 were approximately 9.5% higher than in January 2012. We caution again that sales in a single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as for example selling days, days in the week in which holidays fall and the timing of promotions in retail stores, and should not necessarily be imputed to or be regarded as indicative of results in the full quarter or any future period. In regard to January, we do want to point out that January faced a more difficult prior year comp, which was plus 34% last year.","In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. North American gross margins remain healthy. Our 2012 fourth quarter gross margins for North America were actually higher than in the comparable 2011 fourth quarter. U.S. Nielsen market statistics show that Monster Energy's growth is still outpacing the growth of the category as a whole. We have entered into a distribution agreement with Big Geyser effective April 1, 2013, for distribution of Monster products in the Greater New York area, which is the second-largest energy drink market in the U.S. We plan to launch exciting new additions to the Monster family.","Turning to international markets, we are satisfied with the performance of our international expansion and investment. Our market share continues to increase in almost all of our international markets. International gross sales for 2012 topped $0.5 billion. In 2012, our European business achieved improved operating results. Net sales in euros were up 56% for the year. It is noteworthy that even though the energy drink category has been in existence in Europe for over 25 years, our EMEA markets on average are still experiencing double-digit growth.","According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended December 29, 2012, our market share in the United Kingdom increased to approximately 10% from 6.8% the previous year. And in the 4 weeks ended December  31, 2012, in Spain, we more than doubled our market share and are now the #2 brand with 18% market share, and in South Africa nearly tripled our market share to 15.2%.","According to Nielsen, Monster Energy has the leading market share in value in Mexico. We are excited about our expansion into Asia-Pacific. Monster sales in Japan remain encouraging and are exceeding our expectations. The brand has already achieved an estimated 27% value share of the energy drink market in the modern convenience trade channel, according to internal estimates by our distribution partner. The shipping issues we experienced in 2012 have been significantly reduced. We have launched Monster Energy in Korea, having overcome the product approval and labeling issues we had experienced, and we have achieved authorizations in 3 of the 4 largest modern convenience chains in Korea. We also commenced distribution in Brazil at the end of January with Ambev, our new distribution partner.","I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala of UBS.","Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I know you're happy with the successes of Zero Ultra, can you talk a little bit about the incrementality of the product? And maybe how much is cannibalizing Lo-Carb or Absolute Zero or maybe even green can?","Rodney C. Sacks","I think that -- we don't think that it's cannibalizing the green can, let's start off with that. That is still up nicely. And that is the largest product, so that is up quite nicely. We have seen some cannibalization against basically the Lo-Carb and our Absolute Zero. We are seeing some cannibalization against those 2 products, that is to be expected. They're all basically playing in that 0 or low-carb category. The actual sales we saw, we reached about 72% distribution in convenience. We still have some distribution to gain, and we think also quality of distribution. In some cases, it's been squeezed onto shelves, so we think that there is some room for expansion in both numbers and quality. And it is already pretty much our second best-selling SKU on a per point basis in the stores it's in. So it has been very, very successful.","Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And just quickly to make sure I understood, you said green can was up. Did you give a number? Did you say it was up strongly? I don't have that number.","Rodney C. Sacks","Let me give a number, it's up 4.4% in the 13 weeks.","Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then the last thing on shots, this is your second go-around on the shots business. Sounds like it's down substantially. It also seems like it's a very different consumer that drinks -- that uses shots versus the energy drink consumers. Is it a category that maybe just doesn't fit the profile of your playbook or is it something that you feel that over time has a place...","Rodney C. Sacks","We don't know. We know that there is a category there. We know that it has slowed. But there definitely is -- a category exists. It is a category, in which the basically the only player is still earning very good margins. We believe it is a slightly different consumer, but it does -- a demographic, but it does -- it is related. We're in the beverage category. We believe there still is business. We believe there is room for a competitor, but so far nobody's been able to really crack the code. But it doesn't mean we shouldn't continue trying whether it's in -- with Worx in its present form, its present flavors, its present size, its present pricing. I think we're going to continue to look at and evaluate, but we do believe there is still some opportunity that as a beverage company, we shouldn't walk away from and take off the table. But it does have an effect obviously in looking at comps, and that's why we break it out and deal with it. But we still haven't made final decisions on what to do exactly with Worx or what direction to take in that category.","Operator","Our next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Rodney and Hilton, first just in international market, so fourth quarter slowed down a little bit if I look at your sales growth x currency. So maybe can you talk about some of the markets where you saw a little bit of a softness or is this just really more of a shipment versus kind of a consumer takeaway volatility issue? And from a profitability perspective, it sounds like you are pretty much breakeven in the fourth quarter in your international market. So do you think we're close to now at an inflection point where all of your international markets collectively start to turn profitable?","Rodney C. Sacks","I think that one of the things that did negatively effect our sales in Europe was that CCE in particular went through a realignment of some of their inventories, which decreased, I think, purchases that would ordinarily have been expected from them. And I think -- we think that had a little bit of a dampening effect. I don't want to go into each of the countries. I don't have them handy as to what we did in each of them. We did highlight the major countries, in which we did experience good growth, and those are the main markets in Europe, which is, I think, just about everywhere I think we've grown. I mean, there may be 1 or 2 anomalies, but some of them are -- we still grew. We may not have grown in sell-in, but we did grow in sell-through, but those are the small markets, and they sort of just -- it's just a question of timing. So basically, the main markets, we continue to grow quite nicely, which is the U.K., Germany, Spain, South Africa, Benelux, were good markets this year as well.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Then just in terms of profitability, 2-part question, one, can you talk about Brazil and how the launch in Brazil could impact your profitability in your international markets? Presumably, those are a more profitable market than perhaps some of your other markets. And I believe you said 9.5% in January sales, but you started to ship into Brazil at the end of January. So can you broadly talk about kind of Brazil and how you think that, that market will contribute to your international business in 2013?","Rodney C. Sacks","I'm not sure -- while we began to ship to Ambev, also there was transfer of existing inventories, I think, from our existing distributor to Ambev, so I'm not sure what the net incremental sales were. But the initial response from Ambev has been positive. We're positive. They are a powerful organization. They have extensive distribution. It is rolling out on a sort of a gradual basis, in a region by region basis. It wasn't an immediate hit right through Brazil. But we do believe that there is good growth potential in Brazil. We also believe that while we are continuing to pack our product at an independent third-party packer, we are -- we don't get the benefit of a number of tax breaks and other things. Some of those benefits we believe we will be able to achieve and improve our margins as we realign our packaging with Ambev and take other steps to improve our margins. So we are quite happy. The value chain is acceptable. The value chain, particularly in some of the -- most of the other South American countries we've gone into has also -- has also been quite positive for us. And we will basically -- we will anticipate some costs of trade, MDF slotting, et cetera, as we continue to list product in basically chains in Brazil. We really didn't have very extensive distribution before. So we do look at some upside coming from the South American region. Once we get some of the costs in local production going in Japan and Korea particularly, we do believe those countries will also start contributing profitably. So I think that overall, we were slightly negative on international. But we are looking forward this year to turning the corner. But again, there's a big mix of international that goes into that whole pot, and I can't be more definite than that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Caroline Levy of CLSA.","Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Just I was wondering if you could help us understand proportionately the makeup of the international sales. I mean, Mexico and Canada both in there if I'm not mistaken. Are they the lion's share or is the U.K., Europe, just helping us really understand that.","Rodney C. Sacks","I can try and get some of those sort of totals. Europe is -- overall is clearly far bigger. But I don't -- I'll try and get some of the information to give you some idea of that breakup, while I'm talking and come back to that.","Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","That sounds great. In that context, I was just wondering if the margins in Mexico and Canada are much closer to the U.S. And that it's the all other dragging it down or was Europe getting toward -- just to understand how the time in each market leads to margin expansion over time.","Rodney C. Sacks","We think the margins in Canada are certainly more closely aligned to the U.S. and Mexico's a little lower. But also still reasonably aligned to the U.S. Europe has sort of pretty decent margins. Asia-Pacific is where we are suffering from low margins at this point in time, and we believe that will be -- start being corrected as we go forward operationally. And in South America sort of in between, but again, we hope that we'll be able to improve margins in South America as in when we start producing with Ambev in Brazil and also in other regions in South America. In the dollars, while -- if you look at the U.K., as an individual country the U.K. is our biggest country after the U.S. It's larger than Canada or Mexico. And Spain, basically in the quarter, Spain, Japan, South Africa, Australia and Germany are the next largest, and they are reasonably close to each other after that.","Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Oh, interesting.","Rodney C. Sacks","Just to give you a sort of order of how it goes.","Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Sorry?","Rodney C. Sacks","To give you an order of how they're sort of coming in dollar terms sales.","Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","May I also just clarify, you said sales were up 9.5% lapping 32%. What were you referring to in that number in January?","Rodney C. Sacks","I was referring to the increase last year, January over the January the year before.","Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Is this U.S. Nielsen data?","Hilton H. Schlosberg","It's our sales.","Rodney C. Sacks","No. It's our sales.","Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And does it include international?","Hilton H. Schlosberg","Yes.","Rodney C. Sacks","Yes. This is growth.","Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Growth, yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Chappell of SunTrust.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Looking at the U.S. market over the, I guess, the past few months, it's not that you've been losing a ton of share, but it seems like Red Bull has been gaining more than most. And just trying to see if you look at that, is that coming the Red Bull, from space jump and better marketing or do you think they haven't been quite as tainted by some of the negative press as you have? And was that something you think that will continue or is it just more of a short term?","Rodney C. Sacks","I think what happened was, you saw initially I think the negative press seemed to have been directed sort of focused more on our brand as opposed to the category. And then more recent times, it's becoming a whole category issue. So we think that was probably one factor. We also think if you look at the individual sales, what has happened in Red Bull is they've really -- what has happened, the one package that has grown for them has been their 12-ounce package, which has become their leading package, and that's where they've seen quite a big bump and basically based on not so much -- not on units, but on value because they really were trading up from a 8-ounce size at $2 to a 12-ounce size at $2.49 or whatever it is, or $2.90 or whatever the price is. The average price of their -- I'll give you the 2, the pricing from $2.17 up to the average price of $2.89. So that's largely where they have picked up and continued to pick up market share in dollar terms. That's accounted for that. They've also we think -- what we've seen is substantially a substantial pick up in marketing, not only in the U.S., but around the world. And that clearly also has probably had some effect on their sales.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And is that something you need to react to or you feel very comfortable with...","Rodney C. Sacks","A lot of that is -- a lot of it is when you time your marketing programs. We're looking at the markets, they've executed very well in the markets. That's an issue which I think we need to get our distribution partners to perhaps step up their distribution capabilities and the presence on shelf. They are executing very well in store, which is important. And then I think if you do look at the last 4 weeks, we've sort of tended to catch up and we've now -- we're actually slightly ahead of them in convenience. I think it's going to be growth in convenience and gas. So it will take -- it will start catching up and then I think as we sort of start to get into our promotional cycle, we think things will improve. They did introduce some line extensions also during the period through one of their -- they had exclusive I think on some line extensions with 7-Eleven, but what our experience has been overseas that those line extensions ultimately haven't been particularly incremental. But we don't know how they will ultimately pan out in the U.S. Again, we think that, that won't be a driver going forward for them, but they overall have improved their share.","Operator","Our last question will come from Mark Astrachan of Stifel.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","A couple of housekeeping questions. What were Rehab sales in the quarter? Japan, Korea cost in the quarter? How does that compare to the magnitude of the cost that you incurred there in the second and third quarter?","Rodney C. Sacks","Rehab was a little bit difficult. We've seen some softness in some of the Rehab SKUs. We haven't been able to really get fully under the numbers because last year, we did have the line extensions, which went into -- were listed in the fourth quarter. So there was clearly some sell-in and then -- it's really just been difficult to really compare them. There has been a mixed bag of up and down and that effect. We also think there is possibly some seasonality that is starting to show up more in the Rehab line more than perhaps our other lines because of the fact that it is a tea and it's a non-carbonated tea product. So we think that there also has been some seasonality impact. Can you repeat your second question to us?","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes, the second question one is the cost incurred for the rollout in Japan and Korea in the fourth quarter, were they of similar magnitude to what you incurred in the second and third quarter? And then just a follow-up to the Rehab, do you have a net sales number overall? Were Rehab sales up in the fourth quarter on your the reported numbers, not the scanner data?","Rodney C. Sacks","Retail sales on gross dollars are not up in the fourth quarter of '12 versus '11. They are down somewhat. But again, we've not really been able to tell with any real certainty how we've taken out the effect -- to back out the effect of the sell-in. We believe that if you'd back out the effect for sell-in, there's not much difference. But again, that's something we just haven't been able to get fully into. On the costs, I'm not sure I'm able to give you an answer on the phone on the costs in Asia, fourth quarter versus the third at this point. I think it's just -- I just don't have them handy.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","All right, fine. Just lastly then on share repurchase, so is this something that we need to wait for the board to convene to re-up another authorization or is there something you want to talk about regarding that?","Rodney C. Sacks","This is -- we really have no -- we cannot give you any update. This is something that we're going to -- we'll put on the agenda. We have a board meeting on Friday. We'll put it on -- have it on the agenda. But we're not sure what we want to at this point in time. And just really hard for me to speculate now as to whether we'll introduce an additional program, certainly immediately we've just spent a lot of money expanding, so we may relook at it. But we will evaluate at the board meeting on Friday.","Operator","And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back to management for any further remarks.","Rodney C. Sacks","On behalf of Monster I would like to thank each of you for your continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in our growth strategy, and we remain committed to developing and differentiating our brands and to expanding the company at home and abroad. We reiterate that our products are safe, are properly labeled, and that the caffeine content in a Monster Energy drink at approximately 10 milligrams per ounce is less than half the milligrams per ounce of caffeine contained in Starbucks and other coffeehouse brewed coffee. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's presentation. You may all disconnect.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct the question-and-answer session with instructions following at that time.","As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","Now, I'll turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO. Please begin.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, is with me today, as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends. Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call.","Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed February 29, 2016, as well as our most recent report on Form 10-Q filed April 29, 2016, including the sections contained therein entitled risk factors and forward-looking statements, for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes and designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated August 4, 2016. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section.","As you are, no doubt aware, sales in the beverage industry in the second quarter continued to be weak on a global basis. We believe that it would be helpful to shareholders on this call to address our results on an adjusted basis after giving the effect to a number of selected items in addition to and not in lieu of our GAAP results.","First, the results for the second quarter of 2016 were positively impacted by the accelerated recognition of deferred revenue of $5 million and negatively impacted by the modified Dutch tender stock repurchase expenses of $1.5 million, AFF transaction expenses of $3.6 million, as well as distributed termination costs of $25.3 million, resulting in a net negative impact on operating income in this quarter of $25.4 million.","Second, net sales in the 2016 second quarter were adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $4.1 million.","Third, while the results for the comparable second quarter of 2015 were negatively impacted by distributed termination costs of $12.2 million and the Coca-Cola transaction expenses of $11.5 million, the results for that quarter were positively affected by the sale of Monster's non-energy business for $161.5 million during the quarter, which resulted in a net positive impact on operating income for such period of $137.7 million.","Fourth, we accounted for the AFF transaction in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 805 for business combinations. The effect on contribution margin from the AFF raw material cost savings was minimal in the three months ended June 30, 2016, as inventory on hand prior to the AFF transaction, as well as the inventory acquired in the AFF transaction, were recorded at fair value and were not recognized through cost of goods sold until the end of the 2016 second quarter.","As of June 30, 2016, the company's inventory on hand is recorded at the cost to AFF. As a result, the full extent of the raw material cost savings following the AFF transaction will be recognized in subsequent quarters. Had these savings been recognized in full in the current quarter, the raw material cost savings would've been approximately $24 million. In respect of AFF's sales to third-party customers, after recognizing the fair value adjustment to inventory, $0.6 million was recorded as contribution margin in the quarter.","Fifth, our modified Dutch auction tender share repurchase was completed on June 15, 2016 and we did not benefit from the lower number of shares in the quarter. Consequently, we believe that these adjustments need to be taken into account in reviewing our results for the quarter.","Let me turn to the results for the six months ended June 2016. The results for the six months ended June 2016 were positively impacted by the accelerated recognition of deferred revenue of $5 million and negatively impacted by stock repurchase expenses of $1.6 million, AFF transaction expenses of $4.5 million, as well as distributed termination costs of $28.7 million, resulting in a net negative impact on operating income in such period of $29.8 million.","B, net sales in the first six months of 2016 were adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $16.4 million.","C, the results of the comparable six months of 2015 were negatively impacted by distributed termination costs of $218.2 million and the Coca-Cola Company transaction expenses of $15.1 million, but the results were positively affected by accelerated recognition of deferred revenue of $39.8 million and the sale of Monster's non-energy business for $161.5 million, which resulted in a net negative impact on operating income for such period of $32.1 million.","Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary","There was a gain on the sale of the Monster non-energy business.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. Yes. Our discussion earlier regarding the AFF raw material cost savings during the quarter is applicable in the same manner and to the same extent to the first half of 2016. Consequently, the full extent of the raw material cost savings following the AFF transaction will be recognized in subsequent quarters.","We are continuing to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers worldwide. We have successfully concluded negotiations with many Coca-Cola bottlers in additional countries and are planning to launch Monster with those bottlers in most of their international markets in the near future. In the second quarter, we commenced distribution of Monster with the Coca-Cola bottlers in Peru. We also commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Mexico and Guatemala earlier in the third quarter and are planning to commence distribution in Colombia and Chile later in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we are also planning to commence distribution of Monster with the Coca-Cola bottlers in Brazil, Central America and Caribbean. We commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Albania, Iceland, Serbia and Macedonia in the second quarter and anticipate commencing distribution of Monster in Ukraine and Montenegro in the third quarter. We successfully transitioned Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers in South Africa in July and commenced distribution of Monster with additional Coca-Cola bottlers in Africa in the second quarter.","Over the third quarter, we are planning to launch Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in eight additional African countries, with a number of additional countries in Africa, mainly in North Africa, to follow in the fourth quarter. We are making good progress in Nigeria with regard to both product registration and co-packing arrangements, which involves the installation of new equipment specifically designed for the production of Monster. We are targeting the fourth quarter for the launch of Monster in Nigeria.","We've also completed the registration of our products in Turkey and many other Middle Eastern countries and are proceeding with the launch of Monster through Coca-Cola bottlers in Turkey and a number of Middle Eastern countries in the third and fourth quarters, as well as a number of other countries in the fourth quarter of 2016. In the second quarter, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Australia, New Zealand and Singapore. We are proceeding with the launch of Monster through Coca-Cola bottlers in a number of Central Asian countries in the fourth quarter of 2016. Our plans to launch Monster within the Coca-Cola system in China are continuing to progress well and we are currently engaged in the completion of our marketing and promotional plans in connection with the launch.","Although we have reached an advanced stage of negotiations, we have still not reached final agreement with certain of the Coca-Cola bottlers in China. Subject to agreement on the outstanding terms, we are on schedule to launch Monster in China, commencing with certain key areas on a progressive basis at the end of the third quarter and\/or early in the fourth quarter. We are currently awaiting approval for our product in India. We are making good progress in the repositioning, repackaging and reformulation of many of the Coca-Cola energy brands that we acquired as a result of the Coca-Cola transaction.","As previously reported, we successfully completed our acquisition of the concentrated flavor business operated by AFF on April 1, 2016. While the acquisition and ongoing business activities of AFF have been in accordance with expectations, we did not account for the full benefits of the transaction during the quarter as previously discussed. Had we been able to account for the full benefits of the acquisition in determining our cost of goods for the quarter, our cost of goods would have been reduced by approximately $24 million in the second quarter, resulting in a commensurate increase in our gross profit, less a minimal reduction that was recorded in the quarter. We believe that from the third quarter onwards, we will be able to utilize the full benefits of the lower cost of goods for AFF flavors.","The company commenced a tender offer in May to purchase up to $2 billion in value of its common stock through a modified Dutch auction tender offer. The tender offer resulted in the company's purchase of approximately 12.8 million shares at a price of $156 per share. The company accepted tendered shares on June 15, 2016 and as a result, was unable to obtain the full benefit of the reduction in its weighted average basic and diluted share capital for the full quarter. Had the repurchase been in effect for the full quarter, the repurchase would've increased net income per share on our basic and diluted share capital by approximately $0.05 per share for the quarter. On August 2, 2016 the company's board of directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $250 million of the company's outstanding common stock.","There are limited sales of finished products in the strategic brands acquired from Coca-Cola. As a result, we have decided to rename our segments to address the products sold in those segments. Our ensuing discussion compares our 2016 second quarter results with our 2015 second quarter results after adjustments for certain items in both quarters previously described, namely acceleration of deferred revenue, distributed termination costs, expenses related to, one, the TCCC (12:40) transaction, two, the AFF transaction and three, the share repurchase, as well as the gain on the sale of Monster's non-energy business. These adjustments are set out in the table in our earnings release and may be helpful to participants to refer to.","I would like to point out that such adjustments exclude any effects relating to, A, the manner of accounting pursuant to the AFF transaction in the quarter as opposed to future quarters, and B, the increased number of shares in the quarter due to the timing of the modified Dutch auction tender offer.","In the second quarter, the company achieved record gross sales of $940.9 million, up 19.1% from $789.9 million in the second quarter of 2015. Net sales were $822.5 million, up 18.6% from $693.7 million in the second quarter of 2015. Net sales in the second quarter were adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $4.1 million. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 62.4% as compared to 56.9% for the comparable 2015 second quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the Strategic Brands segment, which generally has higher gross margins than the Monster Energy Drinks segment; two, no sales in the three months ended June 30, 2016 of the brands disposed of as a result of the TCCC (14:14) transaction on June 12, 2015, previously comprised of the majority of the former warehouse segment in the Peace Tea brand, which generally had lower gross margins than the Monster Energy Drinks segment; three, lower costs of certain raw materials; and four, the price increase for our 16-ounce Monster product which was implemented at the end of August 2015.","Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.2%, as compared to 4.1% in the same quarter last year. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.3% compared to 10.4% in the same quarter a year ago. Commission to Coca-Cola and increased sponsorship and endorsement costs largely related to the strategic brands were the two principal reasons for the increase in selling expenses. Premiums were also higher in the quarter. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 9.7% as compared to 9.5% in the same quarter last year. Payroll expenses were up $5.1 million, primarily to support the strategic brands that we acquired from Coca-Cola, and stock-based compensation on a non-cash item was $3 million higher, but was partially offset by a reduction in payroll taxes of $3.4 million.","Distributor termination costs were $25.3 million in the second quarter, as compared to $12.2 million in the 2015 second quarter. Regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's product were $3.8 million in the 2016 second quarter, as compared to $3.5 million in the 2015 second quarter. Our effective tax rate in the quarter decreased from an adjusted 37% in the 2015 second quarter to 35.3% in the 2016 second quarter, primarily due to the domestic production deduction. On an ongoing basis, we expect that our normalized tax rate will be approximately 36%.","Net income was $203 million in the 2016 second quarter compared to net income of $143.2 million in the 2015 second quarter, after taking into account the adjustments previously discussed, an increase of 41.7%. Net sales to customers outside the United States were $200.2 million in the 2016 second quarter compared to $151.3 million in the corresponding quarter in 2015. Net sales to customers outside the United States were higher in local currencies by approximately $4.1 million. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas.","According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through July 23, 2016, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 4.3% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 7.2% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS decreased 0.4%, sales of Full Throttle decreased 8.8%, sales of Red Bull increased 2.3%, sales of Rockstar increased 10.5%, sales of 5-Hour decreased 3.4% and sales of AMP decreased 25.8%.","According to Nielsen for the four weeks ended July 23, 2016, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars increased 2.5% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 5.9% over the same period last year, while NOS was down 5.2% and Full Throttle sales decreased 7%. Sales of Red Bull increased by 0.3%, Rockstar was up 7%, 5-Hour was down 2.7% and AMP was down 34.1%.","According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended July 23, 2016 Monster market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars increased by 1.1 points over the same period last year to 35.3%. NOS' share decreased 0.3 points to 3.5% and Full Throttle's share decreased 0.1 point to 0.9%. Red Bull share decreased 0.8 points to 35.5%. Rockstar share was up 0.3 of a point to 7.9%. 5-Hour share was lower by 0.4 of a point to at 8.2% and AMP share decreased 0.8 of a point to 1.4%.","According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended July 23, 2016 sales of Energy Plus Coffee drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 20% over the same period last year. Sales of Java Monster were 14.2% higher than in the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Double Shot Energy were 28.9% higher. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended June 25, 2016, the energy drink category decreased 4%. Monster sales decreased 2% versus a year ago. Our market share increased 4 share points to 28.2%, Red Bull sales decreased 3% and its market share increased 0.4 points to 38.6%, Rockstar sales decreased 8% and its market share decreased 0.6 points to 18.6%.","According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 36.4% during the month of June, Monster sales increased 4.2%, our market share decreased 7.6 points to 24.5% against the comparable period last year, sales of Burn, one of our acquired strategic brands increased 1.8%, although Burn's market share decreased 1.7 points to 4.9%. Red Bull sales decreased 14.9% and its market share decreased by 7.9 points to 13.1%. Vive 100's market share increased 20.2 points to 41.8%, while Boost's market share decreased 4 points to 10%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single month, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and\/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.","According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended June 2016, the actual 13-week periods vary by a few weeks between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 12.3% to 13.8% in Great Britain, from 18.7% to 22.7% in France, from 11.4% to 14.5% in Germany, from 21.6% to 24.8% in Spain, from 8.9% to 10.3% in Belgium, from 8.6% to 10.5% in Sweden, from 5.9% to 10.7% in Norway, from 9.7% to 11.7% in the Czech Republic and from 6% to 7.4% in the Netherlands. According to IRI, Monster's market share in Greece increased for the 13 weeks prior to the period ended June 2016 from 27.2% to 27.4%. For the 13-week period ended May 2016 according to Nielsen, Monster's retail market share in Ireland grew from 8.2% to 9.6%. Monster's retail market share in value decreased, however, from 16.7% to 13% in South Africa.","I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country to country. We also note that South Africa was one of the markets that transitioned to the Coca-Cola bottlers at the beginning of July.","According to Nielsen, Monster's retail market share in value in Chile increased to 22% in May 2016 compared to 15.6% last year and Monster's market share in Brazil declined from 3.9% to 2.5% in June 2016, as compared to the same period last year. In South Korea, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 10.8% to 22.3% in June, compared to the same period last year, and according to INTAGE, Monster's market share in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 32.7% to 39.2% in June of 2016.","Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the second quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $2.6 million of foreign currency movements. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the second quarter of 2016 increased 13.4% from $651.2 million to $738.5 million from the comparable period last year after the adjustments described above. Net sales for the company's Strategic Brands segment were negatively impacted by approximately $1.5 million of foreign currency movement in the quarter. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment were $77.4 million for the second quarter, as compared to $13 million in the same quarter last year.","Net sales in EMEA in the second quarter of 2016 in dollars were 33% higher than in the same period last year. In local currency, net sales in the region were 30% higher than the same period last year. Gross sales were 31% higher in dollars and 27% higher in local currencies. Gross profit in this region, as a percentage of net sales, increased from 46.4% in the same period last year to 50.8% during the 2016 second quarter.","EMEA sales continued to be negatively impacted during the quarter by supply disruptions encountered by CCE in Great Britain, Monster's largest market in EMEA, during the first quarter that partially carried over to the second quarter, following the implementation of new software. Monster's continuing to gain momentum and increased market share in Europe. In particular, in Germany, France, Spain, Great Britain, Belgium, Sweden, Norway, the Czech Republic and the Netherlands, Monster achieved sales gains and continued to increase its market share.","However, growth in South Africa was negatively impacted due to anticipated transition to Coca-Cola bottlers, which took effect from July 4, 2016. We are pleased with the launch of the Monster Ultra line in the EMEA region, which is now available in 19 European countries and was launched in South Africa in July. We anticipate that the Ultra line will be sold in almost all of our Western European markets by the end of this year.","In Asia-Pacific, net sales in the second quarter increased 69.8% in dollars and 64.6% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 30.9% in the same period last year to 46.1% during the 2016 second quarter. In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 20.1% or 10.3% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. We continue to experience strong performance in Japan. In South Korea, net sales increased 170% or 188.8% in local currency, as compared to the same quarter last year. In Oceana, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia and Guam, net sales increased 330% or 339.7% in local currencies, as compared to the same quarter last year. And in Singapore, net sales increased 81% or 83.7% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year.","As previously mentioned, we are moving ahead with the planning for local production in India with a view to reentering the market later in 2016. In Latin America, which includes Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the second quarter increased 0.6% in dollars and increased 9.6% in local currencies over the same period last year.","Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 46.2% in the same period last year to 50% during the 2016 second quarter. Net sales decreased in Brazil, largely due to the overall difficult economic and market conditions, together with the ongoing uncertainties for our distributor relating to the Coca-Cola transaction and the anticipated transition of Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers, which is now being set for November 1.","In Mexico, net sales decreased in part due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, customer inventory destocking and the uncertainty relating to the Coca-Cola transition. However, as reported by Nielsen, Monster's sales at retail in Mexico grew in the quarter. In Chile, net sales in the quarter increased 2.1% in dollars or 11.2% in local currency, as compared to the same quarter last year. As mentioned earlier, we are optimistic that we will be able to finalize agreements with Coca-Cola bottlers in numerous countries in the near future. We are also continuing to evaluate production opportunities with Coca-Cola bottlers, both in the U.S. and internationally, which we believe will yield cost reductions.","Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $434.8 million at June 30, 2016 compared to $2.18 billion at December 31, 2015. Short-term investments were $44.3 million compared to $744.6 million at December 31, 2015. Long-term investments decreased $0 million from $15.3 million at December 31, 2015.","Accounts receivable increased to $465.7 million at June 30, 2016 from $353 million at December 31, 2015. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 44.9 days at June 30, 2016 compared to 43.2 days at December 31, 2015 and 42.6 days at June 30, 2015.","Inventories increased to $174.4 million from $156.1 million at December 31, 2015. Average days of inventory was 50.7 days at June 30, 2016, which was lower than the 58 days of inventory at December 31, 2015 and the 54.4 days at June 30, 2015.","As announced at our annual shareholder meeting, we are continuing with our plans to launch Mutant, an exciting new beverage that will be positioned as refreshment energized late in September 2016. As previously announced, we also have additional new products planned for production later this year, and are working on additional new products that we are planning to introduce early in 2017.","We estimate July 2016 gross sales on a foreign-exchange adjusted basis to be approximately 2% higher than in July 2015. In this regard, we point out that, one, in the U.S. and several countries, we had two less selling days this year compared to last year, a reduction of 10% in selling days, which will be recognized in August.","Two, according to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended July 23, 2016 for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 3.8% versus the same period a year ago, while sales of Monster grew 7.5% in the same period versus a year ago.","Three, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, such as the upcoming Call of Duty promotion, distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers.","And four, for the reasons and factors just discussed, we reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.","In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. One, our acquisition of AFF is exciting and represents an important milestone for the company through the ownership of the proprietary formulas for our principal products. We believe that we'll be able to utilize the full benefits of the transaction through a reduction in operating costs commencing with the third quarter, and that this transaction will be accretive to the company's earnings.","Two, North American and international gross margins remain healthy and continue to improve. Three, the U.S. Nielsen market statistics and equivalent market statistics from many countries around the world show that the energy category is continuing to grow, and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category.","Four, the new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the company's sales. Five, we're excited about the prospects for our new Mutant beverage, which we are planning to launch late in the third quarter. Six, we are particularly pleased with our performance in our international markets.","And seven, finally, we have successfully transitioned additional international countries to Coca-Cola bottlers, and we have reached an advanced stage to transition many more markets to Coca-Cola bottlers in the second half of 2016.","I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Our first question is from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Hi, everyone.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi.","Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary","Hi, Judy.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So first question is just looking at the U.S. trend. I guess the gross sales number in July, I know you called out the less shipping day issue, but just broadly, it seems like maybe trends are a little bit softer in the measured channel data. So first, what do you think is driving that? Secondly, how much is the non-measured, the non-traditional channel, really adding to the growth, because it looks like the second quarter U.S. number for your DSD business actually came in pretty healthy.","And then my second question is just on Latin America. It sounds like you're making progress with the bottlers there in Mexico and Brazil, and just trying to get a sense of, is this more of a staged transition, where you're going into certain regions within that country with one bottle and then you roll out to other bottlers? Or how much of this could really have an impact in the more near-term? Thanks.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We got to get you to start asking single questions, because our memory is not good enough to have all six of them all answered.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","It's really two.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Two, but the two gets subdivided into categories. I'm not quite sure how many they are. But okay. Just going back to what, I think, everybody has noticed that there's been a slight decline in the monthly or 4-week or 13-week numbers coming out of Nielsen for the category. And you saw that in the numbers, as we indicated earlier now, and I think, Judy, you published numbers over the past couple of months as well, and it showed there has been a decline.","Monster has grown ahead \u2013 is growing ahead of the category, which I think is the important news, and we're continuing to take share, and that's in all the major channels. What has been quite interesting is that part of our growth has been coming from the other major channels, traditionally or historically, we sort of grew more in the convenience channel, and we're now starting to grow \u2013 we were underrepresented in grocery and drug and some of the other independent channels, and we are starting to pick up higher growth in those channels. So if you look at our Nielsen numbers for convenience and then you look at all measured, we're actually growing more in all measured than the convenience.","We still believe that the trends are healthy for Monster. If we look at the gross sales, the key product in the gross sales, Monster Green, is still continuing to be positive. We are getting good traction in the Ultra line in the U.S. and internationally, as I indicated earlier in the call in Europe. And then generally, we are getting growth again in lines that had sort of leveled off a little bit like Rehab and the juice lines, they're both in growth again. And obviously what's quite exciting is the Java line; in fact, in the last 4 weeks, the Java line generally is up at a higher growth rate than it has been reported and has been sort of in the last quarter.","So that's where we see the numbers. Obviously, the non-measured channels are also growing. Wal-Mart has been \u2013 is a big \u2013 an important customer for us, and those channels are growing. And that's why even in relation to July, I did want to mention that we looked at the all measured channels for the 4 weeks because that continues to grow at 7.5%.","Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary","Judy, there's two points I would like to make. Firstly, the benefit of the Coca-Cola transaction is, in fact, in the drug and retail channels, as well as in the non-measured channels, and we are making significant progress with the Coca-Cola organization in the non-measured channel.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. Then, Judy, just going to your second question.","Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary","Which one of the two questions \u2013 the two remaining questions do you want answered first, Judy?","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","(38:07)","Operator","Pardon me, Judy.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hello?","Operator","Yes. Your line is open.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Sorry. Can you hear me now? I think I was cut off from the queue. I think I'm still mute. Oh, am I on? Okay, because I can't hear. Anyway, I was trying to just get a better sense of your Latin America transition and whether you're transitioning to one bottler at different stages or is this just more of a broader rollout into Mexico and Brazil from a transition standpoint?","I can't hear anything. Can you hear?","Operator","Pardon me. I'm still on. I think we're having technical difficulties. Wait one second, ladies and gentlemen. Please stand by.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hello? Rodney? Hilton? Can you hear me? I don't understand. All right. We can't hear you, Rodney and Hilton. I think people could hear me.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, please stand by. Your conference will resume momentarily. Again, please stand by. Your conference will resume momentarily.","Again, ladies and gentlemen, please stand by, your conference will resume momentarily. Again, please stand by, your conference will resume momentarily. Speakers have rejoined and you still have Judy Hong is still on.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. Judy, can you hear us?","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I can hear you now. Thank you.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","(41:28)","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes, and I apologize for my two questions and then...","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sorry, we just get focused on one, and then we just lose track of the other one. What was the other question we were still \u2013 you wanted to ask me?","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","It was related to Latin America. You talked about transitioning in Mexico and Brazil and I just wanted to get some color on whether this is one bottler you're transitioned or is this the broader country in both...?","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, that's fine. What was happening was you have FEMSA that has a lot of areas in which they have operations. And even though they're in different countries, they don't necessarily fill up (42:04) the whole country. So ultimately, we spent a lot of time ultimately in negotiating and getting to a deal with FEMSA. Once we're done there, it didn't facilitated moving quite quickly with other bottlers in each of these different countries. So as we indicated in the call, we have transitioned the whole of Mexico to all of the bottlers that comprised the Coca-Cola group in Mexico, and that has already started as of last week. In the case of the planned transition in Brazil, it will be to all of the bottlers at the same time. The whole group of bottlers have signed agreements with us. We're waiting until that all has happened at one time, and we will transition the whole country on November 1.","In the case of Chile, there are two bottlers, we are going to the whole country. In the case of Brazil \u2013 sorry, Colombia, there may be some small areas, but really it pretty much is FEMSA. We've already transitioned Peru, and we will be transitioning the other countries. So it will be pretty much the whole area. We will also be starting Central America and going to countries at a time in the Caribbean. We will be making that quite extensively, and that's not the same, for example, in which I indicated in China, where we are looking at \u2013 at the three main bottlers, but we are looking at that as such a big country, we're looking at selected areas and selected operating units first to go into then to launch in the second area with the second bottler, then in the third area, which are large towns, for example, we are looking at focusing in Beijing, in Shanghai and in Guangzhou, those areas, and then launching and then going to rolling it out to the different BU, operating units as we go forward.","Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary","And let's not forget about OXXO and how important OXXO is in Latin America as well.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, and so we have come to \u2013 that was part of the arrangements that we know you spent time negotiating with those two \u2013 with FEMSA and all of the two principal bottlers. That is correct, and so that is a more extensive rollout over the next \u2013 coming months in Latin America.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Evan Morris of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Evan Morris - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good evening, everyone.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good evening.","Evan Morris - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just on the Mutant launch, you talked about being in advanced stages. If you could just talk a little bit about the sort of the planned size of the rollout, just the channels. Is it just going to be focused on C-stores initially or other channels as well? And then just \u2013 it would be helpful is just if you've launched other kind of new platforms, not necessarily flavor extensions, but new platforms like this, how additive has it been to your sales growth in let's say the first 12 months to 18 months?","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think that each country is unique. Where we've been in countries, and we've transitioned, you obviously are going into all channels. Where you run into smaller countries, particularly where you got a bottler with good connections with some of the measured channels of the modern trade, you are going to the independent stores and the modern trade and grocery at the same time.","Other markets, we just generally try and focus first on the down the street and the independent markets and then go into the market. So you can't \u2013 there's no single formula for all of these markets. There isn't even a single formula for which markets you're going into. These are being done on opportunistically on the basis that when we are able to conclude agreements with the Coke bottlers, when we're able to properly terminate on due notice to our existing bottlers if there are bottlers in those markets and \u2013 we will then go into markets.","I mean, you take Argentina, there we haven't gone into the market \u2013 in that market, we are at the moment engaged in planning production and looking at the changes being made to the line in order to accommodate our product. And then once that's done, we are working through the value chains with the local Coke bottlers in Argentina, then hopefully, we will come to an agreement with them and then plan a launch. So that takes a much longer time, and it's a longer planning process than in other countries. So every country is different and while we expect countries A, B and C to be the third quarter, and D, E and F to be the fourth quarter, you may end up with A, B and D in the third quarter and C, E and F in the fourth quarter. So it changes literally from month-to-month. So I can't give you a set plan of this on how it's coming in. And again, as to the contribution, it changes differently. Some markets the bottlers are \u2013 get more instant distribution and our sales are at a higher rate. Some markets, it takes time for the bottlers to get to understand our brand, the velocity. It has a different velocity to traditional beverages; it doesn't start off at a high velocity in what would be the normal or ordinary high-volume accounts. It needs to be bought in the smaller stores where it's served cold and sold cold, one can at a time. And so sometimes that takes a lot of getting used to by the bottlers and it takes time. So there is no magical ramp-up the day you start that you have a magical set of things. It just takes time and builds and continues to build. So we're at the stage where we really are transitioning a lot of markets now and there are different stages, and we have been for some months, and these are going to continue to build over the rest of this year and in 2017.","Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary","Yes. And what I would say is, while we don't give guidance, I think, you can look at some markets that have been transitioned. We spoke, for example, on the call about Germany, which was transitioned last year. We spoke about South Korea, and you can look at some of those markets. I'm not saying that's indicative of all markets going forward, but certainly there's been a lot of progress with some of the Coca-Cola bottlers internationally. And we do expect good \u2013 that's why the transaction was done, we expect good performance from those bottlers as we go forward.","Evan Morris - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. I agree. Thank you.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Your line is open.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Hey. Good afternoon, guys.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Mark.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So, two questions. One, quickly, just why was concentrate or the strategic brands, Coke brands, whatever you're calling it these days, why was that better? And is that sort of a good run rate to use on a go-forward basis?","And then second question, not to confuse you, but I think it's fairly straightforward. So on China, beyond negotiations with Coke bottlers, is there anything else that prevents you from commencing distribution? Like is there any formula or manufacturing approvals that are still needed?","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Let me deal with the China first. In the case of China, we already have product approvals, and we have manufacturing approvals, with two of the three bottlers. With the third bottler, we have product approval and we're pretty much, I think, we're almost through with the product, I don't think we've actually seen it, but I think it should be imminent, and then we'll go through the manufacturing approval process.","We don't see any problem with that. It's already been approved by two independent Chinese authorities or provinces and that should be fine. And even if there were some technical hiccups, we could supply product from the Shanghai area, for example, to one of the other areas, and produce it there. So those shouldn't be issues. We just \u2013 obviously, we are in the planning stages. We're just trying to get to the finish line on a couple of issues, on the value chains and the sharing and basically just some contractual terms. We think we should be, be there. It started off with a very big laundry list and we're down to a very few items now. So, we're quite comfortable that we will get there. On the strategic brands, on the run rate, you didn't have a full quarter last year, whereas you did have the full quarter this year. The full quarter...","Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary","(50:35) only completed on June 15, 2015, so you're comparing that to a full quarter in 2016.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Right. And so basically, I think, if you take the \u2013 what you will get in the 10-Q, you'll get the breakout in the sectors, and you will get \u2013 which will now be called the strategic brand sector, you will get the numbers in that sector, which will give you, we think, to be \u2013 which will be indicative of future quarters and the run rate.","But again, subject to seasonality, et cetera. But that will be more in line as we go forward. There is a little bit of finished product in sales in that sector, which it doesn't \u2013 it really doesn't affect it very much. It's a little bit of noise. If that starts growing a little more, it obviously may have a bit more of the effect, for example, and the reason we are saying that, and pulling it out, and that's why we're putting it into the different sector. For example, in the case of NOS in the U.S., we converted the 22-ounce plastic bottle, sort of that unique NOS bottle, but wasn't really practical to have produced and shipped and on shelves, and we converted that and changed it into our 24-ounce resealable can. So we re-launched the 24-ounce resealable can. It is a good product and it's doing nicely. But that product, the Coca-Cola bottlers who are manufacturing NOS off a concentrate model do not have the ability to manufacture the 24-ounce cap-can.","So we are having it manufactured and supplied on a finished product basis. So again, there are some anomalies like this, there is a little bit of finished products in Germany on strategic products, because we changed Relentless into a 355-ml slim can. And again, the Coke production plant that was producing Relentless in a 500-ml can before we made the change to the design to the packaging and the pack size, didn't have either the capacity or the ability, I'm not sure which, but \u2013 to do so, so we are producing it at one of our co-packers and selling finished product. So that might have an effect on your sale proceeds and slightly smaller margins, because of just the nature of selling concentrate at a higher margin. But we think at the moment that is not a meaningful number in that sector.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Thanks, guys. Good evening.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Evening. Hi, Kevin.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Hi. So a quick clarification on the July sales update. That was selling-day adjusted, correct \u2013 or was not selling day adjusted for two days, so...","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's wasn't. That's our actual estimate, and we are saying that, we actually had 10% less selling days. I mean, that's why we made that point, yes.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","So it's something closer to like high-single digits. Is that fair? On a selling day adjusted basis?","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We're not going to extrapolate, but we think that, obviously, that does happen, I mean, if you're selling, you're selling, and you just don't have those deliveries. So, it's a delivery up and that's why we again pointed to the fact that the retail sale numbers going out of the store is up substantially higher than, for example, our sales are showing. And that's why we really are cautious because this single month is a very, very difficult month to start trying to look at and look at trends and this happens to be one of those months where we looked \u2013 we can all see the number and say, okay, but you look at these other factors, and we just don't feel there's any significance to it. But that's how we read, and we run the business more on a trend basis than a single period of time.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Understood. Thanks for the clarification there. And Hilton, another point of clarity; on the gross margin, if I understood you correctly, you had an unfavorable impact of $24 million on cost of goods, so the top line was very strong in the quarter, I guess, relative to expectations. The margins came in a bit lower than consensus expectations, but is it fair to say that the gross margin would have been closer to about 66% on a pro forma basis, adjusting for that? And number one, is that fair? And number two, is that sort of a reasonable expectation going forward here?","Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary","Okay, firstly, we don't give guidance. So, I'm not going to comment on gross margins going forward. What I can tell you is that, in the quarter, because of the accounting and for the consolidation of AFF, we did not get the benefit of the lower cost of goods in this quarter because we had the inventory, and they had the inventory and everything was related to fair value adjustment. So we did not get the benefit of the, A, lower cost of sales in this quarter. We will get it in subsequent quarters. If you look at what that number should have been had we not had to account for \u2013 on these fair value adjustment methods, we would've added $24 million to our gross profit. And whatever that percentage is, that's what the percentage is.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Very good. All right, that's helpful. Just one more for me, if I could come back to Mutant and Hydro. Hilton, can you talk a little bit about the receptivity from retailers, particularly in the convenience channel, which is what you're targeting at this point? And a little bit on your level of confidence that you're going to get the type of merchandising and shelving that you want. And that is sort of at a different point in the cooler from the existing portfolio. Just sort of minimize cannibalization there.","And then also maybe if you could just give us a little bit of clarity on the Hydro launch and when you anticipate that hitting. Thank you very much for your time.","Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary","So sales teams have been not making calls on Mutant, and many of the retailers, many of the major retailers, and in general, the reception has been good. I'm not sure that of any negatives that have been portrayed so far. We have very specific merchandising objectives for this product. It's not going to compromise our space or the Coca-Cola space. So we've very specific merchandising objectives, and all I can say, and I don't want to say too much, but the launch is proceeding in accordance with plan, and the communication with the retailers is also proceeding in accordance with plan. We have not had any negatives to speak of.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Yeah. Okay. Thank you.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","All right, then of the Hydro side, we are dealing with the planning on that product, but we really focusing on getting Mutant down into the market and doing that and we have our sales team and obviously the Coke bottlers have theirs, so you want to focus on one thing at a time. We do propose to follow with Hydro launch. We think that may still be \u2013 we're anticipating in the fourth quarter.","Again, it may be subject to getting the cooperation and the ability of the bottlers to focus when they get to that holiday season that does become a bit tight. But subject to that, we should be able to get Hydro after, again, later in the fourth quarter. And then we do have one or two additional product \u2013 innovation product lines, one particular one planned for launch towards the end of the year, beginning of next year. But again, depending on simply timing, we may get the products done and shipped at the end of year, but probably will be fully launched in January or late January. So there is the sort of the innovation pipeline going forward. There are a number of individual items that we are still also looking at introducing in this period in the next couple of months \u2013 next six months.","Operator","Thank you. This ends the Q&A portion of today's conference. I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Rodney Sacks for any closing remarks.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. On behalf of the company, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy, and remain committed to continuing to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company, both at home and abroad, and in particular, to expand distribution of our product through the Coca-Cola bottler system internationally.","We are particularly excited about the new opportunities that we have going forward, with a robust portfolio of energy drink product throughout the world, comprised of our Monster Energy brand, together with the strategic brands, as well as for our new Mutant product line.

Sacks","Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President is with me today as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance. Before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends. Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed on February 29, 2012, and our most recent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, including the sections contained therein entitled, Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated August 8, 2012. A copy of this information is also available on our website, at www.monsterbevcorp.com, in the Financial Information section.","I\u2019m sure that you\u2019re aware that our company as a result of certain litigation, regulatory requests and media reports, has been the subject of discussion recently. I want to take this opportunity to briefly address this. First and foremost, we reiterate that our products are safe. More than 8 billion cans of Monster Energy drinks have been sold and safely consumed in the United States and around the world since 2002. Additionally, 10 of billions of energy drinks manufactured and distributed not only by us, but by other companies, have been sold and safely consumed worldwide for 25 years. ","We believe that consumers are justified based on that long track record in having confidence in the safety of our products. A principal area of attention relates to caffeine. Unfortunately, there has been some misinformation published recently regarding the caffeine content of Monster. So let me give you the facts. Monster energy drinks generally contain approximately 10mg of caffeine per ounce from all sources. By comparison, the leading brands of coffee house brewed coffee, for example Starbucks, contain on average in excess of 20mg of caffeine per ounce. In other words, a 16 ounce can of Monster Energy contains about half the caffeine of a 16 ounce cup of coffeehouse brewed coffee. Even a 24 ounce can of Monster Energy, which contains about 240mg of caffeine from all sources, has about 30% less caffeine than an average medium sized 16 ounce cup of coffeehouse brewed coffee.","So again our products are just as safe for consumers as a cup of coffee purchased at your favorite coffee house. Even an extra large size single serving of a Mountain Dew fountain drink which is readily available throughout America contains about 234mg of caffeine. In addition, the amount of caffeine per ounce in other major energy drinks on the market is comparable to or higher than the amount in Monster. There is absolutely no basis for singling out Monster in this regard.","Another area of recent media focus has been on the fact that Monster Energy drinks are labeled as dietary supplements rather than as foods. In the case of Monster Energy drinks, this is a red herring. Our products could be labeled and sold as foods if we chose to do so. As previously indicated, Monster Energy drinks, including their ingredients and labeling, comply fully with all laws and regulations in the United States and in each of the more than 70 countries in which they are sold. All of the ingredients contained in our products at current levels are either FDA approved food additives or are GRAS, which stands for Generally Recognized as Safe and are therefore permissible for inclusion in and labeling as foods,","As a result, with the Monster Energy drinks are classified as dietary supplements or as a food is a distinction without a difference. Either way, the current ingredients, none of which are secret or hidden, are fully permissible as a food and a supplement. In other words, we are confident that if we chose to do so, we could re-categorize Monster Energy drinks as a food. Apart from minor changes in form, the labels of Monster Energy as a food would be almost precisely the same and contain the same details as currently appear on our cans. In fact, all of our main competitor\u2019s energy drinks with the labeled as foods or supplements, contain similar, if not substantially higher levels of caffeine than do our products.","Furthermore, from the time Monster was launched more than 10 years ago, the labels on all Monster Energy drinks have expressly stated that the product should be consumed responsibly and are not recommended for children, people sensitive to caffeine or pregnant women. Finally, there\u2019s also been recent focus on so-called adverse event reports that are filed with the FDA. The FDA itself has stated quite clearly that adverse event reports about a product are not reports issued by the FDA and do not themselves establish any cause or link between a product and the reported event. More specifically, the fact is that the FDA has made it clear that it has not established any cause or link between Monster Energy drinks and any of the handful of events reported in adverse event reports.","These reports were received by the FDA over an eight year period between 2004 and 2012 so there are no new or sudden issues. The FDA has long been aware of these reports. It was aware of them, including the report relating to the 14 year old girl whose family brought the lawsuit against Monster when the agency stated publicly in August of this year that it monitors the products it regulates, specifically including energy drinks by examining current scientific data, monitoring new ingredients added to products and investigating reports of adverse effects.","The FDA stated its conclusion that the available evidence and I quote, does not indicate any new previously unknown risks associated with caffeine consumption. In short, there is not a shred of information which cause of links Monster to these adverse events and the Fournier lawsuit is the first the company has received alleging a fatality caused by Monster. Nor are we aware of a single instance anywhere in the world in which Monster Energy drinks have cause anyone\u2019s death. ","While of course we are saddened by the death of the 14 year old girl whose family brought the lawsuit against the company, the allegations in that lawsuit claiming to the contrary are false and totally baseless and are not supported by either the science or the facts. The autopsy report reveals that a caffeine blood level was not performed and that her death was natural and associated with a preexisting heart condition which by itself increased her risk of cardiac arrhythmia and sudden death. We will defend vigorously the lawsuit. ","I hope this clarifies some points that have been made that have been the subject of recent media reports and makes clear our complete confidence in our products. We will of course provide an appropriate response to any regulatory or similar inquiry that we receive. The company can document and support the legal basis by which its products are properly labeled as dietary supplements and also produces adequate third party scientific documentation to substantiate their safety.","However, given the current litigation and pending regulatory recourse, I hope you understand that we will refrain from answering questions or commenting further on these specific subjects. We are happy of course to answer questions you may have about our products in general or about third quarter results as best we can after we have concluded our discussion on the business which I will turn to now.","While the beverage industry in general continued to experience softness in the third quarter, sales volumes, the energy category in our principal market, the United States, continued to grow in the teens in the third quarter, although slightly lower than the growth rates of the energy category in the US in the second quarter. overall, the company had a good third quarter with record third quarter growth sales, up 15.4% to $632.3 million. Net sales up 14.2% to $541.9 million and operating income up 6.5% to $140.7 million.","Our tax rate was higher this quarter at 39% versus 37.2% in the same quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share increased 6.1% from $0.44 per share in the third quarter of 2011 to $0.47 per share. ","While we are pleased with the results we achieved this quarter, this can be described as the quarter of the proverbial thousand paper cuffs with less robust growth for the quarter being due in part to less robust growth for the energy category as a whole in the US together with less robust growth for Monster Energy in our US market, particularly in the latter half of the quarter. lower sales in Canada in the quarter largely due to a realignment by Coca Cola Canada of their inventory levels, the strength of the US dollar against certain currencies in our international markets, lower sales of Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology Energy drinks. This product line has been repositioned from 12 ounce cap cans to 12 ounce SLEEK flap top cans and effective September we lowered pricing for the extra strength line in line with our regular 16 ounce Monster Energy drinks, lower sales of Worx Energy Shots and also lower sales in our warehouse division. ","Nielsen recently commenced reporting sales information for the United States market based on an expanded sample of outlets, which now includes Wal-Mart, dollar stores such as Family Dollar, Dollar General and Fred\u2019s, DeCA Military Stores and club stores namely Sam\u2019s and BJs, but excluding Costco.","On this call and in the future, well at least for the remainder of this year, when we discuss the Nielsen reports for the United States for all outlets combined and the reported information contained in it, will be based on this expanded sample.

And contribution margin increased 11.1% from $153.1 million to $170.1 million.","Net sales for the company's warehouse segment decreased 7% to $25.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2012, compared with $27.6 million for the same period in 2011. And contribution margin decreased to $0.4 million in this quarter versus $2.5 million for the same quarter last year, largely as a result of lower sales \u2013 sorry misquoted. It\u2019s $0.04 million in this quarter the contribution margin which is $40,000 versus $2.5 million for the same quarter last year, largely as a result of lower sales and the impact of increased costs of Apple juice concentrate.","Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales of approximately 2% for the three months ended September 30, 2012, which was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain local currencies in which we conduct certain of our international business. This had a negative impact of approximately $12 million on net sales. Sales were also negatively affected by lower sales to Coca Cola refreshments Canada Ltd, our Canadian distributor largely due to the realignment of inventory levels, lower sales of Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology line which we repositioned from 12 ounce cap cans to 12 ounce Sleek flat top cans as I indicated earlier in which effective September 1 were part in line with our regular 16 ounce drinks.","Sales of Worx were also lower and net sales of the warehouse division were 7% lower in the quarter than the comparable period last year, primarily due to lower sales of sodas and apple juice which was partially offset by increased sales of Hubert's Lemonades. ","For the three months ended September 30, 2012, gross sales through retail, grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers represented 3% of gross sales, down from 4% in the comparable period in 2011. Gross sales through club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represented 10% of sales, down from 11% in the comparable period in 2011.","Gross sales to full-service distributors represented 62% of sales, the same as in the comparable period in 2011. Gross sales internationally increased to 23% from 21% in the same period in 2011. Other sales were 2% for the period, the same as in the comparable period in 2011.","Gross sales to customers outside of the United States in the third quarter of 2012 amounted to $144.7 million, compared to $116.8 million in the same quarter in 2011. Included in such sales are sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas.","Net sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in the third quarter of 2012, in dollars, were 42.6% higher than in the same period last year. Excluding the effect of the strengthening dollar, such net sales would have been 65.4% higher. Monster is continuing to gain momentum and market share in Europe. In particular in the UK, Spain, Germany and the Benelux, Monster achieved substantial sales gains as well as substantially increased its market share. In the United Kingdom,  according to Nielsen, Monster\u2019s market share now exceeds 10%. Our European and Africa operations overall, are now operating profitably, particularly South Africa where we have made good strides in increasing distribution levels and sales. The Central and Eastern European region is still incurring operating losses, although we are starting to see the benefits from certain strategic changes which we are implementing.","During the quarter we launched Monster Ultra Zero and Cuba Lima in 16 ounce cans and are in the process of launching two new DUB products called Baller\u2019s Blend and Mad Dog in 16 ounce cans. Baller\u2019s Blend was previously positioned as DUB edition in a 550ml size resealable can. ","We are continuing with our expansion strategy into new international markets. We launched Monster Energy in the Philippines and Turkey in the third quarter of 2012 and in conjunction with a new distributor, participated in an expanded launch in the Ukraine. We are continuing with our plans to launch Monster in Chile, Peru and Singapore in the next few months and in Argentina and Taiwan in 2013. We\u2019re also planning to launch Monster in additional countries in Central and Eastern Europe in 2013. We believe that we\u2019ve largely overcome product approval and label issues in Korea and anticipate commencing sales there within the few months.","Additional positive news is that sales in Japan in the third quarter continued to exceed our expectations. However, we incurred damages of product losses in relation to the production and shipping of products for Korea and Japan which negatively affected our gross margins during the quarter. We are hopeful that the damages in product losses experienced will be materially reduced in the future and are working towards local production.","Sales of Peace Tea, ready-to-drink iced teas continue to exceed our expectations. In the third quarter of 2012, gross sales of Peace Tea increased 44.1% over the same period in 2011. We are continuing with our plan to introduce additional packages and container sizes for the Peace Tea brand during the first quarter of 2013. We are continuing to sell in market Worx Energy shots, although we have experienced a substantial drop-off in sales. We have agreed to more favorable terms with our principle distribution partner in central and eastern Europe, Coca Cola Hellenic and are in the process of executing final sign distribution agreements with them to give effected too.","Although we still have a long way to go, we achieved improved results in Australia in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter of 2012 through a significant reduction in losses. We are in the midst of reevaluating our strategy in Brazil as we have not been satisfied with Monster\u2019s results achieved there this year and have reached an advanced stage of negotiations with an alternative distributor.","Gross profit margins achieved in the third quarter of 2012 were 50.5% versus 52.7% in the comparable quarter in 2011. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to geographic mix, production variances and product damages primarily in Europe and Asia, including production cost increases forced onto us by our partner in the United Kingdom, an increased promotional and other allowances as a percentage of net sales. Gross profit margins achieved in North America overall were marginally lower than in the comparable quarter last year. Although in the United States, they were slightly higher. ","Distribution expenses, as a percentage of net sales in the second quarter, were comparable with the same period in 2011. Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 11.6% from 12.6% in the same period in 2011. The decrease in selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, was primarily attributable to decreases in advertising, primarily Worx and lower royalties in sales commissions paid to third parties other than customers. The decrease was partially offset by increases in sponsorships, trade development programs and other marketing costs in the third quarter of 2012 as compared to the same quarter in 2011. ","As previously reported, we are continuing to invest in the Monster brand internationally, in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, Asia and South America, particularly through trade development programs to supplement our distribution partners' respective sales forces and to service and merchandise the small independent store channel. The cost of product sampling teams and trade development personnel are included as part of our selling expenses and do not form part of our payroll costs. These costs were substantially higher in Europe in the quarter as compared to the US and last year. As distribution improves and the European markets mature, we envisage a reduction in these costs, particularly as a percentage of sales. However, as we continue to enter new markets in Asia and South America, we intend to fund similar trade development programs to establish the Monster brand in those countries.","General and administrative expenses increased 23.6% in the quarter. The increase in general and administrative costs was primarily attributable to increased payroll expenses and in particular, increased stock-based compensation expense, which was $7.9 million for the quarter compared to $4.9 million last year, and $21.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 compared to $12.9 million for the nine months period last year. For the quarter ended September 30, 2012, operating income was negatively affected by combined operating losses of $2.5 million from our operations in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, South America and Asia. This figure was however lower than the $4.5 million losses incurred for the same period last year. ","Our effective tax rate in the 2012 third quarter was 59% compared to 37.2% in the 2011 third quarter. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of lower than expected tax benefits from the 2011 domestic production deduction as well as an increase in non-deductible equity compensation. ","During the 2012 third quarter the company purchased 6.9 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $57.99 per share for a total amount of $397.5 million, which excludes brokers\u2019 commissions. Subsequent to September 30, 2012 the company purchased an additional 1.9 million shares of its stock at an average purchase price of $54.99 per share which exhausted the availability under the repurchase plan. ","Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalence amounted to $283.1 million compared to $359.3 million at December 31, 2011. Short term investments were $307.7 million compared to $411.3 million at December 31, 2011. Long term investments comprised entirely of auction rate securities decreased from $23.2 million at December 31 to $19.9 million. ","Days outstanding for credit accounts receivables were 41.3 days at September 30, 2012 and 42.4 days at December 31, 2011 compared to 38.7 days at September 30, 2011. ","Our sales outside of the United States continued to increase as a proportion of our overall sales we expect that days outstanding for receivables will increase due to the different terms generally granted to customers internationally in accordance with local practices in their respective countries.","Inventories increased to $193.9 million from $155.6 million at December 31, 2011. Average days of inventory were 65 days at September 30, 2012 which was lower than the 71.6 days of inventory at December 31, 2011. ","At September 30, 2012 the company held auction rate securities with a face value of $28 million, $44.8 million at December 31, 2011with an amortized cost basis of $20.8 million. ","Growth sales in October 2012 were approximately 28% higher than in October 2011. We are encouraged by the strong sales that have been experienced by the company in North America, Western Europe and Japan. We caution again that sales in a single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors and according to each are not imputed to be or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period. ","In conclusion, I\u2019d like to summarize the numerous positive points that occurred during the quarter. The United States gross margins are healthy and are up. 2012 third quarter gross margins for North America were only nominally lower than in the comparable 2011 third quarter. We are satisfied with the performance of our international expansion and investment. Our European business is profitable and the losses we sustained internationally were reduced in the quarter compared to the third quarter of last year. ","The U.S. deals and market statistic shows Monster Energy is outpacing the category. Our market share in the important convenience and gas channel in both units and dollars now exceeds that of Red Bull. According to Nielsen, our market share in the United Kingdom has exceeded 10% for the first time. We have reached agreements with Coca Cola Hellenic for a more favorable terms for distribution of our Monster line in certain countries in Central and Eastern Europe. Monster sales in Japan are very encouraging and are exceeding our expectations. We are planning to launch Monster Energy in Korea within the next few months and as we have largely overcome the product approval and label issues that we experienced with our Korean products earlier this year. ","Gross sales in 2012, in October 2012 were approximately 28% higher than in October 2011, and we have demonstrated that our products off site are properly labeled and that the caffeine content in the Monster Energy drink at approximately 10 milligrams per ounce is less than half the milligram per ounce of caffeine contained in the Starbuck brewed coffee.","I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you. ","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, (operator instructions). Our first question comes from Judy Hong, with Goldman Sachs.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc","So just in terms of your sales trends. So Rodney, you\u2019ve cited some of the headwinds that you faced in the third quarter, the realignment by CCR in Canada and the Nitro sales being impacted. Could you quantify how much those were a drag in terms of your top line growth in the third quarter?","Rodney C. Sacks","We \u2013 at this point I think we haven\u2019t broken those out. Just trying to find something for you. I think the extra strength generally both in the North America were down about $4 million and works about $1.7 million. Just over \u2013 so perhaps $6 million for those two and the impact on sales in Canada \u2013 trying to find that figure for you Judy. I think was somewhere in the region of about $12 million. ","Hilton H. Schlosberg","We also spoke about the impact of the currency, which was also about $12 million in the quarter. ","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc","Right. I guess the better question is if I sort of look at the Nielsen trends and then just kind of back in and just look at the third quarter. It looks like U.S. was up by 13%, international up kind of 24% and the U.S. trends if I adjust for some of these factors do you think the 18%, 19% trends that you are seeing in Nielsen is pretty much representative of kind of what\u2019s going on in the underlying level in terms of the U.S. sales trends. ","Rodney C. Sacks","I can\u2019t speak \u2013 the Nielsen numbers attract sales going up from retail outlets to consumers. So this is a time actually I just don\u2019t have, we don\u2019t have an analysis on what that time line gives and how it affects us in different channels. What we are saying is that basically gross sales in the U.S. were up at about \u2013 North America was up at about 14% and we\u2019ve sort of \u2013 we can only give you obviously our sales numbers. They are choppy from month-to-month depending on ordering patterns and they vary for a number of factors. And so \u2013 but obviously you are just got to try and marry those as best you can, the same way as we do with the Nielsen numbers. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Chappell with Sun Trust.","William Chappell \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Hi, good afternoon. Can you talk a little bit more about the gross margin you hit in the quarter and just anything you\u2019ve done in terms of finding the distributor or finding I guess local manufacturing for Japan and maybe Korea to help that out?","Rodney C. Sacks","We are working towards the -- challenge in Japan and Korea is finding the right size Cans for those markets and plants that are able to produce our type of products and we are working towards that at the moment. We\u2019ve launched in Japan in a Sleek can a 55 malt sleek Can and there isn\u2019t \u2013 we haven\u2019t been able to find a Sleek can available in Japan. So we\u2019ve been working with Can companies to have them manufacture more to actually be able to supply us with a Sleek Can because the alternatives will go to \u2013 which will go to something like a 400 but it was a very stubby Can and we just didn\u2019t feel that was right for the brand. ","Getting the right product to be used in the right Cans in those two countries has been a challenge but we are actively working on doing so because we obviously we appreciate that it will remove the shipping damages and risks inherent in shipping as well as the shipping cost. And with the market -- but obviously what happens is when you start a market to make the investments and we\u2019ll require some capital investments from us to do so as well with the Can companies and to some of the packing companies in Japan. But until we saw the sales velocities and the viability of packing locally, it just didn\u2019t make sense to have those costs incurred upfront and then try and launch and then work, found out later whether your product was or wasn\u2019t viable and it\u2019s velocity. Based on the velocity we see -- it\u2019s been very positive but the problem is there\u2019s been higher costs or higher damages with that higher velocity. But it has accelerated our plan to go to local production and we are working on it. ","We also just had some price increases in the U.K. from our packer and we had some price variances and some damages there again. We had some losses. There were a number of changes that took place in some countries for regulatory reasons and we ended up with some inventory excesses which we are obviously trying to work through to sell elsewhere. But we think we will be able to work through that as it will normalize more going forward as we continue to establish the brand and the company internationally. ","William Chappell \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","And just a follow up on the October sales\u2026","Rodney C. Sacks","I just want to point out again. In talking about Japan and Korea, the modulates were quite substantially affected by these losses, the cost of shipping. With the result was that the business achieved, they had very low margins. Going forward we believe we will be able to obviously improve on those margins both by getting better at exporting and shipping Cans and also through local production and obviously increase sales. So those gross margins were very low in those areas because of that. Gross margins were also lower in Europe largely because of the production, and co-parking increased production losses as well. ","William Chappell \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thanks for the color and just on the October sales I know one month doesn\u2019t make a quarter but that\u2019s all for I think 31% growth in October of last year. Is that sign that some of the issues are behind you or just a timing of shipment. How should we look at that October number?","Rodney C. Sacks","I think it\u2019s a timing issue, they ship when they orders, we ship when products are ordered, whenever we can and it just falls where it falls. So going forward we\u2019ve obviously \u2013 we are encouraged by that factor. We did see a little bit of a fall off towards the end of the quarter. Again, it was what is was and we\u2019ve seen it pick up both \u2013 we deal with it as it comes. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan, with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co","Hi, guys. I guess one follow up to the last question. So monthly volatility has certainly increased from a sales standpoint. If you go to April and May it was up in the lower 30 if you had in June deceleration, July was up 25% August, September then worse in October back up. I realize when you get the orders and when you ship the products that you can\u2019t fully control but is there something that you\u2019ve thought about or is there some way that we can sort of rationalize how the selling and sell through sort of work here. So there\u2019s a bit of an explanation for the increased volatility because obviously the underlying sales per the scanner date are good but they ship way too much volatility here month-to-month. I guess any color there. And then the second question -- so you exhausted the share repurchase authorization. How you are thinking about the roughly $600 million in cash on the balance sheet right now?","Rodney C. Sacks","First, going to the first question Mark. The best measure of the sales which gives you a smoother feel for \u2013 you need to follow the Nielsen\u2019s, because the Nielsen\u2019s are obviously a broad sample of different channels and if you look at the Nielsen\u2019s going through from the July Nielsen\u2019s, it\u2019s pretty steady. Monster four weeks for the end of July was 20.2% up, in the convenience channels was 18.1%, in August 19.5%, in September and 19% for 20th October. That gives you a pretty smooth channel and that\u2019s all sales are basically going year-on-year, that\u2019s the increase in the channel. Ordering patterns from our customers are what they are. It depends on timing of promotions, timing of orders and so I can\u2019t show any more color on that other than to say that you look at the sales going through and you got to look at \u2013 I know that everybody works off and looks at quarters but at the end of the day you also have to look an annual base in which I think gives everybody a fairer and a more balanced view of the direction of the company, the brand, the sales etcetera. Our quarters are just all choppy, that\u2019s the only patterns have come in and that\u2019s how we take it as it comes. ","Hilton H. Schlosberg","We sell to distributors. You know what I mean.","Rodney C. Sacks","On the stock repurchase issue. As we\u2019ve stated in the past stock repurchases are determine by our board of directors. The board continues to review many factors affecting the company\u2019s stock plan as well as the strength of the overall market and will at the appropriate time review whether to authorize a further stock repurchase plan. In light of the fact that we have now used up the existing plan. ","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co","Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala, with UBS.","Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank","Also on the margin question and to make sure I understand it. How much was the actual product damages versus just the additional cost related to shipping product out to Korea and Japan. Were there pallets that needed to get resent and more one-time damages that were\u2026","Rodney C. Sacks","There were a number of issues that we faced. Products \u2013 sometimes the specs are very tight for Japan and they really are much tighter than the U.S. project were perfectly capable in the U.S. We were being inspected and we are being rejected for minor things, the blemishes and scratches and there\u2019s a whole host of things and dense \u2013 they have some pressure issues on cap rates and defective cap issues. So were a whole lot of issues there and again just continued to face us in shipping these large distances. And it\u2019s something that is just difficult to ship full Cans under pressure from the U.S. to Japan. We believe that we will be able to get this more under control as we continue to regain more experience in shipping and understanding Japanese requirements.","But it got to a point where literally every case had to be disassembled, examined Can-by-Can and then repacked and that\u2019s where the costs became very high, and as a result our margins were very little but we were there, we were pregnant, we were launching and we needed to continue and the result is we\u2019ve been able to establish our brand very strong, very solidly in the Japanese market but it certainly has been very costly for us, for all these different regions, but as we go forward we hope that we will avoid the damages, we hope we will avoid having to continue these very costly labor and meddling inspections to satisfy our Japanese customers and then retailers in Japan for our quality standards which are just very exerting because compared to the standards normally acceptable in the U.S. ","Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank","Okay. Got it. And then it sounded like from the very beginning of your opening remarks that the slowdown started about half way through the quarter and then obviously there\u2019s bounce back in October. Was there anything specific you was feel was behind that? And then also was it timing related with selling days or anything like that?","Rodney C. Sacks","We really didn\u2019t see anything specific. We obviously did look and try to understand and there really wasn\u2019t anything specific other than the matters we sort of mentioned and then you\u2019ve seen the pickup in October. We just haven\u2019t seen it and \u2013 basically for us it was obviously we initially looked at it and said \u2013 looked at directionally but basically once we saw the numbers coming back in October, that obviously gave us a lot more comfort. But basically we think that you go back and you take into account the chemical issue which was an unexpected issue and the currency where it is. I mean the business is doing much better as I indicated, the sales are up and the numbers are up in local currencies, up over 60%. So again, it\u2019s as if the factor -- all these factors at the time just really shaved the top.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Faucher with JPMorgan","John Faucher \u2013 JPMorgan ","Thank you very much. A couple of questions here. It sounds like with all the extra -- you talked about the improved profitability on the international business. It sounds like with all the extra costs with Japan and everything that Europe might have seen a relatively significant increase in profitability. Is that a fair analysis to make coming out of your comments?","Rodney C. Sacks","I wouldn\u2019t say significant, I think it had a nice increase in bottom line and they are all continuing to improve the effectiveness in Europe but we are still got a lot of individual countries where we are at the very early stages of developing the brand as a result we continue to divest quite heavily in trade development personnel, South personnel, sampling in order to make sure the product, the companies established in each of these countries. Although the \u2013 Europe again is not one country like America, each country has to be dealt with individually, different languages, different sales team, different support in order to get your brand. And even though the countries are small, you really have to support your brand and that becomes costly until you get to a sort of at least a minimum level of sales in that country and then things will start kicking in. Because we\u2019ve got some really good shares in small countries but it\u2019s costly. In countries like Lithuania, and last year we were up to 15% market share but when you look at it in actual case terms its very small. ","So to support that get the product established there has been expensive but it is starting to kick in on its own. We\u2019ve got very nice shares in certain of the markets like Greece, Bulgaria, some of those smaller markets in the east and then there were others that also sort of we just are still trying to get out of the blocks. So while we are all continuing to see some good change from losses to profits in those areas they will continue to improve. We are also obviously looking at trying to be a little more strict with your marketing spend to support the brand. A lot of the international properties that we started with in order to give the brand international credibility. We are trying to avoid obviously increasing that spend so that we actually end up with a spend per case lower. It is going the right way. It\u2019s happened for the last two years and so now we believe we are going forward.  We will be able to start showing better bottom line coming out of Europe.","John Faucher \u2013 JPMorgan ","Great. And that\u2019s great. And then one point of clarification here you talked about the board making a decision on the share repurchase authorization. Is it safe to say that none of the sort of noise going around that you talked about at the beginning of the call impacts your ability to repurchase stock or to authorize another repurchase program?","Rodney C. Sacks","We don\u2019t believe so. But obviously we need to be advised by our lawyers but we don\u2019t think so. ","John Faucher \u2013 JPMorgan ","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alec Patterson, with RCM. ","Alec Patterson \u2013 RCM Capital","Hi Rodney. First just on the October numbers I just wanted to be sort of clear, with the launches of the new products you mentioned the Cuba Lima or Lima. Sorry, I forgot the names. Was there any impact from that in those numbers?","Rodney C. Sacks","I think the loss was very light in the quarter. It was almost missed the quarter. So you had some launch numbers in the October numbers more from the sort of zero ultra then from Cuba Lima. Because that\u2019s been a bit slow at giving out and we are still trying to get some of our distributor network to take Cuba Lima. Zero Ultra has been taken across the whole network. So that has got out net get impact to buy it, but again I am not sure of the amount of brand as you know started to do very well. But it does take time to get these brands out into the market. So it\u2019s not as though day one you press a button you have a fortune of sales. It\u2019s \u2013 these things do rollout over a period of months. But I don\u2019t know the actual effect of the sales of Cuba Lima  in October. If I can get that figure before the end of the call I\u2019ll give it to you guys but I just don\u2019t have it with me. ","Alec Patterson \u2013 RCM Capital","Okay. Fair enough. And just in terms of the December meeting. Is that still on and also just quickly, should we anticipate any surprises in the Q filing?","Rodney C. Sacks","The December meeting is going ahead of schedule. I think the 11 December. I wouldn\u2019t think they are any surprises. I think the 10-Q will be very similar to \u2013 we\u2019ve gone into the detail pretty extensively of the business in the quarter and the issues. So I don\u2019t think there should be a need. But again I can\u2019t anticipate what you might think is surprising or material, but we don\u2019t think so.","Operator","Thank you. I am not showing any further questions at this time. I\u2019d like turn the conference back to our host for closing remarks.","Rodney C. Sacks","I am probably not going to be able to get the information on Zero Ultra in time for the close \u2013 before the close. I apologize. But on behalf of Monster I\u2019d like to thank each of you for your continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in our growth strategy and remain committed to developing and differentiating our brands and to expanding the company at home and abroad. Thank you very much.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a Q-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO. Sir, you may begin.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Hi. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, is with me today; as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance.","Before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and which are based on currently-available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends. Management cautions that these segments are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call.","Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2018, including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements for discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.","An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes and designated with asterisks in the consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated May 8, 2018. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section.","Growth in the beverage industry globally continues to be challenging. However, there has been recent positive momentum in the energy category.","Net sales for the 2018 first quarter were negatively impacted by $9.9 million due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606. Under ASC 606, commissions paid to The Coca-Cola Company based on our sales to certain of the company's customers which The Coca-Cola Company accounts for under the equity method, or consolidates are now included as a reduction to net sales whereas prior to January 1, 2018, commissions based on sales to those customers which Coca-Cola accounts for under the equity method were included in operating expenses.","In the first quarter, net sales were $850.9 million, up 14.7% from $742.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. Net sales in the first quarter were positively impacted by approximately $17.7 million of foreign currency movements. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 16%. The company recorded first quarter gross sales of $990.6 million, up 17.2% from the $845.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. Gross sales in the first quarter were positively impacted by approximately $22.2 million of foreign currency movements.","Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the first quarter was 60.6% as compared to 64.8% for the comparable 2017 first quarter and 62.1% for the 2017 fourth quarter. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the gross profit percentage would have been 61%. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to: increases in promotional allowances as a percentage of gross sales; the $9.9 million of commissions accounted for as a reduction of net sales due to the adoption of ASC 606; geographical sales mix, our foreign operations generally have lower gross profit margins; a change in domestic product sales mix principally a higher percentage of sales of Java Monster, Caff\u00e9 Monster, Espresso Monster and Hydro; increases in certain import costs principally freight-in aluminum cans and sucralose; Hydro production issues in the U.S. and EMEA, and certain increases in other costs.","Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.9% for the 2018 first quarter as compared to 3.1% in the 2017 first quarter largely due to higher carrier contract rates in the U.S. and increased distribution inefficiencies due to longer haul distances for certain products.","Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.5% compared to 11.7% in the same quarter a year ago. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 12.3% as compared to 14.4% in the same quarter last year. Included in general and administrative costs was distributed termination expenses of $7 million for the 2018 first quarter as compared with $19.9 million in the comparable 2017 first quarter.","In the quarter, payroll expenses were up $8.8 million compared to the same period last year primarily due to head count growth both domestically and internationally including to support the launches in China and other countries.","Legal expenses related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $1.7 million in the 2018 first quarter as compared to $1.9 million in the 2017 first quarter.","Operating income was adversely affected by losses in China and India. The losses in India were due to establishment costs in advance of the launch which has continued to take longer than anticipated for regulatory reasons as well as due to inventory reserves.","Our effective tax rates decreased from 32.8% in the 2017 first quarter to 23.3% in the 2018 first quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the Tax Reform Act signed into law on December 22, 2017. The decrease was partially offset by the elimination of certain deductions, specifically the domestic production deduction and decrease in stock-based compensation tax deduction.","Net income was $216.1 million in the 2018 first quarter compared to net income of $178 million in the 2017 first quarter, an increase of 21.4%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 582 million for the first quarter of 2017 to 574.1 million for the first quarter of 2018 as a result of share repurchases, which I will cover later in this call.","Diluted earnings per share for the 2018 first quarter increased 23.1% to $0.38 from $0.31 in the first quarter of 2017. Distributed terminations were $7 million in this quarter or approximately $0.01 per diluted share after-tax.","We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. We're also making good progress in the U.S. in nontraditional channels including foodservice, accounts and e-commerce. In the first quarter of 2018, in the U.S., we have now fully transitioned the state of Minnesota.","In EMEA, launches are planned in the second and third quarters of 2018 in Azerbaijan, Belarus, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Tanzania. We plan to launch Predator in 2018 as an affordable energy brand in selected Eastern European and African markets.","During the first quarter of 2018, we launched Monster in Argentina and are planning to launch Monster in Ecuador and Uruguay later this year.","In China, we continue to focus our efforts towards establishing Monster around the country, with an emphasis on distribution in the top 40 cities and to key accounts, targeting the younger and more affluent consumer demographic. We have commenced shipments of Monster to Coca-Cola India where we launched Monster in April in a lead market. We plan to expand the distribution and sales of Monster in India more extensively later this year.","Mutant, one of our affordable energy brand that is positioned differently than in the U.S., was recently launched in Pakistan and Cambodia and is planned to be launched in Vietnam and Myanmar later this year.","According to the Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through March 31, 2018, all outlets combined, namely, convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category including Energy Shots increased by 4.8% versus the same period a year ago.

Java Monster's share alone for the five weeks ended March 31, 2018 was 47.6%, up 2.6 points, while Starbucks Doubleshot Energy's share was 43.1%, down 11.7 points.","The production capacity shortages that we experienced in the second half of 2016 for both Java Monster and Muscle Monster were largely worked through by the fourth quarter of 2017. Both Java Monster and Muscle Monster came up for allocation by the end of that quarter.","Together with our bottling partners, we are currently focused on regaining lost shelf space for these products. According to Nielsen in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended March 31, 2018, the Energy Drink category increased 6% in dollars. Monster sales increased 15% versus a year ago. Monster's market share increased 2.5 share points to 33%.

Vive 100 sales increased 12.7% and its market share decreased 1.6 points to 37.2%, while Boost's market share decreased 0.3 of a point to 8.3%.","The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced, positively and\/or negatively, by sales in the OXXO Convenience chain which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO Convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities put a very significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.","I'd like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen in the 13-week period ending March 2018, Monster's retail market share in value, as compared to the same period last year, grew from 10.5% to 11.5% in Belgium, from 11.8% to 12% in Czech Republic, from 23.7% to 27.1% in France, from 15.6% to 18.7% in Great Britain, from 31.2% to 31.8% in Greece, from 10% to 14.1% in Italy, from 5.2% to 7% in the Netherlands, from 11.6% to 16.2% in Norway, from 6.5% to 8.3% in Poland, from 26.4% to 29.1% in Spain, and from 10.6% to 11.8% in Sweden.","According to Nielsen in the 13-week period ending February 2018, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year increased from 10.3% to 13.7% in Ireland.

Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the 2018 first quarter were negatively impacted by $3.9 million due to the adoption of ASC 606.

Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 47.2% for the first quarter. Gross profit in the region was also impacted by a higher percentage of Monster sales.","We're pleased with the rollout of additional SKUs in the Ultra range in EMEA markets. In the first quarter of 2018, we introduced Ultra Citron in the Netherlands and Ultra Violet in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Various SKUs in the Ultra line are now sold in 38 EMEA markets.

Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $511.4 million compared to $528.6 million at December 31, 2017. Short-term investments were $585.2 million compared to $672.9 million at December 31, 2017. Long-term investments were $33.5 million compared to $2.4 million at December 31, 2017.","Accounts receivable increased to $525.5 million at March 31, 2018, from $449.5 million at December 31, 2017.

Average days of inventory was 71.7 days at March 31, 2018, compared to 75 days at December 31, 2017.","In the first quarter of 2018, we launched Caff\u00e9 Monster, a ready to drink energy coffee in 13.7-ounce glass bottles in three flavors, relaunched Muscle Monster in a 15-ounce plastic bottle in two flavors and launched Rehab White Dragon Tea. We rebranded our two Monster Extra Strength SKUs into the Monster MAXX line and added an additional SKU. We also expanded Monster Hydro into a resealable 25.4-ounce bottle with three new flavors.","In Canada in the first quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Energy Ultra Violet and Monster Hydro in a 550-mL PET bottle in three flavors as well as Full Throttle orange in 16-ounce cans. In EMEA we launched Monster Hydro in 550-mL PET bottles in Sweden in January 2018 and in Germany in March 2018. In the first quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Mango Loco in the United Kingdom and Sweden along with Monster Pipeline Punch in the United Kingdom and Belgium.","We also recently launched Mutant as an affordable energy brand in Pakistan and Cambodia. We launched Ultra White in Hong Kong and Macau in the first quarter of 2018. In the second quarter of 2018, we will launch Monster Ultra Citron in Korea along with Cuba Libre in Japan. We launched the Lewis Hamilton signature Monster Energy Drink in Australia and New Zealand in the 2018 first quarter.","We estimate April 2018 gross sales to be approximately 18.9% higher than in April of 2017. On a foreign exchange adjusted basis, we estimate April 2018 gross sales will be approximately 16.1% higher than in April 2017. Please note that the impact of ASC 606 has not been included in determining these figures. April had one extra selling day. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production.","In some instances where our bottles are responsible for production and unilaterally determined their production schedules, which affects the dates in which we invoice as bottlers, as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even two months should not be necessarily imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period.","During the 2018 first quarter, the company purchased approximately 4.3 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $57.74 per share for a total of $249.9 million, excluding broker commissions. In February 2018, the company's board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program for the purchase of up to $250 million of the company's outstanding common stock. No shares have been repurchased pursuant to the February 2018 repurchase program.","In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. The company continued to achieve record market shares in the U.S. and many countries. Retail sales statistics from many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category in line with earlier periods. New additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. We're excited about the prospects for our new product launches. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India despite operating losses recorded during the quarter for China and India of approximately $2.8 million. We are continuing to launch Monster Energy Drinks with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain markets.","I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Vivien Azer from Cowen. Your line is now open.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Hi. Afternoon.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","So, Hilton, I know you say you don't give guidance, but you did offer some kind of personal color on the fourth quarter call around expectations for gross margin where I think \u2013 where you guys settled out in the first quarter did fall short of that and I think will prove to be disappointing to investors. So can you just help talk us through where, relative to your fourth quarter commentary, gross margin missed your personal expectations? Thank you.","Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.","Sure, sure. In the last conference call, I did give my personal views on percentage gross margins going forward. I said that while the company does not give guidance, my personal view was to use the gross margin for the 2017 fourth quarter of 62.1% going forward. There are, of course, many factors that go into gross margin, some of which are one-off costs and some of which may well be ongoing as we experienced in Q1.","Looking forward, again, the company does not give guidance. But it is important to bear in mind what's happening with aluminum, which can fluctuate significantly even within a day. The Midwest, premium, freights, fuel issues, promotional allowances, geographic sales mix, domestic product sales mix, continuing investments in China and India, and so it's extremely difficult to talk about a sustainable gross profit margin percentage when there are many non-controllable factors. So we really are not in a position to give any further guidance on gross margins. On the other hand, we are continuing to progress production efficiencies and we continue to review pricing on an ongoing basis.","Operator","Thanks. And our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good afternoon, gentlemen.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Hi, Dara.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So, Hilton, following up on that comment on pricing, I guess we've seen price increases in this category during times of margin pressure in the past. And given the significant gross margin depression the last couple quarters and the continued commodity cost runoff, do you think you might look to take price increases in the U.S. at some point? And how do you guys think through the puts and takes of taking price increases? Thanks.","Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.","What I said was we continue to review pricing on an ongoing basis, and we do this irrespective of margin pressures. Obviously, when we do have margin pressures, it's something that surfaces again, and it's something that we are continually reviewing. And more than that, I just don't want to say at this time.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then could you guys talk about the health of the energy drink category in the U.S.? You mentioned weak beverage growth trends in general across the sector, but seemed more positive on the energy category. So where do things stand there and any worries about the potential impact on gas, convenience from the rising gas prices?","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Last year, sort of, I think the whole industry was at a bit of a loss to understand why the convenience category had been growing, which had historically grown ahead of all markets, had sort of changed and started to slow down. What we're starting to see now is that the convenience category has really come back and is now growing ahead of the all measured channels. And so I think that we are starting to see this trend, which is quite encouraging. So I think we referred to some of the numbers. I'm just trying to think. The convenience was up 4.6% in the last 13 weeks, and I think it was up a little higher in the last five weeks.","Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.","5.6%.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","5.6%. So it certainly is moving in the right direction and starting to solidify and gain traction again.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Afternoon.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. So could I go to the international? Can you speak about international growth? Because if you exclude the 2% inventory benefit that you highlighted in the January sales, it seems that your underlying sales internationally could have decelerated again to the high-single digit range. Is that what we should expect for a normalized rate of growth going forward?","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Well, I don't think it's gone down to the high-single digits, and I think we did explain and drew the distinction in the markets to some of the geographic sales mix which also affected sales. If you look at the figures we gave you for Strategic Brands, which was down in dollars and marginally up, that has had a drag on our sales. The Monster sales internationally are still continuing to grow on quite a healthy basis.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Pablo Zuanic from SIG. Your line is now open.","Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you. Hilton and Rodney, look, I just want some big picture comments in terms of gross margins. I mean, a number of companies in the industry are facing what they call cyclical gross margin issues with aluminum lags and increasing prices. In your case, it seems to me that you face secular issues also going from single cans to pack sizes in the U.S., growing faster overseas than domestically. I mean, in China, your prices are much lower. So I don't know if it's possible, but if you could just help us understand in terms of these declining gross margins we're seeing, how much could we consider cyclical and how much will be secular?","And the second question which is related to this. Other companies like, say, Buffalo, their gross margin story will be that they will bring in a lot of production in-house from third-party manufacturers. In your case, I've never really understood if there is such a story. I mean as you move distribution to the Coke system, is there an opportunity there to also shift production, or those bottlers were already producing your products? So just help us understand how much leeway or opportunity you have there in terms of structural changes that could help profitability and gross margins. And the very last one on the same topic...","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Wait. Wait. Wait. You're now going on to the third question. We've lost track of the first one.","Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","(37:19).","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","No, no, go on. We're supposed to have one question at a time. Okay. So let's just \u2013 let me just start with production. All of our products of Coke PET we have a finished product model that's not going to change. What will change is as we continue to align ourselves with the Coke bottlers, we will continue to increase production sites with those Coke bottlers in their countries and in their markets, which will have the effect of reducing costs, of reducing freight, reducing import duties, and so that will benefit and continue to improve. There isn't any plan to change that.","In the Strategic Brands, they are already being manufactured by Coke because the model for the Strategic Brands segment is pretty much a concentrate model. Where there are some products in the Strategic Brands where the Coke bottlers can't manufacture them; for example, a 24-ounce cap can for NOS in the U.S., we then are selling that product on a finished product basis. And that accounts for a little bit lower product of gross margin for us because we're obviously in the one case selling concentrate at a higher margin and in the other case we are selling a finished product which does have a lower gross margin just because of the economics and the law of numbers.","So that's on the margin side. So we will continue to achieve production efficiencies. We will lower costs by improving our production and increasing the number of plants. That is also particularly so with regard to the newer products like Hydro. As you know, we experienced some production increases in coffee product because we were having to import product. We are still importing Espresso Monster, but we are looking to convert that to local production, which will again \u2013 which will assist in costs.","And as we start ramping up with Caff\u00e9 Monster and others, we are looking to improve efficiencies in Hydro, which is really manufactured in the Northeast now. We're looking to \u2013 in bottles and in Carolina for the cans, we are looking to increase facilities coming on board which will reduce costs.","Could you take the first question, Hilton?","Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.","I'm not...","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","You don't know what the first question was. Do you want to repeat your first question? Hello?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Freda Zhuo - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. This is actually Freda Zhuo on for Judy. Thanks so much for taking my questions.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Hi.","Freda Zhuo - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So my question is actually on China. So I think if you look at some of the channel data, it seems as though category growth has kind of taken a step down in 2018 closer to the 10% range. Can you talk about what you're seeing on the ground in terms of what might be driving some of that slower category growth? And then I caught a comment that you guys were repositioning or perhaps targeting some of the younger, more affluent demographics. So is that impacting the price point that you're placing Monster at in the market? Thanks.","Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.","Okay. No, we're continuing with our price strategy, which was to remain competitive with Red Bull Gold, the Thai Red Bull. So that strategy is continuing. Our strategy is to maintain our products adjacent to Red Bull and to have what we call 3P execution, which is pricing competitive with Red Bull, point-of-sale, and position on shelf. So that is the target that we have set our bottlers, and we're moving forward in those accounts where we believe that we can achieve good sustainable sales.","And our bottlers \u2013 I've just come back from China \u2013 have set themselves an objective of focusing and trying to achieve what we have succeeded and what we succeeded initially in the U.S. is to develop an energy shelf so that Chinese consumers can go to a shelf and select an energy drink. When our product is placed in a Coca-Cola cooler adjacent to a Coke and a Sprite, it doesn't help the consumer understand what the product is.","So we are proceeding down our strategy, which we are supporting with a range of marketing media and social media. We've got a major computer game program that we are tying in with called Battleground, which is a significant property. We're moving forward on that strategy this year. So we always said that China would be a long-term development, and we're just staying the course.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Yeah. Just to \u2013 perhaps, if I would just add to that. Obviously, one of the challenges we're still having is the level of execution or quality of execution from the bottlers to execute the 3P that Hilton just alluded to, and that continues to be an ongoing challenge. We have seconded some of our key staff from the U.S. to really try and educate them and actually be able to really direct them and show them what we need to do. And we're confident that we will get it done, but it's a longer and harder road, and it will be achieved, and we will get there.","With regard to the demographic, while we talk about the younger and more affluent, there hasn't been a change. In China, we have our product. It's carbonated. Our researchers indicated that younger consumers do prefer a carbonated product, and we've distinguished ourselves from Red Bull, which is a still product Thai Red Bull in China, and we believe that we're continuing with that strategy. The pricing is premium in that it's not as premium as our product in the rest of the world and it is aligned with Red Bull China, but that is at a premium to some of the other energy drinks and certainly soft drinks.","So that just will continue and that continues to be our strategy. There's been no change in our strategy. The challenge is just again getting the recognition for Monster in China that is at a lower level because of the social media fact that you don't have as much access to \u2013 the consumer doesn't have access to Facebook and YouTube that they have around the rest of the world. And we are improving and, obviously, taking steps to start getting the consumer more familiar with us through the local social media companies that have the equivalent channels and programs in China.","Operator","And this ends the Q&A portion of the call. I would now like to turn it back to Rodney Sacks for any further remarks.","Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.","Thank you. On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to develop, differentiate our brand, and to expand the company both at home and abroad, and in particular, to expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottling system internationally.","We are also particularly excited about the new opportunities that we have going forward with the portfolio of energy drink products throughout the world comprised of our Monster Energy brand together with the Strategic Brands, as well as Hydro and Mutant. I hope to see you all at the Annual Stockholders Meeting in Corona on June 7, 2018, at 2:00 PM. Thank you very much for your attendance.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference call. This concludes today's program, and you may all disconnect.

Stump - Northcoast Research","Operator","Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monster Beverage Corporation's Third Quarter 2013 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO. Mr. Sacks, please begin.","Rodney C. Sacks","Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, is with me today; as is as Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance.","Before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends.","Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company, that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call.","Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed March 1, 2013, as well as our most recent report on Form 10-Q filed August 9, 2013, including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements, for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance.","The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated November 7, 2013. A copy of this information is also available on our website, www.monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. Although I do not wish to appear redundant every time that I open our quarterly conference calls, I do however, want to reiterate once again that our products are safe, based on both our and the industry's long track record and the scientific evidence supporting the safety of our ingredients. As investigations of energy drinks continue and further research on these topics and issues is undertaken, the results consistently confirm and reinforce our repeated views that our products are safe. Additionally, we believe that the strongest evidence of product safety is that many millions of energy drinks continue to be safely consumed worldwide every day. By now, nearly 10 billion Monster Energy drinks have been sold and safely consumed around the world over the past 11 years.","As previously announced, the Food and Drug Administration is investigating the safety of caffeine in food products and particularly its effect, if any, on children and adolescents. An independent review panel was convened by the FDA through the Institute of Medicine to help determine if there are potential health hazards associated with the consumption of caffeine in food and dietary supplements. This panel held a public workshop during August 2013 in Washington, D.C. We're still awaiting the report of this panel. The long history of safe use of products containing caffeine in the U.S. has the remained unchanged and studies indicate that the average amount of caffeine consumed by the U.S. population has remained relatively stable, despite the entry of energy drinks into the market.","As previously indicated and as stated by the FDA in 2012, available studies do not indicate any new previously unknown risks associated with caffeine consumption, although the FDA has continued to explore whether additional research on caffeine or energy drinks is needed. Many studies conducted in recent years in the U.S.A., Canada and Europe, including a very recent study, have all consistently concluded that the principal sources of caffeine for teens under 18 are coffee, soft drinks and tea and not energy drinks.","To put of the level of caffeine that is contained in Monster Energy drinks in context, we remind listeners that a Starbucks 16-ounce-sized brewed coffee contains approximately 330 milligrams of caffeine, which is more than double the approximately 160 milligrams of caffeine that is contained in the same-sized Monster Energy drink.","I will now briefly provide listeners with an update on certain of the current regulatory matters and litigation. For a more extensive discussion on regulatory matters and litigation, listeners are referred to our 10-Q, which will be filed in the next few days.","The company continues to diligently monitor developments relating to these issues. The complaint filed by the City Attorney of San Francisco against the company was remanded to the San Francisco Superior Court. Subsequently the City Attorney filed a renewed motion to dismiss the complaint filed by the company against the City Attorney, for declaratory and injunctive relief, in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. A hearing on that motion is scheduled for December 9, 2013.","In a purported class action filed against the company, alleging issues relating to Monster Energy drinks' safety and the marketing activities of the company, an amended complaint was filed against the company after the original complaint was dismissed by the court. The company moved to dismiss the amended complaint. At the hearing the court issued a tentative ruling dismissing the amended complaint. The company's currently awaiting the final judgment of the court on that motion.","Following the hearing held by the U.S. Senate Commerce -- Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation on July 31, 2013, on September 25, 2013, 4 United States senators, 3 of whom are members of the committee, addressed a letter to the company and some 16 other energy drink companies. In that letter, these 4 senators asked whether the energy drink companies would be prepared to agree to a number of commitments relating primarily to the manner in which their energy drinks are marketed. On October 28, 2013, the company responded to the senators' letter indicating numerous commitments it would be willing to make under certain circumstances. In addition, the company has forwarded to the 4 senators and to the American Beverage Association, a set of proposed U.S. model guidelines for energy drink companies. The company is hopeful that under the auspices of the ABA, all major energy drink companies will adopt these guidelines with regard to their U.S. activities. The company supports the proposed model guidelines and would agree to adopt them if all other major energy drink companies doing business in the U.S. also adopt them. In that fashion, the company believes that the concerns expressed by the senators and others would be addressed without putting the company at any material competitive disadvantage.","The company assumes no obligation to update any statements made with respect to ongoing litigation and regulatory matters, including with respect to the foregoing disclosures, whether as to new information, future events or otherwise, other than as required by law.","Given the current litigation and the pending regulatory requests, we will refrain from answering questions or commenting further on these specific subjects. We are happy, of course, to answer questions that you may have about our products in general or about the third quarter results as best we can, after we have concluded our discussion on the business.","Turning to the business. While the beverage market in general in North America continues to experience softness, more specifically in CSDs, the energy drink market continues to grow, although the rate of growth still remains in single digits. However undoubtedly [ph] from the field, the energy drink market appears to be gaining momentum. Sales of our new Monster Ultra Blue energy drinks, as well as our new Muscle Monster line and our tea plus pink lemonade and energy Monster Rehab line extension, have exceeded our expectations and we are optimistic that we will be able to achieve increased sales contributions from these products in the future. In fact, Ultra Blue quickly became one of the top 5 selling Monster SKUs in the convenience and gas channel, according to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through September 28, 2013.","Additionally, according to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through September 28, 2013, in the convenience and gas channel, Muscle Monster has become the second best-selling brand in the protein supplement sector and achieved a 20% market share. Even though ACB distribution levels are still low. We are optimistic that as we continue to achieve increased distribution levels for our Muscle Monster line, we will be able to increase our market share of the protein supplement sector.","During the third quarter, our operating income was negatively affected by increased professional services costs of $6.5 million, net of insurance reimbursements, of which $5.3 million related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the company's marketing, promotions, ingredients, labeling and safety of its Monster Energy drinks, which we believe are exceptional in nature. The net effect on earnings per share professional services costs relates to regulatory matters and related litigation is approximately $0.02 per share. The company continued to make progress in the third quarter and achieved record third quarter gross sales, up 8.6% from the third quarter of 2012, to $686.6 million with net sales up 8.9% to $590.4 million. Operating income was up 7.6% to $151.4 million. Our tax rate was marginally lower this quarter at 38.8% from 39% in the same quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share increased 13.1% from $0.47 per share in the third quarter of 2012 to $0.53 per share in the third quarter of 2013.","Although we are pleased with the results, our revenues were affected by: one, less robust growth sales for the energy category as a whole, in our principal market, the United States; two, less robust growth of the energy category overall in Europe, despite the slower growth Monster was still able to achieve 8.6% growth in dollars in that region in the third quarter, well ahead of the growth of the category overall in that region; three, sales of our new Zero Ultra and Ultra Blue energy drinks, although accretive, did result in some cannibalization generally across our existing SKUs; four, sales were positively affected by the launch of our new Ultra Blue energy drink as well as sales of our new Muscle Monster line, sales of Monster Energy products in glass bottles and the Extra Strength line were lower, as were sales of Worx energy shots; five, sales in our DSD division in North America were 10.6% higher in the third quarter and contribution margin from the DSD division during that period was up 14.2% over the comparable period last year. Sales in our warehouse division were lower as a result, primarily, of an unsuccessful promotion with a large retailer, including an extensive sampling and in-store demo program. The warehouse division incurred an operating loss of $2.2 million as compared to a small operating profit that was earned by the division in the same period last year.","As discussed on previous conference calls, we will be reporting on Nielsen's extended sample of outlets, which includes Wal-Mart; dollar stores, such as Family Dollar, Dollar General, and Fred's; DeCA military stores; and club stores, namely Sam's and BJ's but excluding Costco.","According to the Nielsen report for the 13 weeks through September 28, 2013, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, on the expanded basis I just described, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including Shots, increased by 3.1% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 9.3% in the 13-week period, while sales of Red Bull increased by 7.4%.","Sales of Rockstar decreased by 5%, and sales of 5-Hour decreased by 9.7%. Sales of AMP were down 16%. NOS increased sales by 17.1%, and sales of Full Throttle decreased 2.2%.","According to the Nielsen reports for the 5 weeks ended September 28, 2013, sales of energy drinks in the convenience and gas channel, in dollars, increased by 5.2% over the comparable period in 2012. Sales of Monster increased by 10.2% over the comparable period last year, while sales of Red Bull increased by 8.8% over the same period. Rockstar was up 3.5%, while 5-Hour was down 5.4% and AMP was down 15.1%.","According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended September 28 -- I think, sorry, it's 5 weeks September 28, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, increased by 1.5 points over the comparable period a year ago to 34.3%, ahead of Red Bull's share of 34.2%, Rockstar's share of 8.1%, 5-Hour's share of 9.9% and AMP's share of 2.7%.","According to Nielsen, in the 13 weeks ended September 28, 2013, sales of energy plus coffee drinks, in dollars, in the convenience and gas channel increased 6.1% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 11.1% higher than in the comparable period last year, while Starbucks Double Shot energy was 1.3% higher. Sales of Java Monster continue to exceed sales of Starbucks Double Shot energy drinks in dollars.","According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended September 21, 2013, the energy drink category grew 5%. Monster sales increased 17%. Our market share increased 3 points to 29% over the comparable period last year. Red Bull sales increased 2% and its market share decreased 1.3 points to 38.3%. Rockstar sales increased 6% and its market share increased by 0.3 points to 13.7%.","According to Nielsen for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 1.4% in the month of September 2013. Monster sales decreased 11.3% and our market share decreased 4.8 points to 33.7% over the comparable period last year. But still ahead of Red Bull's market share. Red Bull sales decreased 1.5% and its market share decreased by 0.9% to 32%.","Boost's sales increased 20.4%, and its market share increased 2.5 points to 15.5%. Gladiator sales decreased 21.3%, and its market share decreased by 2.3 points to 7.9%.","The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months at a time, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain, in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. By way of illustration, according to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 15.5% in the month of August 2013. Monster sales increased 27.1% and our market share increased 3.6 points to 39.4% over the comparable period last year, while Red Bull sales decreased 1.9% and its market share decreased by 5.5 points to 30.7%.","This should be contrasted with the Nielsen results I've just reported above for the month of September in Mexico.","Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 9.8% to $566.8 million for the 3 months ended September 30, 2013, from $516.3 million in the same period in 2012 and contribution margin increased 14.6% to $194.9 million from $170.1 million in the same period in 2012. Net sales for the company's Warehouse segment decreased 7.9% to $23.7 million for the 3 months ended September 30, 2013, compared with $25.7 million for the same period in 2012, and contribution margin decreased to a contribution loss of $2.2 million this quarter from a contribution margin of $0.04 million in the same quarter last year.","Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the third quarter of 2013 amounted to $151.6 million compared to $144.7 million in the same quarter in 2012. Included in such sales are sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. Net sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in the third quarter, in dollars, were 8.6% higher than in the same period last year. Monster continues to gain momentum in that region and is growing in excess of the growth in the category. In particular, in each of the U.K., Spain, Germany and South Africa, which are our largest markets in that region, Monster achieved further market share gains.","According to Nielsen report, and for some markets Information Resources Inc., reports for the 13 weeks to the end of August 2013 -- and this is what I want to point out that the actual dates of the 4-week periods vary by a few days between different markets as reported to us. Monster's market share in value in its European markets and South Africa increased from 8.6% to 10%. We are continuing with our expansion strategy in international markets. We launched Monster Energy in Croatia during the quarter. Although we had hoped to be able to commence sales in India during the quarter, we only received the required regulatory approvals for India, subsequent to the quarter end. Sales of Monster Energy drinks commenced in India during October. We are planning to launch Monster in a few different countries in Asia, Central and Eastern Europe and Africa later this year and early next year.","Sales of the Monster Energy brand internationally, including in Japan, in particular, continue to grow satisfactorily. The weaker yen continued to negatively affect our gross sales in U.S. dollars, as well as our margins in Japan during the quarter. While sales to our Japanese distributor in the third quarter of 2013 were lower in dollars than in the comparable quarter last year, we have been advised that case sales, as well as sales out, from our Japanese distributed to retailers were higher in the quarter than in the comparable period last year.","Plans for production in Japan and Korea are proceeding satisfactorily. Test production runs have now taken place in both Korea and Japan. And we are on track to commence full commercial production in Japan within the next few months. We also are moving ahead with our plans to produce Monster Energy drinks in India. Sales in Chile are progressing well. In Brazil, our new distributor, Ambev, continued to secure increased distribution levels from month-to-month. Indeed, sales by Ambev to its customers also continued to improve from month-to-month and we are advised that record sales were achieved by Ambev during October.","We caution that sales in the single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors. Such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, and the timing of promotions in retail stores, as well as changes in production schedules and deliveries, and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the quarter or any future period.","According to the Nielsen report for the 13 weeks through September 28, 2013, in the convenience and gas channel, sales of Peace Tea were 5% lower than in the same period last year. Sales in the category were also lower by 1.7%. We continue to believe that Peace Tea brand has good growth potential and are planning to add a juice cocktail to the line, and we are evaluating the launch of ice coffees in glass bottles under the Peace Tea brand as well.","In the warehouse division, sales of Hubert's Lemonades in glass bottles for the 9 months through September 30, 2013, are significantly above sales in the previous comparable 9-month period. The Hubert's brand continues to gain market and consumer acceptance.","Gross profit margins achieved in the third quarter of 2013 were 52.1% versus 50.5% in the comparable quarter in 2012. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially attributable to changes in product sales mix, particularly the higher percentage of sales represented by our Ultra line and the Rehab Pink Lemonade line, which have a higher gross margins than most of our other 16-ounce products due to lower costs of goods, as well as a reduction in certain import costs and compensation for past product damages in respect to shipments to Asia. Gross margins achieved in the quarter in North America in 2013 were higher than in the comparable quarter last year. Gross margins achieved for international sales of Monster Energy, excluding those products sold from the United States, were also higher in the third quarter of 2013 than in the comparable quarter of 2012. We have covered a significant portion of our anticipated requirements for aluminum cans in 2013, and a large part of 2014, as well as a significant portion of our anticipated requirements for apple juice and sugar over the same period. We do not believe that at current levels, increases in costs of any raw materials will have a material negative effect on our margins.","Distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales in the third quarter were 4.6% versus 4.4% in the comparable quarter in 2012 due primarily to increased freight and warehouse expenses in Europe and South Africa. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12% versus 11.6% in the comparable period in 2012. Sponsorships and endorsement costs were higher as well as the cost of merchandise displays. Cost of premiums were lower during the quarter.","Cost of trade development programs to supplement our distribution partner sales were also marginally higher during the quarter. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased professional services costs for legal, accounting and other professional costs and which I commented on, earlier on this call.","Operating income was negatively affected by combined operating losses of $5.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2013, from our operations in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, South America and Asia, which was higher than the operating losses of $2.5 million, which were incurred last year in the same period last year, primarily due to a non routine indirect tax-related provision.","On a trading basis, the operating losses this quarter were comparable with the operating losses incurred during the same quarter last year. Operating income for the DSD division was $194.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, which was higher than operating income of $117.1 million, which was earned by the DSD division during the same period last year. Operating losses incurred in the warehouse division amounted to $2.2 million as compared to an operating profit of $0.04 million in the same quarter last year.","Our effective tax rate in the 2013 third quarter was 38.8% compared to 39% in the 2012 third quarter. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $287 million compared to $222.5 million at December 31, 2012. Short-term investments were $315.6 million compared to $97 million at December 31, 2012. Long-term investments comprised entirely of auction rate securities decreased from $21 million at December 31, 2012, to $9.7 million at September 30, 2013.","Accounts receivables increased to $339.2 million from $236 million at December 31, 2012. Days outstanding for receivables consistent with the above treatment were 44.7 days at September 30, 2013, and 41.3 days at September 30, 2012, compared to 42.8 days at June 30, 2013.","Days outstanding for receivables are expected to increase due to the different terms generally granted to customers internationally in accordance with local practices in their respective countries. Inventories increased to $247.4 million from $203.1 million at December 31, 2012. Average days of inventory was 78.7 days at September 30, 2013, which was higher than the 65 days of inventory at September 30, 2012, and higher than the 71.3 days at June 30, 2013.","Gross sales in October 2013 were approximately 9.3% higher than in October 2012. We caution again that sales in a single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall and the timing of promotions in retail stores, and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period.","To date, no shares have been purchased under our April 2013 repurchase plan. I'd like to turn to our recent announcement concerning Mark Hall. Mark has been involved in the beverage industry for more than a quarter of a century and has been with the company since 1997 as President of the Monster division. Mark has been an important part of the company but expressed a desire to become less involved in the day-to-day activities and also wished to take some time off for personal reasons until the end of the year. Mark has built a good team around him and has been focusing more on the positioning of the Monster Energy and Peace Tea brands, innovation and product development and spent less time on day-to-day management. Mark's new role as Chief Brand Officer for Monster Energy as of January 2014, formalizes his current role and is a win-win situation for both Mark and the company. Mark will continue to be responsible for the positioning of the Monster Energy and Peace Tea brands, innovation and product development. Mark will also serve on the Board of Directors of the company.","In October, the company launched a new Monster Ultra Red line extension, and is in the process of launching a new strawberry Muscle Monster energy shake. The company's planning to launch a further line extension of its Muscle Monster line at the beginning of 2014. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. One, North American gross margins remain healthy. Our 2013 third quarter gross margins for North America were higher than in the comparable quarter in 2012. U.S. Nielsen market statistics show that Monster Energy's growth is still outpacing the growth of the category as a whole on an increasing basis, particularly over the last 4 weeks. Ultra Red, which was launched recently and strawberry Muscle Monster, which is in the process of being launched are both receiving good reception from both retailers, as well as from consumers. Turning to international markets, we are satisfied with the performance of our international expansion and investments, particularly in the United Kingdom, Spain, Germany, South Africa, Japan, Brazil and Chile. According to Nielsen, and\/or for some markets IRI, the 4-week period -- for the 4-week period ending at the end of August 2013 -- again the actual dates, I pointed out, for the 4-week period vary by a few days between different markets. Monster's market share in value in Great Britain, Spain and France as compared to the same period last year grew from 9.2% to 10.4% in Great Britain from 15.2% to 20.7% in Spain and from 18% to 21.3% in South Africa. In addition, Monster's market shares in Germany and France grew from 7.4% to 8.6% in Germany and from 14.9% to 17.1% in France. In the 4 weeks to the end of September 2013, Monster's market share in Great Britain increased further to 11.4%. In Spain, increased further to 24.9% and in South Africa, increased further to 23.5%.","I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in Europe should only be used as a guide, because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in Europe vary from country to country.","Sales of Monster in Japan are continuing to increase and remain encouraging. According to our distributor in Japan, Monster has now achieved a 31% market share of the energy drink market in Japan. Seven, we are excited as we have finally managed to obtain a regulatory approval for the sale of Monster in India. We view India as an exciting future growth opportunity for Monster, particularly over the long term. Eight, as advised by Ambev, sales out by them to retailers in October reached the highest level since they commenced distribution of the Monster brand in Brazil at the beginning of this year. I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So international, just want to try to understand a little bit more sort of puts and takes there. Maybe you talked a bit about Japan could give us a sense of what the FX impact was there. Maybe talk about some of the sell-in in India how much potentially that impacted it in the October number? And just sort of, give some thoughts in general about sort of how you see it, especially as you look at the number in the quarter and you had a pretty material acceleration on a 2-year basis. So long question but should we think about this as a new run rate, is there a timing issue, I mean inventories, anything you can give that may give us a little bit more color on the international would be helpful.","Rodney C. Sacks","With regard to India, let me just start there. When we started sales, we had originally shipped product to India well before I think it was either the end of last year or the first quarter of this year. And we had shipped that in anticipation of getting regulatory approval and then we ended up with some delays in getting that approval. So it wasn't a buildup of inventory in this quarter for India. With regard to Japan, what we have seen was some reduction in inventory levels being held by our distributor during the quarter. And I think as they are getting more comfortable with the brand and the sector, which is something they really didn't have any experience with, their stock holdings are going low and that is why we refer to the fact that while our sales were low, actually their sales out were higher in Japan. A similar situation has sort of arisen with respect to Brazil in the quarter. On a ForEx level, I will try and get you the impact later on in the call. I don't have it handy. Is there anything else you'd like to ask, Mark?","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Sure, how about that share repurchase, anything coming down the pike there with all the cash that is now building?","Rodney C. Sacks","We look at market conditions as they develop and look to implementing the share repurchase as we go forward. We will raise it again with the board at a meeting tomorrow and then we'll see how we go through the end of the year.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then just related to the first question. Can you quantify the amount of de-stocking in Japan and Brazil as you're looking for the FX piece?","Rodney C. Sacks","I -- do you have the -- I really at this stage, at this time, I just don't have that figure -- those figures handy. Other than to say that, our sales into our distributors in both those areas were considerably lower than the sales out.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Amit Sharma with BMO Capital.","Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Can you just, Ron, you talked about the ABA guidelines and the senators letter. Is it fair to assume that if you do adhere for these guidelines and this overall energy drinks category, agree to these guidelines, some of the regulatory headwinds that you've seen as indicative [indiscernible] will ease up?","Rodney C. Sacks","Well, we can't speculate as to whether what we have suggested would be completely satisfactory to senators or regulators. We've just, from our assessment of the questions that we've got and the request for commitment that we have from the senators, we believe this goes a pretty far way to dealing with them. There are some issues that we have still and don't believe we should agree to and won't voluntarily to agree to. And they may remain still contentious, outstanding contentious issues. But we do believe that pretty much by and large, we think that this will resolve, or certainly alleviate to a large measure, some of those headwinds.","Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","The other question was around profitability. You talked about some onetime sort of losses in the warehouse. Are those -- should that be considered onetime that will alleviate in the next quarter? Or you continue to expect a negative margin piece in the warehouse division?","Rodney C. Sacks","No, we think that, that won't repeat itself. We think that, that will right itself next quarter.","Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And my final question is, as we look at your market share position in [indiscernible] in Europe, especially Western Europe and countries, should we start to sort of assume that margin profile in these countries could start to get better and, perhaps, positive margins in these market?","Rodney C. Sacks","You are very unclear. But if -- what you're talking about is our margins in Europe, we are taking steps to improve our margin through production in a number of additional countries in Europe. For technical reasons some of the production that we had planned to implement during the year, we weren't comfortable with the quality of the products running off -- coming off the lines and so we weren't able to implement some of those, those plans. But we are planning to produce at additional production plants in Southern Europe, which will alleviate a lot of the freight and damages cost and other cost in health margins. We are also planning -- we are quite advanced in production and planning production in South Africa, which will remove the freight from Europe to South Africa and also, reduce damages in transit and also improve our margins there as well. This also will apply in Japan where we are progressing as quickly as we can to implement production. And we also are [indiscernible] finally, we are also at an advanced stage of discussions and moving forward with production plans for additional production plants in Brazil, which we believe will also, because of they are complicated tax laws, will also help us achieve improved margins in Brazil. So we are hoping that in 2014, we will actually start to see some improved margins coming.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell from SunTrust.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just on the Monster Muscle, can you maybe quantify I think you'd said ACB is pretty low. Where we stand there? And where next few months or few quarters?","Rodney C. Sacks","The ACB level that Nielsen has indicated for Muscle Monster is about 38% ACB.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And can that get to 50%, 60%, 70%?","Rodney C. Sacks","Well, it should get to 80%, 80-plus like most of our other energy drink brands. And then obviously, what you might get in -- within the range, you might get a variation of ACB levels from the bestsellers to the least. We have 3, we're introducing strawberry Muscle Monster and we are planning to introduce another variant at the beginning of 2014. So we believe that we will be able to certainly get our better selling products in that -- in the range up to that 80-plus level. But it's a question of time and when we get listings and get into the new sets in spring.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then is this something that's planned to take international?","Rodney C. Sacks","Sorry at this point, we're just looking at the U.S. market. We're also evaluating the Canadian market. But due to cost of goods at this time, we aren't looking at any of the other markets yet.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Got it. Sorry, last -- only one question. In Europe, just trying to make sure I understood like CCE on a call a few weeks ago said Monster sales were up around 25%, and then I think you said Europe for you was up 8% to 9%. Is that just weakness in non-CCE channels or is there some disconnect I'm missing?","Rodney C. Sacks","We take it across all countries. And as we indicated, I gave you some of our bigger countries. Basically, we have increased rates, but a lot of the central and eastern countries have been -- their actual category is down and we haven't seen those sort of increases. And so when you balance it across the whole of Europe, it's come down more but also I think there is some issue in CCE. They did, we think, reduce inventories. But I don't have a figure for that. There was some reduction in their inventory holdings, which again also translate into a difference between our sell in and their sell out. And I think there was a production, they delayed production at the end of the quarter. Just because in some of -- in many of their markets, they run production and then charge out the products and then record a sell, once they run the product produced, and then it gets delivered and they moved their production that was scheduled at the end of September, they moved that into the beginning of October. So that, I think it may have had some impact as well.","Operator","And our last question will come from the line of Alton Stump with Northcoast Research.","Alton K. Stump - Northcoast Research","Just wanted to ask -- just to clarify from a question about India. In the October sales number of up, what was it, 9.1, was there any impact in that just a current month or the October month from India?","Rodney C. Sacks","No. Once again, because we really just started getting regulatory approval, they were using some of their current inventory they had on hand and we're now starting to produce new fresh inventory for them. So India really had no effect. Just want to go back -- in Japan the foreign exchange difference is about $2 million. Also just wanted to mention that, just in case you guys have looked at the some of the inventory buildup, that's possibly due to the fact that we started delivering some of the Ultra Red during the quarter. Although we launched it in the October, there was some sales in the quarter of Ultra Red, we were building up inventory. Also, we had Ultra Blue inventory, which is from the launch in March, which we didn't have last year. And we also have a Call of Duty promotion, both in the U.S. and in many of our international markets, and so there was some buildup of inventory in anticipation of deliveries for that promotion, which will take place later in the quarter, it will take place starting now, I think and going through to the end of the year.","Alton K. Stump - Northcoast Research","Okay, if I could, one quick follow-up, Rodney or no?","Rodney C. Sacks","Want to have a follow-up?","Alton K. Stump - Northcoast Research","Yes. I'd like to ask a follow-up if I could. Just, as you look at the category, it'll only be up low-single digits in the third quarter I guess the comps were easier, is there still any impact, do you think, just from the perception of all the headline news risks? I think you've mentioned that on the last couple of conference calls, is that still out there, is it still and impact in the category do you think?","Rodney C. Sacks","We think that there's still some impact, but we think that it is being -- it is lessening as time goes on because things are -- this started over year ago. The amount of articles and comments and has become sort of lessened. So we do believe there has been lesser of an impact and eventually, we believe it will get -- it eventually will be eliminated and go away. But at the moment, we think there is still some there on the category, generally.","All right. Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued support for the company. We remain confident in the safety of our products and our growth strategy, both domestically and internationally. Thank you very much for your attendance.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day."]}}
