Dillon, III - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Ball Corporation second quarter earnings conference call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, August 3, 2017.","I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes. Please go ahead, sir.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Thank you, Malika, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's second quarter 2017 results.","The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings as well as company news releases. If you don't already have our second quarter earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com.","Information regarding descriptions of our segment reporting, year-to-date depreciation catch-up recorded in the second quarter that relates to the finalization of the fixed asset values associated with last year's beverage acquisition, and the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the notes section of today's earnings release. The release also includes a table summarizing business consolidation and other activities as well as a reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations.","Now, joining me on the call today is Scott Morrison, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. And also, we are welcoming Dan Fisher to our quarterly earnings calls. Dan assumed the role of Chief Operating Officer of our Global Beverage business late last year, and he's doing a fantastic job leading this. Given where we are and where we are going, we thought it's important for you to hear from him on many of the activities that are occurring in this business.","I'll provide some brief introductory remarks and comments on our food and aerosol segment. Dan will discuss the global beverage packaging performance. Scott will discuss key financial metrics. And then I'll finish up with comments on our aerospace business and the outlook for the back half of 2017 and beyond.","Our second quarter results from operations were right on top of our expectations despite challenging U.S. tinplate performance. Volumes in our U.S. food can business declined low double digits in the quarter, and tinplate manufacturing inefficiencies led to lower absorption and redundant costs in the quarter related to the closure of our Weirton, West Virginia cutting and coating facility and contemporaneous startup of our new Canton, Ohio cutting and coating facility.","We're disappointed about the performance we experienced in this segment. However, we believe the underperformance is behind us and expect each of the remaining quarters for our food and aerosol business to be up year over year due to the incremental progress we've seen at our Canton metal service center, improving manufacturing metrics, and the ramping up of new aluminum aerosol capacity in Europe and India to keep up with our customers' growth.","Supply and demand is very tight in the global aluminum aerosol business, and our team is living hand-to-mouth during the second quarter, lending support across regions to one another as they tried to keep pace with the expansion of our highly sustainable and lightweight ReAl product line. Going forward, we will continue to generate cash from our tinplate operations and continue to invest in our growing global aerosol business.","I'll let Dan Fisher review the global beverage can business in a moment. However, one year into the largest acquisition in our company's history, we are seeing the growth in comparable EBITDA and free cash flow materialize in global beverage. Initial transformational actions are driving synergies and cash flow is on the rise. We're not without our challenges, particularly in some of the more volatile regions in which we operate, but our three largest regions, North and Central America, Europe, and South America, are all on track, so far so good.","Combining the expected improvement in both food and aerosol and our continued progress in global beverage, and then layer on current and expected growth in our aerospace business over the next several years, and we remain confident in our team's ability to deliver on our commitments while behaving as owners to ensure the best long-term outcomes for our company. With Dan, Jim Peterson, and Rob Strain at the helm of these businesses, we're in very good shape.","To highlight some of the work being done during the second quarter, we further improved our G&A cost structure with the ramp down of the Charlotte, North Carolina, regional support center. We ceased beverage can production in Reidsville, North Carolina. We negotiated with the Works Councils in Recklinghausen, Germany and ceased production of beverage cans and end in those facilities on July 31. We saw month-on-month improvement at our Canton, Ohio metal service center. And our aerospace business cleared critical program milestones, hired more staff to service contracts that will ramp up through the second half of 2017, and stayed on time and on budget with facility expansions.","Our multiyear value capture plans are on course. And as previously mentioned, we expect to recognize $150 million of the expected synergies by the end of 2017. And balance sheet optimization programs are producing benefits equal to or better than our expectations. Our plans for 2017 and beyond are right on track to capture planned cost savings and grow comparable EBITDA, cash flow, and EVA in all of our businesses.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan.","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","Thanks, John. It's a real pleasure to join the earnings calls and have the opportunity to highlight all the very good work being executed by our global teams. I want to recognize Carlos Medeiros, who moved from our South America operations to replace me here in North and Central America, and Carlos Pires, who took over for Carlos in South America. We have high expectations for both gentlemen and are excited to have them in these new roles.","As John said, we're pleased with our second quarter results. Pro forma global beverage can volumes grew in the quarter. The beverage can is winning in traditional and craft beer, sparkling water, energy drinks, teas and wine, and we're leveraging our industry leadership role to further position the can as the most sustainable package from an environmental, social, and economic perspective for our customers, consumers, and communities.","Our North America volumes grew just over 2%, largely driven by imported beer demand, growth in craft and sparkling water, and consumer demand for smaller sizes of their favorite traditional beverages. And in South America, John and Scott mentioned on the first quarter call that the South America team was feeling much more constructive about the market, and it materialized. In the second quarter, our South America segment volume grew 4%, with Brazil being up in the low single digits and continued growth in other South American countries.","The European business saw growth of approximately 1%, which was in line with industry demand. Demand for sleek cans continued, and our ongoing plant construction in Spain is right on track. We still have much to work on in terms of improving the margins in the business, and it will take some time. However, we have a variety of initiatives, both near and long term, we are executing on that will help bridge the gap between the business we acquired and our expectations for this segment over the next couple years. The \u20ac40 million annualized cost savings from the recent Recklinghausen closures is a very good start, and we have a variety of other initiatives underway to make the business more competitive from a cost and flexibility perspective.","You may have noticed in the release financials that the contribution from our equity investments grew quarter over quarter. The acquired beverage can JVs in Guatemala, Panama, and South Korea, as well as our legacy Rocky Mountain Metal Container JV and our Vietnam investment all performed well in the quarter due to better volume and mix.","We are not without our challenges, including the political and economic unrest in Turkey and Egypt and the carbonation tax in Saudi Arabia that are hurting consumer demand in that region. In the second quarter, our China volumes were flat versus the market growing at roughly 6%. With China's overcapacity situation, Ball has and will continue to exercise a disciplined approach.","Despite these regional challenges, the managers in these regions and the entire global beverage organization is executing at a very high level, and every division is on track to increase the EVA dollars being generated on the invested capital they have employed. Our global beverage sales, engineering, innovation, manufacturing, and finance teams have a roadmap lined with initiatives to leverage our specialty portfolio to existing and new customers, foster best practice sharing and process improvement, and drive innovation while optimizing our plant networks and existing equipment.","In summary, our global beverage business posted strong results, and everyone is laser-focused on keeping this momentum going, meeting demand and effectively managing their invested capital base to drive EVA dollar growth.","We're right on track in the next wave of transformational work to ensure we are fit from a supply\/demand, cost, and flexibility perspective we'll accelerate in the second half of 2017.","Thank you again to all of our teams around the globe. With that, I'll turn it over to Scott.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Thanks, Dan, and welcome to the calls going forward.","Comparable second quarter 2017 earnings were $0.53, which includes expense of $0.04 for the 2017 first quarter catch-up and additional second quarter depreciation related to the finalization of the fair values and useful lives for the assets acquired in the Rexam acquisition versus last year's $0.52, which was right on top of our plan prior to the final acquisition accounting getting recorded.","To keep the update as simple as possible, I would add $11 million of depreciation per quarter and making the offsetting change to segment earnings with $8 million per quarter in Europe and $1 million each quarter in North America, South America, and other for EMEA. Refer to Note 4 of the press release financials for further explanation and catch-up depreciation reconciliation as of June 30, 2017.","Second quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflect the benefit of last year's beverage can acquisition and solid operational performance in both beverage and aerospace. These benefits were partially offset by higher interest expense and a higher share count. Details are provided in Note 2 of today's earnings release, and additional information will also be provided in our 10-Q.","Net debt ended the quarter at $7.1 billion, which is right on top of our plan and a decrease of $300 million since the end of the first quarter, due to strong operational performance and working capital management despite our normal seasonal working capital build. The debt will continue to come down as we move through the back half of the year. At current FX rates and given our euro debt exposure, our year-end net debt will likely trend closer to $6.3 billion, but this will not impede our plan to return value to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends during the second half.","As we think about the remainder of 2017, nearly all of our previously communicated goals remain intact. We expect full-year 2017 comparable EBITDA in the range of $1.75 billion, free cash flow to be in excess of $850 million after spending in excess of $500 million of CapEx. Post-split, the full-year weighted average diluted shares outstanding for 2017 will be closer to 359 million shares excluding the impact and timing of any share repurchases.","Full-year 2017 interest expense will be in the range of $280 million. The full-year effective tax rate on comparable earnings will be in the range of 26%, and corporate undistributed will be in the range of $140 million for full-year 2017. And as I mentioned earlier, year-end net debt could be at the higher end of the $6.2 billion to $6.3 billion range due to the strength of the euro. The cash is really showing up and we feel really good about where we are at midyear.","With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Great. Thanks, Scott.","Our aerospace business reported improved second quarter results, driven by solid contract performance and the continuing ramp-up on new contracts. The team cleared a couple of significant program milestones in some big programs during the quarter. And even though the contracted backlog is down slightly, please don't read anything into that, as the U.S. government has not been making decisions on outstanding proposals as it continues to focus on other priorities and backfill open decision-making positions in the various defense and intelligence communities. Our aerospace business is winning in the marketplace, and we'll see a nice step up in the segment earnings year over year during the second half.","Now as we look forward, we are on track to achieve the financial benefits from the acquisition. Our aerospace business is hiring people at a rapid clip to staff the work won to date, and our food and aerosol team has a mandate to attack costs and improve manufacturing efficiencies to the Ball standards that we expect.","As Scott mentioned, our 2017 comparable EBITDA and free cash flow goals are intact and will be driven by global beverage demand, synergies, and aggressively managing the balance sheet. By 2019, we continue to believe that we can generate $2 billion of comparable EBITDA and in excess of $1 billion of comparable free cash flow.","When we announced our intentions to acquire Rexam, we said that we would rapidly delever, capture synergies, spend necessary growth capital on high-returning projects, and then return our remaining free cash flow to our fellow shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, and that is exactly what we are doing.","And with that, Malika, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. And our first question is from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, your line is open.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Hi, everyone. Good morning, thanks for taking my question and all the details. Congratulations on the progress. I guess I wanted to drill into the guidance a bit to see if there are any subtleties that we should be mindful of over the rest of the year. So I think in the last investor conference, Scott, you said EBITDA would be $1.750 billion-plus. In this press release, it's in the range. And the 20% to 30% EPS growth target hasn't, I don't think, been explicitly mentioned. I'm guessing issues in EMEA, food cans, and obviously the depreciation increase are some factors that are maybe weighing on the guidance. But if you could affirm that or correct anything that's wrong there, I'd appreciate it, and then I had a couple of follow-ons.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Yeah, no, George, I think you have it exactly right. If you look across the businesses and the performance, North and Central America, Europe, South America are all on track, as well as China and aerospace. Food is trailing our expectations, and EMEA is a more volatile region, and right now they're experiencing some tougher times. Given that and the $90 million of additional depreciation and non-yield-related amortization, I think we'll be below that 20% to 30% EPS range that we gave, but above our long-term goals. And our focus has always been on driving cash and EVA dollars, and we're doing great on those fronts. So that's the story, I think you have it exactly.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right, Scott. And, Scott, just you said above the low end of the 20% to 30% goal, did I hear that correctly?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","No. I said below the 20% to 30%, but above our long-term range.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Our long-term goal is that 10% to 15%.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Understood, thank you for that. And then, Dan, I guess welcome to the call as well, some questions for you, to the extent that you can comment. Realizing EMEA is volatile and therefore by definition is going to be hard to project, are you seeing any change in trends early in the quarter that would suggest some improvement? And then to the degree that you've been working on this, how are you finding the company's ability to sell complexity and generate a return from selling the complexity to your customers, any willingness for them to use a more sophisticated and more complex packaging mix in the future?","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","I would say, and I'll ask John to maybe comment on the second part of that. But for EMEA in particular, in Saudi relative to the carbonation tax, we've seen different sorts of tax and different sorts of revenue grabs from governments in the past, and there's always a short-term inflection point until you can work through exactly that impact in terms of substrate mix, pack size, and supply chain or retail prices. And there hasn't been \u2013 here we are, three, four weeks into the third quarter. I haven't seen significant change to what we experienced in June. Keep in mind that tax went into effect basically the first week of June, so it's still very early. But historically, whether it's sugar taxes or anything along these lines, we see the demand profile come back in markets like the Middle East, where we like the long-term and mid-term trajectory.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","And, George, to answer your question about the customers and profit pools, I think that's where you're really going, yes, we continue to see our customers using our containers, particularly on the specialty side, to change the profit pool opportunities that they have in front of them. And whether it's soft drink here in North America, whether it's beer both large and small in South America and even Europe, we continue to see that. And we continue from a \u2013 from our position, we continue to try and push that because I think it's important that we're driving value and volume into our customers, because if we can help them with the price points that they have and improve their profitability, it's better for the can and it's better for Ball Corporation.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, I will turn it over. Thanks very much.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, good morning. Thanks, everyone, just, Scott, one on the cash flow guidance. Obviously, you're getting better working capital. Can you just talk about what exactly has improved along those lines, what your working capital expectation has changed by, and how sustainable whatever those improvements are?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Sure, I think as we move through the year, it's been really fun to see the alignment and energy all of our teams have in getting after, whether it's managing inventories, payable terms, receivables. Having EVA as our primary financial metric is a powerful tool. And if you get people aligned around that and what it means in the different levers you can pull, it's fun to see what our folks, whether it's treasury, sourcing, operations, legal, IT, all working together to drive the improvement. So we're seeing it really across the board, and we're six months into this year and feel better about the cash flow that will show up this year.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Is there any particular bucket that you would focus on, receivables, payables, inventories?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","It really is, Adam, across the board and it's in different geographies and different opportunities. What's exciting to see is leaving no stone unturned. So I think we're going to see nice benefits this year, and more of that will flow into 2018 as well.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","I think just to give you context, let's just focus on the inventory for a moment. The demand side of our business has been good in those three main regions. We have had, as Dan said, some volatility in some of the other regions. But the ability to use our system as a network and the plant floor systems that we've talked about and being able to optimize the days on hand of not only raw coils, but also finished goods, and having better capability, being able to predict the demand profile of our customers, that all helps drive down inventories.","On the receivables, we've done some creative things with some of our customers to help drive the DSO down in there. And then on the payables side, we've been working with our suppliers too, so it really is all across the board.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay, thanks, and just a couple others, one on European beverage margins. If I add back the $16 million of additional depreciation, margins would still have been quite a bit lower than a year ago, appreciating that the asset mix has changed. Were those margins ex the higher depreciation as you were expecting? And if so, why were they so much lower than last year?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Yes, they are in line with expectation. I think we've commented on this. The business that we acquired had a different capability mix and in line with that is a different profitability mix. We're changing both the flexibility and the capabilities in Europe. I think the first step was closure of a high-cost, basically obsolete capability footprint in Recklinghausen. So if you add that back to your first half run rate that we experienced this year, you're getting a lot closer to where we had been historical. And as I said in my comments, we're not done yet. It just takes a little longer given Works Council constraints and things of this nature from a structural standpoint, but we're right in line with where we think.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks, and one just on Brazil. Two of the biggest brewers were both down in the quarter, in one case high single digits, and then one of them said the beer market was down almost 3% in the quarter, yet the can makers and the bottle makers were all up in the quarter. Can you help me understand why there might have been this disconnect between the packagers' volume and the brewers' volume in Brazil?","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","Yes, the actual literage consumption for the brewers was down roughly 3% in the market. And so for us, again, we continue to experience the benefit from substrate penetration on can versus returnable glass. And then depending on which customer you're looking at, they all had a different success story, as they always do from quarter to quarter, just depending on the promotional activity. So we benefited from mix and we benefited from the can and the penetration against returnable glass.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","I'll just add on to that, but Dan raised a very good point because while overall literage was down, we've seen smaller pack sizes on the can go into Brazil at a higher rate than some of the larger sizes, so that's one thing. On the glass, obviously we're not in the glass business. We shouldn't comment on it, but we do know that Dan had said that the can is up while the overall beer market was down.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks a lot, John and Dan. I appreciate it.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi, good morning. This is actually Matt Krueger sitting in for Ghansham. How are you doing today?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Good. How are you?","Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Good, good. I just wanted to ask. How does the recent weakening of the U.S. dollar impact your EBITDA and free cash flow outlook for 2017 versus prior guidance? And then given the lowered EBITDA guidance for 2017, how does this change the timeline for your ability to deliver on the targeted $2 billion in EBITDA for 2019?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Let me just jump out ahead of that and Scott can talk about the euro, but I want to be clear here. A year ago, when we gave out those ranges of free cash flow and EBITDA, we said that if things go our way and we get some tailwind that we're going to be at the upper part of that range. And if we start to encounter some headwinds, we could be at the lower end of the range. We talked about the three largest regions, North and Central America, Europe, and South America, all doing well and on track, and aerospace as well. Where we've been having our challenges, quite frankly, is on the food and aerosol side, where we are down year to date when we expected to be up, and that's not an immaterial amount. We expect it to get better, but we've got to get some giddy-up on the manufacturing side of that business.","And then on the EMEA side, Dan just talked about the 50% carbonation tax in Saudi Arabia. There has been a 40% increase in retail price points in Egypt because of the devaluation. Those are material headwinds to us. And despite that, we still think that we're going to be in the $1.175 billion range on EBITDA. As it translates into cash, it gets down to, you have to look at interest expense and all those things that mutes some of the impact on the euro exchange and a lot of the working capital and just running our balance sheet much more efficiently with this combined organization. That's where we're getting the benefit there. So with that, Scott, if you want to say anything more about the euro?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","No, those are the big drivers. The euro has a bit of a benefit from an operating earnings standpoint, but like John said, it's got negatives too in terms of leverage, interest expense, and other things. So net-net, the business is pretty much in line with what we would expect absent some of the softness that we're seeing in a couple segments, and the performance we're generating is on track and cash flow is ahead.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","And we expect to \u2013 the synergies plans are on track, and we expect to accelerate those plans in the second half, as we said in our earnings release.","Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay, that's understandable and very helpful. And then given all the concern over the Brazilian economy's health, can you describe the South American intra-quarter trends by month for the second quarter? And then how has this region performed thus far during the third quarter?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Typically we're not going to get into that. Quite candidly, I don't think it's helpful because every region has a level of volatility, and certainly South America does when you think about politically what's going on there. But what we've seen is steady progress despite economic and political difficulty down there. As you know, the second quarter and even the third quarter are seasonally slow quarters. And I don't off the top of my head have month to month and I don't think it would be relevant anyway. But the can, we wish it was stronger, quite honestly, but to be up a few percent in a seasonally slow quarter in a place where the economic and political discord continues, we'll take that. It's a little bit better than what we had anticipated six months ago.","Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay, that's helpful. That's it for me, thank you.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Tyler Langton with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, thank you. I just had some questions on the closures. I guess I know you mentioned the \u20ac40 million for Recklinghausen. Could you just \u2013 I don't know if you've given updates for the savings from Reidsville and Charlotte. I think if you could, also just remind us in terms of when the savings from those closures should start to show up.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Both of those facilities closed at the tail end of the second quarter. And as you said, the \u20ac40 million, that's been guidance given. And at our Analyst Day in December, we commented that typically a closure in North America and\/or Europe, if it's a reasonably sized can plant, it's in the $25 million to $35 million range, and it's going to be right in that range.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","For Reidsville?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Correct.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then for those three, in Q3 and beyond is when those savings should start to flow through?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Usually it would be \u2013 because remember, Recklinghausen, for example, didn't stop producing until the end of July. And when you close a plant, there's always a couple months thereafter where you get some kind of cost tail, if you want to call it that. So I would think about Reidsville will get a little bit in the third quarter, a little bit in the fourth quarter. Recklinghausen is probably more fourth quarter, but more importantly it's 2018 and beyond.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And then just South America, and I know the year-over-year comparables aren't great, but I guess margins are strong and equal to the seasonally stronger fourth quarter levels of a year ago. So I don't know if you can comment on what's driving those margins and how you think about them, if they continue to improve as you go into the stronger second half.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","We talked about this before. It's unfair to look at that because it's an apple and a pear, because we have a network now. In the past, we only had several plants, and so the on-season versus off-season fluctuation in margins was greater because when you're spreading your G&A and your fixed costs over a smaller amount of plants, it just becomes more volatile. When you have a network of 13 plants all throughout South America, it becomes a little bit more consistent. Obviously, we just lapped the 12 months of the acquisition, so I think as we go forward that will become more clear as you see looking forward.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great, and then just final question, Scott, just on the working capital. I think previously you said better than $100 million. I don't know if you have any updated forecast for that number.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","It will be better than $100 million, and we think the total free cash flow will be better than $850 million.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right, great. Thanks very much.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","There are a bunch of other puts and takes. That's why I'm not giving you a specific answer.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, thank you so much.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning. Just following up on Tyler's question, I'm wondering if at this stage there are any other footprint optimizations that you're looking at or anything that we could expect going forward there as you look at these markets as they've evolved over the last year or so.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","In December of last year, when we had our Investor Day, we did talk about that we have a multi-year program, Dan, to look at and optimizing our footprint from a cost and flexibility point of view, and none of that has changed. Dan talked about, even in Europe, Recklinghausen allows us to get more flexibility and take a high-cost plant out. We think there are more opportunities like that going forward, and we've also said that our plans are going to be accelerating at this point in time as we go into the second half. And so conceptually, we're continuing to look at these things all the time.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And in the past, you've talked about getting back into the market in the share repurchase program as you get more of a line of sight to the leverage metrics that you're targeting. I guess relative to last quarter's call, has that timing in your mind been pushed out or pulled forward, or is it still roughly the same?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","We always said, as we got better line of sight in the second half of the year, and we're in the second half of the year and I think we have better line of sight, so I would expect it right on plan with what we thought we were going to do before.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay, I appreciate it.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Good morning.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","John, you talked about challenges in U.S. tinplate and the operational headwinds as you transition out of Weirton and start up Canton. Is it possible to quantify how much of a hit those transition costs were in the quarter relative to your initial expectations?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","I'd hesitate a bit because then you play left pocket-right pocket, but what I can tell you is we expected the second quarter to be flat to up relative to year over year, and we were not. And the vast majority of that was related to cost inefficiencies.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, okay. And then at the Analyst Day, you discussed commercial opportunities that could create value in excess of the synergies, and I'm just wondering. In the time since the Analyst Day, as you've spoken with customers, how's the commercial opportunities playing out relative to your expectations? Are there are any early wins that you can point to in terms of packages that are gaining acceptance or a new offering, or is this maybe a little bit more of a longer-term process?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Well, it definitely is a longer-term process. And recall at the Investor Day, what we talked about is \u2013 I mentioned even earlier on this call about profit pools and improving the profit pools. There's a wide variety of ways you can do that. Obviously, different can sizes, price, tighter call-offs, ordering call-offs with our customers. There's a whole host of things.","To answer to your question directly, is on the specialty side, back not six months ago I think we told the world that in North America we were making \u2013 and don't hold me to this \u2013 but approximately 25 different types of cans. We're at 30 now. We're at 30 because we continue to see growth in the opportunities of really differentiating on behalf \u2013 for our customers and on behalf of our customers, I would tell you, so we're having some good success there.","And the standard 12-ounce containers on a global basis, as you know, that's a very competitive spot where we compete with others. We're trying to be leaders in that, but you also have to be realistic, and I think it's much more longer term. As contracts come up, we have to recognize the regional supply and demand and the regional competitive dynamics of that. But on the standard containers, it is more competitive. But as I said on the specialty, we're seeing more and more opportunities. You just have to be a hunter for them.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, that's helpful. I'll turn it over.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning. Dan, I wondered if you could just talk a little bit about what you saw in the second quarter in terms of a seasonal pickup in Russia and the Nordic region. I think when you bought Rexam, you said that there was a more pronounced seasonal pattern there.","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","Yeah, we saw \u2013 and I think we commented in the first quarter, we were slightly down year over year, but it's not a robust quarter in terms of volume in terms of the seasonality. And we were about mid-single digits up in Russia in the second quarter, so right in line or a little bit ahead of where we thought. The business is performing well. They're right on track, really no news to report there.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And then you really hinted at potentially more footprint adjustment in Europe. And I'm always conscious that in a lot of countries in Europe, things are not as flexible from a labor standpoint as maybe we have here in North America. And I wondered if you're seeing any challenges with that that are different than you might have expected.","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","The challenges are consistent with what we've experienced historically when we've done this. I think in my prepared comments, as the market leader, we're constantly looking at supply\/demand balance how we have historically. We're looking at market opportunities because there are parts of Europe that continue to grow. And we've made the comments on our investments in Spain, and we continue to see growth in areas like Russia and Central and Eastern Europe. So we'll continue to make sure that our footprint is fit for purpose to capture the growth and benefit our customers and attack those profit pools, as John mentioned. And there may be changes to the footprint in order to get that.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And then the last question I had, there has been a lot of back-and-forth over the last couple of quarters whether we're seeing any signs of improvement in China, and I wondered if you could comment on that.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","The short answer is there's no facts that we can point to that says there has been meaningful improvement in China in terms of the oversupply situation. I think anecdotally and from a tone perspective, it feels more constructive. But it's premature to declare any kind of victory there. We do know that the can market continues to grow, particularly on the beer side, but you're also seeing more can penetration in alternative drinks, whether it's herbal teas or energy drinks, et cetera. We know that very little if any new capacity has been brought on stream, and so we've slowly been whittling away at that overcapacity.","As we look out several years, it's up to us to be able to try and push some of these new categories because that's going to create the incremental demand that will soak up the excess capacity. So while nothing meaningful has changed as we see it here right now, I think our tone as we look out over the next three years feels a little bit better today than it did say six or nine months ago.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, thanks.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys, a question for Scott. The free cash flow generation for this year is obviously looking pretty strong, and a big part of that sounds like it's working capital savings this year. Do you view the upside of your finding in working capital this year more of a pull-forward from 2018, or are you just finding just a larger basket of opportunities over that three-year horizon you've talked about?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","I think it's probably a bit of both, Phil. I think we've gotten after a lot of different programs, and they're coming to fruition probably a little quicker than what we initially expected, but I think we're also finding broader pockets of opportunity to go after. So I don't think it's necessarily just stealing from 2018 into 2017. I think the total pool will be bigger over time as well.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And I guess on the food can business, did you see any increased competition, because it did seem like you walked away from a little business during the quarter? How should we think about your volume trajectory in the back half assuming a normal pack?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","It's a good question. No, we did not see any meaningful competitive pressure. Let me talk about the volume declines because I think it's important to parse out. There are really three fundamental things that led to the food can declines. Number one, there was some timing with some customers that I wouldn't read into too much. We typically quarter to quarter have timing issues of this, and it actually was a headwind to us in this quarter, but we expect to make it up.","Another one, we have a large customer experimenting with an alternative substrate. And it's premature to say if that's going good or bad and it's not for us to do that, but that really started to hit us. It's not in the traditional fruit and vegetable categories that we talk about, so that was a hit. And I would expect certainly through the balance of this year that we're going to continue in that specific situation that volumes are going to be a bit soft as they experiment with this alternative substrate. And then we have another large customer in the private label area that's been experiencing their own difficulties, which has been impactful.","So what I would tell you is, as we sit here right now, we've got a headwind in a couple of different things, one of them meaning the timing of it I would not worry about, but the other two that we are keeping our eye on. And we expect volumes to be down, but there is no competitive issue relative to other food can suppliers.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Got you. And then just from an operations standpoint, you certainly have some issues. Do you expect to get back on track in the back half outside of volumes on the food business? And longer term, do you need to do more cost takeout, just given the fact that volume has been a little weaker than expected?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yes and yes, and what I mean by that is we were investing in new technology in our Canton, Ohio facility, and that was coming up at the same time that we were shutting down our Weirton, West Virginia facility. And what happened was we ended up not coming up in Canton nearly as fast as we were expecting to or would have liked, and that created the redundant cost. That is largely behind us. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we expect the second half, the quarter-over-quarter improvement to start showing up on that.","In terms of your longer term, this is a business that structurally is not growing, and you have to recognize what it is and who you are. I mentioned that we're running that business for cash, and we continue to have opportunities to take out costs. Let's not forget though, however, even though year to date we're down a little bit, we expect to be up quarter over quarter. The margins in that business are not terrible. It still generates returns in excess of our cost of capital. It doesn't generate returns at our 9% after-tax threshold, but we see a line of sight of being able to get to that. And that's where the additional longer-term cost takeout will continue to occur.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay, that's helpful, and just the last one from me. In your press release, you guys alluded to investing to accelerate synergy capture in 2018 and beyond. Can you just expand a little bit on that? And any color on how we should think about seeing that flow through, is that more of a 2018 event or more of a 2019 event? Thanks.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","I think it's a little bit of both, and I think it's premature to talk about that. I think if you go back and read the transcript of the call in its entirety, you'll get a sense of the various areas we're looking at. We talked about G&A. We talked about footprint. We talked about commercial. We talked about plant floor systems and the operating side of it. So I think it's all \u2013 and we're right on track relative to what we thought. We knew it would take some time, particularly in Europe, as Dan alluded to, on certain initiatives. We knew it would take some time to transfer some of the G&A, and now we're focused on reducing that G&A. And so all the plans that we talked about at this time last year are largely coming to fruition.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay, all right. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Debbie Jones with Ball Corporation (sic) [Deutsche Bank]. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, this is Debbie, and it's actually Deutsche Bank. I wonder if you'd just go back to Europe. I know it's been addressed a couple of times here. And you can put the numbers around the closure, but it seems to me like there's just a lot of opportunity from switching from the Rexam business model to the Ball business model. Can you talk about, now you've had this for about a year, what are the main priorities or things that you need to get done beyond the right-sizing of the footprint that you think can be done?","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","I think there we \u2013 keep in mind, in our legacy Ball European business, we made some investments to create capabilities in line with innovation and customer needs to help attack those profit pools, as John said. I think the historical Rexam business did less of that, and so that's what we're attempting to address in our footprint changes. That's principally the biggest thing is to innovate and have capabilities that are fit for the market and the growth and profit pools.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","The other things obviously we're working on is, as Dan said, from a cost perspective, the optimization of that manufacturing is the most important. But there's a bunch of surrounding G&A that remember back \u2013 Debbie, you'll remember this. Back in 2013 plus or minus at Ball, we went through and we reorganized ourselves within Europe to go from a regional structure where we had four and five pools of G&A to a centralized that had one European G&A. We are doing the same thing right now, and that affects all the back-office support things, and we have a shared center office that we've opened up in Belgrade, Serbia that we're going to be moving a lot of the transactional processing to that, and there's a whole host of other things. But Dan is right. The most important is get the cost of goods sold line right.","Then also the other thing that we haven't talked about which is important the way we think about this is really leveraging the specialty and growing the specialty and creating those profit pools for our customers where we have much more of an emphasis on that than the business we acquired historically did.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thanks. That's helpful. And then my second and last question on Brazil \u2013 or LatAm, you've had this business now for a year. And I think it's been a little hard to determine over on this side the seasonality of that business given its reporting and has before. So could you speak to how the production schedule shifts in the back half of the year? And then part of my conclusion when I look at that is that you should see a higher roll-through if you're getting the synergies in the back half just given that that is a bigger part of the season for you on an annual basis.","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","So it's similar to our previous business. I think we've commented previously publicly that it's a heavier weight to the second half, two-thirds\/one-third. It might be closer to 60:40, but somewhere in that range. So you should expect higher volumes in the second half as the ramp up for peak season, and then the peak season really hits in Q4.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","I think, Debbie, when you look at the seasonality, the business we have now is not different than the business we used to have. It's just bigger, and that's what Dan is alluding to.","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","Yes.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That's fair. Thank you, I'll turn it over.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","All right. Thanks, Debbie.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Folks, I'm sorry. Can you hear me now?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yes, we can.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. So I hit the wrong mute button there. I wanted to just center around two things. First, when we think about \u2013 Scott, you answered earlier getting back into the repurchase element. But my question is if we look at where your long-term targets are, $2 billion-ish of EBITDA should come as a run rate out of 2019, essentially you'll be at your leverage targets as you improve the business. Do you feel like you want to reduce a little bit along the way, or can you essentially shift gears into repurchase mode from here on a go-forward basis?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","What we said originally was that we'll get line of sight to get our leverage down to 3.5 times. That's when we would start buying back stock. So I think you'll see \u2013 we've got more deleveraging to go this year, but we see line of sight to get down into that range by the end of the year, and there will be more cash flow and deleveraging next year. but we'll be opportunistic about it. I saw this morning before I came in here, it looked like it was on sale, so stay tuned.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Chris, I'll just add onto that. Forget about the journal entries of all the accounting that goes around the acquisition. This is a great cash generative business, full stop. Nothing has changed by that, and it's very consistent in terms of its cash generation capability. That's why a year ago we said with confidence that we are going to integrate these companies. We're going to drive the synergies. We're going to flow cash. And in the absence of good investments, and we've had some good investments and will continue to, we're going to give it back. Nothing has changed in that perspective. And we have a line of sight. As Scott said, we said once we have a line of sight that you can look out over the next 12, 18, 24 months in terms of the cash generative nature of this and you see how quickly our leverage comes down.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","I'd say the only thing that's changed, Chris, is we're a year into this and we feel more confident about where we're at and where we're going.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","No, that's fair. Look, the concept isn't that \u2013 we understand that the EBITDA is growing and that's naturally deleveraging. I was just thinking you're trying to absolutely reduce the debt level or not, is really where I was going.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","I think we'll have an absolute reduction in debt, but I think we'll also \u2013 like we've done in the past, because we generate so much cash, we're able to reinvest in our business for growth opportunities. We're able to bump our dividend from time to time, and we're able to buy back our stock, and we see all those things holding true as we move forward.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","That's helpful. Okay, so my follow-up question is around where you are seeing further growth opportunities. On a global basis, it feels like your bev business was up a couple points. You have taken out some capacity in a very targeted location. Where are you at with utilization across other facilities? Have you been able to free up capacity as part of what you're doing with integrating the Ball systems and the Rexam systems, or do you still feel that you see some white space out there to add capacity similar to what you've done in say Mexico or other places \u2013 namely I'm thinking about spots perhaps in Europe or more in Southeast Asia or other places? So could you give us a sense of where you're still seeing targeted opportunities?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Why don't I take that first? You really have to go around the globe. I'll let Dan talk about the opportunities in terms of geographies and where we see future demand growth that can help. But we continue \u2013 as you all know, over the last decade here in North America, for example, we've actually been able to take much of our 12-ounce capacity and capability that was underutilized and convert it to specialty. We're finding that the facilities we acquired, and we knew this, but it's a little bit more difficult to do it in the existing walls of the facilities we acquired. And so we are taking a fresh look, not only here in North America, but also in Europe as well. That's why when Dan talked about Recklinghausen, it was old capacity that was very difficult to convert. That was one of the reasons why we did that.","But you should rest assured that we're going to continue to invest because there is growth even in some of these \"more mature\" markets, that we're going to have opportunities. Because whether it's sparkling waters, whether it's the teas here that continue to grow, energy drinks, even wine, as Dan alluded to, we continue to see good opportunities here in North America and in Europe and outside of that. Maybe, Dan, I'll turn it over to you and let you talk about geographic growth.","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","And so just to follow up on John's comments, when you hear us talk, you're hearing craft beer, you're hearing import beer, you're hearing wine, you're hearing seltzer water. You're talking about categories, so there's growth everywhere. And there will be investments in and around that from an innovations perspective everywhere.","But if you're going to talk about geographic and just overall market growth, Southeast Asia continues to be a very exciting place, a lot of growth there. We've been there. We continue to look at what's the right investment. Obviously, our Myanmar facility is coming online. We've talked about and you've read recently the rebound in the economic situation in Spain. That looks to be a very attractive place for us. Eastern Europe continues to grow. There are other markets that are probably medium and long term that we're consistently evaluating, Africa, sub-continent Africa and other places. What's the right time to get in, and with what customers? Our customers typically lead us into these markets if we don't push them there from an innovation standpoint. And then we've acquired a really big business, a very good business in South America, and the can continues to win in that market.","So there are different aspects of the growth profile. There's substrate penetration. There's overall market growth, then there's profit pool and segmentation growth. So any number of investment opportunities are in front of us. And we like the category. We like the beverage can in the foreseeable future, and it will present a lot of opportunity for us to continue to invest in and grow.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, that's helpful. Thank you, guys.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.","C.A. Dillon, III - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yes, good morning, John and Scott.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","And Dan.","C.A. Dillon, III - Vertical Research Partners LLC","My question has to do with how you guys might be thinking about the euro given its dramatic rise, especially in the last couple months or so. And I guess what you're suggesting is that maybe some of the headwinds you mentioned in a few of the segments might be offsetting any benefit you see there. And then maybe also, Scott, you could talk a little bit about how the currency change may or may not be shifting what you expect from a working capital contribution this year.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","The euro strengthening will help some. It's partially offsetting some of those negatives that we talked about, but it's not a huge impact. And if you look at it from an EPS standpoint, it's virtually no impact because of the debt that we have in Europe, the way we placed the debt. So we actually have less volatility in our earnings per share now than we used to have before the transaction.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","And even \u2013 I'll go a step further. Even if you think about our Russian business, that's fundamentally a dollar-denominated business, and so it's helpful on the margin. But it's also \u2013 you mentioned the steep rise over the last couple months. Who's to say it's not going to reverse itself in the near term as well? So there is some benefit to it. We're not counting on perhaps where it is today, all that benefit showing up, and so there could be a little upside there, but the currency markets just have been very volatile recently.","C.A. Dillon, III - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And then secondly, John, you mentioned that there has been a little bit of chop in the backlog at aerospace, which up to now has certainly seen a pretty good last 12 months when we've looked at the backlog. Do you feel or have you seen any change in tone with your obvious customers given some of the higher emphasis, at least from what I read in the papers, on defense spending?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Well, number one, there has been no chop. What I said in my prepared remarks, just so we're clear, is we had $1.4 billion in backlog and it's off about $150 million or so just because we've been burning that down as we've been working on that work. We haven't been awarded new contracts just because of government priorities. There's a number of senior staff level people that the positions haven't been filled yet, and so that has slowed down and pushed to the right the formal award winnings. But as I mentioned on previous calls, we have more opportunity in front of us than we've ever seen at Ball Corporation with our aerospace business. Nothing fundamentally has changed with the customer, meaning the U.S. government, other than the decision-making in the government bowels, so to speak, has been a little bit slower than it has been in the past.","C.A. Dillon, III - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay, great. Thanks for that clarification.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And our next question is a follow-up question from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for taking my follow-on. First of all, if we think about the food can business, and recognizing it's obviously not the biggest piece of the Ball portfolio when you're running it for cash, it is still not earning your cost of capital. And, John, it has been a source of recurring \u2013 use the word you'd like. The one that comes to mind is disappointment over not just a couple years, but several years. Is there a time at which maybe the strategy there needs to be rethought, or do you really see, A) a clear avenue to getting returns above cost of capital and a great existing fit with your aerosol business? So some thoughts on that would be helpful.","And then the second question I had, Scott, just in terms of corporate, I think you piggybacked or you were talking a little bit about this with Debbie's question. As you look at it, and on the one hand, costs are coming down, but some of those costs are coming out of the business units and being allocated back to corporate. If you were in our seat trying to model that out for the next couple years, are there any guard rails you could give us relative to the $140 million this year? Should corporate come down next year, or does it stay relatively flat because it's basically inheriting costs that used to be at the business level? Thank you, guys, and good luck on the quarter.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","George, let me hit the food business head on. First and foremost, you've got to play the cards that you're dealt. And this is a business that, as you said, let's put this in context. We could have great improvement in that and it doesn't really move the needle at Ball Corporation.","Having said that, we own it, and we've got to the best we can with it unless there is something left to do \u2013 something else to do. We think the best course as we sit here right now is to continue to drive out the costs and continue to run up the cash. We do see a line of sight getting to the 9% after tax. But remember, that really has more to do with our compensation system, so we're well aligned on that. It's generating returns for our shareholders because it's generating returns in excess of our real cost to capital. We are always looking at our business about how to maximize it. Recall that we've been in a variety of businesses, and we've gotten into businesses and we've gotten out of businesses. We just passionate about it, and it needs to perform. We do think there's a line of sight to getting there, and that's the strategy we're currently pursuing.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","And on the corporate undistributed, George, what we're trying to do is drive down total SG&A costs across the company. So you're right, over time some of those costs could move from a business into corporate undistributed, but what we're looking at is the total cost to serve and total SG&A cost. So I can't give you a real great line of sight to what that looks like over the next couple of years, but what we would hope is that we'd drive down the total SG&A cost.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right, thank you very much.","Operator","And I'm showing no further questions at this time, sir.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Okay, great.

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, April 28, 2016.","I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, CEO of Ball Corporation. Please go ahead, sir.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Great. Thank you, Lynn, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's first quarter 2016 results.","The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K, and in other company SEC filings, as well as company news releases. If you don't already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website.","With regard to Ball's proposed offer for Rexam, and consistent with the requirements of the U.K. Takeover Code, we will limit our comments regarding the transaction to: number one, what has already been made public via the 2.7 and other public releases; two, where we are in the regulatory process; and three, an update of ongoing economic hedging and debt activities related to the proposed transaction, including the proposed sale of the Divestment business.","Also note that there may be limitations regarding the depth of our business commentary and certain other items we would normally discuss on our quarterly earnings conference call due to the nature of the proposed transaction. Given the nature of our proposed offer, today's issued press release, webcast and conference calls are advertisements and should not be considered a prospectus. Investors should not make any investment decision in relation to the new Ball shares issued in connection with the Rexam transaction, except on the basis of information in the prospectus and the scheme document, which are proposed to be published in due course.","This presentation and transcription of comments are not for release in whole or in part in, into or from any jurisdiction where to do so would constitute a violation of the relevant laws of such jurisdiction. For more information on Ball's proposed acquisition of Rexam, please visit the offer for Rexam page on ball.com.","Now joining me today on the call is Scott Morrison, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'll provide a brief overview of our company's performance. Scott will discuss financial and global packaging metrics, and then I'll finish up with comments on our Aerospace business and the outlook for the remainder of 2016.","It's been an incredibly busy start to the year. Our first quarter volumes and results from operations were in line with our expectations. The headwinds from a very competitive pricing environment in China, and tough first quarter comparisons in our Food and Household segment, as well as start-up costs from our various capital projects, all that we'd mentioned on our January conference call, played out.","Overall we are pleased with the performance of our businesses, given those headwinds, during a seasonally weak quarter, and Scott will go into more detail on the quarter in just a moment. I'll say, however, that other than China, most of these headwinds are behind us, and we feel momentum building in our various businesses.","Since late January, we have made notable progress to strategically and operationally position Ball for the future, including: signing the agreement for the required sale of the Divestment business; producing cans and ends at our new Monterrey, Mexico beverage facility; the successful groundbreaking of our aluminum impact extruded aerosol expansion in Velim, Czechia, which is expected to come online in early 2017; adding additional customers at our new aluminum impact extruded aerosol facility in India; gaining efficiencies in our new contour bottle line in Conroe, Texas; and our new tinplate aerosol technology in Chestnut Hill, Tennessee; and growing our aerospace contracted backlog, as well as acquiring Wavefront Technologies to further enhance our data and cyber capabilities.","We continue to navigate the highly complex process around the proposed offer for Rexam, while keeping our team focused on things they can control day-to-day to keep our company strong and well positioned for future growth. I again want to thank everyone at Ball for rising to the challenge over the past 15 months, and we feel good about the direction of our company, save for the pricing environment in China, with many of the transitory headwind issues now behind us. Our future is bright, and irrespective of the Rexam transaction, we see meaningful year-over-year improvement through the balance of the year and beyond. We are right on track and the best is ahead of us.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott, for a review of our first quarter numbers. Scott?","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, John. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share for the first quarter 2016 were $0.59 versus last year's $0.69. First quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflect the impact of $7 million in start-up costs, related to our sizable Monterrey project and the new tinplate steel project, as well as anticipated lower volumes in our North American Food business and competitive pricing in China.","The first quarter played out exactly as we said in January, with the re-pricing of our contracts in China, challenging comps in our Food and Household Products business, and the close-out of start-up costs on various capital projects resulting in the first quarter being soft.","Our GAAP results for the first quarter were unfavorably impacted by the economic hedges we put in place to reduce currency exchange-rate exposure associated with the British pound-denominated cash portion of the announced acquisition price for Rexam, and to mitigate exposure to interest rate changes associated with the anticipated debt issuances, also in connection with the cash portion of this proposed acquisition. These economic hedges allow us to lock in the transaction's purchase price economics. Details on these economic hedges are provided in Note 2 of today's earnings release.","Credit quality and liquidity of the company remains quite solid, with comparable EBIT to interest coverage of 5.4 times, and net debt to comparable EBITDA at 3.3 times, including the non-current restricted cash sitting in escrow for the U.S. and euro bond placements \u2013 from the U.S. and euro bond placements. The company has enough committed credit and available liquidity on hand to consummate the proposed Rexam transaction and provide ongoing liquidity for the company.","For a complete summary of first quarter results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis and details regarding the first quarter, please refer to the Notes section of today's earnings release, which includes a simplified table format summarizing business consolidation activities.","Now moving to operations. Our Metal Beverage Americas and Asia segment comparable operating earnings for the first quarter 2016 were down year-over-year solely due to China pricing, a significant swing in China volume, and project start-up costs related to Monterrey. Absent the start-up costs in Q1 in North America, this region was up year-over-year. As we move through the year the cost-out programs in China will reduce the loss in this region, and despite the China headwinds, we will see year-over-year improvement across the segment in the back half of the year, as our Monterrey, Mexico, can plant second line comes online and start-up costs moderate, more than offsetting the impact of China pricing.","Segment volumes in the quarter were up approximately 2%, including mid-single-digit volume growth in North America, low-single-digit volume growth in Brazil, and China volumes being down upper-single-digits as we proactively prune business due to competitive pricing.","European Beverage comparable earnings were up nicely in the quarter due to aluminum premium tailwinds and strong manufacturing performance offsetting slightly \u2013 offset slightly by volumes being down low-single-digits due exclusively to soft export sales to Africa. In fact, excluding such export sales, volumes in the E.U. were up low-single-digits, in-line with the overall market. Industry demand for specialty cans across Europe continues to grow, and industry supply\/demand remains balanced.","Food and Household comparable segment earnings were down in the quarter due to mid-single-digit food can volume declines following the prior-year benefit of certain volumes related to a past food can customer, inventory holding losses, as well as start-up costs related to our tinplate steel aerosol project in Chestnut Hill, Tennessee. We continue executing a disciplined cost control growth equation in this segment, with cost-out initiatives like the announced closure of our Weirton, West Virginia facility versus incremental investments to support continued metal aerosol growth and production efficiencies initiatives in Mexico, Europe and India. These decisions will drive future quarter-on-quarter improvement for 2016 and beyond.","In summary, our Global Packaging businesses continue to be extremely focused on driving EVA dollars from our new capital projects, as we get closer to being able to initiate the next exciting stage in our Global Metal Beverage business. To employees listening on today's call, thank you for all the work on all of these projects. Our business is embarking on its next transformation, which is really exciting stuff, and the collective efforts of the entire team are critical to our shared success.","Now as we look to the remainder of 2016 and reflecting Ball as a standalone company today, here's a snapshot of some key metrics; no real changes here. We expect free cash flow to be in a similar range as 2015, excluding cash costs related to the Rexam transaction, with CapEx expected to be in the range of $400 million and working capital expected to be generally flat year-over-year.","Interest expense is expected to be roughly $145 million, excluding debt refinancing and other costs, and the full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings is now expected to be in the range of 25%. Corporate undistributed is estimated to be in the range of $75 million, a year-over-year reduction of $17 million. And we expect our dividend to remain unchanged from its current level during the proposed acquisition process.","Exactly as we said in January in 2016, we expect all our businesses to be up on a full year basis with the exception of China Beverage Can, with momentum accelerating as we move through the year, particularly in the second half. As we indicated back in January and as we look to the successful closing of the Rexam transaction, we plan to focus our comments in terms of cash EPS post close, due to the large amount of intangible amortization we expect to record for the Rexam transaction.","And with that, I'll turn it back to you, John.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Great. Thanks, Scott. Our Aerospace business reported first quarter results that were relatively flat with last year; however, I'm happy to report that our contracted backlog closed the quarter $100 million higher than year-end, and even happier to report that as of this week, our Aerospace backlog stands at greater than $900 million with even more opportunities for growth during the remainder of 2016. It's taken a fair amount of patience for us to get to this point, and I want to congratulate the entire Aerospace team for their hard work. More exciting, however, is what is in front of us in Aerospace, ramping up on all the new contracts and integrating the recent acquisition of Wavefront Technologies.","Now across the company and as we look forward, we are nearing the end of the marathon we began back in February, 2015, and we cannot wait to step up to the starting line for the sprint to achieving synergies, cash flow growth and the higher EVA dollar generation that all of our investments can provide. As we said, we continue to face headwinds in our China business, although going forward it will moderate. We expect all of our other business units to be up year-over-year and feel momentum building in our business.","Together we are working hard to improve Ball in 2016 and beyond. And we look forward to the hard work that lies ahead. So with that, Lynn, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The first question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Thanks for all the commentary. I guess the first question I had, just from a detail standpoint; I'd missed some of the volume statistics you had relayed regarding beverages. Could you \u2013 beverage cans. Could you quickly go through that? And then, to the extent that you can comment, what effect did you see from weaker beer production in Brazil as it relates to your volumes? And then, a couple follow-ons.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. George, this is John. I think what Scott had said in his prepared remarks, North America was up mid-single-digits, Brazil was up low-single-digits, Europe was down a little bit but that was exclusively because of exports into Africa slowing down. The Continental Europe was actually up low-single-digits, about a point, point-and-a-half, in-line with the overall market. And then China was down upper-single-digits as we proved \u2013 as we pruned some of that very low margin or no margin business.","From a beer perspective in Brazil, you're right, there was some \u2013 there one of the customers did have an issue in one of the facilities. It was a little bit soft, but in our portfolio, our customers, as I said, we were up a couple percent.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks for that primer there, John. Good morning to you. I guess the other question I had, this isn't the first time that China has been a topic not necessarily for the right reasons on one of your earnings calls, and certainly you have company, so you're not the only participant that's had some challenges there. Are you getting to a point where you need to \u2013 recognizing you've been already limiting capital, are you getting to a point where you maybe need to consider other strategic options or strategies in China to improve the performance? And if so, can you provide a bit more color there?","And then last one and I'll turn it over, obviously a lot has changed in the tinplate market over the years, but closing Weirton, how will you manage all the metal decorating and processing that you need for your tinplate business around the rest of the country? Thank you.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, George. Let me talk a bit about China. China is a sore, and there's no hiding from that. It's getting inordinate attention at our company right now. What I'd describe is operationally, we continue to drive a hell of a lot of costs out of the business, in the range of $30-plus million this year alone. The pricing environment is just quite, quite challenging. The only thing I can really say beyond that is strategically we're assessing and continue to assess how to make this a better business. As you all know, we're not in the business to lose EVA dollars, and so it's a very high focus for us.","On the tinplate side, there has been a lot of change in that business. I think the Weirton, West Virginia closure, while unfortunate, allows us to spread a lot of that cutting and coating capability into other facilities, and that's exactly what we're doing. So it's a capacity rationalization play at the end of the day, getting closer to our customers.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thanks. I'll turn it over.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good morning. It is actually Mehul Dalia sitting in for Ghansham. How are you doing?","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good. Thanks.","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good.","Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. It looks like InBev is adding some additional specialty can capacity via their metal container subsidiary. We've seen some other customers do that as well. Are these one-offs or is it basically the customer not being happy with how fast the industry is adding capacity in North America? What are your thoughts on that?","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think what I'd say is Anheuser-Busch InBev have been in the can business for 25, 30 years now. And they have a asset base that they continue to look, we're aware obviously that they're putting bottles in. They're the only one making bottles for themselves. As you know, we actually have a large and very growing bottle portfolio in ours. And so I'm not \u2013 I think these are more one-offs than systematic. And that's how we're viewing it. They're looking at making their own needs for their own capacity.","Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, great. And how much did you spend on start-up costs in 1Q? And how much are you expecting in 2016? And also, can you just remind us how much you spent in 2015? Just trying to see what the delta is year-over-year?","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","In the first quarter, the start-up costs were around $7 million. I think last year they were a little over $20 million. For the remainder of the year, they should start to moderate; we'll still have a little bit of start-up in the second quarter as we get our second line at Monterrey ramping up. But then as we get to the second half of the year it'll moderate quite a bit.","Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, great. Just one last one, acquisition related, if I can. What kind of tax leakage are you expecting from the divested asset startup?","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","We're still in the planning phases on all that, so it's really not appropriate to comment at this point. But there's a number of things, they have some NOLs that we'll take over that will dampen the tax leakage, but right now we're not prepared to give you any specifics.","Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Great. Thank you so much.","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yup. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Tyler Langton with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just of the decline in Americas and Asia, could you break out a little bit what was China? And were the \u2013 of the $7 million of start-up costs, was that all from Monterrey? And was that all in the segment or was there also, I think, some in steel aerosol?","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. The $7 million in that segment is Monterrey. There was also a couple million on the Food side. But \u2013 and all the rest of that is really China. The pricing swing from year-over-year, re-pricing inventories as you come to the first quarter, so you take kind of a double hit. And that's why as we move through the year the loss will moderate and the cost-out actions start to take hold, and so you'll add \u2013 it'll have less of an impact as we move through the year. And then with the investments that we're making that come online here as we move through the year, those will more than offset the China pricing at the second half of the year.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","The investments in Monterrey and other.","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. I'm sorry. Correct.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And then, Scott, did you say, I guess, starting in the third quarter, profits in this segment would be up year-over-year, both in 3Q and 4Q?","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes. That's correct.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then is that \u2013 I mean do you think, I don't know, the second quarter, but could profits for the segment be up for the entire year, do you think?","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, we have to wait and see how volumes shake out. I think it'll be \u2013 there's probably still a little bit of a drag just because again some start-up costs in Monterrey will still continue in the second quarter. It gets closer but then the back half of the year looks meaningfully better.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. And just a final question, Brazil for the remainder of the year, just given your mix and the conditions down there. Any thoughts on what volumes could look like for the year?","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We're starting to go into their seasonally slow period of time and so we, as we said in the beginning of the year, we expected modest growth not necessarily from overall volume but from share mix relative to glass, and we're still seeing that happen. As we enter the seasonally slow, I do think we're going to get a very modest uplift because of the Olympics. Remember, that's just in Rio, but Rio is a very densely populated area, so I don't think our views of 2016 have changed materially at all from when we were on the call in January.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it, great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi, there. John, with everything going on, I think I want to ask you a question about Aerospace. You said, I know on the last call, that I think the backlog was like literally \u2013 it looks like it's grown 50%. It was, what, $617 million. Now it's over $900 million. And I know you gave us some sign that you thought \u2013 some mention of like $800 million in near-signed business, and so the question is, have things really kicked in a little bit stronger than you would have expected three months ago or six months ago for that business in terms of the backlog? And maybe you could comment a little bit on the quality of the backlog, what proportion is fixed price versus cost plus?","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So your first question, has anything changed relative to our expectations? The short answer is, no. You know you always have timing issues of when you get signed because some of it's out of our control when you have to have various government agencies go through their approval processes. We've had some in the first quarter, some in April, as you heard. And even as we expect going into the June\/July, whether it's June, whether it's July I can't tell you right now, but I know that we still have a fair amount of projects that we call won, not booked, which is not in our backlog but we won it, it's just we have to go through the signatory process and the funding process with the government. So nothing has changed on that front.","From a mix perspective, I think I talked about this on the January call, there's not an appreciable difference in the mix relative to fixed price versus cost plus. There could be a little bit more of cost plus in the overall scheme of this new business won, only because a lot of it's new technology, which I think is good. And our folks have been executing very well on those types of things.","So a lot of it's in the DoD, which is both from a satellite perspective, as well as a sensor perspective, and then also in the NASA side, where we haven't done a tremendous amount with NASA because their budget's been so constrained, but we've been able to do a very good job or weave our way back into that and are doing several neat things for NASA as we go forward there.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then just a quick one, a follow-up is on \u2013 I mean look at the guidance items that Scott gave us, whether it is EBITDA, et cetera, there is no change from the last call, and you did mention that things progressed as you thought they would in the first quarter, but maybe a little weaker than what the consensus was looking for. And I guess the question is, does your full-year outlook on the \u2013 is there any reason the EPS \u2013 and again, this is a little bit of hopefully a fiction question because of the change that'll take there in June, take place there in June, but leaving that aside, would your earnings per share view have changed since January? In other words, would there maybe have been a small shift out of the first quarter into the back nine months of the year?","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'll take this and maybe, Scott can chime in. Nothing has changed relative to our expectations. We had said in the January that we expected the first quarter to be soft, given China re-pricing, given the year-over-year comps in Food and Household Products, and then the start-up in the first quarter that, as Scott mentioned a minute ago, would begin to wane as we get into the second quarter and certainly the second half of the year. So nothing has changed from that perspective.","I will say this: it is a bit challenging for us. And I have said this for a year now in our opening comments that given the U.K. Takeover Code, we have certain restrictions on what we can say in terms of profit forecasts. And that does create some challenges for us to be able to articulate and communicate in a way that we normally would do so. So \u2013 but to answer your question directly and to reiterate it, nothing has changed from our perspective.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Philip Ng with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. Glad you were able to reiterate your synergies, but where were some of the upside coming from since the amount of assets being divested is a little larger than I expected? Also, can you talk about some of the working capital savings potential? If we look at the key working capital metric for Rexam versus Ball, there seems to be a pretty sizable opportunity. Thanks.","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, the synergies, they're really the same buckets we've been talking about all along. There's four different buckets: G&A, manufacturing, sourcing and kind of best practices. So those haven't really changed; the buckets haven't really changed either. There's always a little bit of puts and takes but essentially it's the same as we thought 15 months ago when we first started talking about it.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay.","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","On the second part of that question...","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Capital.","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Oh, yeah. The working capital. Yeah, that's obviously one of the areas that we expect to get after right after close. We manage our balance sheet every day of the year. And so that's one area in which we think there can be a meaningful amount of cash taken out over the course of some period of time, probably a year or two.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay, but you wouldn't expect anything structural with the Rexam assets where you wouldn't be able to flex the working capital initiatives you have, legacy Ball, right?","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, again I think we have to stand by what Scott said given the Takeover Code rules.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay, got you. And I guess another question for Scott, how are you guys thinking about leverage longer term? Is there like a threshold you want to keep in terms of 3 times, 2.5 times, going forward post this deal? And how should we think about your ability to buy back stock from a timing standpoint?","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well, I think we're going to lever up here at the close. And it's also kind of the peak of our working capital borrowing season, so it'll be a little bit higher. The game plan is to drive that down closer to three times before we start buying back stock, but because of the asset sale was a little bit larger than what was probably initially thought about, we'll probably get to that leverage \u2013 that leverage area a little bit quicker where we can start buying back stock faster. Longer term, once we get through all of this and get those synergies, then we look at our capital structure. And we'll think about where we want to be longer term.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Very helpful, guys.","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning.","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Is it possible, Scott, to get any sense of just how much the aluminum premiums helped Europe in the first quarter? Those guys really gave you a nice going-away present.","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. It was a little more than \u20ac10 million in the first quarter.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. All right. And then, John, you said really nothing had changed since January, but has the situation in China actually been even worse than you might have expected or weaker than you might have expected?","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, yeah, I said \u2013 what I said is from a financial point of view what our expectations are relative to what's developing (27:59), nothing has changed. The one other thing in China that has \u2013 that was a headwind that we haven't really expressed explicitly was the volumes being softer. Some of that was that we consciously made a decision that we're not making cans for practice. The overall China market has slowed down a little bit. It's still growing, don't get me wrong. But I think those two things create environment where our volumes were down, and that was a headwind in addition.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. The last thing I had, I know you have \u2013 the main focus for you is these start-ups and then the integration of Rexam over the next couple of years, but if you looked a little further down the road, what are the most interesting opportunities if you look two, three, four years down the road in terms of opportunities to create value at Ball?","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","You know what? Let \u2013 if I could ask you please, let's park that until after we close the transaction and then we will make sure that we are going to be very, very much communicative in what we see in terms of the next one, three, five years, both operationally and strategically.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Sounds good. Good luck.","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is a follow-up from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Please proceed.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, everyone. Thanks for taking the follow-up. Two questions again, recognizing it is not your largest segment in Food and Household. Can you comment at all as to whether there's been any adjustment in pricing this year related to things like meat com clauses and that sort of thing or has pricing been relatively stable? Or if it's not, has it been purely just pass-through of metal? Then I had a follow-on. Again, to the extent that you can comment.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. As you know, we run on a pass-through model, and that's really the only thing that's been going on. The pricing environment's been relatively stable.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks for that, John. And then, the last question I have, and back to Weirton conceptually, in the past when we've seen companies adjust their metal decorating footprint, it's a tricky practice and there have been times where capacity have been moved from one facility to another and the initial stages don't go as smoothly as expected. What are you doing now, given, again, all the irons that you have in the fire, in managing the metal decorating process such that when it does come up, the coating, the printing, not that there's a lot of printing done on the food side anymore, but comes up to spec? Thank you, guys, and good luck in the quarter.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, George. You raise a good point. What I will point out is over the last 18 to 24 months we have not been performing well in that part of the business. So as \u2013 in Weirton. And so as a result we've already had to move some things into other facilities. And so that's \u2013 I think most of that's behind us. There's always a level of complexity that when you're taking a facility out and having to redistribute volumes, but a lot of that's already been happening because of the performance in Weirton.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thank you, John. I'll turn it over. Good luck in the quarter.","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, George.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, gentlemen. Just a couple questions for you. One, if you could, I hate to keep coming back to the China and the other piece, but if I maybe try to approach it from the perspective of your segment was down, I think, $23 million year-over-year, if you could give us buckets and maybe size them. Is that a quarter, one-third of that currency? I think you said startups were about $7 million, so I'm guessing that's about one-third of it. Was China the other bucket or how, Scott, would you want us to think about that?","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. No, you have it exactly right. China was the other part of that, both from a pricing standpoint and a volume standpoint. And I mentioned earlier as you had to lower prices, you had to lower the value of the inventory, so that's why you took a little bit bigger hit in the first quarter than what you'll see as we move through the year. And then the cost-out actions will start, we'll continue to gain momentum as we get into the back half of the year. And so for that segment in total, the back half of the year looks better.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, but is it about one-third of the delta? Does that sizing sound right or am I thinking about it incorrectly?","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. No. Yeah, your sizing was right. It was roughly $7 million in start-up costs...","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. I thought I \u2013 the reason I'm thinking about it is I thought I heard you mentioned earlier, too, that you had about $30 million of costs you have been taking out in China, and that just sounded like a really, really big number.","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","It is a big number. That's a full year number. That wasn't for the first quarter, that was for the full year. But as I said, the unfortunate thing is that we've been making a lot of great progress in our North American business and in our South American, Brazilian business. And it's being masked by China. That is why I said that operationally we are driving the hell out of the costs there because we've got to get our costs as low as possible; but then strategically we have to assess how we make this a better business.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right, so the $30 million of costs-out is a reference for the whole segment?","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","For the whole year for China.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","For the whole year, for China. Okay. That's incredibly impressive.","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. Our folks are doing a heck of a job. It's just disappointing that the pricing environment is so bad.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, no, that's very impressive for the size of the business. If I could switch gears a second and talk a little bit about Mexico, I know you've got a number of customers tied to the plant and the multi-lines you're sticking in there. But one of the \u2013 probably the biggest one in the region I think you're tied to is experiencing some delays, we have read, in bringing the brewery up online. How does that or does that change anything with respect to what you're doing in bringing capacity on stream? Do you still provide the cans regardless of who is brewing the beer or how does that process work?","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. No. Let's put this in context. They're not experiencing delays; they're growing so fast that they can't keep up with their demand. That's what's happening. And so as they build out their existing facility and they've announced a new facility, we are supplying them a significant amount. I forget their growth rates, not only as beer, which is very strong, it's the fastest-growing beer company I think in the world right now, but then they are underweighted to cans. And so there's a double benefit for us. And so our business is going as fast as they can take them.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So perhaps, I know you have got one line in now. I think you're starting a second. I think you may have sized it for three. Is there a reasonable opportunity to build that the whole way out in the next 12, 18 months?","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","We believe there is. And we'll talk more about that when we can.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. That's the last of my questions. Thanks, gentlemen.","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Chris.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Mr. Hayes, it appears at this time that there are no further questions on the phone lines.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Great. Well, thank you. Thank you all for listening in. And as we've said, we look forward to speaking to you later on this summer in a much more earnest conversation.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Thank you and have a good day."],"2890":["Ball Corp. (NYSE:BLL) Q3 2016 Earnings Call November  3, 2016 11:00 AM ET","Executives","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Scott C.

Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Kyle White - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Ball Corporation's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Call.","As a reminder, the call is being recorded, Thursday, November 3, 2016. And I'd now like to turn the call over to Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, John Hayes. Please proceed.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Great. Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's third quarter 2016 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied.","Some factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings, as well as company news releases. If you don't already have our third quarter earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com.","Information regarding descriptions of our new segment reporting and the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the notes section of today's earnings release, which includes a simplified table format summarizing business consolidation and other activities, as well as a reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations.","Joining me on the call today is Scott Morrison, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. And if we sound a bit tired, we are. The Chicago Cubs won the World Series, baby. Dreams do come true. I'll provide a brief overview of the company's performance. Scott will discuss financial and global packaging metrics. And then, I'll finish up with comments on our aerospace business and the outlook for the future.","We're pleased that the new combined business, as well as our existing businesses, are right on track versus our expectations and the anticipated earnings momentum has continued to materialize, particularly in beverage and aerospace.","Upon the close of the acquisition, we discussed that the second half of 2016 might be a bit choppy from an earnings and cash flow perspective due to one-time integration costs, but that we felt confident as we went into 2017 that we'd be able to generate comparable earnings and cash flow that we discussed for both 2017 and beyond. This is exactly how it is playing out and we continue to expect to achieve all of the 2017 to 2019 financial metrics and synergy goals we laid out on our prior earnings call.","During our initial review of the new locations, we welcomed our new team members into the Ball culture and experienced a smooth integration to date. Where we have recognized the need for minor changes from a personnel or policy perspective, actions have been taken or are well underway.","In the coming months, we will focus on securing the appropriate value for our products, while fighting for our proportionate share of the volume. And at the same time, we'll be chasing the value capture opportunities in sourcing, freight, logistic and footprint optimization, as well as ongoing cost-saving initiatives like the closure of the London and Charlotte offices.","Certain work from these locations has already begun to migrate to other Ball locations and Ball will exit the Millbank office by December 2016 and close the Charlotte office in the first half of 2017. We thank the Millbank and Charlotte teams for their support during this integration. Future announcements regarding other changes will be made when decisions are finalized.","In addition to the complex integration and separation work, during the third quarter, we continued ramping up line speeds at our new Monterrey, Mexico beverage facility. We shipped and invoiced salable cans from our new Myanmar facility late in the third quarter. We continued the previously-initiated European beverage cost-out initiatives, including the closure of the Berlin, Germany beverage can facility that was announced in December of 2015.","We achieved solid operational performance in our food and aerosol business despite depressed U.S. food can demand in the period, and we further grew our aerospace contracted backlog to a record $1.4 billion. It was an incredibly busy and rewarding quarter.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Mr. Morrison. Scott.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Thanks, John. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2016 were $0.96 versus last year's $1.10 on a higher share count and a higher year-over-year effective tax rate.","Third quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflect year-over-year improvement, largely due to the beverage can acquisition, solid global beverage can demand and improved aerospace performance, offset by higher corporate costs related to truing up our employee compensation accruals, the extra expense for stock plans due to the run-up of our share price, as well as some pension expense for inactives not tied to a continuing business segment, higher interest expense related to the timing of the Rexam debt payoff, a higher share count and tax rate.","Our GAAP results in the first nine months were impacted by transaction-related earnings, hedging, purchase accounting and other customary closing adjustments. Details are provided in note two of today's earnings release and additional information will also be provided in our 10-Q, which will be filed next week.","Our beverage packaging North and Central America segment, which comprises 17 legacy Ball facilities, plus the nine acquired facilities, including joint ventures, had comparable operating earnings for third quarter 2016 that were up year-over-year due to the contribution of the recently acquired plants in the U.S. and Mexico and continued specialty can growth.","Industry demand across North America grew 1.5% in the third quarter, and on a comparable basis, Ball was in line with the industry during the quarter. Our new Monterrey, Mexico facility continues to make production strides and Mexican domestic and export demand remains strong.","Of note, the recently acquired JVs in Guatemala and Panama, as well as our legacy Rocky Mountain Metal Container JV, are not consolidated and therefore are included in equity earnings of affiliates.","Our beverage packaging South America segment, which consists of the 12 acquired facilities, plus two legacy Ball facilities, recorded a solid third quarter as can demand in Brazil gained traction in the quarter in part because of the seasonal summer build. Brazilian market demand, as well as our volume in the quarter, was relatively flat and down 2% year-to-date. Both Brazilian and Argentine can demand has been impacted by the inflationary environment in those countries.","The team in South America is managing the business well, given the current economic and supply-demand conditions in the region. The beverage packaging Europe segment results, which include Russia, were up nicely in the quarter due largely to the acquisition and strong can demand in Russia during September. Industry supply-demand remains tight and specialty demand remains favorable with a bias towards continued shift into specialty.","As we mentioned in today's release, Ball chose to retain certain volumes in Spain, which will be supplied from a newly constructed plant near Madrid. This investment is supported by a long-term customer contract that was known to all parties prior to the divestment occurring and the plant will help to provide supply to a region that is experiencing sustainable growth.","Beginning in the third quarter, our new segment reporting incorporates the operating performance of Ball's legacy China\/Asia business and the acquired EMEA business into other, which also includes the legacy corporate undistributed costs. For clarity in going forward, we will include a footnote in note two of our earnings release financials referencing the amount of corporate undistributed costs included in other.","Of note, the UAC JV, 51% investment, is consolidated and is also reflected in the other segment and the 49% outflow is reflected in non-controlling interest. While I have the opportunity, our team in China is doing everything they can, given the challenges they are faced with. They have met their cost-out goals and the team in EMEA is fitting right in at Ball.","The markets are dynamic like the currency situation in Egypt and we have great teams in both regions managing the businesses appropriately. Food and aerosol comparable segment earnings were flat year-over-year due to lower food can volumes, offset by continued growth in global aerosol. Initiatives to further improve production efficiencies are on track and set to benefit 2017 performance.","In summary, our global packaging businesses posted results that were right on top of our expectations and the teams continue to be extremely focused on integrating the new assets, achieving their synergy goals and driving EVA dollars from the recent capital and efficiency projects.","Thank you again to our global packaging team members, as well as the corporate support teams. Your collaboration and dedication is appreciated. As I mentioned on the second quarter call, we will identify all one-time items impacting free cash flow and operating earnings so that the underlying strength of the business is clear.","You'll notice that our third quarter net debt, as expected, is about $400 million higher than the pro forma $7 billion net debt reflected in our second quarter earnings release. During the third quarter, we paid out $110 million in severance and incentives to divested and separated employees, $90 million to settle Rexam's derivatives, $65 million in advisor, attorney and banker fees, $50 million in tax payments, a July 1 $50 million bond interest payment, and we spent $125 million in CapEx.","Obviously, there were offsets like third quarter EBITDA and the French sale proceeds. We are on target to flow a lot of cash in the fourth quarter, which is typical. We obviously had a working capital build from the acquired locations, and as we said before, it will take time to address how Rexam manages its balance sheet versus how we will manage ours.","Regardless, we still target year-end net debt in the range of $7 billion at current FX rates. As we think about the remainder of 2016, here are some key metrics. We expect full year 2016 comparable operating earnings in the range of $1 billion. And to be clear, our comparable earnings going forward will exclude the amortization associated with acquired customer intangibles, which should be roughly $33 million in the fourth quarter.","Since the $83 million inventory step-up was recognized in the third quarter, I wouldn't expect any additional inventory step-up impact in the fourth quarter. The full year weighted average diluted shares outstanding for 2016 will be in the range of 161 million shares, which reflects the half year impact of the 32 million shares issued for the acquisition.","For Q4 2016 and full year 2017, weighted average diluted shares outstanding will be roughly 178 million, absent the impact of any share repurchases.","Full year 2016 interest expense will be in the range of $230 million. Given the negative carry associated with the timing of when the acquired credit agreement, private placement and hybrid debt came out, third quarter interest ran about $8 million higher than it will in the fourth quarter. The full year effective tax rate for 2016 on comparable earnings is expected to be in the range of 28%.","Corporate undistributed is now expected to be in the range of $115 million for full year 2016 versus the $105 million we discussed in the second quarter call. The $115 million now includes costs to support the integration from locations such as Millbank and Charlotte, as well as a true-up for our employee compensation plan accruals that we'll pay out to current Ball employees in early 2017, and the impact of known pension expense for inactives in the U.S. and abroad, which will migrate to corporate undistributed in the near-term.","To be clear, these are not unanticipated costs. It's more about where we have now determined the costs will be reflected from a reporting perspective.","Before I turn it back to John, we have received a few questions to provide a detailed bridge for 2016 to 2017 and we ask that you recall what we said in our second quarter call. We will not be posting a slide every quarter.","For now, we just remind you that in 2017, we still expect to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion of comparable operating earnings due to value capture savings in the areas of sourcing, manufacturing, logistics and other areas like footprint; 1 billion more units through our new Monterrey plant; cost-out benefits from the F&A metal service center transition; as well as additional global aerosol and specialty beverage can growth; improvement in aerospace and the full year impact of the acquisition.","And by 2019, we aspire to be generating $2 billion of comparable EBITDA and generating in excess of $1 billion of comparable free cash flow. Our December investor field trip will also provide another chance to add to our messaging and engage in Q&A about our progress.","And with that, I'll turn it back to you, John.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Great. Thanks, Scott. Our aerospace business reported improved third quarter results driven by solid contract performance. Congratulations to the entire aerospace team. Their hard work paid off.","Our contracted backlog closed the quarter at a record $1.4 billion, which is a 129% increase since the beginning of 2016. As I mentioned last quarter, we're ramping up and staffing up for these new contracts, which will benefit the remainder of 2016, and more importantly, beyond.","Now, across the company and as we look forward, we're on track to achieve the numbers that Scott just laid out. Every day we gain even more visibility into the opportunities before us and while there are always challenges, the team is up for proactively managing these.","In summary, I'm proud of what our team has accomplished so far. Everyone has taken to heart what it means to behave as a true owner. We all know there is much work still to be done and we're focused on our balance sheet, cost-out, footprint, supply-demand balance, supply chain and innovation. Advocating for the beverage can versus other substrates and improving the value generated for the products we sell are things we embrace as an industry leader.","As I mentioned in my introduction, our financial goals and aspirations for 2017 and beyond remain the same. And when our leverage gets to the range of 3 to 3.5 times, we will return value to our fellow shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends.","And with that, James, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Please proceed.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning and congratulations on the Cubs.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Thank you.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Scott, just a couple of questions on guidance. I think you talked about full year operating earnings in the range of $1 billion. I think previously you had said just north of $1 billion. Is it possible to size that delta, if there is one and what's driving it? And then apologies if I missed this, but with the previous CapEx guidance of $500 million, or around $500 million, did that include the Madrid expansion?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Sure. On the $1 billion, it's dynamic, obviously, but if things go well, if volumes go well, we could exceed $1 billion. If things are a little lighter and softer, we might be a little bit short, but I don't think it's a gigantic range. And then as it relates to the capital, yes, one of the things we had planned for some time now is the expansion in Madrid. So in that $500 million for next year is a good chunk of that to build out Madrid.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. And then, John, in your comments, you talked about fighting for a proportionate share of volumes. I'm just wondering if you could talk generally about the commercial environment that you've seen since the closure of the merger. Have you seen share shift or a significant change in customer inquiries? If you can just kind of talk generally about the commercial environment?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yeah. Nothing out of the ordinary is what I'd say. As we have moved forward, we have talked about this before. We have some new muscles in terms of our relative position and we're developing those and trying to flex them. As I did say in our prepared remarks, we are trying to get value for the products we deliver and we've had discussions with our customers, like we always do. As we mentioned in prior times, we're very much customer-focused and some of those discussions go easy, some of them are challenging at times, but there's nothing appreciable that's out of the ordinary.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay and then maybe just one last one. Is it possible to say what level of working capital benefit is baked into the 2017 free cash flow target?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","There was about $100 million of working capital benefit for 2017...","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","... in the numbers we previously gave.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Thank you. I will turn it over.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Adam Josephson from KeyBanc. Please proceed.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. John, Scott, hope you're well. Scott, just one more on the 2016 comparable earnings target. It seems like corporate is $10 million higher than you were expecting before. Is food and aerosol any lower \u2013 is your expectation any lower now than it was before and have any other particular buckets changed?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Well, I think, to the first point on the corporate undistributed, it's not really that it's higher. It's just in a different bucket than the one we previously had anticipated. What we're going to do with some of the pension costs going forward is, if they weren't related \u2013 we've retained some of the German pensions, for example. And so next year, we'll move some of the German costs for those pensions into corporate undistributed because they really don't relate to the business. So it's really more of just where we're reporting those numbers. It's not really an increase in cost.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","As it relates to the second part, food had a little softer quarter in the third quarter, but I think the fourth quarter should be okay, and so that plays into the number. Like we said, it's a big business that we're getting our arms around and I think doing really well. We just want to make sure that we're clear. And could there be a little variability to that number? Yeah, I think there could.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","But just to be clear \u2013 no, I hear that, Scott. Just to be clear, on a segment basis, have your expectations changed for the full year?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","No, not at all. Not for this year and not really for next year. If anything, we're 120 days into this and I think we're more excited about the opportunities that we see in front of us.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks for that. And just a couple others, one on the aforementioned food can business. Can you guys just talk about the volume decline that you've experienced and what drove that and the extent to which you think it's one-time or that it won't recur for several more quarters?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yeah. Well, as we said I think in our earnings release, Adam, it was really just two things. Number one, the salmon business, as you know, that has over time been a pretty volatile business and it was a poor salmon harvest this year. So that was definitely one of them.","The other one was just in our existing customer base, the demand side on the customer didn't perform as well as we had thought. We've talked in the past that we had some share shifts, but that had nothing to do with \u2013 in the quarter. It was just a little bit softer. Some of it bled over into October, but we don't expect October to be meaningfully different than it was last year. And so I just think it was a little bit softer harvest than we had expected.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks, John. And just one on South America, you talked about the market being relatively flat. Do you have any reason \u2013 and obviously some of your large customers have expressed disappointment about the market of late. Do you have any reason to expect a change in market demand in the foreseeable future? And relatedly, do you have any thoughts about the potential for additional capacity to be added in that market as demand remains fairly sluggish?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Well, as you know, the Brazilian economy has been challenged economically, so I will start with there. I do know that can, however, continues to perform relatively well overall. For example, overall beer volumes were down a couple percent in the quarter and the cans were flat, which means it continues to take share from other substrates.","I think as we go forward, we continue to expect that. I do think that some of the reforms that Brazil is pushing through gives better confidence over the longer term in terms of the economy improving and the middle class growing, which is real important, as you know, for overall beverage consumption.","There has been discussions about new capacity coming on. It's reasonably tight right now. So as I said on the call last quarter, we're certainly aware of that. We don't think there's going to be any appreciable dislocations because Brazil does have a lot of embedded growth. They're just going through some short-term economic pain.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks very much, John. Best of luck.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tyler Langton from JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes, good morning, thanks. Just had a question in terms of the $150 million of synergies you're looking for 2017. Do you have a rough sense on how much the closing of Millbank and then Charlotte would contribute towards that?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","I think what we said on last quarter, nothing really has changed. Millbank between those two things, we had $70 million, $80 million of costs in that range and we expect to get most of it out. We'll have a little bit because there is some incremental support that's required for all those acquired facilities, but I think what we talked about was $60 million, $70 million of total cost that we expect to be able to get out of that.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then just, I guess, with South America, the new margins that you reported this quarter were a decent amount above year-ago levels, which were sort of your older assets. And in Europe, it's kind of the opposite, the margins now with, I guess, the Rexam assets were lower than yours. Can you just talk high level what's driving those changes? Is it businesses or is it any sort of one-time items? Just some color there would be great.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yeah, first, I caution not only with both of those, but with all of them, the comparability, if you want to call it that, of these segments is a little apples and oranges just because you're comparing a legacy Ball business, much of what you just described in South America and more importantly in Europe, we divested. And so that's the apple and then the pear or the other fruit is what we have going forward.","Having said that, I would say in South America, we have \u2013 as we've talked before, it's a good business with a great management team. We've got scale, which is real important there. And when you have a footprint that you can leverage in a way much greater than we were able to with kind of three facilities, you can see some of the benefit.","I do think in Europe that there is some opportunity. Our business \u2013 our legacy business margins were a little bit better than the business we acquired. We knew that going in. There were no surprises there. And so our opportunity in some of the cost-out that I mentioned, whether it's Berlin or whether it's some other things, we think there's opportunity, again, because of the scale of the business. It's a bigger business than we've either had. So over the next couple of years, we expect to drive continued improvement in the European segment.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. And just last question, again, within sort of food and aerosol. I think a couple quarters ago, you commented that it was your goal basically to get EBIT in that segment back to where it had been historically. Is that still a reasonable goal in your view?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yeah, I think it is a reasonable goal. As I said, we're a little bit softer in the third quarter, but other times, sometimes we're a little bit stronger. I think as we look forward, what we talked about before in terms of the service center realignment that's going on that we're going to get the benefit of 2017, we're investing in the Czech Republic to grow the impact extruded side of that business that's going to come on stream late this year, early next year.","We have a new plant in India that up until recently really hasn't even been generating anything because it was in startup mode. And then, we've invested in the UK in terms of impact extruded. That combined with just the overall continued growth, for example, in our Mexican impact extruded says that over the next couple of years, we expect to be able to get in the range of where we had been before.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks so much.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Scott Gaffner from Barclays. Please proceed.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Good morning.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Just going back to South America for a couple minutes, just to clarify a couple things. I realize we're comparing apples and oranges here, but there was a pretty significant delta on the margins in the legacy Ball facility versus what you did acquire. And this is kind of our first look into some of the margins in that market. Is it really just a scale issue? I heard you mention that as being one of the big drivers or is there anything else that made the margins between those two businesses different?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","As I said, scale is real important in this business. And just, for example, we had G&A that supported three plants. We don't have that much more appreciable G&A that's supporting 13 plus plants in that region. And so that's just one example of it. There's many others we can give, but scale is important in our business.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","But also remember, Scott, last year in the third quarter, we had a pretty tough quarter. So you're comparing something that was unusually low too, so you've got to be careful with the comparisons.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Yeah, that's a fair point, Scott. I appreciate you highlighting that. And then, one other on South America, it sounds like one of your larger customers recently talked about reinvesting in glass bottles for off-premise consumption. And I realize that can continues to take market share in the long run, but are you seeing anything in the near-term just given the macro environment where you're seeing maybe a shift back towards glass in the near-term? Is that something you're seeing?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","No. As I said, for example, in the third quarter, can continued to gain share relative to glass and we are entering the summer, so \u2013 and it's still early in their summer season, but so far so good. But we haven't seen any appreciable change from the trends we've talked about previously.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. One last one for me. John, you mentioned this a couple of times. You talk about securing appropriate value for the product and some of that was prefaced on sourcing freight and logistics, but I got the sense that maybe you feel like maybe that you've not been getting full value for the product over the last couple of years maybe because of competitive dynamics or something else in the market. How should we read that commentary?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Read it as exactly what the words that came out of my mouth. We think that the beverage can is the most sustainable package from an economic perspective. And while at the same time, we want to make sure we're getting paid for our innovation efforts. And we put a lot of effort and energy into the specialty can size and growth and development of not only the can itself, but the market itself. You think about the aluminum bottles, you think about the service that we provide, you think about the quality we provide, and my comments stand on their own two feet.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","And the complexity of the business is way different. We need to make sure that we're getting paid appropriately for that complexity.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yeah. I mean, another example on that is, given the retail environment, there's a lot of movements and shifts in terms of in and out packages. And so when you contract on a standard 12 ounce can basis and you have long runs, it's changing today. So that's just another example of how we've to modify our muscle memory to reflect the current realities.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Sure. I really appreciate that. I guess one follow-up on that. You can see from some of the customers, they're able to significantly \u2013 up-charge significantly from a customer perspective with some of these new can sizes. For instance, moving from a 12 ounce to a 7.5 ounce doesn't just get you \u2013 on the CSD side, doesn't just get you more per ounce for the beverage guys, it actually gets you more on the total dollar amount. I mean did they recognize that value as well or not?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yes. Look, let me attack it a little bit different way. When we're able to help our customers grow their profits and grow their profit pools, there's greater money to go around. What we try and do is actually make the can the most sustainable package and make it to become the most profitable package for our customer. That's our aspiration, because if we can do that, that's what we mean about being the most sustainable package in the beverage world.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. I do see a lot more cans in other things like sparkling water these days.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","There we go.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So it's interesting to see the growth. I appreciate it.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","One customer at a time.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ghansham Panjabi from Robert W. Baird & Company. Please proceed.","Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good morning. It's actually Mehul Dalia sitting in for Ghansham. How are you guys doing?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Good. Thanks.","Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Just piggybacking off of that last question in terms of value capture, is there a particular region where you feel value isn't up to par or is it just broad-based across your entire portfolio?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","No, generally speaking, it's broad-based, but specifically when you think about the greatest amount of changes in terms of the package sizes, shapes, those types of things, I would certainly say Europe and North America.","Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, makes sense. Thanks. And then, can you give us some clarity on your expected synergy on a run rate by the end of 2016? I know you guys gave \u2013 you reiterated your 2017 and 2019 targets, but just what you guys expect to achieve by 2016 on a run rate?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Yes, we never gave a number for 2016. We gave a 2017 number. So we have lots of plans in place, a lot of things that are progressing as we expected. And that's why we're reiterating the number for 2017. It's the same as what we told you a couple months ago.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yes. For 2016, as we said before, the second half of 2016 is as much about getting after \u2013 from an integration point of view, getting after those cost synergies that we're able to deliver on in 2017. So you shouldn't expect too much in 2016.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Yeah. There's probably a little bit of drag actually in 2016 as we get after some of that stuff.","Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Makes sense. Just one last one and relatedly, has there been an impact on synergies from the recent pound devaluation? And if so, how are you offsetting that to stay at your targets?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Our pound business actually isn't that big. And then today, the UK Court said the vote for Brexit was illegal and that Parliament has to vote, so the pound popped. So it's a dynamic world.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yeah. And remember, the UK business as a percent of our revenues is south of 5%, so it's not a big driver.","Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America. Please proceed.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Everyone, good morning. Thanks for all the details and congratulations on the closing, and again, also on the Cubs. I guess my first question, Scott, I forget if you mentioned it, the cash costs associated with the integration, has that changed at all, or is that very much on track with your expectations for both 2016 and 2017? Has there been any change in the timing there of?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","No. No real change, George. Everything that we expected to happen in the third quarter post-close is exactly what happened at the costs we anticipated. And as we look into 2017, and any actions we might take there, none of those costs have changed.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks for that. I don't think you could provide a lot of detail and clarity on this for various reasons, but could you give us some qualitative view on how customer specialty did by region within your business?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","I'm sorry. You said specialty?","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, correct.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yeah. Yeah, let me just quickly try and go through it. I think the overall trends that we've talked about really haven't changed at all that much. And what I mean by that, in North America, we continue to see \u2013 on a pro forma basis, again, you have to keep that in mind, but we were up high single-digits in the United States and North America, that segment.","In Europe, I don't have the numbers off the top of my head, but as we talked in our prepared remarks, there continues to be a bias towards specialty. And so that's been growing at a faster rate than the standard containers. And then, when you go into other regions, whether it's South America or even Asia, you're continuing to see specialty can growth higher and in the case of Asia much higher than you are standard containers.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Appreciate that, John. One thing I wanted to ask, Scott, is the Madrid plant. Can you provide a little bit more color? I think you said it was an existing contract you had that you elected to keep and you're building this new facility. If there's any more commentary you could share around it. I forget if you said how large the facility was going to be. And then I had one last follow-up before I turn it over.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Sure. This is a customer we've been selling to for a while. We were servicing them out of another plant that was outside of Spain in the old Ball legacy business. During the process of working with the EC, we kept that particular contract, which was a long multiyear contract, way beyond five years, which is the anchor tenant of all that volume.","It'll initially \u2013 the plant will come up in 2018 with one line and then another line added after that. And so a vast majority of it is contracted and then the Spanish market continues to be one of the better markets across Europe and so we'll be able to grow with that market.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. Thanks for that, Scott. As you think about Mexico, given the potential for various outcomes post-election, is the way you're planning for that business to progress or develop, or for that matter, the way your customers are planning, has any of that changed over the last six months relative to where we are right now? And then, I don't know if you have a quick update on Chinese pricing and the outlook for 2017, but I figured I'd throw that in there? Thank you, guys. Good luck.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","All right. Why don't I tackle Mexico right now? No, no changes. As you know, we make in Mexico and sell in Mexico. Now, the finished product is often exported in the United States, but it really plays into the broader demographics that's going on there.","I think you're intimating what happens in the election. I think it's premature to speculate there, but I \u2013 it's challenging to think that there is going to be meaningful changes in domestic consumption here in the U.S., given the demographics that have gone on, certainly in the next few years. So we don't see any change based relative to where we were six months or even a year ago.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","But would you consider maybe tightening up the cost structure if currencies further devalue? I guess that was part of the question.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","The cost structure is really \u2013 we've pretty much inoculated ourselves from Mexican currency swings because it's really a dollar-based business.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thank you for that.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Yeah, so no change. (36:36)","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yes. Then in the China market, we're right in the early part of the throes of the annual price negotiations. As you all know, we took a big step-down last year. Relative to our expectations, we still think there's oversupply in the market. We still think it's challenging. We also know that a lot of can makers that are publicly traded over there have publicly expressed that they are quite challenged in the market.","So I think it's premature to determine exactly what's going to happen, but we've taken a ton of cost out in that business in 2016. We have further plans to do that and we kind of think we've hit a low point. But having said that, it is early November and the pricing discussions haven't been finalized.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you, guys. Good luck. Congratulations on the progress.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Thank you.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chip Dillon from Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","Hi. Good morning, John and Scott.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Good morning.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","First question is, I guess we really appreciate the detail and it's pretty noticeable that if you look at the first half results in Asia, they were \u2013 actually, it looks like negative $13 million. And of course, that's just legacy Ball. And then, in the third quarter, they shot up to $22 million, as you indicated. Interpolating from the other line, of course. I didn't know if all of that improvement was Rexam or are there other moving parts?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","No, if you looked at the Asia business alone, we took a big hit in the first quarter. We had inventory revaluation down, which was a big impact in the first quarter. So the first quarter was particularly rough. It has progressively gotten better, as we've gotten the cost out too. Remember, we had a pretty significant cost-out plan and that has matured through the first quarter into the third quarter and that's why sequentially we've gotten better as the year has gone on.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yeah, but I think to answer your other part of the question, the other remember also includes EMEA and that is a profitable business. So we've made a lot of good progress in China, but don't \u2013 I think you're intimating it went from negative $13 million in the first half to positive $22 million.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","That's right, that's right.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","Yeah. And then actually to be fair, it was positive $15 million in the first half of 2015, but I appreciate that answer about the first quarter. That's right. And the other thing that really sticks out, of course, is the margin that we see in South America and how much better it looks like, at least it appears to be at with the Rexam assets. And of course, that's even with a little bit of a hand tied behind your back with the stepped-up depreciation. I'm sure there's a little bit of that. And is that all of it? Was it just the differential in the businesses you acquired versus what you had before? And I guess there was a divestiture maybe in there as well. And is this sustainable, this sort of 18% to 19% EBIT multiple we saw in the third quarter?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Remember, what you're comparing to was a really soft quarter in our legacy business in the third quarter of last year. So you're really not comparing \u2013 making a fair comparison. But the business that we acquired is a much bigger business that has a lot more scale and is a very well run business. Now, where the margins go over time, we will see. But it's a good business.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yes, the other thing, as you all know, we never really talk about margins because metal pass through is such a big component. With aluminum being softer, it makes the margin look higher. We look at the return on capital. And that's a better way to be looking at it. So I wouldn't read too much into these margin things that you're mentioning.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","Okay. And then on the plant in Madrid, I mean as I look at it, it looks like you have an aluminum aerosol plant starting up in the Czech Republic and that's basically it until Madrid. And given that you're working hard on all the synergies, I would imagine, I mean, that can change, but that's really the only thing that's out there. And should I assume it's like, what, 800 million cans per line, one in 2018 and one in 2019? Is that a good ballpark?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","It's a good ballpark. Like Scott said, we're going to be putting this first line in and then kind of ramping up and building infrastructure for the second line. And so the timing of it is dependent upon how the Spanish market continues to grow.","But in terms of your broader question about CapEx, we have been spending a fair amount of money. And you mentioned \u2013 actually just to be clear, we're not building a new plant in the Czech Republic. We're significantly expanding an existing plant, but we continue to make specialty can investments in our business.","We talked about in North America on the last conference call that there is some capital that's going to be required to upgrade the facilities we acquired. So there's a whole bunch of distributed things like that. And we stand by what we said in the range of $500 million for next year.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","Okay. Okay and last quick one. I know the depreciation \u2013 this is the first look we've had with the step-up. If you annualize the fourth quarter, I guess it would be what, 456? Isn't that a good ballpark to be in next year, is the 450 range?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Yes. That sounds about right, and then add the amortization that we're going to exclude is on top of that, but that's (42:04)","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","Which is 132 give or take?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Correct.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","Okay. That's good. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chris Manuel from Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, gentlemen, and congratulations to a strong \u2013 what sounds like a strong first 120 days or so.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Thanks.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Let's see here, so a couple questions I wanted to ask. I think I understand what's happening in Spain, but I wanted to also dive into the aerospace business a little bit. The backlog's up quite a bit. If we look back historically, 2012, 2013, 2014, you've been $900 million plus of revenue there before. What do you think the path is towards monetizing some of that backlog? Should 2017, 2018 be $900 million plus revenue kind of numbers, or what's the path there?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yeah. I think the path \u2013 I mean, we have a record amount of backlog and it's obviously a very good story there. I think as time goes on, we're going to be able to surpass what we've done in the past in terms of revenue and in terms of profitability.","I mentioned on last quarter that we had a lot on our plates in terms of won, not-booked and the biggest surprise that happened in the third quarter for us is, given that the government pushed out the continuing resolution until after the election, we were pleasantly surprised and so some of the wins turned into funded wins, which went into our backlog.","We're still chasing a variety of things in the aerospace business. And even getting back to the capital, I think over the next couple of years, it's not big dollars, but we're going to be investing in that in terms of new chambers, in terms of expanding our manufacturing capability and capacity, and building out some of our existing facilities because our backlog is the highest we've ever had it and we're ramping up big time in terms of hiring people, getting people going. And as I mentioned, I think you're going to start to see it roll out as early as the fourth quarter 2016. And then as we go to 2017 and beyond, we feel good about that business. They've been doing a great job.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then the second question I had was \u2013 and I fully appreciate you're going to have an Analyst Day event for us in a few months. But given that the business, particularly in Europe and in South America, is quite different than your historic business, or at least the footprint to an extent is, help us get \u2013 give us a sense of what you would anticipate, say, the next one, two, three years, the organic growth profile of the new Ball business looks like. And even in North America too, given that maybe we've had a bit of an inflection point here.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","There's a very long answer to that. I would encourage you to come to the investor conference and hear directly from our presidents in that region. That's part of what we're planning on doing \u2013 explaining what we see from a demand perspective, a supply perspective, a footprint perspective, a size, shape, capacity, innovation, all those various things at the Investor Day.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. I'll wait for that. Thank you.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","All right, thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line Philip Ng from Jefferies. Please Proceed.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. It sounds like what you're seeing \u2013 some increased momentum there. Can you provide some color what kind of trends you're seeing and how should we think about mix relative to your business in Europe going forward?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","I'm sorry. Can you repeat the question? You were breaking in and out.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Yes, sure. Russia seems to be gaining a bit of momentum here. Can you talk about what's driving the growth; where you see that market taking off next year and what kind of impact should we think about from a mix standpoint?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Yes, the Russia market is good. It's a good business. It's a growing business. The can continues to do well and we would expect that to continue going forward.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Any big delta from a margin standpoint relative to Europe, positive or negative?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","No, not appreciably.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","No, is the short answer.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And I don't know if I missed this; piggybacking off of Chris' question about the aerospace business, backlogs have obviously picked up pretty meaningfully. How quickly of a ramp do we expect to see that flow through your P&L? And are there any startup costs we need to be mindful of in terms of that potentially impacting margins?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","No, there are no start-up costs and it's going to be ramped up as we go and really get going. It's a difficult question to answer because as we have \u2013 like, and every time we have some contracts that are coming off, some contracts that are coming on.","I will point out a couple things though. The majority of the business we've won is a cost-plus business, cost-plus fixed-fee business. And that usually \u2013 we've talked about this in the past. When you have a fixed-price contract, usually the margins when you start out are a bit lower. And then, if you execute successfully, your margins will pick up as you deliver those.","In a cost-plus environment, it's a little bit more stable. The margin is across, so I don't expect our margin profile, having said that, to change meaningfully as we look forward. I think it's as much about growing the revenues. And some of these programs we've won are multi-year programs. Some of them are single year. It's a big mix, but the vast majority of this is cost-plus, which is actually good from an overall profitability perspective.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay. That's really helpful. And just one last one from me, I know one of your partners in Mexico announced they're acquiring a brewery in Mexico. Is that an opportunity for you to slide in from an existing facility, or through potentially more capacity down the road? Just want to talk about the opportunity down the road. Thanks. Appreciate it.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yes. We've got a very good relationship with that customer you're mentioning. I think it's premature and it's not fair for us to comment on what some of their plans are. I'll just say that we have a very good relationship with them to supply 100% of their needs in Mexico.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Mark Wilde from BMO. Please proceed.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah. Good morning John. Good morning Scott.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Good morning.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Good morning.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Just actually following on Mexico, John, is it possible to get some sense of what you're seeing in terms of the can's share of the mix for both domestic and exported beer out of Mexico?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yes. I don't have them off the top of my head. Some observations though high level is, number one, the can penetration is certainly lower in Mexico than it is in North America. Number two, it \u2013 and I say that on the beer side, I want to say it's in the 20%s versus 50%s here in North America. So there's a lot of good runway there.","And I think as a lot of the Mexican beer companies look to develop their brands, they recognize they've been underweighted cans relative to glass and other substrates, and so they've been putting much more emphasis on the can, which I think longer term and shorter term is a benefit for us.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. What about on the export side? Do you have any sense of the export mix, how much of that is going in cans and how much is going in bottles and how that might shift?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yeah. It's the same trend. Historically, it had been more weighted towards glass than it had been cans. And I think as we look now and going forward, we are seeing a greater weight of cans relative to glass for the export.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And then I'm just curious, over the last 90 days, you've said no changes to any of your targets. But has there been anything that you would highlight over the last 90 days as you've kind of gotten into Rexam much deep (49:47) that surprised you at all one way or the other?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","On the conference call three months ago, our initial observations was the engagement of the people was awesome and we'd reiterate that. Great bunch of people who were very excited and I think as time goes on \u2013 we had a management conference; got the top 300 plus people in a room together, and really galvanized about who we are, what we're trying to do and how we are going to get there and what each and every person's role is and really this behaved like a true owner, as I talked about in my opening remarks. That's a positive.","I think in terms of \u2013 when you peel away the onion, there's always puts and takes, but, as Scott had mentioned, we see some \u2013 we have to firm these things up, but we see some opportunities on the cost side, whether it's footprint, whether it's supply-demand dynamics, whether it's best practice sharing in the manufacturing footprints, all those things. We're getting after it now. And as we dig into it, we're excited.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Scott, I'm curious, with that Rexam headquarters wind-down, is there any potential benefit for you in terms of being able to sell the remaining years on the lease?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","My experience is \u2013 we're going to try to re-lease the property. We don't own it.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","There's usually not a huge upside. I mean the market is higher than it was when we entered the lease, so maybe there's a little bit, but that's rounding.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah. Okay. All right. That's good. Final question I had, any way to quantify the benefit from aluminum premiums in the third quarter?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Nothing for us really.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. All right. Sounds good. I'll turn it over.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Kyle White from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Kyle White - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. A large brewer recently said that they're starting to see some slowdown in the craft beer market and I'm just curious if you guys are seeing that as well with some of your customers. I know I think last quarter you said it was growing at 30% year-to-date, but just what are you expecting going forward from that?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","No, it's still growing strong. I think what that \u2013 whoever was mentioning that \u2013 you have seen a change though. I think some of the larger craft brewers have slowed down. The top 10 brands in the craft brewing side has slowed down, but on the other side of the curve, many of the smaller ones, they continue to grow very strong on the can side because they were in glass historically, or they did not exist. And so we continue to see a strong uptick in some of the smaller craft beers going into cans.","Kyle White - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then sorry to go back to the new facility in Spain. I'm just trying to fully understand, it's a customer that you are servicing now, so are you guys seeing increased cost maybe from transportation or whatnot that this kind of new facility is more of a cost-saving with some added growth to it, or how should we think about that?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Well, we were servicing out of a new facility that we had to divest.","Kyle White - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","So that business will come when we get that plant up and running.","Kyle White - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","And it will be much more beneficial from a cost standpoint because it'll be very closely located to where all that volume's going.","Kyle White - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. All right. Thank you. I'll turn it over.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Manuel from Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hello, again, gentlemen. Just one quick follow-up for Scott, and if you have the answer for this handy, that would be wonderful. If not, if you could get back to us. But wanted to get a sense of the pension, where we are today, where we are heading into 2017. Mainly, what is the liability so that we can try to calculate some sensitivities on what happens with stuff, but your expectations for what the liability is, what the funding level is and how that might play out into 2017 as well?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Sure. I don't have the exact liability numbers with me right now, but the pension plans that we acquired were actually better funded than the Ball legacy pension plans. So, in fact, in the UK, they have a very sizable pension there. It's actually over funded by a few hundred million dollars. And in the U.S., it's better funded than our plans have been. So we don't anticipate a major change in the pension expense going forward and most of the expense that we'll have will be really related to our U.S. legacy business versus what we acquired. But I can get you some more specific numbers. (54:23)","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","The fund status would be helpful too. Thanks.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Sure.","Operator","There are no further questions from the phone lines at this time.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Okay, great. Well, thank you, James, and we look forward to seeing you all at our upcoming investor conference in December. And if anyone who has not registered, we'd ask you to please reach out to Ann Scott and do so. And look forward to getting into 2017 and delivering on what we expect. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

Welcome to the Ball Corporation Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]  As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, January 26, 2012. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, President and CEO. Please go ahead.","John A. Hayes","Good morning, everyone, and thank you, Sema. This Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's fourth quarter and full year 2011 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-Q and in other company SEC filings, as well as company news releases. If you don't already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website.","Now joining me on the call today are Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Ray Seabrook, Executive Vice President and COO of Global Packaging. In a moment, Scott will discuss our financial results for the quarter and for 2011. Ray will follow up with details about our Packaging operating performance, and I'll close with comments on Aerospace and the outlook for 2012 and beyond.","Ball reported improved 2011 results in a continued anemic economic environment. Our solid performance was due largely to the great work from our employees around the world, as well as the development and initial implementation of our Drive for 10 vision. Now at its core, our Drive for 10 vision is made up of 5 strategic levers that we believe will position us for continued growth. These levers include maximizing value from our existing businesses, expanding into new products and capabilities, broadening our geographic reach, aligning ourselves with the right customers and markets and finally, leveraging our technological expertise.","We've been hard at work executing our strategy, and during the fourth quarter, we maximized value in our existing businesses by ensuring our supply-demand balance aligned with market needs, taking manufacturing downtime in food and beverage plants, resulting in excellent cash flow generation.","We expanded into new products to meet growing demand by successfully starting up our new reclosable Alumi-Tek bottle line in Golden, Colorado. We also aligned ourselves with the right customers and markets. In December, Ball Corporation signed a 10-year contract extension with MillerCoors LLC for the Rocky Mountain Metal Container joint venture and extended its commercial supply agreement with MillerCoors LLC as its sole supplier of cans. We continue to expand our geographic reach as construction proceeded on schedule for new beverage can plants in China, Brazil and Vietnam, all of which will start up by the end of the first quarter. And we leveraged our technological expertise with the successful launch of the Ball-built NPP satellite for NASA, which will aid long-term climate forecasts and improve short-term weather forecasts.","2011 was a very good year for Ball. In recognition of the company's performance and future growth potential, our Board of Directors yesterday approved an increase in the dividend of nearly 43% and a new share repurchase authorization of up to 30 million shares.","I'll turn it over to Scott to talk about the quarter, and then Ray will provide color on our operations. And I'll return on comments on Aerospace and the outlook for 2012. Scott?","Scott C. Morrison","Thanks, John. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for 2011 were $2.73 versus last year's $2.36, an increase of more than 15%. In the fourth quarter, comparable diluted earnings were $0.48 versus last year's $0.53, which included a tax benefit of $0.07 related to debt refinancing.","For the full year, the following factors contributed to improved results: volume improvements in Brazil and China, strong operating performance at our Metal Packaging businesses, exceptional program performance in our Aerospace business and a lower share count.","Fourth quarter results were impacted by 6 fewer accounting days in the quarter compared to 2010 and our decision to run for cash as Packaging volumes were weaker than forecast in the U.S. and Europe.","Turning to full year free cash flow, Ball generated over $500 million after spending nearly $250 million for growth capital. During 2011, we returned every free cash flow dollar to shareholders via a net share buyback of $474 million and dividends of $46 million.","Net balance sheet debt at the end of the year was approximately $3 billion, only a $317 million increase over 2010 despite our Aerocan acquisition, growth capital and acquiring over $470 million of our stock.","Credit quality and liquidity of the company remained solid with a 2011 comparable EBIT to interest coverage of 4.9x and net debt to comparable EBITDA at 2.5x. Committed credit and available liquidity at year end was in excess of $1 billion.","For a complete summary of fourth quarter and full year results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, please refer to the Notes section of today's earnings release.","Turning to some key financial metrics for 2012. Interest expense will remain the same or approximately $175 million. For 2012, full year effective tax rate should be in the range of 31%. As mentioned in today's earnings release, we announced plans to move our European headquarters from Germany to Switzerland in the second half of 2012.","Given continuing capital projects in China and, to a lesser extent, in Brazil, full year 2012 CapEx is expected to be in the range of $400 million. Each of these growth projects exceeds our investment hurdle within 3 years. The timing of certain projects will impact actual spending, and as always, we'll keep you updated as the year progresses.","We expect 2012 free cash flow to be in the range of $450 million, with the majority of free cash flow going to share repurchases. At current exchange rates, year-end net debt is expected to be approximately $2.9 billion, roughly flat with 2011, and we'll continue to have cash being oriented to share repurchases and dividends versus debt paydown.","Finally, here are a few key modeling data points. D&A will run approximately $312 million for the year. Since we did an exceptional job of getting working capital out of the business in 2011, we'll do our best to keep it out in 2012.","Pension expense will increase by about $5 million, while cash contributions to the pension plan worldwide will be up approximately $85 million over 2011 levels.","Maintenance CapEx, including recent acquisitions, now runs approximately $200 million. On December 31, 2011, basic share count was 160,316,000.","Also, let's close the loop on the question of how many accounting days in the quarter is for 2012. We essentially return to a normal quarterly distribution even with the leap year. First quarter 2012 will have 92 days versus 93 days in the first quarter of 2011. The middle quarters will have 91 days as they did in 2011, and the fourth quarter will have 92 days in 2012 versus 90 in 2011. With that, I'll turn it over to Ray to talk more about the Packaging operations.","Raymond J. Seabrook","Thanks, Scott. Fourth quarter operating results in the Metal Beverage, Americas and Asia segment were better than a year ago due to higher sales volumes and earnings in China and Brazil.","Fourth quarter North American Beverage Can earnings were slightly lower than last year due to 2% lower sales volumes as a result of fewer accounting days in the quarter, as Scott noted earlier. Full year operating earnings in this segment were up 15%, and we expect this trend to continue in 2012.","In 2012, we anticipate that the Beverage Can market will continue to grow in Brazil and Asia, and specialty can sales will progress in North America. As John mentioned, new manufacturing facilities constructed in '11 in Vietnam, China and Brazil will all be selling cans by the end of the first quarter this year.","Further Beverage Can capital expansion programs are planned for China in 2012, but this year's capital spending in Brazil and North America will be considerably reduced from last year's levels.","Fourth quarter operating results in Europe were slightly down from a year ago despite Beverage Can volumes being up 2% in the quarter and for the full year. European fourth quarter earnings were negatively impacted by price cost compression in beverage cans.","Full year operating earnings in this segment were up 15%, primarily on the strength of Ball Aerocan acquisition, which occurred in January of 2011. Ball Aerocan continues to perform at better-than-expected levels, with full year sales volumes in '11 up almost 20% from a year ago.","Full year operating results in the U.S. Metal Food and Household Products segment were up 3.5% from last year.","Fourth quarter earnings were lower than a year ago due to lower sales volumes and inventory management. A poor vegetable pack and little 2012 prebuy impacted fourth quarter sales volume. Full year food can sales volumes were lower by 3% but were down 7% in the fourth quarter.","Lower fourth quarter sales volumes drove higher manufacturing costs due to production curtailments. Production curtailments and better inventory management resulted in Food and Household business reducing working capital by more than $80 million in 2011.","As we look to 2012, we anticipate another good year in this segment, but quarterly earnings distribution will be much different. In 2011, this segment earned 60% of its full year earnings in the first half and 40% in the second half of the year. In 2012, the full year earnings distribution will be reversed.","With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.","John A. Hayes","Thanks, Ray, and thanks, Scott. Our Aerospace and Technologies business posted double-digit EBIT margins for the full year. Continued excellent program performance propelled this segment's results to record levels.","NASA's NPP satellite launched successfully on October 28, and instruments are coming online and returning good data. Climate monitoring and measurement is an important growth area for us and is the latest example.","Also during the quarter, Ball Aerospace was awarded contracts to develop and integrate enhanced operational capabilities for the U.S. Air Force Distributed Common Ground System, providing new capabilities for the intelligent community, another growth area for Ball.","Backlog ended the year at $897 million, which sets us up well going into 2012. Though the top line will grow in 2012, EBIT will likely be relatively flat with 2011 as multiyear fixed-price programs ramp up through the year.","So in summary, our various businesses had a solid finish to 2011, and we expect to do even better in 2012. Due largely to the lack of inventory holding gains, as Scott mentioned, in the first half in our Food business, we expect first half earnings to be relatively flat as compared to 2011. And we see noticeable upside in the back half of the year as our various growth capital projects transition to producing product and profit over the coming months.","As Scott mentioned, even including some carryover capital spending from 2011 and increased pension funding, Ball continues to generate significant free cash flow. We remain focused on our balanced capital deployment strategy, and will continue to return value to our shareholders via share repurchases, as well as dividends.","Our Drive for 10 vision is a mindset around perfection in everything we do, and it will play a key role in achieving our goals of more than doubling our EVA dollars generated over the next 10 years, as well as generating a compound average growth rate of 10% to 15% earnings per share over time.","So with that, Sema, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Two quick questions to start, one on Aerospace and the other on use of cash flow and the structure within Beverage Cans. Within Aerospace, it looked like the backlog dropped a little bit. I didn't catch if you said what your expectations were for the rest of '12. But could you comment at all as to whether you think the backlog might be able to hold steady or improve relative programs you know you're likely to get some funding for in the year? The second question, when you look at the U.S. and Europe, it's been more often than not, in the last several quarters, where volumes may have been a little bit softer than you would have expected. Clearly, the scanner data, as we look at it for North America, has been somewhat soft for a lot of your key customers' key products. Do you think -- and what are your plans around, perhaps, further rightsizing the business? And how do you think about the growth expectations and the capacity alignment or the growth you're expecting in your key traditional products in both U.S. and Europe?","John A. Hayes","George, this is John. Let me talk about Aerospace, and I'll have Ray comment on the footprint discussions you were just mentioning. Aerospace, as we know, sometimes, we talk about it being lumpy. And if you look back over the past couple of quarters, we were about $900 million, I think, in the second quarter, moved up to about $950 million at the end of the third and back down. We expect -- given that this is an election year, we don't expect significant changes relative to the U.S. government. So I wouldn't expect significant changes in our backlog over the course of 2012. With the elections coming up in November, I think that's going to be a very important milestone relative to where some of the future funding is going to be. But we feel pretty darn good about where we are on a variety of different programs in a variety of different segments and markets. So we have a good diversified portfolio, and we continue to grow, expect to grow in the Aerospace business going into 2012, '13 and beyond. Ray, do you want to...","Raymond J. Seabrook","Yes. George, to answer your question, let me start with Europe for a second. We had 2% growth, volume growth in Europe this year. We actually had a program on the drawing boards to add a little bit of capacity potentially in 2012 in Europe, but we're not going to do that. So we are absolutely to the walls in Europe, and we're not going to add any capacity. We'll see how 2012 looks. When I look at North America, our customers are not exactly sure. It's a pretty tough year in volumes in North America, and we're getting some mixed signals out of our customers what they think. But as the market leader in North America, we're not going to run the business with excess capacity. So we have a couple of lines right now, although we'll see how things go. But at the end of the exercise, if demand is there, the capacity is coming out.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","First one, just if you, I might have missed this, but you mentioned $200 million is now your run rate in maintenance CapEx. What did you say for the full year you expect CapEx to be this year?","Scott C. Morrison","Right now, going -- this is Scott. Going into this year, it looks like it's around $400 million. But as you saw last year, we pulled -- there was probably $40 million that moved from 2011 that moved into 2012. So it's a little bit higher going into what we had thought maybe 6 months ago. Most of that increase is just due to the movement from '11 to '12.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Got you. And I know it's really early days, but, and it will depend on how the market develops, especially, say, in China, but as you think about this year, if the year unfolds as you expect, like with your full year guidance, that you suggested a stronger second half, do you think you will need to keep that CapEx level around where it is now to keep the capacity coming in where you need it in 2013? In other words, do you think CapEx stays here next year?","Scott C. Morrison","Right now, we're seeing a lot of continued growth opportunities in China. And so more of the cash or more of the CapEx will be oriented towards China in 2012. And really, we evaluate things on an ongoing basis, and that's why things could be added or things could be -- come off the list depending on how volumes materialize in different parts of the world. So for right now, we think $400 million is a decent number, with most of that going into China to keep up with all that growth.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Got you. And one more quick one and you might have mentioned this, but I know that North America in the fourth quarter, your volumes were down 2%. And of course, that's because of the days. Did you give us the -- or can you give us the numbers for the other geographies in that segment, Brazil, as well as Asia?","Raymond J. Seabrook","Yes, sure. Chip, this is Ray. Our volumes in Europe were up a little bit better than 30%, and Brazil was just almost 10%. And that's...","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Asia is 30%?","Raymond J. Seabrook","That's with the less number of days.","Scott C. Morrison","Yes, Asia was 30%.","Raymond J. Seabrook","Yes, Asia was 30%.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","And those are clean comps. That's not taking into account increasing your ownership or anything like that from the joint ventures.","Raymond J. Seabrook","Those are clean comps, except for the 6 days. If you add the 6 days, it would be higher, right?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Can you give us an early read on how to think about volumes globally for 2012, perhaps break it down on a quarter basis versus the capacity additions that you have in Asia and Brazil?","John A. Hayes","Ray, do you want to express the...","Raymond J. Seabrook","Yes, what I would tell you is Europe was up 2% this year, and I believe we're thinking that the market goes up a little bit next year. Our volumes are up slightly. We've -- it's been a pretty tough pricing environment in Europe for us, and so there were some situations that we didn't participate in. But fundamentally, is Europe, I think, will be slightly up for us, but I would say in the 2% range sounds about right. North America is a little bit of a moving market for us. Depending on which customers you're talking to, you get some slightly different answers. But I think -- we think it's probably still slightly down. How much, we're not sure. It depends -- I think it's going to depend on how good the economy is and a bunch of other things. But I don't think it's going to be as down as much as it was this year. It was down about 4%. I think we're thinking of a lower number than that. We're thinking maybe 2%. When you look at China, China continues to grow. We're basically sold-out; every can we make, we can sell. And as a matter of fact, we're kind of oversold a little bit in China in 2012, it won't be up 30% because we haven't increased capacity 30%. I think the number is more in the high teens, high teen number for us in China even though the market will grow probably in the 20% to 25% range. And Brazil, we're hoping -- Brazil was kind of a tough year this year. They had a good first quarter, a terrible second quarter. They had some very interesting weather situations in Brazil this year. So if you talk to our Brazilian colleagues, they'll tell you it was a really difficult weather year. I think we're hoping for somewhere in the 15%, 10% to 15% range again in Brazil for 2012.","John A. Hayes","Yes. Ghansham, I'll just add a little bit more color and even some color around what we talked about first half, second half. When you think about the third quarter for us, the European weather perspective was absolutely horrible in 2011, and just even if you get normal weather patterns, there ought to be some benefit there. That combined with the European soccer championships in Europe, I think, are going to be helpful. And as Ray mentioned, although the context is slightly different in Brazil, we face the same thing as well. So with those 2 important markets for us, I think just the external comparables relative to what we saw in 2011 should be better for us in 2012.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And on the headquarter move, can you share with us how the tax profile of the company will change in the next 3 years or so?","Scott C. Morrison","It's really to better align our organization with how our customers and suppliers are structured and improve process, putting everybody all in the same spot. There'll be some benefits longer term. Not much in the way of '12, but over time we'll expect to get some benefits. And there are some exit costs too that you have to pay when you do some of this -- this type of restructuring. We'll fill you in on those as we get further down the road in 2012.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","You talked about the price compression in Europe. Could you just elaborate on that, perhaps, where did you see that, what region?","Raymond J. Seabrook","I think it's really just pretty much throughout. As you know, the European Union, it's been a difficult situation over there, so I think business is difficult for our customers. It's difficult for us. So as our customers look to do business, they're looking for -- they're looking to cut their costs, and we're looking to our suppliers to cut their costs, and sort of it will be through the whole supply chain. I think that there's probably a little bit more capacity in Europe than we'd like to see, but all that's coming out with the volume growth. So it's just been a little bit more difficult than we would've liked to have seen it.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then Scott, can you quantify, perhaps, the underproduction hit that might've occurred this quarter just across the regions?","Scott C. Morrison","Most of it was in North America, both in the Food business and the Beverage business in terms of running -- taking more downtime and running for cash. But the shortfall is probably a hand -- a few cents to $0.05, I would bet.","John A. Hayes","Just to give context to Scott's point, North American beverage cans, we took out -- year-over-year, we produced roughly 300 million less cans, and I think upwards of 1 billion less ends in the fourth quarter. So we really put the brakes on the manufacturing side, and that creates excellent cash flow, and that's what you saw in the quarter. And so I think it sets us up very well going into 2012, where our inventories are where we want them to be, and we feel pretty good about that.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just the last one is you do have the savings from Torrance coming in, in 2012. Roughly how much should that help? Isn't that $20 million-ish of saves that you get kind of right off the bat?","Scott C. Morrison","Yes, we get part of those things started to kick in, but you're right, that was the full year number.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Philip Ng with Jefferies & Company.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","On the food can business, I just want to get a sense how much are tinplate prices expected to be up this year?","Raymond J. Seabrook","Yes. The good news about all that is that the tinplate pricing is up a lot more. We had 2 really high years of tinplate price increases. In 2012 -- which is great news because of D&A exercise. We've still got a product, our customers have a product to sell. So the tinplate prices are up significantly a lot less than they have been in prior years.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. I mean, certainly, last year, you had sizable increases, and then the weather was bad. I mean, the volumes are pretty tough. I mean, margins were still quite good. Is the normalized growth rate going forward in that business down 1% or 2%, or is it still flattish? How should we think about that business?","John A. Hayes","This is John. I would think of it more a flattish type of business. It may be down a little bit, but remember, we had horrible pack in the third quarter if this year, and so that skewed the results. But what you're seeing in terms of the overall economic climate, it actually plays well into processed food such as food cans. And so every given year, you have certain things, deviations from expectations, but we don't see it as a long-term necessarily declining market. We think it's more a flattish market. That's the way we run the business.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just the last question, you commented on some price weakness in Europe. Did you see any leakage in any of your other major markets?","Raymond J. Seabrook","No, not really. I think China is not -- I mean, this is not an easy business. And so we have good competitors that play hard, and so do we. But I would say Europe is where we're seeing most of the pressure. A little bit in China, but I would say primarily Europe.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Can you just update us again on what you think kind of a longer-term growth rate is in China? I think you mentioned in 2012, you were looking at something in the mid 20s. And then what your plans are right now to grow your own base there.","John A. Hayes","Yes, long term, we continue to see very strong fundamentals in the China marketplace. If you want to put a number, it really depends. I think we're not going to sustain the 30-plus percent growth we've seen over the past couple of years, over the next 10 years, but certainly in the near term. As Ray said, every can made is a can sold right now, and we expect very strong growth to continue in 2012, even in '13. And as the base of that business gets bigger, I think the growth rate itself will start to slow down, but the absolute number of cans being sold, I don't think, necessarily will slow down. We've talked about the can penetration in the beer market really being mid-single digits, the 5%, 6% range as we sit here today versus 50% in developed markets. And when you think about China is the world's biggest beer market, and only 5% of that is packaged in cans. And you have all the people moving from rural areas to urban areas. It sets us up very nicely over the long term. And that's why, as Scott said, a lot of our capital dollars are going into that, and we're very much focused on getting the right team there, getting the right footprint there and doing it very cost-effectively to help us stimulate and continue stimulate the demand. So all those things are core to our China strategy.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And I think you mentioned last quarter that you might be moving some lines from the U.S. over to China?","Raymond J. Seabrook","Yes, we're actively looking at that. I said we had a couple of lines right now that we've got out of commission. And as we expand in China -- we generally have some really good equipment in the U.S. We don't have stuff that's not good. So our preference would be to relocate the equipment from mature markets to emerging markets. So we're all about that.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then it sounded like in Brazil, you were expecting a pretty nice bounce back in 2012 in terms of volumes. It seems like some of the reports we see coming out of Brazil are that the Brazilian economy is growing slower. So can you just kind of help us reconcile that?","John A. Hayes","Yes. On one hand, the economy is growing slower. But on the other hand, the middle class is increasing and the wages are going into the pockets more quickly. They had a minimum wage increase that was in the range of 10%, 12%, which is actually good for our business because as the middle class rises, they have more disposable income. And then they go and purchase products such as those that we produce. So despite the overall economy being a little bit -- the growth of it being a little bit lower than it's been in the past, we still think there's good prospects relative to the consumer need for our product.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And just last on that, what's the penetration rate in Brazil right now do you estimate in beer?","John A. Hayes","On the beer side, it's mid- to upper 30%. It's kind of 36%, 37%, in and around there. And it's been increasing, and it continues to penetrate further, and so it's good for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alton Stump with Longbow Research.","Alton K. Stump - Longbow Research LLC","I think this is the fourth quarter in a row that I've asked this, but how are the trends in Eastern Europe versus Western Europe? Is that holding up as well? Or do you expect there's going to be some weakness there this year?","Raymond J. Seabrook","Yes. In 2011, Eastern Europe was a little slower than historically it has been. If you go back the last 5 years, probably the last 3 or last 5, Eastern Europe's been growing quite nicely. I think with all this euro and the difficult, if you will, economy that they've had in Europe, Eastern Europe has slowed more than potentially Western Europe.","John A. Hayes","What it's going to look like for '12, I think we're still thinking it could be a little bit on the slower slide.","Alton K. Stump - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And then just one quick follow-up on Brazil. We've heard, based on our checks, that it looks like the consumer there has gotten a bit more used to the pricing that was put through at the first of last year. Have you seen that? And is that at all responsible for the fact that it would look like demand is coming back now during the peak summer period?","John A. Hayes","I think that's part of it, certainly. There was, as you rightly pointed out, the first quarter last year, a big price increase driven in part by taxes from the government, et cetera, and that did put a short-term damper on it. And then as we went through the balance of the year, as we said, the weather was not all that great. So as we sit here beginning of 2012, as we know, it's on the back end of their summer season right now. But I think for the full year 2012, we expect it to be getting back, a little bit back on track relative to what we've seen over the past few years.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Todd Wenning with Morningstar.","Todd Wenning - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","With so much dry powder to repurchase shares now, what will your strategy be as it pertains to timing those purchases over the year? Will you look to repurchase them when you consider them to be good absolute value, good relative value to other capital allocations or something else?","Scott C. Morrison","We tend to be a pretty steady buyer of our shares, and we also tend to load up earlier in the year to orient more of our share repurchases to earlier in the year. So I would expect we'll continue that same pattern in 2012 and be pretty steady throughout the year but probably a little more heavy, in terms of repurchasing, in the first half.","Todd Wenning - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then if my calculations are right, based on your historical capital allocation strategy, and in light of your new buyback and dividend and CapEx plans, it seems like there's not a lot of cash flow left for acquisitions this year. Does that mean you're finding fewer acquisition opportunities that meet or exceeded your return on capital targets?","John A. Hayes","No, I wouldn't say that at all. In fact, if you look at last year, it's probably good representation of what we did -- of what our philosophy around that. We generated $0.5 billion in cash. But at the same time, we bought back or gave dividends of roughly $0.5 billion. We spent $250 million on growth capital, and we acquired a business worth over $300 million. So our debt went up, but our leverage ratios went down because of the operating performance of our company. And that's the model that's worked very successfully for us. And so we always want to keep the right amount of, to use your words, dry powder because you never know when opportunities present themselves. And so when you're strong financially, you have more flexibility and more options, and that's what we're going to do as we go forward.","Todd Wenning - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Great. Just one more. How are you thinking about the Aerospace and Technology product positioning in light of the new Department of Defense guidance that was issued earlier this month?","John A. Hayes","Yes, we actually feel pretty good about where we are because we're very good at low-cost, high-value, fixed-price projects. That's what the government really needs right now. They need better cost, better value, and that fits right into the sweet spot of why we've been successful and right in the sweet spot of why we're optimistic as we go forward relative to some of those things.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo Securities.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple of quick questions for you, but if I could start at -- on the capital side, you're spending again about $200 million beyond what you consider maintenance. If I've kind of done my math right, I'm not sure if I have, I think most of the capital is already spent for the capacity edge you have going in the new plant in China, the new plant -- capacity in Brazil. There's probably a pretty good slug yet -- could you help us fill out what that $200 million or so is going towards?","Scott C. Morrison","Well, it's Scott. As I mentioned, we probably had $40 million of that moved from 2011 into 2012 to finish some of these projects. As John, I think, mentioned in his comments, a lot of the things that were being built have moved into the first quarter of 2012 to complete them. So there's $40 million there. And then a pretty good chunk of the rest of the growth capital is oriented towards China.","John A. Hayes","Yes, as Ray said, every can made is a can sold right now, and we're short-capacity a little bit. So as we go into 2012, we have some projects that we haven't publicly announced as to where they are, but we plan on moving forward with those.","Raymond J. Seabrook","Yes, we've got another new plant on the drawing boards for China. We've got -- we're relocating some equipment in China. We've got end capacity, as well, these cans, come to the fact that we need some more ends, we've got end capacity in China. And quite frankly, we do have some other opportunities in different parts of the world that are looking very encouraging. So we don't want to get ahead of ourselves here, but there's some of the things that if things go our way, that could add some nice addition to our company.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","That's true. The next one I want to understand is it sounds like you still have some room for some other projects that haven't been announced yet.","Raymond J. Seabrook","Yes.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And as far as looking at -- I think, the last gentleman asked about acquisitions. But as far as looking at new flags on the ground, so to speak, or new areas that you could be targeting for development, can you maybe give us an update there as to what space globally that you think about capacity adds or markets that are attractive?","John A. Hayes","We don't want to go into too much detail given the public nature of this phone call. But we are actively looking, as Ray just even mentioned, at some things. We are very financially disciplined around things like that, and that's why some of the timing of these issues are unclear. We're also very much customer-driven and what we mean by that is typically, when we build a new plant, as you've heard in Brazil and other places, we do it -- we first enter into long-term agreements with the customer, so we know what we're dealing with relative to volume and pricing. And then we take the risk on the manufacturing side, which we're quite comfortable doing. Now getting specifically to your question, we've been doing some things on the impact to the distributed Aerosol business, whether it's adding new capacity in our European operations, which we did in 2011, or some other things we've been looking at. But also, on the Beverage Can side, in terms of geographic growth, in terms of new products, all those things are the focus that we've been trying to rally ourselves around with respect toward Drive for 10 vision. And I don't want to go into specifics on what those are right now, but as Ray said, if a couple of things go our way, we feel pretty darn good about where we are, and we'll make our company a better company and more profitable company.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Dan Schniewind with AMI Asset Management.","Daniel T. Schniewind - AMI Asset Management Corporation","It looks like you have some paper callable in '18, and you've got some other debt. It's a little bit higher coupon. Have you guys given any thought kind of tapping kind of the available market now and maybe refining your debt into maybe a benchmark deal or a little bit bigger size to increase your flexibility?","Scott C. Morrison","We look at our debt portfolio all the time and manage it, I think, opportunistically. So we're always looking at the economics of doing something like that, but we haven't decided to do that yet.","Daniel T. Schniewind - AMI Asset Management Corporation","Okay. And as far as acquisitions go, in the future, would you guys look to do those through debt or through cash?","Scott C. Morrison","Last year, that was up almost the exact amount of our acquisitions. So it really -- as John was talking about, we have a variety of levers that we can pull given our strong free cash flow. And so it kind of depends on the situation, what's the optimal way to finance something. And then again, it gets back to being opportunistic with the debt markets, too. So it depends.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Al Kabili with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just wanted to ask a question on Aerocan, and given its focus on some of the consumer discretionary in Europe, are you still seeing high-single-digit, like low-double-digit growth rates with the business? Any impact on the macro conditions there?","Raymond J. Seabrook","I would tell you that this year, very early after we bought that business, as we put some capacity in, we probably took the majority of the market growth in Europe. Now I said we were up almost 20%. I wouldn't say our competitors were up the same kind of numbers. We have a very -- a business that's probably low-cost in Europe, and so it's very successful. I would tell you that the volumes in '12 will not be up to the same extent. We expect a slight volume increase but not to the same magnitude we had in '11.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then also, I guess in France, on the soda tax potentially, any thoughts on any potential impact there?","John A. Hayes","No, you know what, it's not a meaningful -- we don't believe it to be a meaningful impact to us even if it were to occur. It really gets down to the retail price of it. Could there be a modest impact? Maybe, but in the totality of our European operations and even the totality of our company, it's not material.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just last housekeeping question on corporate expense. How should we be thinking about it for 2012?","Scott C. Morrison","It should be relatively flat year-over-year.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Even with the share price the way it is in the fourth quarter?","Scott C. Morrison","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions for you. In Europe, some of your competitors across a different substrate are very aggressively looking to take price there. It looks like aluminum prices are down on top of that. You're saying that you're seeing some general pricing compression for cans. Are you seeing any customers approach you to look at potentially switching from glass to cans?","Raymond J. Seabrook","I'll let you answer that, John, but I personally haven't seen it, but I'll defer to John.","John A. Hayes","In the short term, the filling lines of bottles versus cans are different. And so in the short term, because of pricing activity, we don't see any material shifts in substrates that are being used for the packaging of it. As Ray said earlier, though, the European market generally is a very tough market right now. You have unemployment high. You have not only the economies being soft, but there could be threats of double dips, and it always puts pressure on the supply chain, and that's what we're seeing. And so without knowing specifics more about other substrates, I would just tell you pricing environment for virtually every industry right now in Europe is challenging.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A question on China. You guys are, I think, the leading player there with about 31% share. How much further do you think you can grow your market share in China before you may run into some anticompetitive issues?","John A. Hayes","Well, as you know, China is such a large country, number one. And we have more growth right now just keeping up with market demand, let alone market share shifts that we have not really focused too much on increasing our market share, although we're going to -- we certainly want to, at a minimum, hold our market share. More longer term, I think there's probably some regional opportunities but not wholesale. But remember, there's -- we're, far and away, the largest. We have another competitor that's relatively large there, and then it gets pretty fragmented at that, and it really starts to focus on the regional -- regions of China as opposed to the country as a whole.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And just last question for Scott. Looking at the free cash flow numbers for '11, it looks like there were about $200 million of other items that positively boosted the free cash flow number to north of $500 million. What I'm really trying to get at is what's the core change in the cash flow of the business in '12 relative to '11 if you were to adjust '11 for that $200 million of other items of positive cash flow?","Scott C. Morrison","Well, the big item would be the pension funding versus expense. So that's going to go up $85 million year-over-year. So we had very little pension funding that was required in '11 and more -- a larger increase in 2012. The working capital would also be a big swing. Where it was a pretty big source of cash flow in '11. We're going to try to keep most of that out in '12, but we'll see. And those would be the 2 big components.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Is there anything on taxes?","Scott C. Morrison","Nothing really material in taxes.","Operator","And our next question is a follow-up question from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A few things to clean up. One of the paperboard companies was reporting recently, and they're talking about increased installations, both of their systems and their board for multipacks, especially around cans. I guess I'm preaching a little bit to the converted here, but are you seeing that in any particular regions? And are you seeing it more in soft drink or beer? That would be question #1. Question #2, back to North America, you're forecasting, to some degree, a lesser rate of decline in North America versus '11's 4% or so decline. That's not great, but it is a little bit better. Does that suggest at all that your customers in North America are rethinking their price versus volume strategy or not?","John A. Hayes","One of the -- Ray, why don't you talk about North America, and I'll come back for the global?","Raymond J. Seabrook","Yes. It's funny. It's a little more customer-specific, so, and I don't want to go into that, George. So certain customers, I don't think, are seeing it exactly the same way. So we have some customers that I think are -- their volumes didn't decline quite as much. And they're not thinking about making some tremendous changes. We have other customers that probably, their volumes did decline more and are rethinking some of their strategies. So it's kind of a mixed bag, to be quite honest with you. I think on the beer side, I think the guys probably are more wedded to their pricing strategies, I think. In the soft drink side, it's a little different, I think. So that's what I would tell you about North America.","John A. Hayes","Yes, with respect to the multi-packing, George, as you know, it's quite prevalent in the United States. We've seen a lot of activity going on there relative to whether it's microbrewers going in the multipacks if they haven't. Or you're seeing many of our customers change the pack size, change the pack configuration. But outside the United States, multi-packing is really not -- has not been a big phenomenon, and that's what provides a good opportunity. Even in Europe, multi-packing is not the norm. It's more of an exception. And so we are seeing some activity there. China, I think, is another big opportunity as the urbanization occurs there and the change to the retail trade. When you have many more of the big box stores going into China, which is exploding there, they really like to push multipacks because of convenience. And so I think you're going to see that as time goes forward as well. And so obviously, as you said, we're talking of converting here, but it's helpful to our business, and some of these other areas ramp up the penetration of the can.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So it's opportunity, but you're not really seeing it yet in the volumes. That'd be the summary, right?","John A. Hayes",".","What I'm saying is we are seeing it, but I wouldn't say that it's wholesale right now. There's a lot of experimentation going on.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, that's fair. Two last questions, and I'll turn it over. You mentioned at the beginning that you renewed your contract on the Rocky Mountain Beverage Can plant agreement. Did you also say, if you did, I missed, and I apologize, that you also renewed your entire agreement with MillerCoors? And then secondly, in food cans, what's the latest on BPA both in terms of coatings and customers' expectations?","John A. Hayes","Okay. Your first question, yes, we did say that we extended our agreement with MillerCoors. Getting back on the BPA, as most people know that we expect by the end of March for the FDA to make an announcement around it. We don't expect there to be any surprises of the science side of it. We've talked about that before. But unfortunately, this is in the political arena to some degree, and that's not of our control. Irrespective of that, George, and this is really getting to the crux of your question, we feel really good about the progress we've made and can now offer alternatives to meet any regulatory pronouncement for the vast majority of our products. So we are anticipating the FDA to say something. We don't expect it to be wholesale change. But as I said, you never know. And we'll adjust working with our suppliers on one hand and customers on the other hand. To the extent that we need to do something, we certainly have to consider that.","Operator","Mr. Hayes, there are no further questions at this time.","John A. Hayes","Okay. Well, I want to thank everyone for participating, and we, here, all look forward to a good 2012. And we'll speak to you 3 months from now. Everyone, have a good first quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, October 25, 2012. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, President and CEO. Please go ahead, sir.","John A. Hayes","Thank you, Amit, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's third quarter 2012 results.","The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-Q and in other company SEC filings, as well as company news releases. Now if you don't already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website.","Joining me on the call today are Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Ray Seabrook, Executive Vice President and COO, Global Packaging. In a moment, Scott will discuss our financial results for the quarter. Ray will follow with details about our packaging, operating performance, and I will close with comments on aerospace and the outlook for the fourth quarter.","Ball reported third quarter 2012 results ahead of last year's third quarter. Recall that we had mentioned in July that our second half 2012 results would be up year-over-year and, to date, we've performed slightly better than we expected. During the quarter, we made several -- we made progress on all of our Drive for 10 strategic levers. Several highlights include:","In our North American beverage container business, we continue to aggressively manage our overall supply to meet market demand. We announced in August we are removing 12-ounce beverage can capacity from our system, converting additional 12-ounce capacity as specialty containers and redistributing can end-making equipment to existing Ball end centers. In addition, during the quarter, we initiated the voluntary separation program for salaried U.S. employees that will help rightsize our administrative expenses relative to our current business.","In our beverage can businesses outside of North America, volumes improved nicely due to the startup of our Alagoinhas, Brazil; Qingdao, China and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam facilities. In fact, on a global basis, volumes were up nearly 7%.","In our aerospace business, we continue to leverage our technological expertise as we align with growing markets, resulting in a record contracted backlog of $1.1 billion. We also announced our intentions to acquire an extruded aluminum manufacturing facility in Mexico and form a joint venture in Argentina with Envases del Plata, which broadens our geographic reach and brings new capabilities to our metal food and household business.","And finally, during the quarter, we acquired the beverage can business of [indiscernible], a small regional beverage can manufacturer in Italy, for approximately $15 million. In the first year of operation, this investment will exceed our return hurdle. While world economies may have slowed a bit, our businesses are faring well as we continue to actively manage the business, and our pace of cost optimization and cash generation is accelerating.","I'll turn it over to Scott to talk about our quarter, and then Ray will provide color on our operations. And I'll return to comment on our aerospace business and the outlook for 2012. Scott?","Scott C. Morrison","Thanks, John. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2012 were $0.90 versus last year's $0.81, an increase of 11%. Also in the quarter, the company recorded after-tax charges totaling $26.4 million related mainly to the relocation of our European headquarters and previously announced plant closures.","The following factors contributed favorably to third quarter results: higher volumes in Europe, Brazil and China, as well as specialty can volume growth; solid program performance in our aerospace business and a lower share count. FX translation negatively impacted the third quarter by $0.03. For a complete summary of the third quarter results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, please refer to the Notes Section of today's earnings release.","Recapping key financial metrics for 2012, full year corporate undistributed costs are expected to come in closer to $65 million. Interest expense will be around $177 million. The full year 2012 effective tax rate is projected to be around 28%, with the fourth quarter rate closer to 31%.","Given recent global growth trends, full year 2012 CapEx is anticipated to run under $350 million. Therefore, we continue to expect 2012 free cash flow to be at least $0.5 billion. At current exchange rates, year-end net debt is expected to be just over $3 billion, and we will return the majority of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends versus debt paydown.","Just as a heads up, in the fourth quarter, Ball will record a $38-million after-tax charge for the closeout  of certain Canadian pension plans, costs associated with an employee voluntary separation program in the U.S., and additional cost associated with previously announced plant closures.","With that I'll turn it over to Ray to talk more about the packaging operations.","Raymond J. Seabrook","Thanks, Scott. Comparable third quarter operating results in the metal beverage, Americas and Asia segment were 18% above last year's level and through 9 months are up 6%. Third quarter Brazil performance was much improved from last year's level due largely to the contribution from or our new Alagoinhas plants, which came online in the second quarter, and strong year-over-year volume gains.","In Asia, our new can plant in Vietnam is coming up to speed, and our plant in Qingdao, China ran very well in the third quarter. Asia operating results are still well ahead of last year's level through the quarter and through the first 9 months.","Sales volumes in North America were relatively flat through the first 9 months compared to a year ago. We continue to focus on controlling costs, and we were seeing a more favorable sales mix in that business, which has resulted in higher comparable segment operating earnings in the quarter and year-to-date.","","European third quarter operating results on a euro basis were up 8%, however, on a U.S.-dollar basis, were lower due to a weaker euro exchange rate. Year-over-year third quarter volume gains were somewhat offset by continuing price cost squeeze  in that beverage can business.","Third quarter earnings in the U.S. metal food and household products segment were less than expected due to Midwest drought, but slightly improved over last year. Year-to-date earnings in this business were below last year due to inventory gains made in 2011 that were not realized this year. With that said, we expect fourth quarter segment earnings to be noticeably higher in the fourth quarter of 2011 when we took a significant amount of manufacturing downtime for inventory control.","So far, 2002 (sic) [2012]  has been a successful but tough year, with customer volume shifts in 12-ounce, growing specialty can demand, challenging growing conditions for our food can customers and 3 new plants coming online. I'm proud of our people who have effectively managed through these challenges and opportunities and expect a good finish to the year.","With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.","John A. Hayes","Great. Thank you, Ray. Our aerospace business continued to perform well, with solid execution on existing programs and strong new wins that set us up well for the future.","Previously awarded fixed-price programs continue to ramp up and, as you can see from our better-than-expected segment earnings, program performance is quite good. Margins for the quarter remained in the double digits. And as I mentioned earlier, contracted backlog ended the quarter at $1.1 billion.","While uncertainty remains around the U.S. government plans and sequestration, Ball's strong track record should keep us well positioned no matter the outcome of this important issue.","In summary, after a very good 9-month performance which was slightly above our expectations, we remain on track to achieve our goal of 10% to 15% diluted earnings per share growth for 2012. While it's a bit premature to discuss our 2013 outlook, we are proactively focusing on cost optimization and growth opportunities that will drive future performance and continued strong free cash flow. We are on track to fill the gap in 2013 related to North American volume shift.","Further emerging market growth, mix shifts to more specialty containers, more normalized weather in North America and Europe and continued growth in aerospace all should serve as catalysts for good performance next year and beyond. We will continue our long-standing disciplined capital deployment strategy to return value to our shareholders, manage existing operations to match market demand and grow the EVA dollars we generate over the near and long term.","And with that, Amit, we're ready for questions.","Amit, if you would, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'll ask 3 questions and turn it over. First of all, Ray, could you give us a breakdown in the third quarter of what volumes were on a year-on-year basis? I think I saw in the press release and in your -- heard in your remarks more of a year-to-date comment. So could you run that by us in terms of a year-on-year for the third quarter volume progression?","Raymond J. Seabrook","You want that? Yes, I -- the -- in the North America\/Asia segment -- our North America business was up just slightly, and in China and Brazil, they were up -- they were both up in the 20% range. In Europe, we had a strong volume quarter. We had volumes up almost 10% in Europe. And of course, they were down in food and household.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Did you have a food and household number?","Raymond J. Seabrook","Yes. Remember, we've got an aerosol in the food business. So the aerosol was down about 4%, and food was down about 7%.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Next question, can you -- I think John mentioned that you're making progress to filling some of the volume that you had seen  shift this year for '13. If possible, could you provide a bit more color in terms of that process? And are you worried at all about perhaps some of the negative publicity around energy drinks recently, what that might mean in terms of your efforts and your customer's demand?","John A. Hayes","Yes, George. With respect to your first question, the -- with the closure of our Columbus facility and taking out effectively 4 lines, of  which 2, 2.5 were being utilized this year, we're going to be pretty tight next year overall.","Raymond J. Seabrook","Yes. George, I would tell you that, I think, next year, we look like we might have a half line open, which is fundamentally full.","John A. Hayes","Yes. Exactly. And so we feel pretty good about the necessary decisions we had to make there. Obviously, it's dependent upon what happens in the marketplace, but we're assuming a relatively flat market for 2013. And then with respect to your question about energy, no, we're not overly concerned. It's not a big part of our portfolio. It's certainly less than 5%. And if we had to, we could move that over into the beer segment relatively quickly because we have been running very strong on the specialty side of our house. And we continue to expect to have strong growth in that segment as well.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And last one, on aerospace, the backlog, nice pick up. Is there any way that you can comment, realizing a lot of these programs are in the black, in terms of where the backlog improvement was?","John A. Hayes","Yes. What I would tell you, George, is most of that backlog is, as you described, in the black. And so we really can't comment on it. But we have some -- there's certainly some good wins there that we feel good about.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi from Robert W. Baird.","Matthew R. Wooten - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","It's actually Matt Wooten sitting in for Ghansham today. With many in the industry adding specialty can capacity in North America, can you quantify the current pace of volume growth? And do have any concern about the specialty can capacity in the near term? And if not, how about over the next 2 to 3 years?","John A. Hayes","Well, our specialty growth has been quite strong over the past couple of years. I think I mentioned, on the second quarter, year-to-date, it was up mid-20%, and we continue that pace right now. So I think it's very strong. It's masking obviously the decline in 12-ounce. And what we're seeing from our customers, not only North America but around the world, increased emphasis and interest on specialty sizes, everything from a 5.5-ounce, all the way up to the jumbo can. In terms of new capacity coming on, there's a lot of growth that's occurring in it. We constantly monitor that. And obviously, we're not going to be doing anything that we don't have business contracted for like we always do. So no, as we sit here today, we're not overly concerned about it because it's a good news story with respect to the growth.","Matthew R. Wooten - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I appreciate the color. And then as a follow on and back to the aerospace business for a second, recognizing that backlog was really high, have you seen any signs or any negative implications of a pending fiscal cliff in the U.S.?","John A. Hayes","Well, the short answer is no because we've been given no guidance by the -- our customers on this, because I don't think they know what's going on. The one thing that I can tell you is many of these new projects, and somewhat,  most of our existing projects are of a strategic nature. And so we think, at least in the short term, they are reasonably well inoculated from any issues. Certainly we have some product lines that are more tactical in nature that could have some impact, but it's a very small part of our portfolio. So as we sit here today, we don't expect any meaningful dislocation relative to our business wins there. But obviously, time will tell. If it goes late into 2013, I think all cards are on the table. But as we sit here for the next, call it, 6 months or so, we feel pretty good.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Philip Ng from Jefferies.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I know it's still pretty early in the process, but how should we be thinking about pricing in 2013? I'm particularly interested in any color around Europe and China. I mean, demand\/supply  seems to be firming up in Europe, but a little more challenging in China.","Raymond J. Seabrook","Yes, I think you're right. China, fundamentally, we're sitting with a -- the industry is sitting with probably 25% excess capacity. That excess capacity is being eaten up pretty quickly by, obviously, the growth in the market. I would say that the next 18 to 24 months, we should see that excess capacity eaten up. But in China, the pricing is difficult. What's helping us in China obviously is the volume growth. So I would say, from a perspective, pricing is difficult but volume is making up for the difference. In Europe, again, there is a little bit of excess capacity in certain spots. It's probably more in the east than the west. And pricing has been difficult, but we are seeing signs of that starting to firm up a little bit.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And can you give us a sense of what your outlook is for growth in China? Because there is -- I mean, at least Alcoa lowered their guidance pretty sharply. I just want to get your view.","John A. Hayes","Yes. We actually even had a board meeting this past week in China. And the fundamentals, I think, still remain quite strong. Ray talked about the overcapacity, but there's a tremendous amount of can filling investment going in. And despite some of the slowdown on a GDP basis in China, the rise of the middle class is still continuing. This migration from the rural areas to the urban areas that we've discussed in the past is continuing on. Ray had mentioned earlier that our volume was quite strong, and I think the overall industry volume was good, largely because the can has a share, the package mix is small. And so I think -- certainly, there is -- like in any market that's growing so strongly, you're going to have hiccups here and there. But we think long term the China market is still going to be pretty healthy.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just one last final question for me. Historically speaking, you guys have allocated capital pretty evenly between CapEx, M&A and just returning cash to shareholders. 2012 was more of a robust year in terms of growth with Brazil and China.  You guys have done an incredible job of buying back stock. How should we be thinking about the split for 2013?","Scott C. Morrison","It's pretty early right now. But our balance sheet is in great shape, we don't have much in the way of current maturity. So we won't be paying down debt other than current -- what comes due. And growth CapEx is dependent upon the opportunities that present themselves. And absent that, we'll use most of the free cash flow to buy back our stock.","John A. Hayes","The third leg of that is the whole M&A side, and that's kind of like growth capital. It's opportunity-driven. And if we see good opportunities, which, from time to time we do -- witness the Envases transaction -- we'll utilize that. But you never -- we never go into any given year planning on spending x percent or x amount of dollars on M&A.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","From your vantage point, I guess, between -- the split between growth on the emerging market side versus M&A, would the bias be more towards M&A this year? I mean, for 2013?","John A. Hayes","We just -- our bias is returning capital in the most prudent way and creating value in the most prudent way for our shareholders. And so our M&A activities as well as our external growth opportunities are opportunity-specific. And so absent anything that, we're going to buy back -- continue to buy back our stock and return  that capital to  our shareholders.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon from Vertical Res.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Could you talk a little bit about -- it seems like, from what we've been hearing and -- from some of the beverage companies that the beer business in Europe has been a bit stronger than what you would think reading the headlines. And what do you ascribe that to? And is it mostly affecting the can business more than bottles? Or how would you view the beneficiary of that?","John A. Hayes","Well, I don't know if the beer business in Europe or at large is all that strong. I certainly know that the overall beer can market in Europe in the third quarter was relatively flat. Now a lot of that had to do with poor weather in Western Europe and the U.K. And I know the can has not been losing share in the beer market. So I think perhaps maybe better than expectations, but it's certainly not blowing the lights out.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Got you. It just looked like -- I asked that because SABMiller talked about having very strong volumes over there. But maybe it's just that one company.","John A. Hayes","Yes.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Yes. And then as a follow-up, and you might have addressed this, but given that one of your competitors has postponed some of their capital spending or projects in China and Brazil, do you think the longer-term outlook there isn't as strong as maybe you thought earlier? Or do you think it's more just tied to the economy? And I'm really thinking about China because I know you all pointed out a year ago how low the beer penetration is in cans versus other substrates when you look at China versus other parts of the world.","John A. Hayes","Yes. No, I --  we still think, long-term, the fundamentals are very strong. For example, the beer market in China year-to-date is up 6.5%, irrespective of package type. And so obviously, that's a good news story. I think really why some of these projects are sliding to the right, even for ourselves, has much to do with supply and demand and -- more than anything else. But as Ray pointed out, with the growth we're seeing in China, that could be sopped  up relatively quickly. And so you just got to -- we're keeping our eye on that and being close to our customers.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel from Wells Fargo Securities.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions for you. First, could you give us a little more color on the couple of acquisitions that you announced? The facility in Italy, how big is it, a couple of lines, et cetera, what you expect there, and is it full or capacity opportunity there, number one? And a little more color potentially on what you hope to do with the aerosol assets?","John A. Hayes","Well, first, with respect to the small Italian acquisition, that was, as I said, the beverage can portion of it. They had a very old, small outdated line that we're going to be taking out of their facility and moving those volumes into existing Ball facilities. And that will free up that existing line for deployment in other parts of the world as we continue to explore other geographies. With respect to Envases del Plata, we've talked over the last 18 months or so about our strategic thrust on the aluminum impact extruded side. We acquired Aerocan about 18 months ago, and this is just the logical next step. We're taking -- acquiring in its entirety their Mexican plant. And then we're joint venturing. We have at tinplate business down in Argentina. They obviously have an aluminum impact extruded. We share similar customers so we're forming a joint venture there with options in the future to either acquire it or dispose it back to the seller. We're in the midst of our due diligence now finalizing that, and we're subject to regulatory approval. And that's a little bit unknown right now, but we expect, as we sit here today, for these things to, most likely, close in the fourth quarter.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right.  The last 2 quick ones I had were, as you look globally at capacity, with volumes up so strong in Europe and then you talked about some of the elements here with Italy, it sounds like that's going to be folded into existing and can somewhat close. Do you -- I think you've -- are towards the end of your plant openings that you've announced globally with elements in Vietnam and China, et cetera. Do you envision any areas of the world where you might need further capacity as you look out the next year or two?","Raymond J. Seabrook","Brazil. We -- that new plant we just built -- we have a good customer that is just down the road. And we've just found out lately we have another  one of our good customer is also building a brewery down the road. So I think we're going to need more capacity in Brazil. And that's the immediate capacity that I see. John?","John A. Hayes","Yes. And probably, over the next year or two, we've talked about this before, but we're getting recently [ph] tight in Europe. We've had some pricing issues, and I think our #1 focus and priority is getting those pricing issues right before we focus on any incremental capacity. And so -- I think we talked about that either in the first or second quarter conference call. And so that's what -- our plan right now. But go to the longer term, if Europe at large continues to grow as it is, we are going to need some capacity. We just want to focus on getting our business right there, first.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes.  And then the last one is as you kind of [indiscernible] and went through some of the puts and takes, as you think about 2013, and then  you've got a couple of these acquisitions to add, you still have some flow-through from plants you've brought online as they come up the learning curve. You've got some headwinds here in North America with business moving around, although you've done good work to fill those in. As you think about all these and put them together, does 2013, in your mind, seem to shake out as though you can still kind of fit within your long-term earnings growth objective?","John A. Hayes","It's premature to say that right now because obviously, we're in the midst of our planning process. But what I'd tell you is, largely because of the North American volume shift, we -- our guys have done a great job of clawing back to profitability in that business. But it took away some of the upside in it. So as we sit here right now -- it probably would be difficult to certainly get to the upper end of that range, but we're certainly focused on trying to achieve that lower end of the range, yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson from KeyBanc.","Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","What volume trends did you experience in Europe intra-quarter? And what regional differences existed, if any?","Raymond J. Seabrook","Well, as I said, we had a very strong volume quarter in the third quarter in our European beverage can. And that's mainly because -- if you remember, last year, summer didn't show up in Europe. So the last year's third quarter was dreadful. So that's why I think probably everybody was up fairly substantial in the third quarter. Year-to-date, we're up about 5%, with the market growing about 3%. And for us, our business is primarily concentrated in Western Europe. Of course, we do have operations in Eastern Europe. And Western Europe was a little bit stronger-growing than East Europe. John, do you have anything to add?","John A. Hayes","The only outlier to what Ray just said was the U.K., where the weather was atrocious throughout the second and third quarter. And I think overall volumes, from an industry and for ourselves, were down in the U.K. But outside of that, Ray is spot on.","Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And just one for Scott. Scott, by roughly how much have your CapEx expectations come down for this year?","Scott C. Morrison","Well, as we've moved through the year, things have kind of slid to the right a little bit. That's why I've said for -- the most we've spent in a quarter -- we spent a little over $200 million through 9 months. And the most we've spent in a quarter historically is about $140 million. That's why I think we're going to trend lower than the $350 million. How much lower depends on how much -- how many things get closed out by the end of the year versus sliding to the right a little bit.","Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Right. But you would -- I would expect, in the future, you'd still be spending in excess of the $200 million of maintenance CapEx?","Scott C. Morrison","Yes. We're still seeing growth opportunities. We're seeing selective places where we still want to deploy capital and where we can get the returns. So we're going to continue to do that.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to follow up on the 2013, just referencing some commentary from the last quarter call about Americas\/Asia.  You've been talking a couple of times on this call about the gap that you have to fill for the capacity closure. Is it fair to say that -- with the commentary hopefully better than flattish, I think was the comment made last quarter for what next year's EBIT could look like in this segment. Is that a fair characterization, that it would be kind of somewhere between flattish and what you're seeing this year, kind of in the low-single digits? Or how are you thinking about that? Is there a risk that it's actually down next year, that you actually -- you have something else to make up for?","Raymond J. Seabrook","Yes. I think it was me that made that comment. And what I would tell you is that we've been very fortunate in the U.S. We've filled up -- we pretty much filled up the open capacity that we had. I said I think we have about a half line open in all of our system in the U.S. for '13, and that's pretty much full. And we expect  -- Brazil is still growing for us, and we're expecting another very strong year in Brazil. And while price is very difficult in China, volume is very good. So as we sit here today, I would tell you, I expect it to be up a little bit from where it is this year.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. Okay.  And then just on China, just out of curiosity, I mean, there's -- it's a more fragmented market than the other markets. So with some of the slowing growth and the excess capacity there, would you think that there's a possibility that this market kind of consolidates sooner than we might have otherwise thought, maybe 6 to 12 months ago?","John A. Hayes","I think that's a fair comment. And I think there's a reasonable shot at something like that. You just think about what we've done and then what we read about what our competitors have done in terms of things sliding to the right. I think there is a general recognition that there is overcapacity. And typically, when the industries have overcapacity, there's consolidation. So obviously we keep our eyes open to those types of things all the time. And if it makes sense, we'd certainly look at it.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just on kind of Asia in general. One of your peers has pretty significant exposure in Asia x China. You kind of made the move in Vietnam. How are you thinking about perhaps other markets throughout Asia at this stage? Is this -- would this be a goal over the next couple of years? Or just how are you thinking about that?","John A. Hayes","Yes, I think it's certainly an objective. You all know that through a joint venture, we've had an interest in Thailand for a long time and with that same partner, we've moved into Vietnam. And I think there's other opportunities, if they make sense, that we'd certainly look at them with our partners like that. So it's a been a good partnership. There's good growth throughout Southeast Asia from a volume perspective. And if we can make the economics work, we'd certainly take a look at it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Debbie Jones from Deutsche Bank.","Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I was just wondering if we could go back to Brazil, the comments you made about the new capacity coming on. I'm wondering if we should expect an even bigger volume bump in the next quarter as you continue to ramp up. It was my impression that when you did -- I think it was Tres Lagos [ph]? Please correct me if I'm wrong -- 2011, that that ramp up went pretty quickly? And then I guess my follow-up on that would be do you see the need to add more capacity in that region over the next few years? Are you happy with your current footprint or where you would actually just add another line at one of these facilities? Or would you expect that you need to move out of that area?","Raymond J. Seabrook","Well, for us -- remember, Brazil this year started off very, very slowly. We had a very, very slow first quarter in Brazil. And the second quarter was better, but it was still very, very slow. And then they were going to have a tax on beverages, and they've moved that back. And in the third quarter, it's really taken off for us, and we're expecting a very strong fourth quarter as well. As I said before, at least initially, we're not -- we're going to fill out plants as opposed to building another plant. We've only got one line in that new Alagoinhas plant we built, and there's certainly room for some more capacity to be added in there, and that's what I would expect to happen in the next very short period.","Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just kind of moving out of region,  we haven't discussed -- I've seen a lot of announcements of capacity coming on in South Africa, and I believe some of the major players provide either technology or ends to that market. And I'm just wondering if that will ever become a market that you guys might be willing to move into?","John A. Hayes","Well, the short answer is we take a look at markets like that all the time. It's a market where the can demand has not been growing, and they're having some economic difficulties down there. So I wouldn't expect anything, in the very short term, for us to be doing anything. But we do, from time to time, look at opportunities like that. And if we can make economic sense, as I said before, we would certainly proceed on  -- with those.","Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then if I could just ask one more question on China. We've asked a lot about the need for more consolidation in that market, and my characterization has always been that the existing players would probably want a little bit more than what you or some of your peers would be willing to pay. And I'm just wondering what kind of the strategy would be, if there are not some smaller, maybe self-manufacturers or single-plant players that you guys think you might be able to consolidate over the next year or so. That would be helpful.","John A. Hayes","Well, I think, as I said before, generally speaking, when there is overcapacity in markets, you see consolidation. And usually, what happens is the big -- the strong remain strong, and the weak ones are the ones that are consolidated. So it falls directly in line with what you were just saying. And if it works for us from an economic point of view, from a geographic footprint point of view and from a customer portfolio point of view, we'd certainly look at it.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Al Kabili from Credit Suisse.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just first question is on free cash flow. And certainly, the working capital improvement this year is impressive. I was just wondering what you think of the opportunity next year along those lines? Is the free cash flow next year sustainable relative to this year? You have CapEx down, but working cap might be hard to repeat. I just wanted to get some thoughts around that.","Scott C. Morrison","We've had a number of good programs that are benefiting us this year on the working capital front. We have some things that are yet to come that will happen next year. So I -- while it's too early to call what working capital will look like next year, I'm still fairly positive on how that will develop next year. So I don't think it's -- I don't think we're going to have to give anything back that we got this year necessarily.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. All right. And then also, related on -- just a quick housekeeping question on corporate costs. What should we be thinking about going forward? I know the second quarter was a little bit lower than I was expecting, at least -- or the third quarter, I'm sorry.","Scott C. Morrison","Yes, they ran a little -- full year is going to run closer to $65 million because of the benefit that we got in the third quarter. On a full -- in a typical year, it should run a little bit higher than that. We had some unusual benefits in the third quarter that won't repeat themselves in the fourth quarter.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, okay. Got it. All right. Last question is just on -- is on the rationalizations in North American beverage. Is there a way to help us think about what the fixed cost reduction is associated with those? Or -- we know you're going to -- there's some volume loss there. Kind of help us with  maybe what some of the offsetting is on the footprint side.","John A. Hayes","Well, if you recall, in the past, when we've closed facilities, we said the fixed cost savings was -- depending on facility, was in the range of $25 million or so. The Columbus plant was a little bit bigger than a typical plant, and we closed an end facility as well. So you should expect the fixed cost savings to be north of that. That's one of the reasons why both Ray and I said that we feel reasonably comfortable that we'll be able to claw back most if not all of the shortfall relative to volume loss.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner from Barclays.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Question is just around the share repurchase. I think you said, now that you're going to do about -- at least $500 million of share repo in 2012, if I look on the second quarter call, I think you were at $275 million year-to-date. It looks like, at the end of the 3 quarter, you bought back about $300 million of shares. How should we think about the timing of that? How do you sort of look at that and decide when is the best time to do share repo, or -- how do you think about that as we move into the balance of the year?","Scott C. Morrison","Well -- I mean, obviously, we try to be opportunistic if we can. But to buy $200 million in the last quarter, you've got to be buying it everyday.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right.  Okay. So you're actively in the market. I mean, is there a period -- a window when you have to -- when you're no longer allowed to buy near the end of the year? Or you can buy all the way through the year?","Scott C. Morrison","You could put a variety of programs in place to be able to buy through blackout periods. That's usually not problematic.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Looking at the North American slugs business, right, you've got significant market share there. You did an aerosol acquisition. What do you think about overall vertical integration of that business longer term? Do you think there's a -- do you have a target rate for vertical integration, or do you -- pretty comfortable with where you stand currently?","John A. Hayes","I think we're pretty comfortable with where we stand currently. We got in the business because as we started to explore the aluminum impact extruded, we realized the importance of having good quality slugs to make good quality containers, and that was the business premise behind getting in that. And so that hasn't changed at all. And so it is a good source of quality slugs for us. And then we don't have to point fingers at our suppliers.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right. Okay. And then just lastly, I think somebody earlier talked about the negative publicity around energy drinks and the impact on your business. But I sort of look at it from a different angle. Is that -- maybe this is an opportunity for you. We've heard a lot about reclosable and resealable options for cans. It doesn't seem to have been adopted very much, whether -- at least in North America. Do you think this is maybe an opportunity for you to advance some of the reclosable and resealable innovation that you have?","John A. Hayes","Well, it very well could be. Whether you want to talk about the Alumi-Tek bottle, you want to talk about the resealable end that we produced in Europe -- but actually, we do sell it here in North America. I do think whether it's energy drink or whether it's anything that is looking at portion control, there are opportunities there. And our business development folks are actively pursuing those.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alton Stump from Longbow Research.","Alton K. Stump - Longbow Research LLC","I just wanted to get back to European bev cans. Obviously, this has already been asked, but I was shocked at how good that number was. I get the fact that the comp was easy. But just with how poor weather was, particularly in northern Europe in the quarter, is there any certain thing, or are you able to identify as to how much lift you think you got  -- obviously from either the Olympics, or maybe a tail end of the Cup games, if that helps at all, either -- if there's something else going on there that drove that huge 10% growth number?","John A. Hayes","I think the biggest thing actually when you take a look at it from a volume perspective was the Benelux region was quite strong. And what's in the Benelux region is largely multinational beer companies that export out of that area into other geographies. And I think we're the -- a beneficiary of that. So if we had to isolate it to one thing, that was probably the biggest surprise relative to our own internal expectations.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question is a follow-up question, comes from the line of Chris Manuel from Wells Fargo Securities.","Gabe S. Hajde - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A quick follow-up, this is actually Gabe. In China, is there -- are there any sort of anti-competitive issues that would preclude you from making a purchase in any particular region within China, given that it's obviously a large country?","John A. Hayes","I think that that's such a general question, it's too difficult to answer. Obviously, we would have to be mindful that if we were to acquire something that was adjacent or very close to one of our facilities, in the absence of other competitors in the region, obviously that would be a challenge. But I think there's enough competitors out there that we could probably weave our way through.","Operator","There are no further questions from the phone lines at this time, Mr. Hayes. I will now turn the call back to you.","John A. Hayes","Okay, great. Well, thanks, Amit, and thank you everyone. I just want to remind everyone that our January earnings call will take place on Thursday, January 31, 2013. So we look forward to having a strong finish to the year, and we'll talk to you then.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, January 30, 2014. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, Chairman, President and CEO. Please go ahead, sir.","John A. Hayes","Thank you, Reynaldo, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's fourth quarter and full year 2013 results.","The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings, as well as company news releases.

Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website.","Now joining me on the call today is Scott Morrison, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'll provide a brief overview of the company's performance, Scott will discuss financial and global packaging metrics, and then I'll finish up with comments on our aerospace business and the outlook for 2014.","Our fourth quarter results came in ahead of expectations, and full year cash flow was right on track. As we mentioned in our third quarter conference call, we've seen momentum in our business from a financial perspective. And as we move into 2014, we are well positioned from a capacity utilization and product mix perspective, and we remain excited about our prospects. Excellent cost management across our global packaging businesses; volume growth in Europe, Brazil and our specialty can portfolio in North America; key aerospace program deliveries and our disciplined returns-oriented capital allocation strategy all drove results.","2013 was truly a tale of 2 halves. The first half with stronger-than-anticipated market and economic headwinds and the second half filled with additional cost optimization project rollouts, line startups and a return to more normalized demand for our food and beverage containers all helped contribute to this improved performance.","Now during the first -- fourth quarter, we continued to see double-digit growth for specialty cans in the Americas. We further improved our operating costs in our European segment, with the administrative office relocation on track for completion at the end of the first quarter 2014. We started up the second line in our Alagoinhas, Brazil, beverage can manufacturing plant, which contributed favorably to results and is ready to meet our customers' needs for specialty cans in the 2014 World Cup. We ramped up production at our existing Foshan, China plant after the relocation of our Shenzhen equipment. We continued down the path of further optimizing our steel food and household manufacturing footprint in North America. And lastly in the quarter, we announced the redemption of our 2019 senior notes that will lower interest expense in 2014, which Scott will discuss shortly.","Our focused efforts to identify pockets of growth and manage our cost structure are bearing fruit and will drive EVA dollar and cash flow generation in 2014 and beyond.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott for a review of our full year and fourth quarter numbers. Scott?","Scott C. Morrison","Thanks, John. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share for 2013 were $3.28 versus last year's $3.06. And in the fourth quarter, comparable diluted earnings per share were $0.86 versus last year's $0.64, a 34% increase.","For the full year, the following factors contributed to improved results: excellent cost management across the businesses; a full year contribution from line 1 at the Alagoinhas, Brazil plant and the Mexican extruded aluminum facility acquisition; a lower effective tax rate; and a lower share count. Also, FX translation related to European operations positively impacted full year 2013 EPS by $0.03.","Turning to free cash flow, Ball generated $461 million in 2013. Again, we returned every free cash flow dollar and more to shareholders via net share buyback of approximately $400 million and dividends of more than $75 million. Net balance sheet debt at the end of the year was approximately $3.2 billion. Credit quality and liquidity of the company remains solid, with a 2013 comparable EBIT-to-interest coverage of 4.8x and net debt-to-comparable EBITDA at 2.7x. Cash was higher than usual at year end due to the planned redemption of the 2019 senior notes, which was completed on January 10, 2014. Committed credit and available liquidity at year end was in excess of $1 billion. For a complete summary of the full year and fourth quarter results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, please refer to the Notes section of today's earnings release.","Moving to operations, our metal beverage Americas and Asia segment comparable earnings were down roughly $11 million for the full year and up $9 million in the fourth quarter. Year-over-year benefit from the 12-ounce can and end plant rationalizations, cost containment programs, excellent operating performance at the plant level and continued double-digit specialty can growth in the Americas all contributed to better segment results.","In the quarter, North America volumes continued to be sluggish for standard cans in the carbonated soft drink category. However, Brazil volumes were up double digits and our China volumes were flat, as we continue to run at very high utilization rates, and we continue to make disciplined decisions to not add capacity in an oversupplied market.","European segment profit was flat for the full year and increased almost $10 million in the fourth quarter due to mid-single-digit volume growth and initial benefits of reduced labor costs, which will continue to flow through the segment in 2014 and into '15.","Food and household comparable segment earnings were flat in the quarter due to mid-single-digit volume declines for steel food cans in North America. And for the full year, earnings improved roughly $10 million due to the contribution from last year's December's Mexico extruded aluminum plant acquisition and excellent operating performance at our remaining global manufacturing locations. As John mentioned earlier, our global manufacturing operations are starting to be rewarded for their incredible efforts to improve their cost structure and cash flow.","Moving on to financial metrics for the full year 2014, interest expense will be in the range of $163 million. Full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings is expected to be approximately 27% to 28%. And for modeling purposes, remember that the first quarter of 2013 benefited from 2 R&D tax credits. We expect full year corporate expense to be approximately $73 million. CapEx should be in the range of $375 million, and free cash flow will be in the range of $550 million. And the majority of our free cash flow is expected to be returned to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends.","Yesterday, the board increased the share repurchase authorization by 20 million shares, so we have plenty of room and expect to buy around $500 million net shares in 2014.","With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.","John A. Hayes","Great. Thanks, Scott. Our aerospace business performed very well in the quarter and full year against a difficult comp. Solid execution on existing programs and some early deliveries drove performance, quite an accomplishment given the disruptive U.S. government circumstances in the first and second half of 2013. Contracted backlog ended the year at $938 million versus $942 million a quarter earlier and approximately $1 billion at the end of 2012.","During the quarter, the STPSat-3 satellite for the U.S. Air Force was successfully launched from NASA's Wallops Flight Center. The final 3 mirror segments for the James Webb Space Telescope arrived at Goddard Space Flight Center, and the Ball-built GMI instrument arrived in Japan for the upcoming launch onboard NASA's Global Precipitation Measurement satellite. The GPM satellite and GMI instruments are part of an international satellite constellation that will capture next-generation observations of rain and snow worldwide every 3 hours, as well as 3D views of hurricanes and snowstorms, aiding weather prediction.","With the recent 2-year budget agreement, we are starting to see things in Washington have a bit more visibility than we have had in the past several years. Our aerospace team is awaiting decisions later in 2014 on several key program awards so that they can move forward with what they do best, providing affordable solutions for scientific discovery and national security.","Now looking out across our company today, we will generate positive returns in 2014 on the growth capital invested in 2013. In Europe beverage, operating margins are improving as volume has recovered, and our ongoing cost optimization programs will provide further upside. In our global food and household products packaging business, we are laser-focused on maximizing returns across our steel product lines and positioning our extruded aluminum manufacturing capabilities to serve our global customers' filling locations. And most of all, we are proud of our employees and their resolve to execute on projects and programs to improve our company's performance. Truly exceptional. Given our operational momentum, excellent working capital management and reduced capital expenditures, as Scott mentioned, we expect 2014 free cash flow generation to be in the range of $550 million.","In summary, we believe, at this time, we are on track to grow our EVA dollars and achieve our long-term diluted EPS growth goal of 10% to 15% in 2014 and beyond.","And with that, Reynaldo, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Adam Josephson from KeyBanc.","Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","John, can you talk about what's driving the strength in European beverage volume? I know you said it was mid-single digits. It was up, I think, 7% last quarter. I know you're levered to beer in that segment, and SABMiller recently talked about sluggish trends. So just trying to understand what's happening in your business that might be different from what some of your customers might be experiencing.","John A. Hayes","Well, I think a couple of things. I do think the can is improving its share of the overall package mix, not only with beer but even on the soft drinks side. So that's one big factor. I think the other one is geography. And as you all know, we're a bit more weighted to Western Europe, obviously, some presence in Eastern Europe, but where we don't have presence, really, in much of Southern Europe. And when you look as an industry where the growth has been coming from, it's really been coming from France, from Germany, from the U.K., from those places that I talked about in the third quarter. The first half of the year, recall, the weather was very terrible, and so volume was actually down in those regions. But in the second half of the year, it rebounded and it proved to be quite nice for us.","Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. In terms of EBIT this year, John, do you expect European beverage to be up more than Americas and Asia beverage? And can you quantify the potential benefit from the cost savings in Europe that you've discussed in '14 and going into '15?","John A. Hayes","Yes, well, we've talked in prior conference calls about our -- we expect to get back to the 2010, 2011 margin profile that we had in the European business. We actually had a very good second half of the year, but we still have opportunities, as Scott had mentioned, on the cost-out programs. So as we go into 2014, I think with normalized volumes, and that, obviously, we're sitting here in January so that's always a question mark, but with normalized volume, we continue to see progression in the EBIT growth of that business, largely through the cost-out programs and just maintaining our share of the European beverage can market.","Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And just one last one, just on the LME aluminum premium situation in Europe. Can you just discuss your exposure to that issue?","Scott C. Morrison","Yes, the way we contract our business here, we don't really have any exposure in North America. And in Europe, I think I mentioned on the third quarter call, it had been a headwind for a while in Europe through '13. And if it stays elevated at these levels, we probably have some exposure to the tune of maybe EUR 5 million, but more on the back half of the year if it stayed at these levels for all year.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess, first question I had is regarding China now. Obviously, your operating rates are quite high because of what you've been doing with capacity relative to demand. Is it possible from where you sit right now to discuss when you think the industry will be in a better state of balance, say, above 90%?","John A. Hayes","I think, George, let's start with the demand side and then we'll go to the supply side. On the demand side, overall industry volume growth continues to grow strongly, mid-single digits. We did not participate this year because we're pretty tight. And remember, we had -- in the second half of the year, we were moving some of our capacity from Shenzhen to Foshan, and so we were a bit short relative to that. And so we'll be able to capture our fair share of the growth this year. On the supply side, that's really the question mark. And I think over the -- there continues to be some of the smaller players adding capacity in. I think from a cost perspective, we feel like we're in pretty good shape, and so -- to ride out this wave. But if -- to give you an exact time or date on when the industry may get to 90%, I honestly think it's premature, and I would be speculating on it. I think we continue to expect the market to be growing mid-double digits. I'm sorry. I might have said mid-single digits in China growth, I meant mid-double digits. And so the volume side, demand side is growing quite strong. It's just when do people take a pause in terms of the capital growth so the supply can catch up with demand -- or demand can catch up with supply, I mean.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. But that in itself is saying something because the market is still growing mid-double digits and you're not sure when you get back to 90%, not blaming you guys here, nonetheless it tells you that there's still a fairly large amount of excess capacity to be absorbed. You would agree with that, correct?","John A. Hayes","I would agree. This time last year, George, we thought that there's arguably 25% overcapacity. And as -- despite the mid-teens growth in 2013, I don't think that changed materially, which, by definition, means some of the people kept adding capacity.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Same question. In Europe, where would you say operating rates are for you or for the industry, to the extent that you can comment? And then I had a follow-on on North America, and I'll turn it over after that question.","John A. Hayes","I think for us, we are sold out. We are full. And I think for the industry, it's pretty full as well. Obviously, on a regional side, you have pockets here and there. And, of course, even we may have very small pockets, depending on what the regional geographies are. But overall, I think the industry is reasonably tight, and we certainly are tight.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","The last question, John, in North America. Is there a volume decline in standard cans in the next couple of years that would either, on one hand, create diseconomies for you in terms of managing the remaining 12-ounce demand in the market from your existing network of plants, or one of the things you've been obviously doing is converting your 12-ounce to custom cans and that seems to be working well, that to absorb whatever level of decline might happen in 12-ounce would then risk saturating the custom can market from capacity standpoint? I know there isn't perhaps a single number, but how would you have us think about what the rates of decline might need to be to get to that point?","John A. Hayes","Yes, I think the answer to your question largely hinges on what happens with soft drink. CSD has really been the softness in terms of not only the can business, but I think the overall liquid consumption business. And we have -- we expect to have continued declines on the CSD side. I think 2014 is going to be real important to help answer that question because you're going to see natural sweeteners start to come out. And the question is, can the soft drink industry really strive to arrest these declines they've been having. To answer your question specifically, I think it's much more complicated than just having the numbers saying at what decline rate do you -- the oversaturation. I think we've been pretty disciplined over the last few years, and we've been doing it in our own economic best interest. Just looking at the past 12 years, we closed Columbus, we closed the Gainesville end plant, then we closed Milwaukee. That was in part. But at the same time, we also took some existing 12-ounce and converted. So I think that model, you can't do that forever, obviously, and we're very cognizant of that. But we're also cognizant of maintaining a tight supply\/demand, at least in our system.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird & Co.","Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","It's actually Mehul Dalia sitting in for Ghansham. In European bev cans, just wondering if you could parse out demand trends in Western Europe versus Eastern Europe during the quarter?","John A. Hayes","We typically don't go into that level of granularity. But what I will tell you is Western Europe, the growth in Western Europe, the overall industry was up low- to mid-single digits, and there's a little bit more on Western Europe and a little bit less in Eastern Europe.","Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And I'm just curious as to any progress on the BPA-free coatings for the food can market. Can you just kind of update us as to what your customers are thinking there?","John A. Hayes","Yes, I think it's been relatively quiet on that. From a technical perspective, we have solutions is the most important thing to say. There is a cost implication to that, and I don't believe our customers have felt the need to convert and look at the relative costs of that without any real either legislative reason or economic business reason. And so right now, it's more in a holding pattern.","Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And just one last one. Was there any benefit from the World Cup in 4Q for you guys? And if so, could you quantify the impact?","John A. Hayes","Well, other than America being qualified, I don't think we have any benefit. But I do expect that, certainly, in the second quarter, that's when we would expect to -- late second quarter and third quarter, expect to see the benefit.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Philip Ng with Jefferies.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Your EBIT margin for Americas and Asia was up pretty dramatically. Can you parse out how much of that was Brazil, China, or just better mix in North America? And going forward, is that sustainable? I do understand there's some seasonality in the business.","Scott C. Morrison","Yes, Phil, this is Scott. We're coming off relatively easier comps from last year's fourth quarter, yet metal down year-over-year, which will help margin percentage. You had volume growth in Brazil, and you had volume in China and great cost controls in North America and China, and specialty growth in North America. All those things kind of played into why the margins were where they're at. And that's about as specific as I'm going to get.","John A. Hayes","And the only other thing that -- in North America, we had a decline of 12-ounce, which is a low-margin product.","Scott C. Morrison","True.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then can you give us some color on North America food on pricing for this year? I understand one of your customers is in bankruptcy. That could actually get sold off to a self-manufacturer. There's some noise in the marketplace with new capacity coming on in 2015.","Scott C. Morrison","Well, let me address the customer bankruptcy issue, because we took a charge in the third quarter for a portion of the receivable that we had owing from that customer. There's going to be an auction for that company that will occur next week, and we'll see the outcome of that, what the outcome of that auction is, if we have to make any changes to what we've already taken from a reserve standpoint. And if we have to change anything, we'll either do that in the 10-K or sooner. And in terms of the pricing environment overall, I'd say it's relatively stable.","John A. Hayes","Yes. There really -- there's no appreciable change in pricing in our customer base. And largely, we often look at the metal side of the business, and there's really no significant change we're talking about on the metal side. So I don't -- we don't see any big changes one way or the other right now.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, on Europe bev, from what I understand, some of your competitors saw a modest lift, at least, on pricing last year, and the market appears to be still pretty tight. Is that going to be a positive tailwind in '14 or is it going to be pretty flat as well?","John A. Hayes","I think reasonably flat. The reality is Europe is -- the economic declines experienced over the past few years in Europe are -- have flattened out. But the economy is not strong. I do think that this whole supply chain of virtually every industry has continued to be under cost pressure and trying to take costs out of the system. And so I would not expect any appreciable change relative to the pricing environment.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I wanted to talk a little bit about capital allocation. If I look at your early-on comments of $461 million of cash flow from 2013, almost all of it returned to shareholders. And it looks like, if I heard the commentary correctly, that the plan for 2014 is very similar. And so I'm wondering, is that a comment indirectly on the outlook for the M&A environment and the ability for you to grow via acquisition?","John A. Hayes","Not necessarily. What I would say is we're always spending a fair amount of time on acquisition. And you often aren't given credit for the things either you pass on, but that doesn't mean there isn't a lot of activity going on. As you know, we are a very disciplined company when it comes to capital allocation. And when interest rates are very low, we buy things for the long term. And when interest rates are low, you have to compete with private equity and other firms like that. And so we haven't found anything, at least in the recent past, that has met our return requirements. And absent finding good return projects, we're going to return our value back to our shareholders either through share repurchase and\/or dividends, and that is one reason why our board authorized a 20 million share repurchase authorization yesterday. Scott, anything to add?","Scott C. Morrison","No, I think that's right. The cash machine has kind of grown to a point where we can do a lot of things at the same time. So we're able to still invest. We still have some growth capital in the 2014 budget. And John talked about some of the growth capital that we spent in '13, that we'll start getting the returns on in '14. And we're still able to buy back a lot of stock. And so we'll still be able to do both of those things. And hopefully, acquisitions will come along that have good value, where we could get the kind of returns we want. But we don't need to be stretching for anything. And so we'll continue to be disciplined.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And the competitive environment within the acquisition market, specifically versus private equity, I guess I've heard some commentary that in this environment, they're not able to lever up as much as they used to on some acquisitions. Are you -- and, therefore, strategics are not as disadvantaged when it comes to acquisitions. Is that something you've been running into as well?","John A. Hayes","I guess, on the margin, but it's -- in this environment, capital is still quite available, and interest rates remain quite low. And so I think it's just you have a much broader set of competition. But I don't think there's any -- been significant change over the last, call it, 6 months or so, no.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And just last question on the CapEx, $375 million. I mean, it looks like maybe you underspent a little bit versus plan in 2013. Is that just a rollover or is there something in that $375 million -- it was about $50 million more than what we forecast, not you, but our forecast. Is there something in there that we're not aware of?","Scott C. Morrison","There are some things in there that you're probably not aware of, but we're not ready to talk about them in total yet. I mean, part of it is carrying capital from last year, because we underspent what we thought we would spend. So a little bit shifted to the right. But there's still some growth projects that we're going after that we're just not ready to talk about at this point.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And those are growth projects meant to fill the gap in 2015. Is that how we should kind of think about that?","Scott C. Morrison","No, they're growth projects that have good long-term returns to them. It has nothing to do with what year they're in. It's just the opportunity that's coming. It's getting to maturity. And we think we have good contracts to support the capital that we would spend.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","I noticed, and I don't know if you addressed this, John, the aerospace margins were sort of the highest I'd ever seen, or at least in a very long time. Was that sort of a onetime wonder getting the 20 -- the 12 percentage-type margins that I think you made close to $25 million last quarter?","John A. Hayes","Yes, don't think that's sustainable. I do think we had some early deliveries and some other things, including some execution on existing programs, that made it really more of a onetime bump in the margin. I think as we look out into '14, margins for the full year '14 should be comparable to the full year '13.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Got you. And then I don't know if, Scott, you've specifically mentioned it, but what is the change in the cash pension contribution rate in '14 versus '13? So, I guess, what were those numbers? And how does that compare to the book expense for both years?","Scott C. Morrison","Well, the expense from '13 to '14 will be down $15 million to $20 million because of interest rates and a variety of things. The cash funding will be down considerably because we did fund up -- in the fourth quarter, we did fund up our pension more. And so it will be down considerably.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Like 50 or...","Scott C. Morrison","More than 50.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay. Got you. And then last question. I don't think this was asked, but -- or maybe I missed it, but you mentioned the specialty can volumes were sluggish in 12-ounce in North America. I don't know if you gave a more specific number and\/or if you could tell us what specialty can volumes did in North America in the fourth quarter year-over-year.","John A. Hayes","Yes, the 12-ounce was sluggish, and I think -- I don't have the numbers in front of me, but they were certainly down as an industry mid-single digits, if not a little touch more than that. Specialty volumes, for us, we've said for the full year -- I think the fourth quarter and the full year were about the same, which was kind of mid-teens.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Up mid-teens. Got you.","John A. Hayes","Yes.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions for you here. First, when we look -- one of the businesses that you didn't particularly highlight in here was the extruded aluminum. Can you talk about maybe what you're seeing there with respect to opportunities? I know that in the past, it's been an area you've targeted for some growth and, in particular, potentially some more lines. Can you maybe give us an update as to how that business is progressing?","John A. Hayes","Yes. Chris, that's a good question. It's -- we have, over the past few years, really put some focus on that in terms of growing that business, both organically and inorganically, via acquisition. I think our European business continues to grow well. Volume has slowed down a little bit in Europe over the past few years because of the economy. We were up slightly. And I think the folks over there are doing a great job. As you all know, in December, 13 months ago, we acquired the Mexican plant, and that facility has -- the volumes are still growing double digits, kind of mid -- low- to mid-teens. We wish they were growing a little bit higher, to be quite frank, but I think that's going well. And from an acquisition, as well as a greenfield perspective, we still have opportunities to expand our footprint. And we've been looking at serving our customers, whether it's here in North America or whether it's in Europe or other parts of the world. We continue to be focused on that. I think there's going to be some opportunities as we move forward into '14 and even beyond.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. And that's kind of a good segue to -- when I think about the $175 million this year of growth capital that you've got chartered in there, and I also appreciate you don't want to get too granular at this juncture on what you're doing, I anticipate you'll probably give us more color as the year progresses. But when I think about the -- I said growth capital, I meant return-oriented capital. Give us maybe a sense of what the balance is between growth-oriented projects and what might be more cost takeout or other efficiency projects as we think about those.","John A. Hayes","Yes, of the -- so let's break this down. Of the $375 million of capital that Scott mentioned, our maintenance capital, if you will, is in the range $175 million to $200 million. And within that maintenance, there's always a level of cost-out in that, whether it's getting more efficient on the energy side or other things like that. But the additional, call it, $175 million of what we call is growth capital, not too much of that is in terms of just pure cost-out. It really is growth. I just mentioned impact extruded. There are some opportunities in there of broadening our geographic reach on the impact extruded side from a greenfield perspective. On the beverage can side, there's opportunities in there. I don't think on the aerospace side, over a couple of years ago, we significantly expanded our ability to manufacture satellites in our Boulder facility, so there's not a lot in there. So it really is beverage cans and impact extruded. And I focused it in broadening our geographic reach and in terms of new products and new capabilities.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. Last quick one I had was, in the past, we've talked about -- you've given some color about what's happening in China with respect to the growth and that you anticipate being able to capitalize a little better on it this year. Could you give us some color as to what the pricing environment has been like in relation to the capacity that's still there? Has it stabilized, been more constructive, continued to be more challenging? How would you maybe give us some thoughts there?","John A. Hayes","There hasn't -- I think I said on the third quarter, that China remains difficult. I don't -- it's not going down appreciably, but there have been pockets of softening -- continued softness on the pricing side and -- which is challenging. And it gets to the question I think George asked earlier about supply\/demand dynamics. Until supply dynamics become more in favor, I just -- we're not anticipating upside in pricing.","Scott C. Morrison","So we're focused a lot on the cost side. Our guys are doing a great job on the cost side, which is helping the business, but prices aren't getting any better right now.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","You referenced can demand improving in Europe, or rather can's share of the overall package market in Europe improving in both beer and CSD. And I'm wondering if it's possible to quantify that. Is it something that's happening more at the margin? And then what is driving that from your perspective? Is it economic pressures, consumer preference? Is it something your customers are driving?","John A. Hayes","Well, I think the answer is yes to all of that. Just a little context. I think for the full year, the market grew 3%, 3.5% over in Europe. And again, Europe is a big place with many different geographies, so I'll generalize here. But Europe grew kind of low- to mid-single digits. I know that liquid consumption did not grow that much. And so by definition, the can took a little bit of share. Reasons why cans took a little bit of share, I think there are changing consumer preferences for one-way packaging over returnable bottles, and we've talked about that in the past. I do think that in some of the more mature economies, people are staying home a bit more and the can is more of a home package. So I think that has been helping. I think those are the 2 things that are probably driving this can share mix the most. It's not seismic. It's over time and gradual. And recall that relative to at least the United States, for example, the can as a share of the package mix is much smaller in Europe, writ large, than it is in the U.S. The U.S. on the beer side, it's over 50% of beer is consumed out of cans in North America. In Europe, writ large, it's in the low- to mid-20s.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Sure. Sure. And just as a follow-up. I mean, you're coming up on a very easy comp for Europe in the first quarter. I think January demand last year was reasonably strong, and then things really kind of melted down in March. I think there was some weather issues, and you had some other cost issues as well. But I'm just wondering, did the experience of first quarter 2013, in any way, change the way that you kind of forecast the full year? Did it make you more cautious? Or was that really just sort of a freak event from your perspective?","John A. Hayes","Well, I don't know if weather is a freak event. But demand, as we said this in the past, we had 2 quarters, the first and second last year, that were down year-over-year, and that hasn't happened too often in the decade we've been operating in Europe. In fact, it 2 out of 3 times happened last year, and it was both in the first half. I do think it was soft demand. Recall also, we talked about in mid to late 2012, we actually had moved our European headquarters from Germany into Switzerland, and we knew we had some redundant costs. And we were -- 2013 was an act to try and get after those costs. I think the lessons learned from the first half of last year was you can't rely on volume all the time, so you ought to be proactive and aggressive at all times about the cost side of the business. And I think our folks have responded very well. And that's why as we go into 2014, our cost programs are really executing well, while at the same time, if the volume is normalized, it provides a little bit of upside. And that's why I said earlier on, it is only January. If we could get through the first half of the year and volumes are normalized, we feel pretty good, but it's just too early to predict what the weather is going to do.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank.","Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I realize you guys don't have a crystal ball for Brazil, but what is [indiscernible] Ball assuming for the next year, if you could give some sort of range? And I believe the expectation is for one-way containers to outpace returnable glass next year. But looking out beyond that, do you think that a shift in the pack mix towards cans is still sustainable?","John A. Hayes","It's a good question, Debbie. And I think we're -- we expect 2014, because of the \"2 summer effect\" we've talked about, it to be positive. And with the World Cup being there, the can is a great one-way package. The can as a share of the package mix is approaching, at least on beer side, 40%. And I've mentioned a couple of minutes ago, in the U.S., it's over 50%. So there's probably some marginal improvement on that, but not wholesale improvement. And so as we go past 2014, we expect overall volumes to more closely reflect the overall beer growth. But in 2014, we do expect some nice growth.","Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then has your customer mix shifted materially over the last 6 months in Brazil at all with your new capacity?","John A. Hayes","No.","Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just a final question. What is your outlook for can demand in North America? And are you happy with your standard and specialty can footprint?","John A. Hayes","Well, on the standard 12-ounce containers, we expect continued declines on the soft drinks side. We expect flat to slight declines on the beer side. And we expect to continue the growth that we've seen on the specialty side. From a footprint perspective, as we sit here now, we feel good about our footprint. And we wish that 12-ounce was a bit stronger, but that's as much reliant upon consumer demand. And as we have shown over the years, we will do what's necessary and in our economic best interest to make sure we're maximizing the value of what we do.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Al Kabili with Macquarie.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Just wanted to dig in Europe bev on the -- on your market share. Has there been any change throughout the year in '13? And so far, what's the outlook for '14 in that regard?","John A. Hayes","No is the short answer. We just give you -- for the full year in 2013, as I said, the market was up 3%, 4%. We were up slightly less in that. A lot of it had to do with just timing and geography. As I mentioned, the first year was -- the first half was softer, the second half was a bit stronger. But there has been no appreciable change in that. In any given year, different things are happening with different customers, but no, there hasn't been any meaningful change.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then I just wanted to clarify on China as well. With the cost savings and optimization you're doing there, how are you -- but yet pricing still under some pressure. How are you thinking about overall profits in China in '14 versus '13?","Scott C. Morrison","I think that will get a little bit better. I mean, it's not going to be wholesale. But we took a big price hit last year, and I think we'll do a little bit better in '14, both from a volume standpoint and a cost-out standpoint.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Okay. Got it. And from a pricing perspective in the market, how would you characterize '14 versus '13? Is the magnitudes of the declines lessening there or similar? I know we're not fully wrapped up there yet, but in terms of contract renewals, how -- so far how's the tenor there?","Scott C. Morrison","I mean, we're not seeing anywhere near the price declines that we saw from '12 to '13 going into '14, but the environment is still soft. It's still weak, and there's isolated things going on in different places. But there's still -- as John talked about, there's still way too much capacity. And so we're doing what's in our control in terms of cost-out. And we're growing with -- a little bit with the market. And all those things should help us, but the pricing environment is not getting better yet.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then on the food can side, we heard from of one of your peers yesterday, and they had talked about extending some contract lengths. And I was wondering if you could sort of update us on how you're doing on the food can side and any changes to your contract length structures, et cetera.","John A. Hayes","The short answer is nothing out of the ordinary. We have a variety of different customers and a variety of different customer contracts, and nothing really has changed appreciably in that. We have -- our focus on is -- everyone knows at the end of '14, we expect to lose some business from a customer, and we've talked about that for the last 6 months. I think 2014, we have plans in place, and the timing of the execution will occur throughout 2014 as we move towards that date. We have a hole to fill, we recognize that, but I'll bet our people against anyone else any time.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Okay. I appreciate it. Final question is just a clarification on pension, tailwind of $15 million to $20 million. Can you help us just with where that flows through in the segments? I imagine most of that is going to be in the U.S. And could we assume, say, 75% of that in U.S. bev and maybe 25% or so in food can? Or help us kind of parse out where that will flow through.","Scott C. Morrison","It does hit the U.S., but remember, we got a big aerospace business, too. So you look at where the percentage of employees are. Food has a bigger impact than what you'd think the size of the business, but it's an older business. Let me get to the detail, I don't want to tell you off the top of my head, but I do have that detail. But it kind of runs across the businesses.","Operator","We have a follow-up question from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple of things. One, so if we look to '14 and could see your expectations for European profitability, would we see more of the profit growth that you expect coming from a pickup in volume or would it come more from the cost-out? If you had mentioned that earlier, I apologize, I had missed it.","John A. Hayes","Yes, well, as you know, George, it's difficult to parse it out because it's a fixed-cost business. So when you get a little bit more volume, is that because of volume or because of cost? I will tell you this, all things being equal, our guys are doing -- our folks are doing a very good job on the cost side of the business. And so we're going to continue to put our shoulder into that throughout '14. And as I mentioned, we're closing our German regional headquarters, and that should happen late first quarter. And we have a bunch of other cost-out opportunities that we have been executing on, and so that's a big focus on that.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Related question and segueing a little bit on, I guess, Al's last question. Again, one of your peers yesterday was talking about some of the other things that they're working on to, one, make the food can more viable; and from our vantage point, two, secure their position with their customers and in their market, along with plant realignment and looking at new markets. Are you doing any kind of co-investing with your customers on a longer-term basis, more so now than perhaps had been the case? Can you share any more details on the plan that you're executing in '14?","John A. Hayes","No appreciable difference in terms of what you described as co-investing with our customers relative to what we've done in the past.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And the last question, and I'll turn it over, there's been some discussion in the trade that maybe not right now, but over time, there's going to be more and more usage of aluminum sheet in auto manufacturing. And if that, in fact, does occur, how do you think that might affect the availability of can sheet in the market? Obviously, something that's very important to you. What if your suppliers told you about that and the likelihood of supply shortages, again, not now but maybe down the road?","Scott C. Morrison","Yes, I'm not sure I'd worry about supply shortages. I think that beverage can has been pretty steady, so it's a nice steady business. But the automotive business, historically, has a little bit more volatility toward it. And I think there's a question of how much auto converts to aluminum and is that a stepping stone to another type of material, some kind of composite material. So I think all this is going to take some time to play out. So we'll see.","John A. Hayes","The only other thing, George, I'd add to that is it really is -- what you're talking about is more of a North American phenomena than anything else. And because of the pass-through nature of the business, it's not a huge impact.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And, I guess, for that matter, too, to the extent you'd rather the other -- the reverse be true, to the extent that can demand isn't growing by leaps and bounds, that makes more availability, I guess, of can sheet as well. But it sounds like your suppliers aren't telling you to worry about this anytime soon.","John A. Hayes","Well, I think to be honest, they're excited about the automotive opportunity. And -- but Scott raised an excellent point. They're doing it because of EPA guidelines in terms of miles per gallon for cars. It is a lighter-weight material than steel, but it is much more difficult to handle relative to steel in terms of welding and other things like that. The question is, is it a conversion to aluminum or is aluminum a migration to another form of composites or other things like that.","Operator","We have one final follow-up question from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc.","Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","John, Scott, how do you factor the recent fluctuations in emerging markets into your CapEx plans? And I know you're strategy is to follow your customers, but are you any less inclined to expand in emerging markets than perhaps you were a year or 2 ago?","Scott C. Morrison","Not really. I mean, it all dependent on the right opportunity. These things kind of come and go. I don't get too caught up in where currencies trade in a particular day. When we put assets in the ground, we're going to be there for a long time. And so if the long-term economic value proposition is there, we would still do it.","Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. In Brazil, how would you characterize the capacity situation at the moment? And based on our industry growth expectations, do you think more capacity will be necessary over the next couple of years?","John A. Hayes","It will be interesting to see. I think it's reasonably tight for '14 because of the World Cup. I think after that, the biggest question is, given the economic situation, given the political situation and given the growth of the middle-class in Brazil, what happens after '14 in terms of liquid consumption, in terms of can growth, in terms of the overall economic profile. And so we're looking at that very closely, but first and foremost, we're saying, \"Let's put our head down and get through '14, and then we'll evaluate it a little bit more.\"","Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just one last one. Scott, forgive me if you mentioned this earlier, but interest expense, how much of a benefit do you expect it to be this year?","Scott C. Morrison","I said that we expect full year interest expense in '14 to be around $163 million. So the bonds that we issued last year and the redemption of the notes in January, it's kind of -- the mix of that will help interest by quite a bit.","Operator","And we have no more questions at this time.","John A. Hayes","Okay, great. Thank you very much for participating. And we look forward to what we think could be a strong 2014. And we'll speak to you in April. Thanks, everyone.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, November 2, 2017.","I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, CEO. Please go ahead.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Great. Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's third quarter 2017 results.","The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially for those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings, as well as the company's news release. If you don't already have our third quarter earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com.","Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the Notes section of today's earnings release. The release also includes a table summarizing business consolidation and other activities, as well as a reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations.","Now, joining me on the call today are Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Dan Fisher, Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Global Beverage.","I'll provide some brief introductory remarks, Dan will discuss the beverage packaging performance, Scott will discuss the key financial metrics, and then I'll finish up with comments on our Food and Aerospace businesses and the outlook.","We achieved improved third quarter comparable operating earnings, particularly in South America and despite lower performance in our North American Metal Beverage business in the latter part of the quarter.","First, given the devastation caused by the hurricanes, earthquakes, and recent fires that raged in our Fairfield, California facility, we're thankful that all our fellow coworkers, their families, and our physical assets in Florida, Texas, California, and Mexico are safe. Thank you everyone at Ball and beyond who lent a helping hand to their colleagues, families, and communities who are personally impacted by these natural disasters.","Candidly, the hurricanes were a perfect storm that ripped through Ball's supply chain late in the quarter and then two of Ball's largest North American regions. To put the hurricanes into perspective, while our Conroe, Texas and Tampa, Florida plants suffered some downtime, they recovered in relatively good shape. However, the downtime at our key customers' filling locations continued well beyond the aftermath of the storms and resulted in a combined seven days of lost production due to lack of orders for us in the regions and meaningfully lower can sales. For example, industry sales in the alcoholic category were down 12% in September with much of that happening in Texas in the southeast filler locations.","In addition, significant spikes in freight rates and out-of-pattern freight across our southern and lower Atlantic plant network accelerated after the hurricane events and negatively impacted our results. We understand that FEMA, for example, consumed nearly 10% of the available freight hauling capacity after the water subsided and freight surcharges increased materially during this time.","Freight and fuel rates continue to be higher than before the hurricanes and we're attempting to offset this high cost freight expenses with existing passthroughs and additional surcharges where contracts allow. To state the obvious, this has been challenging and frustrating and it has overshadowed an otherwise good performance across the rest of our company, but we'll push through, Ball folks always do.","Dan Fisher will provide additional color on the overall Global Beverage Can business in a moment.","Moving on and highlighting some of the great work being done during the third quarter. We began to see results from some of the actions taken in our European Beverage business with margins and profitability improving year-over-year. Our South American Beverage business experienced meaningful volume improvement with growth equally spread throughout all of South America.","We further improved our G&A cost structure with the launch of our shared service centers in Queretaro, Mexico and Belgrade, Serbia. We transitioned beverage can production from Reidsville, North Carolina to Tampa, Florida and Rome, Georgia; however, this was impacted a bit during the hurricanes in Florida. We significantly improved manufacturing efficiencies at our Canton, Ohio metal service center. We hired additional staff in our Aerospace business to service existing and future contracts, while staying on time and on budget with important facility expansions. And year-to-date, we acquired a net $85 million of our stock and paid out $93 million of dividends.","Our multi-year, value-capture plans are on course. And while we're disappointed in the third quarter performance of our beverage North America and Central America segment in light of the hurricanes, we have a clear line of sight to all of the synergies identified when we announced the transaction. Our plans are on track to capture cost savings and to grow comparable EBITDA, cash flow, and EVA.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan.","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","Thanks, John. Third quarter was quite dynamic from a demand and operational perspective, and John described it well. Global beverage can volumes grew 2% in the quarter. The beverage can is winning across multiple geographies and we continue to promote its sustainable qualities and product capabilities to our customers and consumers.","John outlined the U.S.-weather related struggles in the quarter, so I won't dwell on the short-term situation impacting global beverage results because it does not impact our three-year outlook for our Beverage business. Instead, let's focus our attention on the future opportunities to make disciplined growth investments while addressing our cost structure across each of our regional segments. North American volumes were flat in the quarter due to domestic beer declines, and our larger presence with these customers was offset by growth in imported beer, craft, sparkling water and certain carbonated soft drinks. In the middle of the quarter, we announced our U.S. network optimization plans with the closures of Birmingham, Longview and Chatsworth and the construction of the Goodyear, Arizona specialty can plant, which will provide annualized net savings of $50 million beginning in the latter part of 2018.","And as we move into the fourth quarter, we believe the severe impacts of the U.S. weather events are largely behind us and our team is focused on executing on its network optimization plans, streamlining processes and systems to lower our cost structure and having certain headwinds like lower absorption, out-of-pattern freight and the PPI drag turning the tailwinds in 2018.","Our South American business had a very good quarter. Segment volume grew double digits led by Brazil. Ball's business benefited from our customer mix, our product portfolio in proximity to near-term market needs in the region. We anticipate further strength in Brazil and surrounding countries during the fourth quarter as we move into the busy summer selling season south of the equator. We do, however, anticipate a higher level of competitiveness in 2018 and 2019 as competitor's new plant comes online. The European business saw mid-single digit volume growth, which was in line with industry demand. Our ongoing plant construction in Spain is right on track. Our near and long-term initiatives to get segment performance back to where Ball's legacy business was are moving at a reasonable pace given the complexity of our transformation projects.","The \u20ac40 million annualized cost savings from the recent Recklinghausen closures will really begin in a meaningful way in the fourth quarter. The financial contribution from our Central American joint ventures in Guatemala and Panama were off slightly due to customer and production timing in Central America.","In EMEA, we are not without our challenges, like the demand volatility we deal with on a daily basis related to political and economic unrest across the Middle East and the carbonation tax in Saudi Arabia leading to low demand in the region. The EMEA team has done an amazing job dealing with the complexity. In the third quarter, our China volumes were down 6% versus the market growing 6%. Ball will continue to exercise a disciplined approach in this market.","In summary, our Global Beverage business has posted strong results in South America and Europe with good demand trends and their ability to cover off the incremental year-over-year depreciation. It's been a tough couple of months for our North America and EMEA teams following the hurricanes and the Saudi carbonation tax. Everyone is driving to the best EVA outcome possible in 2017 and our multi-year thesis for acquiring Rexam is intact.","Looking forward, I feel good about where our Global Beverage business is headed. Growth in differentiated sizes, initiatives to more fully utilize our global shared service centers and having a team of global key account directors laser focused on securing the best value possible for our tremendous product portfolio. Thank you again to all of our teams around the globe.","With that, I'll turn it over to Scott.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Thanks, Dan. Comparable third quarter 2017 earnings were $0.52, which included $11 million of additional depreciation versus $0.48 in 2016. Third quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflects solid operational performance except for North America Beverage, lower corporate cost, lower interest expense and a lower tax rate. Details are provided in Note 2 of today's earnings release and additional information will also be provided in our 10-Q.","Net debt ended the quarter at $7 billion, which was $450 million lower year-over-year, though slightly above our plan due to the $95 million impact of a higher euro. Net debt will continue to come down as we move through the remainder of the year.","At current FX rates and given our euro debt exposure, our year-end net debt will likely be closer to $6.5 billion and this will not impede our plan to return value to shareholders via share repurchases in 2018. As we think about the remainder of 2017, we expect full-year 2017 comparable EBITDA in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.75 billion, free cash flow to be in excess of $850 million after spending in the range of $550 million of CapEx. Full-year 2017 interest expense will be in the range of $290 million, up $10 million from our prior target of $280 million.","The full year and fourth quarter effective tax rate on comparable earnings will be in the range of 25% due to the geography of the earnings mix and corporate undistributed will be in the range of $135 million for full-year 2017, an improvement of $5 million from our prior guidance. The cash is showing up and we feel good about where we're at.","And with that, I'll turn it back to you, John.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Great. Thanks, Scott. Our Aerospace business reported improved third quarter results driven by solid contracts performance and the continuing ramp-up on new contracts. The team at Ball Aerospace is winning. All of it hasn't translated over to meaningful operating earnings improvement or contracted backlog yet. However, staff is being added weekly to be positioned for the ramp up of these key wins. The aerospace team has done a wonderful job managing through the ever changing winds of Washington D.C. We have an exciting launch of JPSS-1 scheduled for next week and we remain more constructive today regarding the United States budgetary process and how it can help translate programs wins into profitable earnings growth.","Now, as we look forward, we are on track to achieve the financial benefits of the acquisition. Our Aerospace business is poised for another bump up. Our food and aerosol team has attacked costs and improved manufacturing efficiencies to Ball standards and our Metal Beverage Packaging businesses are preparing for further growth and cost-out initiatives.","When we closed on the acquisition in June of 2016, we expected 2017 EBITDA to be in excess of $1.75 billion and free cash flow to be in excess of $750 million. As mentioned in the press release, we will likely be short of our original 2017 EBITDA goal due to our beverage North and Central America performance this quarter and the manufacturing inefficiencies we experienced early in the year in our Food and Aerosol segment, which is now behind us.","However, our cash flow continues to show up at or above our goals at that time despite higher capital expenditures. We still expect that by 2019 we can generate $2 billion of comparable EBITDA and in excess of $1 billion of comparable free cash flow. So when we announced our intentions to acquire Rexam, we said that we would rapidly de-lever, capture synergies, spend any necessary growth capital on high-returning projects, and then returning our remaining free cash flow to our fellow shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, and that's exactly what we're doing.","And with that, Jennifer, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning. First off on North America, clearly, you guys are focusing across the company on free cash flow generation. But in that process, were you running maybe a little bit too tight on inventories, which was sort of exacerbated by the weather impact? I'm just trying to think about that dynamic potential.","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","Yeah, I think that's a good question. I think in Q2, if you remember, there was growth in the 2% to 3% range. We benefited from that and we entered Q3 at lower stocking levels than we anticipated heading into the year and that problem, as you rightly pointed out, probably exacerbated some of the issues that we had in Q3 with the weather patterns.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then in your comments, Dan, on the PPI reversal for 2018 versus what you saw this year, with that framework, I mean, you are going to see surcharges in freight still, a lot of your coatings companies are talking about higher coating prices et cetera that they're trying to implement because their costs have gone up. Do you feel that you're going to be at price cost parity in 2018 versus maybe what you saw in 2017?","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","Yes. And I think if you reflect back on probably some earlier comments in and around moving into this year, we've largely negotiated both metal and ODM contracts for the foreseeable future, and in each of our contracts we try to lock end-to-end with our commercial contracts on the pass-through mechanism. So, I don't see a tremendous amount of risk there.","The surcharge, as you said, we're still seeing accelerated freight rates in the Texas and the Southeast areas on the increased rates for freight. The advantage is though, and what we're laser focused on, it's much like your earlier question, we're trying to get our stocking levels back at a place that we feel comfortable with and that's what we've been focused on for the last two to three weeks. And that's going to allow us to better manage out-of-pattern freight or mitigate that and really \u2013 feel really good about what the North America team is doing in that regard.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yeah. I'll just add, Ghansham, on that very last point that some of our contracts, commercial contracts, are clear of what we can and cannot do with respect to passing through these higher freight charges and we are, as Dan said, focused like a hawk on where we're able to go after that. Rest assured we are going after that.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Terrific. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. In August, you announced the three bev camp plant closures in the U.S. and the greenfield in Arizona. I was wondering if you could give us any more detail on the timing of the greenfield can plant, maybe CapEx cost capacity, any kind of further color you can give? And then with the closures, is it possible to say how much net capacity you're reducing or any way that we can understand the total \u2013 the impact of the total number of cans you're producing or the mix between 12 ounce and specialty?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yeah. Why don't I attack the first \u2013 last part of the question and Dan can could talk about timing of them. With regard to the overall capacity, we're going to be net flat to slightly down, but there should be a big shift because majority of the capacity we're closing is standard capacity and we're adding in a lot of specialty. Specialty continues to grow for us. The Southwest is an important market for us. And so you should expect net 12 ounce to be declining, while specialty is increasing in that region. Dan, do you want to talk about timing?","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","And in terms of the specific restructuring timeline, I think we've made some of these announcements public, but both Longview and Birmingham we feel in the Q2, beginning of Q3 would be the closure date. Obviously, we'd have to have capacity in place in the new facility in order to do that. Those plants are still online and then Chatsworth will be toward the tail end of 2018.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then the timing and CapEx costs around Arizona?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yeah, what we've said in the past was we're going to be focused on in the range of about $500 million of CapEx as we go forward over the 2017, 2018, 2019 time period. And as you recall, our maintenance CapEx we believe to be about half of that. So embedded in that $500 million assumption is things such as Arizona. So, I don't think there's any appreciable more capital other than what we've said. There's always a timing issue, and I think that the slight raise in terms of what we expect for CapEx this year has to do with accelerating some of those \u2013 some of that CapEx, particularly for Goodyear because, as Dan mentioned, we need to get the capacity up and going before we can get \u2013 start getting those savings out.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's very helpful. And then, Scott, I understand this may be difficult, but is it possible to quantify the hit that you saw from hurricanes just from a dollar perspective in 3Q?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Yeah. The way I would look at it is if you look at Q2 versus Q3, I would put it in kind of three buckets; a third, a third, a third. And Dan touched upon the first one or one of them, which was the absorption coming into that season with probably lighter inventories, and we have had pretty good growth in the second quarter. So that's about a third of it. Lost volume just from the decline from the hits from those that our customers experienced would be about a third and then a third would be a combination of both freight rates and out-of-pattern freight during that period.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, that's helpful. I'll turn it over.","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Unknown Speaker","Good morning.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Scott, just following up on that for a minute. Obviously, you took up the free cash flow guidance, but you also took up the CapEx guidance. So I would assume you're looking for a little bit better working capital management. Could you talk about maybe where you're getting some of that with these inventory absorption issues that you're discussing in the quarter?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Well, it's kind of separate from the inventory, but I mean, unfortunately, we probably had too light of inventory going into that busy season. But by the year end, really it's the EVA mentality across our businesses that's taking hold. We thought there would be good opportunities in our business in the new balance sheet that we have to get a lot of money out of the working capital, and everybody from finance to the operations folks around the world have been very effective. And I think we're experiencing some of the benefits we expected to get a little sooner than what we originally anticipated. So we were all happy with where we're at.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So you're saying it's more on the receivables and payables side, is what you would say on working capital?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Yeah. And then, selectively, in other places in inventory, there's always going to \u2013 the magic is having the right inventory, right? So, it's having the right inventory, but clearly we're a little too tight in the second quarter coming into the third quarter but by year end my comments were more focused on year end.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And when we look to realign...","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Go ahead, sorry.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I was just getting \u2013 I just going to move on to the synergies, but if you wanted to close out there first, that's fine.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","No. Go ahead.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","As you can say, on the realized synergies, I think you guys had mentioned the $150 million for 2017 before \u2013 do some of the issues in the third quarter plus the manufacturing efficiencies in the first half of the year, do that maybe lower that number for 2017, but then we get those back in 2018?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Not at all. It was separate and apart from anything to do with the synergies. And when you think about it, it had to do with the \u2013 in the Food and Aerosol, and I'm happy to report that that is behind us. And you see that one of the things I didn't mention in my prepared remarks, but overall food can volumes were down about 10% in the quarter.","Aerosol was roughly flat and so you see very good cost performance in that business. That obviously had nothing to do with the synergies and then as Scott just pointed out in terms of the lost sales absorption because of the lower inventories we had and then the higher freight, both in terms of out-of-pattern and overall freight rates, that's what really affected it. So there's been no change at all to our synergies.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, guys. Good luck for the rest of the year.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. Just wanted to come back to the North American beverage volumes. I'm trying to parse out the hurricane impact from it. It seemed like just from looking at the industry data even if you threw out the down 12 sort of September, the volumes would have been a little bit light kind of going into that event. So, just wondering if you could kind of comment on what you think the underlying trends are. Was there maybe some pull forward to earlier in the year when volumes were a little bit better than expected and any kind of color you can give on kind of October trends now that we've maybe kind of worked through some of the hurricane issues?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yeah. This is John. Why don't I take that first part. There was a meaningful impact. Let me give you some statistics here. Year-to-date through August, overall beverage cans in the United States were flat. In the month of September, they were down 6.5%. When you break that down between alcoholic and non-alcoholic, alcoholic they were down 2.5% year-to-date through August and they were down 12% in September. And in the non-alcoholic side, they actually were up 1.5% year-to-date through August and were down 2.5-plus percent in the month of September. So you can clearly see what happened.","I do think that there was a lot of good heads up around these hurricanes in the days, if not week or two prior to it. There was able, perhaps, to be some stock up, although we don't see weekly data like that, so it's not \u2013 I don't think it's appreciative. But when you have total communities underwater for, I won't say weeks, but certainly a week plus at a time and you don't have the ability for your customers to be filling and you don't have the ability to be shipping either our product to our customers or our customers to their distributors or retailers, it does have an impact, and I think those statistics show.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And so just to summarize, you think the outlook for North America going forward is still for sort of flattish to maybe up a little bit on volume?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yeah, I did answer your last question. I think, in October, what we've seen is they have bounced back as the supply chain starts to normalize. And so we've seen back to normal improvement yet \u2013 but as we've said all along, I think longer term we expect flattish demand in North America and we can happy to go through some of the trends. They've actually reversed because you recall over the last five to seven years, actually, cans \u2013 beer cans have been up and soft drink has been down. It has reversed. We've benefited candidly from some customers down in Mexico that have helped us in that whole segment, but I think it's no surprise. Big Beer here in the United States has been struggling. The cans have been doing well. Actually, it's been taking share from glass. It's just overall Big Beer in America has declined and it's encouraging to see the soft drink has started to get some growth back in the can as well.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay great. And just for a follow-up question. Just thinking about the bridge from the \u2013 I guess the midpoint of $1.725 billion of EBITDA to the $2.19 billion implies you've got to grow about $275 million. And without giving any kind of 2018 guidance yet, just thinking about the cadence of that. It does seem like the 2018 you'll have some duplicative costs from all the planned consolidation. I don't know if there's any way to kind of quantify that or maybe verify that, and just thinking about that bridge, do you think it will be kind of equally split between the years or maybe a little bit back-end loaded because of that consolidation effort next year?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Well I think we'll get \u2013 we're right on track with kind of the three-year plan that we had when we acquired Rexam. And the footprint things that we're doing that we announced recently in North America, most of those don't take hold to the back half of 2018 and into 2019. The capital that we're spending at some of the growth projects that we have start to come online next year in 2018 then more in 2019. So we're right on track with where we thought we would be.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yeah. And let's not forget we're experiencing duplicative costs now. I mean, we talked earlier in the year about the G&A and we were able to get in the short-term G&A out through the closure of Millbank and the closure of Charlotte, but then we are reinvesting and we just stood up in this quarter two shared services centers, one in Serbia, one in Mexico. So we are having duplicative costs. I think to Scott's point, what we've told people is we expect the next chunk of SG&A to come out as we transition many of these back office services from the various plants in regional locations to the shared service locations, but it's hard work. There's a lot of process, there's a lot of process redesign, there's a lot of manual efforts going on right now that we are going to \u2013 we'll be looking to automate, and that's probably a second half 2018 event as well. So, we are experiencing duplicative cost now.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. I'll turn it over now. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Langton with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Good morning. Thanks. I think just in your prepared remarks you said in South America in 2018 and 2019 results could be impacted by more competition. I guess, I mean give a \u2013 I guess a sense of how big of an impact and is it more \u2013 is it volumes, is it margins, just any details there would be helpful?","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","Yeah. Well, I think, at this point, it's probably too early to call. I think from a supply\/demand standpoint, we do know that a greenfield facility is coming up. We also know that a competitor is converting a steel plant to an aluminum plant. So largely, and we've said this historically, it's all dependent on the growth from a supply\/demand standpoint. How quickly Brazil recovers, keep in mind, we're still down over the last couple of years in that marketplace, and we like what we're seeing in the last couple of months, but two months is not a trend make. So, we'll have to wait and see on that. The volumes outside of Brazil are really strong and we're benefiting from that. But I'd say it's probably premature to make a call on exactly what all is going to transpire relative to 2018, 2019 in the competitive landscape. We do recognize though that the supply\/demand is something that we're laser focused on as the new greenfields come up.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then just with Europe, I think sort of EBIT excluding the higher depreciation was up around $10 million. Maybe just give a rough sense in terms of how much have been \u2013 was volume-related currency and just the improved operating performance.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yeah, I think it comes in three or four different areas. Number one, volume was up low-single digits, as Dan had mentioned on this conference call on his prepared remarks, I think a little over 2% or so. So obviously that helps. Cost side, we're doing a much better job on that. We did inherit some contracts that had some pricing challenges for us as we went into 2017. So that's kind of a headwind relative to it, but to be up in that segment, as you said, about $10 million or so given that we really haven't gotten much. If any of the benefits from some of these larger strategic actions around the plant in Germany, et cetera, we have a long way to go. We recognize that, but we are on the path that we expected.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. John, just one on Mexico and your U.S. beer business. Just given that your U.S. business is so much larger than your Mexico business, can you just help me understand how one would fully offset the other?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Well, it's \u2013 when you \u2013 I assume you're largely talking about beer...","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Yeah.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","...because it's really what we actually do. But when you think about it, you're right, in terms of Big Beer in the United States, that's been challenging. I don't have the exact numbers in front of me, but as I mentioned before, I know the can is taking share from other substrate, such as when the beer market is down 2.5% or so it's challenging particularly when the base is so big. We have been a beneficiary in Mexico of a couple of customers and we've been very strong in that region. But let's also not forget the craft beer side that we've talked about for a while where, I think, in the third quarter again we were up close to 30% in that segment. So you combine those three together and that's why we're able to offset many of these things.","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","Yeah. I would just add to that, Adam. I mean it's pretty simple, right? The Mexico beer is growing at 8% to 10% and the craft's growing at 30% plus. So the magnitude of that growth pattern is how we're able to offset the 2.5% decline on the bigger base.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks, Dan. Just one on Brazil. I know the biggest brewer down there, their beer volume was down about 5.5%. Meanwhile, the can market was up mid-single digits \u2013 one of the public bottlers was up substantially in Brazil. So it seems like the packaging trends have significantly diverged from the trends of the under \u2013 the biggest brewer there. Can you help me understand that, or why that might be the case?","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","There's a couple things going on. I think there's definitely a premiumization of beer that's afoot in that marketplace. Those folks are largely, if not exclusively, going into cans and that market's growing. There has been a reversal of the biggest brewer in that market in terms of pushing returnable glass over the last couple of years back to stabilizing their pack mix because they're losing, in some instances, to these startups in the craft brew. So it's really a good mix for us. You're right that the leader (33:34) is down, but there's definitely a movement afoot from the largest brewer all the way down to the smaller ones to move more of a pack mix to cans.","There is also, from a retail standpoint, quite a push from a sustainability point right now in the bigger cities that we're benefiting from. So the sustainability message is definitely helping in the last six months. We'll keep our eye on that. We'll obviously keep promoting that, but a lot of good packaging trends for the can right now and not only there, but in the other Latin American countries.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","I may just add on to that that we've been, candidly, pleasantly surprised by the can growth down in Brazil. I think we see all the trends that Dan just mentioned. The economy, it's flattened out, but it certainly hasn't improved. So whether you look at GDP is flat, now that's better than down 3%, but unemployment is still too high, it's still in the teens, the 11% to 12% range and we really need the middle class to be growing to get that leverage (34:35) growing, because think of the logarithmic opportunity we have if we can get the leverage (34:39) going and the pack share changing.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks, John. Just one last one on the synergy question. I know you mentioned you still expect to get the $150 million this year. Are you at liberty to say what you actually realized in 3Q and what you expect to realize in 4Q?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","No, we said from day one that we're not going to go into that level of detail because you end up parsing things out and you hire a bunch of accountants to do what? It doesn't make us any money by doing that.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Mr. Staphos, your line is open. Please go ahead.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. I didn't hear the introduction. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my question, all the details. I wanted to try to come back to the storm effect one more time if possible. Scott, you'd mentioned three buckets and you looked at the 2Q to 3Q sequential effect or guided us to think about it that way. Could you give us some view on what the storm effect was in total for the third quarter or how North America and Central America performed relative to what your expectations might have been going into the quarter?","And then the related question, as we parse your fourth quarter EBITDA guidance and what it comes out at relative your nine-month, how is that relative to what your expectations might have been heading into July or August earlier this year?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Okay. Well, the first part of that, I would have expected the third quarter to be close to the second quarter and that's why I used that as a reference point. So that's the magnitude that we're talking about.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","And then the third, a third, a third buckets still hold true. On the fourth quarter numbers, we don't expect to have \u2013 we're still seeing some freight rates and things, but we expect to have no meaningful impact from the third quarter carrying over into the fourth quarter. We expect Brazil to be \u2013 South America to be strong. And so all that kind of bakes into our fourth quarter expectations.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Fair enough. That's helpful. And just I guess to close the loop, then, on it, Scott \u2013 I apologize. So fourth quarter, even with all these headwinds, is more or less trending as you would have expected a couple of months ago? Obviously, there's a mixture of pluses and minuses, would that be a fair summation?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Yeah, I think that's fair.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yeah, the only caveat I would put on that, George is we said freight rates remain elevated. We're going after them where we can, but obviously we're not saying we've covered them off yet right now. So the longer they persist, the little bit more headwind we have in that, but that's the only thing. Volumes have bounced back, the plants have bounced back, the supply chain has bounced back, it's just the freight is a bit higher.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Yeah, I appreciate you taking the question there. I want to come back to South America, Dan, and you mentioned a couple of things in the market in answering an earlier question that prompted the commentary, but from what I recall those are relatively pre-existing conditions, both the conversion and the new plant. So is there anything else that's triggered your comment, just to flag it for us heading into 2018, or is it just a fiduciary heads up you just wanted to make there?","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","It's exactly a fiduciary heads up. And practically speaking, George, the new greenfield is coming online now. So it's not speculation or thesis. It's real. So, that's the intent behind the comment.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Understood. Two last ones, and I'll turn it over. Can you comment at all, either qualitatively or in some sort of quantified measure, realizing it's kind of hard to do that, how your progress has been in terms of selling \u2013 going back to the Investor Day complexity and promoting value over volume in terms of how Ball goes to market relative to your customers?","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","Yeah, I think the downside to the hurricanes that we experienced is probably the upside of selling that through because we kept all our customers in cans. It just caused us a heck of a lot of money to do that. That will enable those conversations to take a very different tone in a very real tone. And as these contracts start to roll off in the future, we will make it a point, George, to ensure that we have mechanisms built into these contracts that reciprocate the risk and the inefficiencies to both parties. Unfortunately, in some of the instances, we've got historical contracts that don't allow us to do that as effective as I think we can have those conversations now.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yeah, and George specifically just to give you some data points, around the world, Dan mentioned we have 2% volume growth around the world. We had almost 9% specialty volume growth around the world. And so it was a bit impacted here in North America for the exact reasons Dan just mentioned, but we continue to push this and it's part of our strategy.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","John, my last one, I'll turn it over. Thanks for all the color. Aerospace, you mentioned a number of metrics. I'm talking about the performance in the quarter. We have the backlog. You're hiring more people, which I guess is a leading indicator of more business down the road. Performance in the quarter was a little off from our model, but that's neither here nor there. Is there a way you could take some of the points that you've mentioned and help us from where we sit understand what the cadence on earnings and margin could look like? And for that matter, where the \u2013 if your backlog is $1.250 billion, what is the stealth backlog when you look at things that you've won but haven't been necessarily seen committed yet on funding? Thank you, guys. Good luck in the quarter.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","All right. Thanks. Well, George, a couple of things, and you've been a long-time student of Ball in our Aerospace business, so this may not be surprise you. But number one, you first got to follow the revenue growth and then just look at year-to-date what we've seen in the revenue growth and I think that's terrific. Number two, as you well know, as we start up new contracts that the margin profile of those always starting is lower than when you're finishing if you perform well because what you do is, as you accrue, you buy down the risk. The technological risk subsides and you start to \u2013 you're able to accrue more as those programs go on. We have a lot of new programs going and that's why the margin, if you look at just pure margin it's come down. There's nothing in that other than we started a bunch of new projects as we go forward.","Lastly with your question, we look at several different metrics. We look at funded backlog, we look at won not booked, which is programs that we have won, but have not been booked, because they haven't been funded. And then we also look at bids and proposals that are outstanding and all of those are at record high for Ball. I mentioned in my prepared remarks about the \u2013 we're much more constructive on the budget process right now. I know Congress or the House is putting out a tax plan now, but let's not forget both the House and the Senate approved a budget, and I think that's very important because that gets the funding on some of these won not booked. And so I would expect, I don't want \u2013 don't pin me down to the exact timing, but I would expect over the six to nine to 12 months that you're going to see an improvement in our backlog, and then you could see continued performance improvement as we translate these new and existing contracts, buy down that risk and perform on them like we typically do.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anojja Shah with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Anojja Shah - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Good morning.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Good morning.","Anojja Shah - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","I wanted to go to the \u2013 good morning. I wanted to go to the Food segment for a little while. You guys had double-digit declines in food cans.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Right.","Anojja Shah - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And still managed to have an EBIT margin decline of only 10 basis points. I assume some of that is from the closures of Baltimore and Hubbard, Ohio. Some is from the Aerosol contribution or better manufacturing. Can you sort of just quantify the contribution of each in the quarter? And then along those lines, what you think are stable long-term margin would be for this segment?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yeah. Well, let me first by start to say Hubbard and Baltimore we actually sold those facilities. We did not close them and so actually we sold \u2013 and they were both profitable. So, actually our results on a apples-to-apples basis, perhaps, might have been even a little bit better than what we suggested. I think really what you're seeing, to answer your question, it's difficult to partial out, because many of our manufacturing facilities are comingled, but what I would tell you is that the projects that we had in place over the last 12 months to close our Weirton, West Virginia facility and bring up the new Canton \u2013 or expansion of our existing Canton facility, we had some short-term pains in the first quarter and second quarter. We worked those out and the team has done a very good job and we are getting the benefits that we expected currently. We weren't in the first half of the year, but we are certainly currently.","We also \u2013 as the Aerosol business continues to grow and it is continuing to grow, I said it's relatively flat around the world. In North America, it was down a little bit. Again, we can't specifically determine why, but I think some of it had to do with these hurricanes, but in Europe was up for us and in India, which is a relatively new plant for us, that is growing very strong.","So from a big picture perspective in that segment, as you continue to see our Aerosol business growing and our Food business, which is a small business and getting smaller in that, you should see margin improvement in that business. Right now, I think we're in around the 9% year-to-date. We would expect that to improve. It all has to do with the amount of pass-through of steel and we do expect increases in steel going into next year, which means the margin may look lower, but the overall profitability of that segment ought to improve as we move forward.","Anojja Shah - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, that's great. Thank you. And then just going back to North America, is there any sort of insurance recovery that you can claim for this out-of-pattern freight that could help you in the fourth quarter?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yeah. We're looking into that. The issue is you've got \u2013 these are two storms and so we have insurance that covers both downtime in our facilities and then contingent downtime at customers' facilities, but you have to satisfy deductibles in both those. So we're looking it up, but it's probably negligible.","Anojja Shah - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thanks. I'll turn it over.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good, morning guys. Just a couple of questions that haven't been touched on. First, you talked about the shared service centers, one down in Mexico and one over in Serbia. Could you maybe give us a little color there as to what sorts of activities that you guys have folded in or what you're doing there, what the \u2013 how we should think about the opportunity for either cost savings or growth or what have you from those activities?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Sure. I mean, you could think about everything that doesn't involve making a can in a plant and selling it to a customer, so all the back office processes. They are AP, a lot of planning things, a lot of just back office accounting things.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Payroll.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Payroll. We're looking at \u2013 I mean, we have a game plan and we're starting to transition those services from both North America and across Europe into those shared service centers, and that will grow over time. And that's also a part of that three-year plan that we put together when we decided to buy Rexam. So we're on track and, like John said, there's always \u2013 there's a lot of work that goes into that to do that. It's not simple and it takes a little bit of time, but we're happy with the progress we've made so far.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yeah. And just to give a little color and context. It's not a big bang event that you go from zero to one and just put all those things in. We have new processes, we have new systems, we have new people in place. And so each of those various work streams, as Scott mentioned, in addition to many others, we have a specific game plan of when to roll those out. For example, at the beginning of October, we turned on a payroll system on a global basis for the first time. Are we getting the benefits right now? No, because we're going through the typical debugging issues when you go from a bunch of different systems to one much more standardized system. But now we have people in place in these two shared services to be implementing that and we're able to relieve ourselves of some of the higher costs G&A elsewhere. You're going to see over the next year or so a lot of this, I call it two yards and a cloud of dust, to use the football analogy, because that's what it is. It's hard work, but you're going to see it and it's \u2013 we really expect to start to meaningfully see the benefits as we get in the mid to late 2018.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And then second question I had for you, Scott, was, I mean, you repeatedly told us that you're on track for where you thought you are in respect of the big plan. Another component of that was we felt when you were within line of sight of that, you've talked about ramping up the share repurchase to kind of be most of cash flow, that kind of being where it's wanted. I did note that it looks like you picked up some share repo here in 3Q, but perhaps not quite to the levels I would have anticipated. Kind of what's the outlook going forward? I mean, do you still \u2013 do you feel you're closer to line of sight at this point to kind of ramp up share repurchase or thoughts on capital allocation that way?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Yeah, I think we're right on schedule if not ahead of schedule. In fact, I think, initially, we said we probably wouldn't buy shares in the 2017 and we did. So, in my mind, we're a little bit ahead of where we thought we'd be unless we look at next year and put our plans together in February, to tell you what our plans are for 2018 in terms of share purchase, but I would expect it to be part of our capital distribution.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Right. And the only thing I'd add, we're also mindful we have debt covenants. So as our leverage comes down, we have to make commitments. We're well within that, but we have to be mindful of that. So, we're trying to be good long-term stewards of our capital.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay guys. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks. Good morning.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Good morning.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So when you announced the Rexam deal, you obviously had a plan in place and you've kind of maintained the $2 billion of EBITDA, $1 billion of free cash flow.

So, I just wanted to see if you could give any comments on the growth from today's EBITDA of $1.725 billion or so in 2017 out to the $2 billion. Maybe you can size those buckets of the $275 million incremental, what comes from maybe synergies, market growth, conversion to specialty or anything else that's worth talking about?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yeah, well let me kind of start and ask the others to jump in. Let's start and talk big picture about the various synergies and where we are with them like the footprint. We've announced upwards of $130 million of cost savings through the footprint and we haven't gotten really anything year-to-date. And so that's all on the comp we will start to get in the fourth quarter. Dan mentioned Recklinghausen, Reidsville here in North Carolina in the United States. But then really going into 2018, so that's a big chunk of it.","We also announced \u2013 on the sourcing side, we announced I think in the first quarter that we expected to slowly start getting it in the second half of this year and as we enter the fourth quarter we'll start to accelerate, but we're really going to get the full-year benefit of that in 2018. And then on the SG&A side, I just mentioned that, through our shared services that we expect to get a kind of half of our original expectations, but it won't be coming till mid to late 2018. You add all that up and you quickly see how we've gotten some good synergies.","Now it's been the SG&A, we've gotten some sourcing, and you can see in the progression, but really going into the fourth quarter and going into 2018 you're going to get a lion share of that. You layer that on top of Aerospace growth that I talked about before, you lay it on top of the growth capital that Dan talked about and whether it's the new plant we have in Spain, what we're doing here in North America, some other regions as well, and that's why we remain confident of getting to $2 billion by the end of 2019.","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","And just, I guess, your initial comment on things have changed relative to beer, I would say from a demand standpoint nothing has changed appreciably from our investment thesis, with the exception of EMEA has been a little bit more volatile than we anticipated heading in.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. That's helpful.","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","But Big Beer is on its \u2013 Big Beer has been on a constant decline over the last two to three years and that's why we've invested heavily in craft and other segments to offset that.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Great. And then, just as a followup there. Is there any way that \u2013 what's your plans for growth, continued growth in Mexico and Brazil? I mean, would you consider \u2013 are there opportunities for further kind of footprint growth if that were to be possible?","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","I think we've said historically, you think of Mexico in two different markets, right? The one that's export into the U.S. which we're a big player in and then since the deal we've acquired our Queretaro facility, which really handles both CSD and the local beer. That's been slower growth over the last year because of the FX dynamics and the impact to the end consumer in the domestic beer market. But we have stayed ahead and we've been working very closely with the two biggest brewers for the export business and we've continued to stay ahead from an investment standpoint.","We built the Monterrey facility for three lines. We do have a third line that is running right now, and so I think we'll continue to respond to the growth of the big customers in and around the U.S. marketplace. That's really where our focus has been. Where there are other opportunities and when the Mexican domestic market comes back and grows at that 6% to 8%, there will probably be opportunities for us, but right now we're laser focused on keeping up with the demand of our existing customers into the U.S. marketplace.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Brazil, any footprint?","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","And in South America, there's been \u2013 there's really a big movement afoot from \u2013 moving from returnable glass into the can as we mentioned and we've expanded our Argentina facility. We've continued to add capacity where it makes sense into Brazil. And so, again, we're going to continue to stay ahead of that. We're in close contact with the big customers there. So, I would expect that you would continue to see some capital going to work for organic growth opportunities in those two markets in particular.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical. Please proceed with your question.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yes. Good morning.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Good morning.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","This is more for Scott, I suppose. I just wanted to make sure I didn't miss something on the bridge of where the free cash flow for the year is going to stay relatively the same, even though it looks like the CapEx is up a bit and the net debt is going to end the year a couple hundred million higher than what you said last quarter. So, could you help me bridge that, please?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Yeah. Well, the bridge in the debt has to do with really FX rates and we bought a little bit of stock in the third quarter that hadn't been in the numbers before. So, that's why the debt is up. And then the \u2013 on the cash flow side, we're getting working capital benefit sooner than what we had initially anticipated, so that's offsetting the CapEx increase and it's offsetting what we bought back.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And as we look at 2018 and 2019, how much more capital \u2013 sorry, working capital benefit, I guess you'd say, or cash used, will it be a source in those years? What would be a good guess to use for our models?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","I think it's really too early to tell. Our folks have been incredibly creative and aggressive at managing our working capital year-to-year. And so I think at this point it's a little too premature to talk about 2018 and 2019, but we're on track to hit our 2019 goals for cash flow.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And then last question, I guess more for John is, you mentioned that CapEx might be a touch lower in 2018 or 2019, like around $500 million, which of course does include a lot of growth capital in there. So, I guess it's safe to say that as we go through next year there'll be more lines probably planned at least to be under construction in those years or one of those years?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Well, yeah. What I said was the $500 million was the original placeholder when we announced the transaction and it included $250 million of growth capital. As time goes on, you get more specific plans around that and we'll adjust up or down. Dan had mentioned that in Mexico we've been investing to keep ahead of the demand. Down in South America, we have some opportunities. We'll let you all know when it's appropriate, but I think that as a placeholder it may be a little bit more like we're doing this year. Some of that's pulling ahead. But as opportunities come forward, and we think they're good projects, we're compensated to earn returns in excess of 9% on that. And if we think we can do it, we're going to do it.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. That's great.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question...","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay.","Operator","...comes from the line of \u2013 oh, I'm sorry, I apologize.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","No. Please go ahead, Jennifer.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank Please proceed with your question.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for letting me get my question in here. Two questions, one quick one on Europe and then just one follow-up on Brazil. Even in Europe if I adjust for the lower G&A sequentially, your margin still expanded. Could you just talk about what you saw there quarter-over-quarter? What kind of improvements you're seeing in that business?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yeah, Debbie, I think I might have mentioned it earlier, but the quick summary is we've had volume growth of 2%, 2.5%. We've had good cost and efficiencies at the plant level. We really haven't benefited from any of the strategic moves we made, although we start to in the fourth quarter and we also inherited some contracts that had lower year-over-year pricing. So that's been a bit of a headwind. So despite all that, we've been up and been able to improve margins.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And then just on Brazil. Just bear with me for a second here because there are a lot of questions on this and you made that comment earlier in the prepared remarks. My sense is that the industry should see demand in Brazil at about 26 billion cans at the end of this year. And my math kind of suggests that the industry next year would operate a little over 90% if you see some growth, maybe a little under if you don't. Is that fair to say and is that considered balanced in your view? Are there any kind of regional nuances that we should think about because you haven't actually seen a decent amount of capacity flowing in, in the last year and this is the only can plant I think that's just coming in next year, so I'm just trying to get a sense of what the real risk is here?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yeah. I think in real short summary, it's the regional nuances that occur here. Brazil is such a large country. Its supply chain is very different and its transportation is very different than what you see in more developed markets, and so it really is a region by region. And where the new capacity is coming in, we have facilities there and there has been some growth, which has been helpful. But the question that Dan alluded to is, is it enough growth to offset some regional supply demand imbalances and it's premature to tell. The only thing Dan was signaling is that the competitors' plant we understand is up and running now. And so it does create a little bit of headwind.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Edlain Rodriguez with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning, guys. Just one quick one on Europe. I mean, yes, we are seeing some margin improvement, but it still lags your segments. But where do you see margins growing over the next year or two in that segment?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Well, what we said is at \u2013 about a year ago, we said that we believe that there's 250 basis points of margin improvement in that business, but it will take some time. And we now \u2013 we closed at the end of July, early August the Recklinghausen, Germany facility. We really haven't seen that much of benefits of that and so you're going to start to see that with some other things in terms of G&A, the shared service concept that we talked about earlier. It's Europe and you have to work through Union. You have to work through Works Council and it just takes longer than what you would like to do, but we've got a three-year game plan to get back to the margins that we think ought to be achievable in Europe.","Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And one last one on interest expense. Like what's driving the higher number? I think last quarter you have said about $280 million and now it's $290 million. Like what's driving that incremental $10?","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","Yeah. The debt is a little higher.","Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC","Okay.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","It's currency.","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","Yeah, and currency.","Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Okay. Thank you. Jennifer, assuming there's no other questions, we should probably finish up.","Operator","We do have a follow-up question.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Okay. Why don't we take one more?","Operator","Very good. Our question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your follow-up question.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks for taking the follow-on. I'll make it quick, guys. Number one, John, we saw how the custom can help the soft drink business grow value at retail and grow volume. Are the mega beer producers considering at all using some of these sizes to maybe stimulate growth as well or is it really kind of a mismatch of package type with the bread and butter consumer for that product? And then, if you can remind us in terms of cash outlays for the restructuring, should we expect there'll be \u2013 and integration, excuse me, higher in 2018 versus 2017 on par, if you can remind us what the numbers are there, would appreciate. Thanks again, guys. Good luck in the quarter.","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","I think, George, from an innovation standpoint, yes. And how? I think the Big Beer folks are being a little more thoughtful in terms of initializing innovation in different can sizes around a brand, to your point. Some brands, it's important for innovation. I think one of the faster growing products in the U.S. market, you'll see it, but I think two of them you'll see them in sleek cans. So it's out there, it's a foot. And obviously in many instances, where there is success, there are followers. So I would anticipate a lot more conversations in around there, and not just in the U.S., all around the world where actually the sleek can is the can that is initially launched in some markets around the world, a Vietnam, a Brazil, et cetera. So I think you're on to something there and there are a lot of conversations happening in and around that, so probably more to come on that.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Cash?","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","Yeah. And on the cash side of restructuring, yes, more of the cash will go out in 2018 from some of the actions that we've already announced.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you very much.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Okay. Thank you, George. Jennifer, we could wind up, please?","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today.

Welcome to the Ball Corporation Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Thursday, July 31, 2014. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, Chairman, President and CEO for Ball Corporation. Please go ahead, sir.","John A. Hayes","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's second quarter 2014 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings, as well as company news releases. If you don't already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com.","Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website. Joining me on the call today is Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and Chief Executive Officer. I'll provide a brief overview of our company's performance. Scott will discuss financial and global packaging metrics and then I'll finish up with comments on our aerospace business and the outlook for the remainder of 2014.","In short, we had a strong second quarter and our results exceeded our expectations. During the second quarter, we saw an extension of many of our first quarter themes: solid global beverage can demand with healthy year-over-year growth in Europe, Asia and Brazil and firmer demand in North America; lower operating costs in our European beverage can segment and continued strong cost management in our North American as well as Asian beverage can businesses; continued specialty can and beer container growth in North America; strong performance in our European and Mexican impact-extruded businesses from both a volume and cost perspective; strong aerospace program execution; and ongoing disciplined returns-oriented capital allocation strategy from all drove our results.","North American tinplate container volumes were lower than expected and, operationally, we continue to have some operational challenges that we discussed on our first quarter conference call. Some of it is related to the repositioning of certain manufacturing equipment across the domestic food and household segment footprint, and some of it is a bit self-inflicted as we have taken steps -- and we have taken steps to get it back on the right track for 2015 and beyond.","While some previously disclosed segments still exist in the back half of '14, including persistent LME premium in Europe, the aforementioned manufacturing inefficiencies in our food and household products division, and tougher second half volume comps, it's evident that 2014 is shaping up to be a better year than 2013.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott for a review of our second quarter numbers. Scott?","Scott C. Morrison","Thanks, John. Excuse me, I'm fighting a bit of a cold this morning. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share were $1.13 versus last year's $0.85. In addition to John's comments around better year-over-year global beverage can volumes and cost-out progress, a lower share count contributed to our improved results. During the first half of the year, we acquired net $239 million of our stock and returned another $37 million to shareholders in the form of dividends. And presently, the majority of our free cash flow is expected to be returned to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends.","For the full year, again, no significant changes to our previous financial metrics. Free cash flow is expected to exceed $550 million, share buybacks will be in the range of $500 million, CapEx around $375 million, with it being more back-end weighted. Interest expense should be around $163 million and our effective tax rate for the full year should be in the range of 28%. On a full year basis, corporate undistributed should be closer to $80 million.","Net balance sheet debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $3.4 billion. Credit quality and liquidity of the company remains solid with comparable EBIT-to-interest coverage of 5.6x and net debt-to-comparable EBITDA at 2.7x. Committed credit and available liquidity at quarter end was in excess of $1 billion.","For a complete summary of second quarter results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, please refer to the Notes section of today's earnings release.","Moving to operations. Our metal beverage, Americas and Asia, segment comparable earnings were up more than $15 million in the second quarter. Year-over-year benefits from cost-out programs, excellent operating performance at the plant level and continued specialty can growth in the Americas all contributed to better segment results. In the quarter, North America volumes were up due to our customer waiting to beer and continued growth in specialty, while volumes in Brazil and China were both up mid-teens in the quarter, due to higher can penetration for beer packaging.","European segment profit was up roughly $22 million in the second quarter due to mid-single-digit volume growth and the benefits of reduced costs, which will continue to flow through the segment in 2014 and into 2015.","As John briefly touched on, between our previously disclosed second half LME premium headwind of roughly EUR 7 million and tougher second half volume comparisons, our ongoing cost savings initiatives should offset these headwinds in the back half of the year. Food and household comparable segment earnings were down approximately $8 million in the quarter, as low-single-digit segment volume declines and manufacturing inefficiencies in North America, which John mentioned earlier, dampened the results. Rest assured that the food and household team has a plan to align tinplate supply with demand in North America while wrestling with the current plant performance headwind to ensure that we are well-positioned going into 2015.","In summary, our global beverage operating team continues to execute in tight supply\/demand situations across the majority of its manufacturing portfolio, while also managing capital projects in North America and Europe to further improve our packaging business in 2015 and beyond.","With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.","John A. Hayes","Great. Thanks, Scott. Our aerospace business continues to exceed expectations. Solid execution and higher work fees on existing programs, successful deliveries and niche product wins for antennas and sensors are some of the highlights. Contracted backlog ended the quarter at 580 -- excuse me, $858 million, and as mentioned on our January call, we are pursuing some large programs that are expected to be awarded late this year or early next year. We do have a significant launch coming up for the WorldView-3 satellite by DigitalGlobe later in August, and so far, things look good here.","Now looking out across our company today. We are proud of our year-to-date results and the teamwork it took to accomplish them. Though some challenges still exist, we will control what we can control and effectively manage through the rest. We remain confident in our ability to achieve our long-term diluted EPS growth goal of 10% to 15% in 2014 and beyond while growing both our EVA dollars and free cash flow.","And with that, Nelson, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets.","Mark Wilde","I wondered, on bev cans in Europe, is it possible, Scott, to quantify the benefit you got from just no more drag from the switch of headquarters that you were dealing with last year? And then I wondered if you could also provide a little color on that expansion in the Netherlands?","Scott C. Morrison","Sure. The -- I think the Europe benefited from nice volume gains in the quarter. If you remember, year-over-year, volumes were a lot tougher in the first half of last year. This year, they've been better. They're getting the benefits of cost-out, some of the cost-out programs that they've been putting in place. So I think there's really not much of a drag anymore from the European headquarter's relocation. And then we're getting the benefit of the -- on the tax rate side, we're making more money in Europe, which has lower tax rates, so that's helping us. The second part of your question was about the Netherlands' expansion, and that is moving along and we expect to have that capacity up for the busy season next summer.","Mark Wilde","And that's all committed volume at this point?","Scott C. Morrison","Yes, we have a variety of contracts to take that volume.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.","Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","It's actually Mehul Dalia sitting in for Ghansham. First question, just wanted to make sure I heard correctly. Aluminum premium is expected to be a EUR 7 million headwind in 2H in Europe? And do you expect a price recovery in 2015 as a result?","Scott C. Morrison","To the first part, yes. The premium that we expect, the headwind is about EUR 7 million in the second half of the year. We had a little of that in the second quarter, but only maybe about EUR 1 million. In terms of price recovery, it's too early to talk about what pricing looks like for 2015, but obviously, if our price -- or if our costs are going up at some point, you need to recover that through the system.","Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. Great. And I know the press release talked about a plant fire in the Americas. Just being it's the peak season right now, is there any worries about supply as a result?","Scott C. Morrison","Our people did a phenomenal job. We did have a fire in Monticello, Indiana really at the peak time of shipping. And through the great work that they did, they were able to get that plant up and running in different pieces over a period of just a few weeks. And throughout our system of people doing really phenomenal work, we really didn't miss a beat. So due to the great work of our people, it really was less of a financial impact, but tremendous work by our people.","Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. Great. And just one last one. Just wanted an update on the supply and demand balance in China, and if you have any initial thoughts on pricing for 2015 out there?","Scott C. Morrison","We're hopeful that pricing would stabilize. There's still a lot of -- there's probably 20% excess supply. We're sold out so we're running kind of hand and mouth in terms of our selling them what we can produce. So we're pretty tight. But it is a much more seasonal market, too. Even though there is 20% overcapacity in total, finding cans at the peak time is a bit tough. And I think it's a little too early to tell in terms of pricing in China, but hopefully we've seen kind of the bottom. Things that we've seen recently, it doesn't look like it's materially changing from where it's at right now.","John A. Hayes","The only thing I'd add is the market continues to grow very strongly there. Mid-double digits, 15%, 17%, which obviously helps to soak up some of that excess supply. I think as we said on our last call that some of the smaller, more regional players continue to put some more capacity in. But I think the tone and tenor of building plants versus making money has changed slightly towards the positive in terms of looking to make money and make returns.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a few interconnected question on Brazil and Latin America. Can you talk a little bit about the pack mix change to more one-way during the World Cup. What are you hearing from your customers as far as retaining that shift impact mix? What do you think is going to happen with the impact of the demand from a possible beer tax coming later in the year? And then how should we be thinking about 2015, just off of a strong 2014 comparison?","John A. Hayes","That's a lot of questions there. I think the first one, in terms of the package mix, we continue to see growth in one-way packaging. The can as a percent of the beer mix is now 45%, 46%, that's up from 39%, 40%, I think, a year ago. So things continue to go strong there. I don't think it was only related to the World Cup because we've seen a consistent growth of that metric over time. Certainly, the World Cup had, on the margins, some positive. But there was also a lot of on-premise beer drinking in Brazil, which is not cans. It's more returnable glass. But I do think, overall, those trends that we've seen have continued. In terms of your question about the beer tax, we've talked about this before. They pushed it out on the last call. It was supposed to happen in June and now they're talking September, and it may not happen at all, so it's unclear. It would put a little bit of a headwind into it. But these things happen from time to time. What we're hearing is it's unclear whether it's going to be implemented or at what time, given the elections going on. We had a very strong first half of the year than the overall industry did from a volume perspective. Our plan -- our expectations are it's going to be much more muted, is the best way to say it, and it's going to be relatively flat is what we're planning on in the second half this year. Going in 2015, it's really as much about the economy, and the economy is not doing all that well. The elections are coming up. So it depends upon that. We certainly don't see any big upside or downside, relative to overall volumes. And so kind of relatively flat to up a couple of percent, if you'd ask us right now, it's probably what we'd say. But it is a bit premature to look into the crystal ball for 2015 down there.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a quick follow-up then on that. How sold out are you with your facilities in Latin America and Brazil, specifically, at this point?","Scott C. Morrison","We've got -- it's a very seasonal business there, as well. And we brought up a line -- the last line in the fourth quarter of last year. So I think from a supply standpoint, we've got kind of where we need to be. I don't think we're going to need to be adding any additional capacity. Again, it's a very seasonal business. So seasonally, you run really hard when it's summertime and you run a little bit less when it's not.","John A. Hayes","Yes. We currently have no plans to add any additional capacity, but our manufacturing focus right now is really to be as efficient as we can with those assets that we put in place and get more cans out of them. So I think over the next 12 to 18 months, you should expect that's really where our focus is.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess, starting off, maybe shorter term, talking about the food can business in North America. As you mentioned, and for a lot of reasons who already discussed in the past, earnings were down quite a bit. Is there a way to parse how much of the decline in earnings year-on-year was attributed to, say, your volumes being off, how much of it is just from higher cost to service you're realigning capacity ahead of '15 and how much of it was the self-inflicted? If you can get into any of that, that would be helpful, and I had some follow-ons.","John A. Hayes","Well, the best way -- I don't know if I can break it into those 3 buckets, but I can break it into these 2 buckets. I think, from a volume decline, 1\/3 of the decline in profits came from volume and 2\/3 came from the manufacturing side and whether that was -- it was a relocation of the assets, as well as the self-inflicted -- we just haven't been executing as well as we would've liked in terms of these movements, and it's going to take some time to cycle through. So that's -- George, that's one of the reasons why we said, in the second half of this, we're going to see -- continue to face see some of these headwinds. But I think as we go into 2015, we're laser-focused on making sure these issues are corrected.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","John, on the volume, is this market or is this related to the contract that's ultimately coming up, I would have thought then have an impact in 2015?","John A. Hayes","Yes. No, it's market related. We're down a couple of a percent, I think, as we said. The packs have started a little bit late, but they seem to be -- it depends on where you're talking, but they seem to be going okay, but I wouldn't read anything into it other than we are off a couple percent just because, remember the first quarter, the weather was bad and I think even in the early part of the first half of the second quarter, the weather wasn't all that great. So it's kind of pushed the packs out a little bit. But I wouldn't read anything other than that.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's fair. I guess my last question on food, and again, you did very well everywhere else, so I apologize, I'm focusing mostly on where the performance wasn't as great this quarter. If we consider the volume effect in '15 as the contract comes off, but then the recovery, from an operating standpoint, from the realignment and then getting back, perhaps, on the performance relative to where you've had some missteps, do you think earnings in food next year are down versus '14? Or might you be flat to up because of the improvement in operations?","John A. Hayes","I think flat to up would be a big stretch as we sit here right now. But I do think that they'll be down slightly, but it's really a function of how much we can approve the manufacturing side of the business here. We've talked about as we go into the second half of this year that we're going to be looking at executing on our plans that we already have in place to optimize our business going into '15. So I think there are some puts and takes as you think about '15. One of the positive things is we should get better manufacturing performance.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. One last one, John, I'll turn it over, and really more for Scott. Realizing that it's not '15 yet and it's hard to provide a CapEx forecast, since a lot of your projects seem to be back-end weighted off Myanmar, the spending this year, my guess, is a little bit more back-end loaded as well. Would the project spending spill over into '15 and therefore make it more likely that capital spending is up from 2014 or should we not draw that conclusion?","Scott C. Morrison","I don't know, George. It's probably too early to call. There's definitely -- the capital has been slower than what we expected it to be flowing out this year. And we'll see what we get done in the second half of this year. But we typically have some amount of carry-out capital and carry-in capital, year-over-year, and it's really too early to call. And it's also, frankly, dependent on the opportunities that we have. So too early to tell what '15 will be. I have a hard-enough time judging next quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","First question I have is actually let's jump over to aerospace. John, you mentioned that there are some initiatives, I guess, from proposals that are out there that you guys are kind of aiming to get a piece off in late '14 and '15. Are these sort of contracts could make the business a lot bigger or are they more to kind of keep the business the size it is right now?","John A. Hayes","No, I think it's more growth, look to growth. We just are aware of a fair number of different program proposals that will be put out for bid in the second half of this year that had kind of fallen to our sweet spot. So as we think about that, whether we win them this year or next year, or whether they will be awarded this year or early next year, it's unclear at this time because some of the request for proposals aren't even out yet. But we do see those types of things and I think it will help to grow our business.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay. And then I might have missed this. But in the Americas segment, could you give us a little bit of detail between how specialty did versus standard? And even within standard, sort of what was the difference between beer and non-beer?","John A. Hayes","Well, I think I'll take a crack at it. I know our specialty can growth was up high-single digits. And so by definition, our standard container were probably down a little bit. When you look at beer versus soft drink as an industry and as -- beer was up a few percent, soft drink was down a few percent. And so I think those kind of trends that we've talked about in the pass where the can is taking share, the package mix of beer continues to go strong. The beer market is relatively stable and solid, and on the soft drink side, they have some challenges in terms of volume and I think the can is feeling it. So those are the overall headlines.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","And then I guess the last question, just really more on a -- I guess from a qualitative perspective. When you think about the aluminum premium that you're paying in Europe, that's something that I would imagine wasn't anticipated when you did your contracts because it seems like that we've seen contracts in Europe, as well as North America, kind of have as a precondition almost to work. That volatility in aluminum is borne by the customer and yet here that's not occurring. So why would there not be a sort of a change in the contracts just too kind of keep that kind of rule of thumb that we've been seeing for the last few years?","Scott C. Morrison","The pricing in Europe has always been a little bit different, but I think you're exactly right. I think the premiums that we're experiencing now, at some point, need to flow through the system. So it's always been a little bit less connected than it has been in North America and other markets. But you could see -- I mean if we're paying double the premium this year versus where we were 6, 9 months ago, at some point you need to get that back.","John A. Hayes","And I think one of the issues, the premium historically had been relatively stable and so people never really thought about these big deviations that have been seen. So your point is spot on, that I think as we look at contracts going forward, that's one of the things that we're certainly going to be trying to address.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","And I know maybe this is not a fair question, but is it possible that premium could go down and you could actually benefit, say, next year if it's not -- if the volatility is not written out of the contracts?","Scott C. Morrison","Well, I think you'd have year-over-year comps that are easier, but I'm not sure it's going to go -- we would be hopeful that it would go back to more normalized level, but I'm not sure it's going to go much further than that.","John A. Hayes","Yes and we think irrespective of the changes at the LME's rules, it's going to take some time for this to wind down, the premium changes to kind of flow through the system, just because the way the whole system works.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a follow-up on North American specialty cans. It sounds like volumes were strong. If you were to look at specialty can margins, would you describe those as up year-over-year? Are they stable or is there any pressure there? And I think, on the last call, you referenced potentially a line addition in specialty cans in North America in the second half, if there's any update on that?","John A. Hayes","Yes. The -- I would say, again, we talk about specialty as almost like one type of package, but it's 20 or 25 different sizes and shapes. I think from a profitability perspective, we really haven't seen any change in that. We do have some plans that we really can't talk about in terms of putting a specialty container opportunity in North America that we're moving forward on. And that will be up and running sometime next year, so that's the only update I can provide.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Okay. And is it possible to give capacity figures for the Holland and the Myanmar lines?","John A. Hayes","Typically, when you add a new line, for example, on existing facility, you get, depending on the speed and other things, 750 million to 900 million cans, plus or minus, so it's going to be in that range. And then in Myanmar, it really is more about the demand of Myanmar than it is about the capacity. We expect to be up and running in excess of a 0.5 billion cans in Myanmar. And as we go forward, we'll continue to incrementally build out that line to provide more capacity.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just one last one. I mean, we've seen some undisciplined supply behavior by Chinese producers within China. As you look at Southeast Asia as an attractive opportunity, are you seeing Chinese competitors look at that market or maybe put capacity into that market that doesn't necessarily make sense or is concerning to you? Or how do you think about the threat of Chinese producers in Southeast Asia?","John A. Hayes","Well we have seen a little bit, but not wholesale. In Vietnam, there's a Chinese producer that's manufacturing there and some other areas we look from time to time. It's certainly not as acute as in China itself. But there's other competitors as well, whether the Japanese, or whether even some European competitors that have been looking over there. So it's -- I would say the overcapacity and the thought around that is not as acute as it historically had been in China, but it's certainly a competitive world.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Philip Ng with Jefferies.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Bev can demand in North America was pretty encouraging in the first half. Are you seeing that momentum carryover into 3Q? And how has the promotional activity track thus far?","John A. Hayes","Well in terms of continuing it, and we're only, what, 3 or 4 weeks into the third quarter and we haven't seen any appreciable change in the demand profile, I would describe the promotional activity as kind of average. As I said earlier, the beverage -- excuse me, beer cans were up, soft drink cans were done a little bit. And I think that kind of nears the overall industry for both those categories. And so we did see some 4th of July, some promotional activity, but I would just describe it as average.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then it looks like one of your competitors is looking to add some capacity in the specialty can side in Europe and North America. Any concern of saturation in that market as you bring on your plant in the Netherlands? And I guess you are looking to add some capacity as well next year in North America?","John A. Hayes","No. Because, as you all know, typically, when we add capacity, it's on the back of customer contracts. And so we feel good about the capacity additions we're putting in.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then in China, it was pretty impressive that you were able to run your plants that hard. I would've thought your plants are running pretty full at this point. Can you talk about some of the initiatives that you have placed to unlock more capacity and is that double-digit type trajectory sustainable as we head into next year, if there is demand?","John A. Hayes","Well we are, as Scott mentioned, hand to mouth in Asia. And our folks have been doing a good job, but it's -- and anytime you're hand to mouth, it creates inefficiencies from a logistics perspective because you're shipping cans all over the place. We are -- while we have no specific things to talk about right now. We do have to look about capacity in Asia, but we're not going to do anything unless we can make economic returns. And so as this oversupply exists, but at the same time, the growth continues very strongly, we're looking at ways of getting more of our existing system. And then if we have to add incremental capacity, because generally speaking, particularly in the South of China, is where we're short of cans.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And then just one last final one. The aluminum producers have continued to shift more production into auto and aerospace. Have you taken any initiatives to lock up supply longer term?","Scott C. Morrison","We've -- there's been a lot of talk about the automotive business, and it remains to be seen where that's going to go. It depends on the customer what the customer wants to do, really, and how long they want to go on their contracts. There hasn't been any appreciable change in how we're contracting for aluminum or what we're doing.","John A. Hayes","Yes. The only thing I'd add as well is, remember, the North American market is not exclusively but largely a soft hole market. And so the contracting of the rolled aluminum is often done by some of our major customers.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Langton with JPMorgan.","Tyler J. Langton - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just with Europe, I was wondering -- in terms of taking out costs, could you provide just a little more detail, I guess, on how much you've achieved as of now in relation to your goals and how much sort of is left potentially.","Scott C. Morrison","I think we're making a pretty good progress. And part of it is small often depreciation for projects that had kind of run through their life. But a lot of it is efficiencies that we're getting out of running the business as a Pan-European business out of Z\u00fcrich. And I think there's more to go in terms of manning and efficiency. But right now, I'd say we're on track with where we hope and thought we would be, but I think there's more to go.","Tyler J. Langton - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And just a follow-up on the premiums. I mean if European premiums remained where they are now, I guess would there be any incremental hit as you head into 2015?","Scott C. Morrison","Well, you'd have a tougher comp in the first half of '15, but since they've been elevated in the second half of '14, that would balance out.","Tyler J. Langton - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then I guess sort of just last question. I know on U.S. bev cans, you've kind of benefited from the closures in the previous 2 quarters. Is there still room to reduce cost there or is that kind of the cost space roughly where you think it should be?","John A. Hayes","Well I think from a footprint perspective, if that's where you're going to, I think we're comfortable with where we are right now. But our folks continuously focus on taking inefficient costs out of the system, and we've been spending a lot of time on the freight and logistics side, the whole warehousing side, there's a lot of opportunity to optimize that. And so our folks have done a wonderful job, and it's part of the mantra. It's just to continue trying to cost-out. But from a manufacturing footprint perspective, we have no plans to do anything other than what we're doing right now.","Tyler J. Langton - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And those savings from the previous closure have lapsed as of the second quarter?","John A. Hayes","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank.","Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a few questions on Europe -- I know you kind of talked around this a bit, but can you just comment on the sustainability of the 13% EBIT margin? I mean I know that you're going to see some premium headwinds in the back half, but it just seems like you previously had said 11% to 12%, so it was a little bit better than I was anticipating.","John A. Hayes","Yes. If -- remember, when you go back and look over the past number of years, there's a seasonality aspect of it. And our margins are usually a little bit higher in the second and third quarters relative to the first and second. So when we were talking about that 11.5%, 12.5%, that was really on a full year basis.","Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. That makes sense. And then, again, do you expect, with the situation in Russia and the Ukraine, that you might see some fallout of volume basically making its way into other Eastern European markets that might typically go in that direction?","John A. Hayes","I don't think anything appreciably. We don't think too much about Russia, because Russia's, from a logistics point of view, is very far away from the other parts of Europe. And Ukraine, I know that there is one plant in Ukraine and -- but the overall Continental European market has been regionally strong. And so when you're talking about a base of $50 billion and it's growing mid-single digits, that's a couple of can lines a year. And so we don't -- if your question is around -- or you're concerned that things from the east may move to the west and it's going to put pricing pressure on it, I just don't think, on the margin, there may be some cans going there, but it's not going to have enough of an impact.","Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just my last question is have you guys made any decisions on leadership in the metal beverage business?","John A. Hayes","Well we're taking our time. As you see, we're performing very well and we're having conversations about that, but we have made -- to answer your question, no, we've not made any decisions.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered, but I wanted to kind of hone in on a couple of areas if I could. One being as -- recognizing you guys are very, very disciplined, when you go to put capital in you don't build a lot of spec capacity or do things of that nature. But -- and you go about that the right way. So when you put a new capacity or you're in the process of putting new capacity in the Netherlands, in example, given some of the premium issues, can you use that as an opportunity to -- and appreciating you don't want to talk in too much detail about contracts, but can you use that as an opportunity to maybe change some of the mechanics of how you do contracts to protect yourself from things like LME premiums and things of that nature? Or do you kind of have to follow industry dynamics and then work as a whole. Maybe a little color would be helpful.","John A. Hayes","Well, I don't know. I think they're a bit separate. I hear where you're going with that in terms of how to use this capacity as leverage. We're sold out in Europe right now, in fact, we're real tight in Europe right now, and so we need the capacity to come on. How you negotiate contracts with customers, I think, is separate and apart from that. And it's a competitive world. So if we were trying to do certain things in competition or not, we'd have to deal with that. So that's the way we think about it.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. And then the second, you said that you are pretty in a spot where you're sold out and tight in China, we've heard some discussion here and there about some incremental capacity or someone looking to potentially add a facility in I think the in the Weilin area, could you comment on your appetite, as it sits today, given that you're full and seemingly running at okay returns to potentially add capacity?","John A. Hayes","Well, I think I mentioned this earlier. We are looking at that. We have nothing to announce right now. But again, we are sold out in Asia, and as the market continues to grow mid-double-digit to teens, 15%, 17%, we want to capture our fair share of that but only do it if we can be economically sustainable, and our folks have done a very good job of -- from a cost perspective and a capital perspective of making sure that we're low-cost there. And so, stay tuned on what some of our plants are, but we're looking at various things.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. And then just the last question I had was when we look at kind of your opportunity here in North America in that tinplate business, I think you've -- in the past, you've talked about looking for ways or options to try to replace some of that lost EBIT that would be from the contract move. As you sit today, you haven't made any other capacity announcements, whether it's adds in different areas. Can you maybe share where you're at in the process? Is that something still you're working on and you'll share with us in the future? Or have you thought about adding, whether it's different products or different components, aside from moving around some volumes?","John A. Hayes","Yes. Well, I think we mentioned this on our first quarter call, but we expect it, come late summer early fall, to know where we stand relative to this loss of the business and whether or not they require assistance going forward. I think you should expect that we have plans in place and that we're going to be executing on them in the second half to optimize our business for the expected customer loss. Some of it includes -- I would not say we are going out in trying to look for new business just to \"buy\" business. We're looking at various costs initiatives. We're looking at various new product initiatives as well. And you should expect to hear some of those in the second half of this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Looking at the total EBITDA for the business in the second quarter, it looks like it's up about $34 million. Is it possible to parse out how much of that $34-million improvement is productivity and sort of how you think about the productivity number in the back half of the year, what that number typically is in a given year from a planning perspective?","Scott C. Morrison","There's always a variety of -- we don't parse it like that. But I mean the improvement is across the board, across the beverage business, from volume improvements and cost-outs. It's a variety of things. So it's a pretty strong operating quarter.","John A. Hayes","Yes. I mean, I think it's the only -- I'm with Scott. I don't think we parse it out the way you think about it, but you'll go segment-by-segment and you look at the margin improvement, I think we're up in every category, except the food and household for the reasons we've talked about before. So we've had great operating performance and we've had a much more normalized constructive demand situation as well.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then in China, I think we had talked about in the past that you'll be able to grow operating earnings there this year, even though the pricing environment is tough. Are you still on track to accomplish that and can you sort of provide order of magnitude on what you think China operating earnings will up in '14?","John A. Hayes","Well, we never really get into that. But I do think that we have some volume improvements. We have -- as I said, we have a little bit higher costs because the volumes have been so strong we've had to move cans all over the place. And we also even have some currency headwinds with the volume improvements as well as the cost-out on the manufacturing side I think are more than offsetting certainly the -- some of those other headwinds.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it, John. Just last question. So your leverage ratios are moving lower even though you're not paying down that, given EBITDA's growing. So is there potential to perhaps buy back above the free cash flow number, so north of $0.5 billion given your leverage is moving lower?","John A. Hayes","We look at it all the time in terms of how much stock we're going to buy back. The guidance I gave you on the call earlier of we expect to use most of the -- all that free cash flow to buy back stock and pay dividends. That's kind of where we are right now.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets.","Mark Wilde","Yes. I've got just few short ones. John, can you give us some sense of what kind of growth you're seeing in that craft beer business right now. I think you've got most of the can business in that market.","John A. Hayes","Yes. It continues to grow very strong, just a data point on that. The can as a share of the package mix in craft is now right around 10%, and that's a great testament to the work done largely by the business development folks. And so we continue to see very strong growth from the craft side. It's still not -- it's not a huge part of our overall portfolio, but the growth in it is still quite strong, and we expect that to continue. There's been a number of craft brewers, they've been putting in new breweries in the Southeast region, and I think as we think about the capacity there, as well as them putting new can lines, and we're seeing good growth there.","Mark Wilde","Yes. I mean what would guess your penetration would have been in that market 3 years ago, would it have been like 5% or even below that?","John A. Hayes","Less. Less than 5%. I would be speculating, but I guess 2% to 3%. It's been growing strongly.","Mark Wilde","Yes. All right. So you're growing relative to the market. The second one I had, just with kind of conflicts picking up globally, is there any impact in all of that for Ball Aerospace as you look forward over the next 3 or 4 years?","John A. Hayes","The short answer is there very well could be, but it's -- I really can't comment on that. When you think about -- the geopolitical environment is such that there is regional conflicts everywhere, and I think information and surveillance and reconnaissance around that is really important, and I think those are some of the strategic opportunities we may have in front of us.","Mark Wilde","Okay. About half of that business is defense, is that right?","John A. Hayes","Approximately, yes.","Mark Wilde","Yes. Okay. And then the last one I had is just for Scott. I noticed that the repurchase activity this quarter was the lowest that we've seen since the second quarter of 2010. I just wondered whether we should read anything into that?","Scott C. Morrison","No. I actually didn't know that. But -- usually, we try to buy -- I mean, frankly, we buy pretty heavy in the first quarter of the year. In the second quarter, we probably have more moderate pace, so you shouldn't read anything into that.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wanted to pick up on one of the question I think Chris had started in. And you've teed up given your comments on Asia and China in particular. So if you have a market that is, well, if you have a customer base and a supply chain of your own that's sold out, and we have acknowledged in the past you've discussed the fact that prices had nothing where you would have liked them to be. And you're still making economic profit when prices aren't where you like them to be. You're suggesting that the next move should be potentially to add a can plant in China, and I was wondering how you, if that wound up being the eventuality, how you would be able to preserve or turn to a contract where certainly in the last few years because of market factors, not your own, it's been less good of a market than you would've liked. So differently, given your sold-out position, want opportunity you have to have instead of growing capacity, but rather using your sold-out position to optimize your customer mix?","John A. Hayes","Yes. And, George, those are all fair points. The way we kind of think about it is, #1, China is such a large country. And so you have to look at the regional differences. So that's point 1. Pricing has come down, and as Scott mentioned it has stabilized. Point 3 is our folks over the last 2 years have done a very good job, focused intently on making sure we're low costs from an operating perspective and from a capital perspective. And so if we were to be thinking about capital going forward, I think it's on an optimized capital base at a much lower cost basis. And the question is, at the current pricing, can you make economic returns with that? And if the answer is yes, then you consider it. If the answer is no, then it gets into how do you improve either 1 of those 3 further from where you are today. That's the way we think about it.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's fair. And gets me to one of the other questions that I had. I mean relative to where the industry was back in the mid-1990s, the beverage can business had become actually very good business for a lot of reasons. You are currently earning a lot more economic profit, both as a company, as an industry, than had been the case, given our mix. But that also brings a challenge because it attracts capital. So what do you believe to be, if you can't get into the number, that's a question about productivity. One of the ways you keep out that capacity is by always improving your own cost position. To what degree do you think you can improve your productivity and cost relative to the industry in total, especially in the growth markets like in Europe or Asia? Where do you think your productivity is leading the market by?","John A. Hayes","Well, again, I think we've talked about this in the past. The way that we look at it is, let's just pick on China, there are a number of smaller, more regional ones that are publicly traded and you're able to go and look at their public financial statements and we're able to do that and compare them with ours. And we see that scale matters in our business. And we see that we can bring the global perspective to issues at a regional level. And so if we're having some operational issues in a particular plant in China, it's not just the people in the plant that can deal with it, we can bring to bear some of our experts around the world to help them on that. Some of the regional guys don't have that. So what that ultimately creates is a scale issue where we can see it in the financial statements that our returns and margins are better than some of the local regional guys.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's fair. I'll drop that line for now. I guess the last question I had and I'll turn it over. Realizing that this maybe isn't the most realistic scenario because you're going to win contracts and your backlog is going to get better, but assuming these contracts don't come in quite the way you'd expect, when would we begin to see your margins in aerospace begin to fade? Right now, it's very rich because of where you are in terms of the contract terms, the life of contracts and so on. Would that be a third quarter or of fourth quarter event? Good luck in the quarter, feel better, Scott.","Scott C. Morrison","Thanks.","John A. Hayes","I don't think it's necessarily a step change function quarter-over-quarter, but I do think that we've been -- in the first half of this year, and you've seen it both the first and the second quarter, we've been doing very well as we've closed out some of these programs. I mentioned that we have the WorldView-3 launch coming up in a couple weeks. We delivered that in the second quarter, and so that de-risked much of it and we were able to get some benefit there. I think as we go into the third quarter and fourth quarter, you should not expect as much of that as you saw in the first and second quarter. And then when it comes to the rebuilding that backlog, whether it's fourth quarter this year, whether it's first quarter next year, it's not -- we don't necessarily think about it as a point in time. But there's a number of opportunities for chasing that are going to be awarded in that timeframe. And that, hopefully, we'll start to build the backlog back again and then we'll go through this other cycle of starting the contracts and then performing as we go.","Operator","And I'm showing no further questions at this time.","John A. Hayes","Okay. Well, thank you, everyone. Enjoy the rest of the summer, and we look forward to speaking to you in October.

This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's second quarter 2013 results.","The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings, as well as company news releases. If you don't already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website.","Joining me on the call today is Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'll provide a brief overview of our company's performance, Scott will discuss financial and global packaging metrics, then I'll finish up with comments of our aerospace business and the outlook for the remainder of 2013.","Now despite a very cold and damp spring, particularly in North America and Western and Central Europe, that resulted in volume declines for standard beverage cans in these regions, our second quarter results were largely in line with expectations. In fact, the soft demand resulting from the challenging weather and global economic malaise actually more than offset much of the good work and performance our various businesses have accomplished. Over the past month, we've begun to see more normalized weather patterns and slightly better demand than we saw in the second quarter, which if sustainable, should give us better visibility as we cycle into the second half of 2013 and, more importantly, into 2014.","During the quarter, we tackled a variety of issues, including: aggressively addressing the unusually soft demand in our 12-ounce U.S. beverage container manufacturing output by permanently eliminating 12-ounce capacity in our Milwaukee, Wisconsin, facility; making progress on European cost-out plans through, among other items, announcing the consolidation of our former European headquarters in Ratingen, Germany, into our regional technical center in Bonn, Germany; as well as other G&A optimization measures. While we are working through the various approvals required, we expect this to be completed in the first half of 2014 and, combined with other cost-out and value-in initiatives, will help us to improve our fixed cost leverage in this segment. In Brazil, we are on track to complete the installation of a second line in our Alagoinhas beverage can manufacturing facility by early fourth quarter of this year, which positions us nicely as we look to the World Cup next summer. In Asia, we are in the process of relocating the capacity from our one-line facility in Shenzhen, China, to one of our existing locations there. This optimized footprint and better cost structure will position us nicely in the growing Southeast China region.","Our food and household products business also had a good quarter, with volumes up 8%. And we are finalizing the installation of another production line in our Mexican impact-extruded facility.","Lastly, in the quarter, we took advantage of attractive credit markets to increase our financial flexibility by amending and extending our credit facility, coupled with the issuance of $1 billion of 10.5-year senior notes at 4%.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott for a review of our second quarter numbers. Scott?","Scott C. Morrison","Thanks, John.","Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the second quarter were $0.85 versus last year's $0.89. Also in the quarter, the company recorded after-tax charges totaling approximately $32.6 million primarily related to business consolidation and debt refinancing costs. Our metal beverage Americas and Asia segment comparable earnings were down year-over-year.","These results were slightly weaker than expectations given continued weak industry demand for our standard cans in North America where our volumes were down double digits in the quarter, which was consistent with the first quarter trend. From a manufacturing perspective, cost containment and operating performance at the plant level were exceptional in all regions, and specialty cans in the Americas continued to grow at a double-digit pace.","The European segment profit declined in the quarter due to slightly lower volumes brought about by challenging economic and weather conditions, coupled with higher labor and input cost, both of which are being addressed aggressively.","In food and household, year-over-year segment earnings were higher due to improving volume trends, our recently acquired Mexico plant and good performance in our steel and aluminum aerosol businesses. Segment volumes increased 8% in the quarter, and conditions leading into the seasonal fruit and vegetable pack are favorable.","Transitioning from operations. During the quarter, our corporate undistributed costs were roughly in line with expectations, the effective tax rate was slightly lower than we anticipated and we repurchased a net $202 million of our stock. Net balance sheet debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $3.7 billion.","Credit quality and liquidity of the company remained solid, with comparable EBIT-to-interest coverage at 4.7x and net debt-to-comparable EBITDA of 3.2x. Committed credit and available liquidity at quarter end was in excess of $900 million. Given our seasonality and strong full year free cash flow, we anticipate year-end net debt levels to be in the range of $3.1 billion.","For a complete summary of the second quarter results on a GAAP and non-GAAP bases, please refer to the notes section of today's earnings release.","Moving on to financial metrics for full year 2013. Hardly any changes here. Interest expense will be in the range of $183 million due to some negative carry associated with the senior notes offering. Full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings is expected to be approximately 27% and full year corporate expense is expected to be around $73 million.","CapEx is still in the range of $400 million, and free cash flow will be in the range of $450 million. And the majority of our free cash flow is expected to be returned to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends.","With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.","John A. Hayes","Thanks, Scott.","Our aerospace business continued to perform well in the quarter, with solid execution on existing programs, the award of a Korean environmental instrument and solid contracted backlog at $966 million. While backlog continues to remain at or near record levels, we have seen some slight delays in U.S. government contract awards due to the effects of sequestration. Our operating performance has been excellent, and we remain well positioned while continuing to monitor closely our timing of project starts as we move into the third quarter. Longer term, we are seeing a variety of opportunities both domestically and internationally that will continue to help grow our business and help mitigate any effects of sequestration.","Now looking out across our company today, a few observations to share. Over the past month, we have seen some improvement in the demand for standard beverage cans in North America and Europe, although we are not planning to recoup the volume shortfall of the first half of the year. In our metal beverage Americas segment, a tremendous amount of great work has been done to arrest the volume issues we have been facing. And while it is not impossible, our ability to reach last year's profitability in this segment for the full year will be challenging.","In Europe beverage, we have plans in place and are executing on a variety of cost-out and value-in projects, the majority of which will be realized in 2014 and 2015, which should get us back to operating margins consistent with the 2010-2011 period.","Plantings to date related to the seasonal vegetable harvest for our food and household products business look good. And as of today, and if the weather holds for a strong pack, we should see continued good performance out of this business in the second half. Going forward, we also see some more upside, with the aluminum aerosol business performing well.","In our aerospace business, Ball's strong performance and track record should keep us well positioned for the long term.","So given all of this, we expect strong free cash flow, as Scott had mentioned; full year 2013 results to exceed full year 2012 comparable diluted earnings per share results; and a return to a more historical earnings per share growth in 2014.","And with that, Ciglund [ph], we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","John, I think you mentioned you saw some pickup in the beginning of the third quarter, in demand in North America. I was wondering if you could just talk to us about that a little bit. Is it just weather returning more normal? Or are you actually seeing some pickup in promotional activity that's been relatively nonexistent? What exactly are you seeing there?","John A. Hayes","I think the vast majority of it has been weather related. As you know, the month of June, particularly the first half of the month of June, had the same trends in May being largely wet and even cold, and we've seen a more normalization of that. There has been a little bit more spot promotion, but that -- I think the vast majority of it is weather.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And when I look at your volumes, you said your 12-ounce volume was down double digit. I think the industry was down about 5% in the quarter. I know that 12-ounce is not your only offering. Can you talk about sort of how your volumes overall compared relative to the industry and maybe how your mix played into that somehow...","John A. Hayes","Well, yes. On the specialty side, we grew double digits again in this quarter, which was -- helped to offset our softness in the 12-ounce. And on an -- on a apples-to-apples comparison, if you exclude the business that we lost last year, we were about down on the 12-ounce side equal to the industry, and then you just compound that with the business we walked away from. And that's why we were a little bit worse than the market.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And just lastly, the facility or the -- you said you were going to eliminate a 12-ounce line in Milwaukee. Is there anything left of that facility? Are we closing a full facility? And if so, what will you think about cost reduction?","John A. Hayes","No, that was one of our facilities that the -- we shared with the metal food business. And we make 2-piece food cans there as well. And we've right-sided the G&A part of that business as we go forward as best we can. But we are still making 2-piece food cans there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","On -- first on Brazil, a lot of your packaging peers have reported challenges there in the beverage business, whether it's weather or the economy or social unrest or whatever the reason. Can you just give us your perspective on the market and then how you're thinking about the upcoming selling season in 4Q and 1Q?","John A. Hayes","Yes. Actually, we feel reasonably bullish on what's going down in Brazil. As you know, we started up a new facility beginning of this year. Our plans are on track for adding a second line in. Our customer base, which is at times different than maybe some of the people you're referring to, has been reasonably strong. We're well diversified into the Northeast and to -- and then down into the South. So overall, we feel pretty good. And as you know, we're just -- it's beginning of their spring right now, so we're starting to get into the heavier selling season. And with the startup of the second line in Alagoinhas, I think we feel pretty good, particularly going into the World Cup in 2014.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then on the beverage can business as a whole, how should we think -- kind of think about inventories across North America and Europe given all the challenges you faced during the first half? I guess I'm asking because should we expect below-average operating rates during the third quarter. Or is it pretty well sort of aligned by now?","Scott C. Morrison","We're managing that as we go along in the year, actually. And so inventory rates are a little bit higher than where we expected them to be given the softness in volume and -- but we kind of monitor that as we move throughout the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I had a couple of questions, to start. Can you tell us, to the degree that you're looking at your headcount in aerospace, do you expect, given the opportunities you have in the next couple of years, that you'll be able to maintain your headcount within aerospace?","John A. Hayes","Yes. And in fact, even year-to-date, we're up slightly in the aerospace business because we've been winning work. And -- but I think, as we go forward, George, we would continue to grow the headcount because you're going to see continued growth in revenue.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Right. No, and that's the point I was trying to get at. So if -- that's a good sign that your headcount is up right now and suggests that, whatever you're seeing out of sequestration, you're being able to manage it with other opportunities. That would be fair?","Scott C. Morrison","Yes.","John A. Hayes","Yes, it is fair. You know what, as you know, our backlog is down slightly from the last quarter, but the real issue is we've been burning off backlog and the government hasn't made any decisions because many of their employees have been furloughed. And so the decisions are just being slowed but our contracted work is still going well.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And now the next question I have for you and Scott, you made the comment about you're working very hard to arrest the decline in 12-ounce beverage can. You obviously shut the line in Milwaukee. You've been doing other activity to shift your mix to specialty cans. But aside from that, is there anything that you're seeing either from your customers to support growth rates, either for mega beer or for softdrinks, or anything that you're doing within 12-ounce, or cans broadly, to support growth there?","John A. Hayes","We've been doing a lot, but let's first start with the customers. As you know, the end markets, beer is down 2.5%, 2.6%, and that's the biggest decline that they've had in a long time. And so they've been doing a lot of innovation work trying to arrest the demographic change: as people get older, they've been drinking less beer; but also the shift to spirits and wines because they very much have been focused on the value side, the pricing side, relative to volume. I think the same thing holds true on the CSD. And as you know, CSD has been challenged. It's a little bit more sensitive to economic issues, and I think this payroll tax has hurt them a little bit more. The pricing strategies, they very much have been focused on. And so CSD is down in overall category, a little bit more than beer. I think both of those segments, the -- our customers are very much focused on the long-term aspects of this because that's where a lot of their value is derived from then. So just based on first- and second-hand knowledge of working with those customers, they are trying to put some more excitement into their categories. Some of it has to do with innovation and coming out with their new products. Some of it has to do with innovation around packaging. And some of it has to do with innovation about placements. And so I think they're very much focused on all those. And as you know, innovation is a key part of our strategy, and so we've been helping them on that.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","John, I thought I saw a headline recently about you using a straw-in-can innovation in Europe. I -- correct me if I'm wrong, but if that is correct, do you have the ability to do that here in the States as well? And is there any interest in that?","John A. Hayes","We do have the ability to do that in the States, yes. And we don't think that's going to be a huge discriminator, but yes, we can do it in the United States.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Last question, and then I'll turn it over. There's obviously been a lot discussed about, some relevant, maybe, some maybe not, but in terms of your potential customer loss in a couple of years. Can you update us with kind of the latest you can provide in terms of how you plan to deal with that potential customer loss or that actual customer loss in '15? And what actually have you garnered already, or progress, in terms of refilling?","John A. Hayes","Well, it's premature to tell the outside world what we're doing, but we definitely, George, have plans in place to recover most, if not all, of that loss from a profit perspective. I'm not talking about from a volume perspective. Our volume will be down, but we're here to make money, not necessarily only to make cans. And so at the appropriate time, we'll be talking about it. I just think it's premature based on some of the activities and the impact that has to be talking about it on this call today.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Philip Gresh with JPMorgan.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question. John, you talked about some nice margin recovery opportunity in Europe. It sounds like you're kind of targeting something in the 12% range, which would be maybe 200 to 300 basis points higher than where you are now. And you've talked about a variety of different factors that have driven the results so far this year. So I guess my question is, if you could parse out for us, what part of that recovery comes from just cost-out and those types of opportunities versus things like getting more price to recover the input cost inflation you've been seeing from metal premiums and other things to get there? That would be helpful.","John A. Hayes","Yes, let me, first clarify. I think when I talked about the 2010-2011 time frame, it's closer to 11% to 12%. You're at the high end of that. And I wouldn't disagree that's an aspiration, but it's going to take an awful lot of hard work to get to that. But having said that, the types of initiatives we have ongoing is taking a look at our G&A headcount. And as part of that, it's not only about the headcount, it's about how we conduct our various processes, whether it's payroll processes, whether it's credit collections, all those various things. We think there's a lot of opportunity to move to more of a truly pan-European approach to that and take a lot of cost out. I think we have a lot of opportunity on the freight side and the logistics side of the business in optimizing that, and we're doing a lot of activities there. We have some other cost activities at the plant level, although as Scott mentioned, the plants are performing very well from a manufacturing perspective. And then last but not least, the value-in is about trying to get paid for what we think is good value and also looking at our mix issues. So it's a combination of a whole host of things that we think, over the next 2-plus years, will get us there.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. Thanks for the clarification on that number. I think I hadn't stripped out aero can. But so what you're saying is you don't need price to recover the input costs, as part of this plan?","John A. Hayes","Not completely. We're -- put it this way: We're not relying on it, but we're certainly focusing on it.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then the second question is just -- you talk also about the framework for 2014 kind of being in place with the long-term view of kind of a 10% to 15% EPS growth. So I guess that what I was wondering there is just, as you think about the drivers of that and what will you continue to see from the volume side of the equation, what kind of volumes do you feel like you need to assume for regions like Europe and North America to get to that kind of target? I mean, if North America is going to continue to be down, let's say, 2% to 3%, can you still get there? Or do we need something closer to flat in North America to reach that type of a target?","John A. Hayes","No. I think, from a big picture, we need -- kind of need more normalized volumes that we've seen over the past couple of years. And what that means, in North America, it's probably down 1% to 2%, maybe even 3%. It's the 6 -- 5% or 6% declines that really put a -- makes it challenging. But as you've seen, we've take -- been able to take out a tremendous amount of fixed cost in our business. In Europe, we're kind of focusing on the more traditional growth, call it the 2% to 5% growth. It's an even year next year. And putting weather aside, with the World Cup, those are big drivers for European beverage can growth, as well as Latin American beverage can growth. And with it being in Brazil, I think there is some upside there. China, all the trends that we've talked about in the past continue to go forward. So in order to achieve the -- our long-term targets in 2014, we just need a more normalized set of volumes that we have not experienced in the first half of this year.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. The last question is just, one of your peer companies was talking about significant underproduction in areas like France, for beer, in the second quarter. And I didn't know if maybe it's -- there are some elements of that, that were impacting you more than just the general volume trends. And if you could give a number for how Europe did in the quarter, that would be helpful.","John A. Hayes","The overall European volumes were down less than 1%, so I don't know, 0.8%, something like that. That's -- the 2 big areas that hurt us the most probably were Germany and France just because the weather in Germany, as well as some of the things -- I don't think we were directly impacted or specifically impacted by the beer issue in France you just mentioned, although we -- there was somewhat of an impact. But it's even softer and [indiscernible] relatively flat, if not down slightly, in France as well. So I think it's Germany and France. And as we said, looking forward, if we're able to get some of this weather normalized and they're not underwater in Central Europe and wearing parkas in May, like they were in Germany, we feel okay about where we stand today.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Philip Ng with Jefferies.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Heading into the year, demand-supply was pretty tight in Europe on the bev can side, and things are still pretty tight, I would imagine, and you had some aspirations of getting some incremental pricing in 2014. In light of the recent pullback on demand and one of your competitors adding capacity in the U.K. region, is that a -- is there some concern on the pricing front on 2014? Or should we see some upward trajectory from here?","John A. Hayes","Well, as I said earlier about our cost-out and value-in initiatives, we are not planning on it. It is always challenging. It's too early to say what we're going to be able to achieve, but we are -- we have not been adding any capacity ourselves. And we are focusing on trying to recover some of those costs that we've mentioned before, but it's too early to predict victory.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Got you. And then can you give us a little preview on CapEx guidance for 2014? And should we expect free cash flow getting back to that $500 million range for next year?","Scott C. Morrison","Well, this is Scott. As always, on CapEx, it's dependent on what kind of good growth opportunities we see around the world. But with the world being a bit slower, I would see CapEx trending down meaningfully in 2014.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. Do you have a number for us? Or is it still...","Scott C. Morrison","No, not yet, because it's really early. So we're still expecting to spend -- remember, we've got, this year, we had $100 million of carry-in capital to this year, so it's unusually high. And I don't think we'll have that much carry-in capital into next year because most of the capital that we're spending will be concluded by this year. And so I'd see it dropping by a fairly sizable number next year.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Got you. And then, John, I think, in the past you have mentioned that when the macro environment does slow down, that's been a pretty good time for you to get more active on the M&A front. Have you seen now that pipeline improve a bit here?","John A. Hayes","Yes, well, we -- as always, we have a variety of conversations going on. And as you know, it's been a cornerstone of how we've created value over the long term. And that hasn't changed at all. I don't think we have anything to report at this time, however, but you just never know. You always -- my predecessor always said you need motive and opportunity. And I think we have the motive, we're just making sure the opportunity is right.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions for you. First, I missed a few sets of numbers, I think, in here, but did you give us what your volumes were like in Europe and in Brazil specifically...","Scott C. Morrison","In Europe, they were down less than 1% in the quarter. And in Brazil, they were up double digits high. It was very strong. Remember, we had capacity that came online this year with our new plant. And we'll have another new -- or a new line coming on in the fourth quarter of this year.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. As we look at your performance here in North America in beverage cans and we look to your performance in Europe in beverage cans, you've been a bit below the market in Europe and a good chunk below the market here in North America. While I do recognize there's been some customer shift back and forth, but maybe more specifically, over the last couple of years, you've seemingly had to take a disproportionate amount of the capacity out in North America or maybe not grow as fast as some of the other folks in Europe. Is there anything that's changed in the competitive landscape that maybe has put you at a bit of a disadvantage, whether it's how you're going to market with pricing or whether it's what-have-you that may account for that? And how might that, or can that, change going forward, I mean? Or is it just simply a position of doing what your customers or your set mix is?","John A. Hayes","Well, let me try and tackle that. It -- because I think there are 2 answers for each -- there's a different answer for each of the regions. In North America, we've been trying to take a very disciplined approach as the market leader. And we've been putting our money where our mouth is in terms of capacity. I do think that, if you separate this onetime item that we lost last year, on an apples-to-apples basis, we're right there with everything else. And in fact, we're probably even a little bit ahead because of the specialty growth. So I wouldn't read into that too much. And I think it really was a onetime item. And when you look into Europe, I would -- I certainly wouldn't agree with, over the last couple of years, anything has been happening, that has disadvantaged us. It's really been over the last 6 months, and it has to do with weather and geographic footprint. And everyone knows that Western and Northwest Europe in particular have been much more heavily hit than Southern Europe and Eastern Europe. And so when you look country by country and category by category, where we were off slightly relative to the market, had to do with the geographic proximity.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. Last question I had is, you spoke about getting back to in the corridor of your traditional earnings growth rates in 2014. With some of these factors, weather now seemingly getting better, along with your comments earlier about better 12-ounce and some of these other factors seeming to improve here in the back half of the year, is it feasible that you could get back to 10% to 15% earnings growth per quarter the back half of this year?","John A. Hayes","I think it's too early to say. Certainly, what we've told in guidance was we said the full year '13 will be higher than the full year '14. And if you look, we're down in the first half of '13 versus first half of '12. So by definition, we have to be up in the second half of '13. I think it -- we feel good about the efforts that we can control. It really is a volume game. And we feel okay right now, but you know how volatile the weather has been here in North America and in Europe. And so I know that probably doesn't directly answer your question, but that's where we are.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc.","Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","John, one of your competitors this morning talked about a mix shift toward can that tends to occur whenever economies weakened, as they have recently. Have you seen any evidence of such a shift recently? Or would you expect one in the developed markets?","John A. Hayes","Well, I think, on the beer side, it hasn't -- over the last 5 years, I think beer cans, as a share of the package mix in the beer category, has gone from, call it, 47% to 53%. So we've actually seen some relative health on cans. I do think you're seeing a resurgence on cans, particularly on the beer side. Think about all of the activity that's been going on on the craft side of the market, and you're even starting to see them in the on-premise. And so I think that is constructive. I do think it has more to do with where the customers are pointing to and a little bit less to do with the overall economies because what I would tell you is it has to do, in part, with what the pricing strategy of the beer makers is as well. And over the last few years, on the value side of beer, they've been pushing price up more than they have on the premium side.","Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","No, that's helpful. And just one on the mix, the mix in Brazil. Have you seen any recent trends there in terms of a continued mix shift toward cans and away from returnable bottles?","John A. Hayes","A little bit, yes. It's -- there's not that many one-way bottles down in Brazil. It's largely returnable. And we, again the share is a package mix, over the last couple of months, I don't think we've seen wholesale change. But certainly, over the last 5 years, that's one of the big drivers of the beverage can in Brazil, and now it's up in the upper 30s. And hopefully, as we go into 2014, with the World Cup and the other things, hopefully it will start with a 4, but it's premature to declare that. But we have been seeing good growth in the beverage can relative to overall industry beer growth.","Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And one last one. Any notable change in the competitive dynamics in China as of late? I know you talked about the supply-demand imbalance getting a bit better in the second quarter.","John A. Hayes","Yes, no, nothing to update. The market continues to grow strongly. I think, the balance, some of this excess capacity is being soaked in. I do think that we haven't seen any -- certainly any more downside relative to prices, but we haven't yet seen any upside relative to pricing either.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Al Kalibi (sic) [Kabili] with Macquarie.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","I guess, John, a question on the European cost saves. And I know most of this is really in '14. But incrementally, what's the opportunity to ramp that up a little bit more in the -- I mean, the back half of '13?","John A. Hayes","Well, the biggest issue, I think, it has to do is things happen more slowly in Europe because of the works councils and because of the union and how you deal with the various people component of it and where to do it the right way. And that just takes time. So that's probably the biggest reason is that [ph], and combined with some of the other cost initiatives. As Scott had mentioned, in the plants, we're doing a very good job, and it's been offsetting some of the softness in Northwest Europe from a volume perspective. But I think that's the main reason. The reason why I just said on the labor side is why we don't expect to see a tremendous amount of upside in the second half of '13.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","And then secondly, you mentioned on the aerospace side the sequestration and the impact on new awards. Are you seeing any impact on the pace of your backlog burn at this point? And what do you see the risk to the current backlog that you have?","John A. Hayes","I think our current backlog is pretty solid right now. And in fact, we were just speaking about that the other day. I think the biggest issue is just with the government. There's 2 things going on: Number one, the overall budgets are declining. And I won't go into the details here, but if you're a program of record, you're relatively solid. And most, if not all, of our backlog is programs of record, which is good. I think, in terms of new awards, in terms of new initiatives, those are the things that are a bit slower. And it's slower because, number one, the government has less money, so they need to figure out efficiencies to find money to fund those. But then, number two, because of the short-term nature of sequestration and the furloughing of employees, people who had been working 40, 50, 60 hours a week to try and process some of this stuff are now working 25 to 35 hours a week and so there's just not as -- it just takes longer to get things through the system.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then along those lines, you mentioned the small international award that you recently booked. And it's pretty small, but I guess it's notable because that's something you've talked about looking to do, is expand internationally on the aerospace side. And just what's the outlook there?","John A. Hayes","Well, we actually are bidding on more international opportunities than we ever have in the history of Ball aerospace right now. They have to come to fruition, but it's really based upon some of the nonclassified technologies that we have developed in that business and the global need for some of those things, first. So for example, this environmental satellite we're building for the South Koreans was based on some things we've done for the U.S. government over here. And as we look in other places of the world, we think there's opportunities for things like that in terms of environmental monitoring and other technologies.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then final question is just the Vietnam JV that I know is small, but I wanted to just get an update there and if you see that as a springboard to further expand into Southeast Asia.","John A. Hayes","Yes, well, it's been up and running a little over a year now, and it's making good progress. We were there a couple of weeks ago. And I think it's an excellent facility. And if any of you are ever in Southeast Asia, we'd be happy to give you a tour of it. I do think that it's not just a Vietnamese joint venture, but it's more as part of a regional strategy. We have an interest in one of our partners in Thailand as well. And so that whole region, when you look at a map, it's not just one country versus another country, it's a regional perspective. And so yes, there could be opportunities going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","In the food can business, you referenced high-single-digit growth. And I'm wondering if there are specific categories in which you're doing well, if you had kind of a preliminary view on the pack season. And then you -- there's a competitor that's discussed maybe some food can business being shifted from 3Q to 4Q because of a potentially later pack or delayed pack, and I'm just wondering if you had any view on that in the back half of the year.","Scott C. Morrison","Yes, the -- our numbers were up high to mid single digits in the quarter. And we feel pretty good about where the pack is at now. And we're getting more normalized weather. The Southeast in the last couple of years has been just horrendous, and this year, it's been more stabilized. But I would agree with the comment in terms of pushing more into the fourth quarter from the third quarter: We expect third quarter to be solid, but there's probably more that will benefit us in the fourth quarter of this year.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just shifting gears to the aerospace side. You discussed some of the headwinds with sequestration. And I guess earnings in the segment were kind of flattish sequentially with the first quarter. I'm wondering, as we look forward to 3Q, 4Q, is that kind of $19 million type run rate a decent estimate for 3Q, 4Q? Or could we see a little bit more of a pickup? Or is it kind of too soon to tell?","John A. Hayes","I think, to answer to your question, it's probably a decent run rate. We had talked on prior calls that, in 2012, we had a number of close-outs on some programs that we had executed very well on. And that provided some upside in 2012. With the startup of many of these new programs in 2013, these are 3-, 4-, 5-year contracts, and so as -- the way we do it, as we reduce the risk, if you will, the execution risk in those, the accruals change. And so you usually make more profits in the back end of programs if you're doing well, as opposed to the front end. And so the fundamentals of the business in '13 are quite good. But really, where you're going to see that profitability, assuming we're actually executing, it really starts to ramp up in '14 and '15 relative to the current run rate.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. [Operator Instructions]","We'll go to the next question. [Operator Instructions] We do have a follow-up question from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","2 strategy questions or bigger picture questions. First, in aerosol, the company's technology bed, if you will, is on impact-extruded aluminum. And thus far, that's been a good place to be given your performance, from what we could see in Aerocan. Are there other technologies that are viable in the aluminum aerosol can market that you need to be mindful of that maybe could start to pick up share? Would you have the ability to adopt other technologies to make aluminum aerosol cans in quick order if you needed to?","John A. Hayes","The short answer to that, George, is we have a variety of technologies we've been working on, on the aluminum aerosol side, even the steel aerosol side, that we feel very confident that they have some interesting developments. It's premature to talk about those, but as we move forward, I think you're going to see some things where it's leveraging our D&I capabilities in the aerosol sector. And it -- we're excited about the promise of that. As you know, we're already doing that in terms of the Alumi-Tek bottle with MillerCoors. And we have some other interesting things. And then even on the impact-extruded side is we've talked about having our ReAl slugs, which is a much lighter-weight slug, by utilizing some of our technology that we've morphed from our beverage can business. So we've got a variety of things that we have been actively looking at. Some are commercialized right now, and others could be commercialized in the future.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Would it be fair to say that doing a D&I aluminum aerosol can is probably a couple of years away? Next month? I mean, how would you ballpark it for us if you could? If you could.","John A. Hayes","Well, it's -- D&I aerosol is challenging just because the pressure is held in aerosol and you need to make sure that the, well, wall thickness will withstand that. But that's one of the areas we're working on, but it is premature to say when it might be out.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Understood. The other question I had is around return and EVA. And obviously, Ball Corp., going back to the 1990s, has been really a pioneer on EVA. It's worked very, very well for you. And I was looking on my model, and historically, the big jumps-up for you have come with things like a Reynolds, like Schmalbach. It's not been the only thing, but it's been where you've gotten the outsized pickups in economic profit. As we sit here and think about the next 2 to 3 years for Ball Corp., should we expect that more of your economic profit improvement, which I would imagine you think you will improve from these levels, will come from what you do with the balance sheet in terms of capital allocation, buying back stock, versus other source of capital? Or do you think that the investments that you've made and could make would be the bigger driver of economic profit, say, between end of '13 and, say, of '15 or '16 in terms of time frame?","Scott C. Morrison","Well, first, I mean, EVA is still the big driver of how we decide in what to invest and how to invest. And I think it's a combination of the things that you talked about. It's going to be the capital allocation that we've done in the past; the returning -- absent other opportunities, returning a lot of cash to shareholders. We feel real good about the EVA returns of the investments that we've been making. Even in -- and if you'd look at the North American beverage business that shrunk this year, their EVA returns are getting better. And so the returns that we're getting on those incremental investments have been very attractive. So I think it's a combination of continued focus on EVA and making sure that we're getting the returns. As John mentioned, acquisitions have always been part of our strategy, and that's -- that continues to be. And that's allocating capital in a balanced way and in a disciplined way that we've done in the past and we'll continue to do in the future.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So you think your investment will be able to at least keep up with the buyback component of EVA. Would that be fair if we look out the next 3 years?","John A. Hayes","Its opportunity depends -- this is the way I'd look -- I'd think about it: There's kind of 3 different buckets of EVA. It's, number one, what you have right now. And what we're trying to do is improve the profitability and minimize the investment there. And that generates excess EVA dollars. Number two in this -- the number two and number three both get to capital deployment, but number two is what Scott said, it's more the expanding into new geographies, expanding into new products, it's the specialty container that we've talked about that generate returns in excess of that capital. So you're putting more capital to work. And then the last but not least are kind of the big hitters, as you described, that aren't lost on us which are putting an even greater amount of capital to work through acquisition. And the only thing you really need to be focusing there on is making damn sure that the capital you're putting to work there can generate that excess return. So we think about it in those 3 buckets. So, what are we doing right now in terms of improving our business? What are we using our cash flow for, and is it returning it and reducing the investment to our shareholders? Or is it investing in new internal growth opportunities, or is it on the M&A side?","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly on this, guys, and I promise I will give it up here. Scott, you said your EVA returns, if I heard you correctly, in North America are up this year. Did I hear that correctly? And does that include even the cost or the cash flow outlay for integration?","Scott C. Morrison","The cash flow outlay for -- you're talking about restructuring costs?","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Well, I mean, the -- yes, exactly.","Scott C. Morrison","Restructuring costs get capitalized, so you still have to pay for those over time.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Exactly. So what's -- even including that in your EVA calculation, you were up in terms of EVA returns in North American beverage.","Scott C. Morrison","Yes, that's correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, just a few cleanups. First of all, the aluminum storage situation has been in the news a lot the last week. Anything new there from your perspective?","John A. Hayes","As people know, there was a big article in the New York Times on Sunday about the issues on metal premiums and LME, and it's been widely discussed. And we do know that there were some governmental hearings on Tuesday. I probably shouldn't comment on them because I wasn't purposefully there. But there has been issues there, and I do think it's getting more focus to make sure that there's a level playing field around how metal is purchased on a global -- aluminum is purchase on a global basis. So that's probably all I should say. Scott, anything...","Scott C. Morrison","No. As I said, they -- we're -- we've been involved in those conversations because we think that there are -- better transparency around how the warehouses work will be beneficial to the industry and to -- ultimately, to consumers.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Second question, that 8% volume gain in food and household in the second quarter, any sense of what you would expect there for the full year?","Scott C. Morrison","We said, for the full year, we'll be up slightly, but it's not going to be at that kind of a pace.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then finally, any thoughts on specialty can margins in North America and Europe and where you see those moving over time?","John A. Hayes","Well, I think we talked about this on the call last time. We haven't seen any changes up or down relative to them. As the specialty canned -- can's market size gets bigger, it's logical to think, from an economic perspective, it may put some downward pressure on volumes. But from an overall profit pool perspective, I think it will continue to grow.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then final, you guys didn't make this, but there's a \"bow tie can\" that was out there. Do you have any sense of, like, what that actually did for volume for the brewer involved? As just one example of...","John A. Hayes","We'd be speculating if we said anything.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","You mentioned several times on the call that the volumes thus far in July are tracking better and improved weather is really the key reason. So in places like North America and Europe where the improvement in the weather seems most obvious, can you just actually tell us how your volumes are tracking on the beverage side thus far in July?","John A. Hayes","Well, I think, nothing else to add. You just summarized it. I think, particularly in North America and Europe, they are more normalized or becoming more normalized, which means we weren't seeing those huge -- the month of June was very soft from a North American perspective. I don't have the numbers in front of me from an industry perspective, but they were in excess, I believe, of the 5.5-or-so percent decline for the quarter. And so what we've seen is more moderation of that. I would not say it's anything to go home and get overly excited about, however. All we're saying is they've returned to more historical normalcy.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it, John. And then I know you're running pretty full, but where do you see utilization rates for the market in China as a whole? And where do you think they need to go to before pricing power begins to shift back to the suppliers?","John A. Hayes","Well, they're somewhere in the 80s right now. And it depends by in the -- upon region, and it depends on what you assume that -- the actual output versus the rated output of some of these new competitors in there. I do think, you look at any in the -- any in -- region in our industry, and the minute you can start to get to the upper 80s or lower 90s, that's when you start to see tightness in the market, because there is -- as you all know, there is a seasonality effect.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Right. That's make sense. And just sort of a last quick one from me: In North America where it's-- the standard 12-ounce can is going down pretty significantly for you in '13, and specialty continue to go, where do you see the mix between the 12-ounce specialty can as you end 2013?","John A. Hayes","Probably in the low 20s, specialty as a percent of total mix.","Operator","And we do have a follow-up question from the line of Philip Gresh with JPMorgan.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just one very quick follow-up just around this normalization of volumes. If I look at Europe in the third quarter of last year, if I have this correct, Scott, you guys were up almost 10% in European beverage, so I just want to kind of clarify what kind of normalization would mean for you guys in Europe against that type of a comp.","Scott C. Morrison","Well, I think what we're talking about normalized volumes is that low- to mid-single-digit growth rates. Kind of that 2% to 5% growth rate would be normalized.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, so you would -- you would see the ability to do that in the third quarter despite the comps.","John A. Hayes","Yes.","Scott C. Morrison","Yes. We should be more -- it, again, all depends on weather. But we should be more in line with the market if weather is normalized.","John A. Hayes","And then at -- I don't have last year's numbers in front of us. The 10% seems high.","Scott C. Morrison","It seems high.","John A. Hayes","I thought it was low to mid single digits the third quarter last year. But perhaps you can give Ann Scott a call and clarify that.","Scott C. Morrison","In Q2 of last year, we were up just a couple percent, so I -- you might have a bad number there.","Operator","And there seems to be no further questions at this time, sir.","John A. Hayes","Okay, great. Well, thanks, Ciglund. And thank you, everyone.","I just want to remind everyone that Ball we will be hosting at Investor Day and Management Briefing in Midtown Manhattan on October 2 and 3. Analysts and institutional investors should contact Ann Scott for an invitation.","We thank you for participating on today's call. And we're looking forward to seeing you all in early October and then on the call at the end of October. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line."],"2574":["Ball (NYSE:BLL) Q1 2012 Earnings Call April 26, 2012 11:00 AM ET","Executives","John A.

Welcome to the Ball Corporation First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, April 26, 2012. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, President and Chief Executive Officer. You may begin, sir.","John A. Hayes","Thank you, France, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's first quarter 2012 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings, as well as company news releases. If you don't already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website. Now joining me on the call today are Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Ray Seabrook, Executive Vice President and COO Global Packaging. ","In a moment, Scott will discuss our financial results for the quarter. Ray will follow with details about our Packaging operating performance, and I will close with comments on Aerospace and the outlook for the remainder of 2012. Ball reported improved comparable first quarter 2012 results during the seasonally slow first quarter. Recall that we have mentioned in January that our first half of the year will be relatively flat as compared to 2011, and we performed slightly better than we expected. Maximizing the value and performance of our existing businesses is one of the strategic levers of our Drive for 10 strategy, and our people and our business are executing well in this environment. ","The other levers of Drive for 10 include broadening our geographic reach, expanding in the new products and capabilities, aligning ourselves with the right customers and markets, and leveraging our technology expertise to create a competitive advantage. We're making good progress in all of these. And several highlights include: completing the construction of our previously announced capital projects in Qingdao, China; Alagoinhas, Brazil; and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, further broadening our geographic reach; increasing the production and sales of our specialty can product portfolio in North America, which grew approximately 20% due to expanding volume in the 7.5 ounce, 16 ounce in Alumi-Tek product categories; leveraging our technological expertise by announcing our ReAl can technology and innovation and sustainability breakthrough in our extruded aluminum impacting business. ReAl enables significant light weighting of aluminum aerosol container, while utilizing aluminum from our beverage can plants in the manufacturing process to add up to 25% recycled content into aluminum aerosol containers. ","And finally, we've been working hard on our third sustainability report, which will be out at the end of May. Sustainability is an important part of our Drive for 10 and plays a key role in both maximizing the value our existing businesses and leveraging our technology. Our new report will provide detail on our progress since 2010 as well as our future goals and objectives. You'll hear more examples of our Drive for 10 progress from Scott and Ray. There's a lot going on here at Ball. And while it's still early in the year, 2012 is off to a nice start. ","I'll turn it over to Scott, and we'll talk about the quarter. And then the Ray will provide color on our operations. And I'll return with comments on our Aerospace business and the outlook for 2012. Scott?","Scott C. Morrison","Thanks, John. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2012 were $0.63 versus last year's $0.58, an increase of nearly 9%. ","For the first quarter, the following factors contributed to these results: higher European and specialty can volumes; solid program performance in our Aerospace business; a lower share count; and a lower tax rate. ","For a complete summary of the first quarter results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, please refer to the notes section of today's earnings release. The key financial metrics for 2012 that I gave you in January are all the same other than the tax rate. Taking into account certain tax benefits achieved in the first quarter and those expected later in the year, the full year effective tax rate will now be approximately 30% for the full year 2012. Other than that one change, everything else looks the same. ","Interest expense will remain at approximately $175 million. Full year 2012 CapEx is still expected to be in the range of $400 million. And as always, the timing of future projects will impact actual spending, so we'll keep you updated as the year progresses. And we still expect 2012 free cash flow in the range of $450 million. ","The company's annual funding of our U.S. pension plan was largely completed in the first quarter. And at current exchange rates, year-end net debt is expected to be approximately $3 billion, roughly flat versus 2011 as we will continue to return our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends versus debt paydown. ","With that, I'll turn it over to Ray to talk more about the Packaging operations.","Raymond J. Seabrook","Thanks, Scott. Comparable operating earnings through the first quarter in the Metal Beverage Americas and Asia segment were below last year's level. For the most part, the first quarter earnings shortfall was in Brazil. ","First quarter sales volumes in Brazil were lower by mid-single digits compared to a year ago, primarily due to a change in the customer filling location and the temporary loss of another location due to higher freight cost until our new capacity came on stream. The new can plant, Alagoinhas, has successfully started making cans in late March and is now supplying our customers in the Northeast, which will catch up our volumes in the second quarter. ","With this new capacity coming on stream, we anticipate full year Brazil volumes to be up 15% or more from 2011 levels. ","In Asia, our new joint venture can plant in Vietnam also started up in March, and we are now selling cans to our customers in that marketplace. The newly constructed plant in Qingdao, China is still in checkout phase and is scheduled to making and selling cans to our customers next month. ","All in all, it's been a very busy first quarter finishing up these major capital projects. Sales volumes in China were also off to a slow start due to a very cold winter in the north and an earlier-than-normal beginning to the Chinese New Year. First quarter Asia results were a little behind last year's level, but we still expect low double-digit volume growth in Asia for the full year. ","First quarter sales volumes in North America were up slightly compared to a year ago. And we started to see a more favorable sales mix as we got to the end of the quarter that has carried into the second quarter. ","Higher archive and freight cost occurred in the first quarter as we move to improve plant utilization rates. Comparable European operating results were slightly better than a year ago despite currency headwinds and continued price cost compression in beverage cans. ","Beverage can volumes were up mid-single digits and aerosol volumes were up low-double digits in the quarter. Ball Aerocan continues to make year-over-year earnings improvements. ","First quarter earnings in the U.S. Metal Food and Household Products segment were ahead of plan, but below last year's first quarter due to inventory gains made in 2011 that were not realized this year. Food can volumes in the quarter were slightly below last year's level, but our total year forecast is for improved volumes due to relatively easy comps from a year ago. ","As we said in our January conference call, the quarterly earning pattern in this business in 2012 will return to a more typical seasonal pattern, which was reversed in 2011. A more typical quarterly earnings pattern would be for 40% of segment earnings we made in the first half of the year and 60% in the second half. As we look to a full year earnings for this business, we continue to see another strong year. ","With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.","John A. Hayes","Great. Thanks, Ray. Aerospace and Technologies posted near double-digit EBIT margin for the quarter. Backlog ended the quarter at $855 million, which is holding in nicely as we await for it on key bids outstanding. Previously awarded fixed-price programs continue to ramp up, and we anticipate another good year in Aerospace despite the uncertainty around funding in this election year. ","Now during the quarter, Ball's Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite instrument onboard the NPP satellite began collecting data that will provide information about the global distribution of ozone. And in early April, NASA extended the Kepler mission to 2016. Kepler was designed to search for planets around other stars and has identified so far more than 60 confirmed planets and hundreds of other planet candidates. Ball Aerospace is the mission prime contractor for Kepler. ","Finally, we also announced the addition of Rob Strain as Chief Operating Officer of Ball Aerospace. Rob comes to us from NASA, where he was the Director of the Goddard Space Flight Center and has a wealth of experience in the civil, defense and commercial aerospace markets. And we're delighted to have him on board as he works closely with Dave Taylor and the rest of our Aerospace team in the pursuit of Our Drive for 10 strategies. ","So in summary, and as we said in January, we expect our first half of the year to be largely flat as compared to 2011. And with an improved first quarter behind us, we are slightly ahead of where we thought we would be at this point. We continue to see noticeable upside in the back half of the year as new emerging market plants complete their start-up curves and begin selling product and our North America and European beverage businesses move into the busy summer selling season. ","As Scott mentioned, Ball will continue to generate significant free cash flow, and we remain focused on a disciplined capital deployment strategy to return value to our shareholders and grow our company. ","Drive for 10 is a mindset around perfection in everything we do, and it will play a key role in achieving our goals and more than doubling the EVA dollars generated over the next 10 years, as well as generating a compound average growth rate of 10% to 15% earnings per share over that time and more specifically in 2012. ","So with that, France, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question, from the line of George Staphos, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Ray, I was hoping you could go through the volume percentages or guidance for the first quarter, specifically with the Americas segment for beverage. I couldn't keep up with some of your discussion.","Raymond J. Seabrook","Yes, okay. Sure, George. Brazil, we were down about 6% and the market was up maybe 4.5% to 5%. And I think I explained in our comments that, that's just mainly timing for us. In North America, we were up at pretty much like the market through the quarter. And in China, we were pretty flat, slightly down but pretty flat.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. I mean you mentioned the reasons there. I mean given the growth economically still being higher-single digits, were you disappointed even with the weather, even with the late recovery out of the New Year with that volume growth in China?","Raymond J. Seabrook","Well, I think it surprised us quite frankly. And it wasn't just us. I think it was -- if you were to talk to our competitors in China, they would probably give you the same story. I think the early Chinese New Year probably meant that our sales in the fourth quarter last year were a little stronger than they otherwise might have been because people were taking cans in the fourth quarter. It was terribly cold in the North this year. That's one of the reasons at Qingdao. It should be up and running right by now and it's not. That's one of the reasons. It was hard for us to get some of that concrete forward because it was so cold. But all in all, I talked to our guys just -- I've been talking to our guys constantly. The volume is starting to pick up. As we sit now, the weather's gotten a lot of better. So we are still predicting low double-digit volume increases in China, and we think most of that was just timing.","John A. Hayes","George, also, this is John, let's not forget that in 2011, we were sold out, so we did not have any additional capacity. And so we're anticipating the ramp up of Qingdao to provide us that flexed capacities going forward. So now that we have it, our salespeople have had discussions with our customers, which is not unimportant as we think about going to the second half of 2012.","Raymond J. Seabrook","Actually, that's a good point, John. We actually, in our plan this year, we felt we'd actually have to buy cans for China. And as we know, because of the little slower start, I'm not sure we're going to have to do that. And, of course, if we buy cans, we don't make any money. So I think really we're looking at that as just primarily timing.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And related question, not trying to overdo it. Given that there was some one-off factor that created these slower start both in Brazil and China, would this be a reason that perhaps you take a more wait-and-see approach on the next slug of capacity to see how the market digested or not really? You're still, more or less, all guns blazing relative to [indiscernible] we have in place?","Raymond J. Seabrook","Well, remember, George, we just -- we really don't -- we don't build the plant and hope somebody shows up. That's not how we do things.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Understood.","Raymond J. Seabrook","So we really don't do anything unless we have customer contracts in hand. So if we have customer contract in hand that has the right parts to them that says that we're not taking all the risk, then in fact, we put capacity in. So that's the way we operate, and we'll continue to do that. So we're really not building anything we don't have contracts for. So that's how we're going to continue in the future. We have slowed down a little bit because the market slowed down a little bit, but we -- that's always the way we do things.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Fair point. Last question then I'll turn it over. One, have you seen any kind of pickup in promotional activity or interest in North America on the beverage side? Two, what are your plans with the lines that have been idle in Columbus? And three, are you seeing any more competition in the aluminum bottle market vis-\u00e0-vis you're Alumi-Tek technology?","Raymond J. Seabrook","Let's see. The first question is we are seeing some promotional activity. We have some lines idled in Columbus. We just had some discussions yesterday. We may have to turn some of those lines on. We are to the walls in every single one of our plants in the U.S., absolutely to the walls, except we bottled [ph] those 2 lines in Columbus. And I'm not sure we're not going to have to lease term one of them on before we get to the end of the year, especially if the market picks up a little bit for sure. We're not seeing any competition for Alumi-Tek. As a matter of fact, in our R&D shop, we continue to look at various things. And I'm pretty excited with some of the R&D things that we're developing that relate to that, not exactly Alumi-Tek but Alumi-Tek type technology. So we're really doing some really good things over there that I think is going to pay dividends for us in the future.","Operator","Our next question, from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you might have mentioned on the last call that you could possibly see Metal Beverage America, Asia operating profit up 15% year-over-year. But 1Q operating profit, it looks like it was down. Do you still think you can get that kind of result? And what has to happen from here on out to potentially get there?","Raymond J. Seabrook","Well, yes. We definitely foresee that segment operating profit up. I just don't have the number in front of me, but it's 15%, but we see it significantly up. The first quarter was pretty much as we thought. Remember, Brazil last year -- if we think about Brazil's comps, last year, Brazil, our volume increased 18% in the first quarter. It was down 18% in the second, and so we're flat halfway during the year. And I think we were up double digits by the time we got to the end of the year. This year, our volume was up. I mean it was off 6%. The market was up, but we expect with our new capacity coming in Brazil that volumes will be up at least 15% year-over-year. So we're expecting volumes up in China. We're expecting them up in Brazil. And so far, the U.S. has started up fairly strong. So we expect that segment profit up certainly more than 10%, somewhere between 10% and 15%, I would tell you.","John A. Hayes","To reiterate what Ray said. We -- nothing really -- the first quarter came in as we thought, and we see nothing as we go forward that's a deviation from what we thought in January.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And do you get a little bit of a mix shift there in that it looks like Brazil volumes or top line growth you might have taken that up a little bit, and China is maybe a little bit lower? Do you get a positive mix shift with better volumes out of Brazil and maybe a little bit weaker in China?","John A. Hayes","Nothing appreciable. I think as we look at the various areas within that segment: Asia, Brazil and North America; you always get little bit shifts here and there, but I wouldn't -- from a profitability point of view, it's nothing appreciable.","Operator","Our next question, from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Ray, on the promotional activity commentary, can you differentiate between beer and CSD in North America? Is it sort of equally spread between the 2 or is one stronger than the other?","Raymond J. Seabrook","I think what we're seeing a little stronger. We're hearing it a little stronger in the CSD side.","John A. Hayes","Yes. And we said that on the beer side, the overall beer market in the first quarter was actually up slightly. And that's after a couple of straight being down in the low-single digits. And what -- our beer customers are making a lot of renewed noise and push around the marketing innovation, which not only is helpful to growing the category, but it's helpful for us because it's key to our strategy.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then switching to Brazil. Obviously, the market slowed. I don't know how it shaped up inter-quarter, but did you have any sort of down time to realign inventories with what you started to see in terms of deterioration there?","Raymond J. Seabrook","Yes, absolutely. We took downtime in our plants. We didn't build inventory.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Can you sort of quantify that for us?","Raymond J. Seabrook","As I say, a 6% reduction in the quarter is like a 50 million cans. And we took downtime to cover that off.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, all right. And then just real quick on the extruded aluminum pack in Europe, what's behind the double-digit increase there?","John A. Hayes","Continued customer demand. Despite some of the economic ills in Europe, we're continuing to see strong demand. And we're, I think, we're aligned with the right customers.","Operator","Our next question, from the line of Philip Ng from Jefferies & Company.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just piggybacking off of Ghansham's question. Margins actually held up pretty well in Europe. Certainly volumes were strong. But price was supposed to be down a little bit. Is the margin strength driven by the Aerosol side?","Raymond J. Seabrook","We did get -- we have had price cost compression in Europe, there's no question about it, mainly in beverage only.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So it sounds like the lift came from the aluminum Aerosol business, right?","Raymond J. Seabrook","Yes. That and also the volume increase.","John A. Hayes","And our guys have been doing a good job over in Europe controlling the cost relative to the price compression.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then when you're looking at acquisitions going forward, are you looking to stay in your core products that you're in already? Are there opportunities for you to expand in something different, like a few years ago, you guys branched out into aluminum slugs in the Aerosol business?","John A. Hayes","That acquisition was a very much adjacent to what we were doing. And when you think about selling aluminum containers and the slugs were a key component of it, I would not expect us to go far afield certainly. We have more opportunities in what we do today than we've seen in a while. And so we're going to stick to our knitting, generally speaking. Technology is an important part of what we do. I think the slug business is a good example of that in our announcement of the first quarter about taking our scrap from our beverage can plants and putting it into the slugs was exactly what we had anticipated as we acquired that. And so things like that, I don't think, are too far afield. But as we sit here today, as I mentioned, we have a lot of opportunities within what we know very well.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And just a last question for Scott. It's early in the year. Your free cash flow was a little bit light, and I think you guys guide towards working cap being flat potentially. What's driving the uptick in that working cap?","Scott C. Morrison","When we think of working cap -- actually, we made significant improvements in the working cap last year. We've got a number of programs in place this year that we think we can actually improve upon where we ended up last year. It's early in the year, but we think we can have a bit of a source of funds from working capital this year as well.","Operator","Our next question, from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just on the guidance for Americas, Asia beverage of up 10% to 15% this year, I just want to kind of peel back a little bit and understand how much of that you think would come from North America versus emerging markets? I'm trying to basically take into account the North America. You have the switch over to specialty. You have the Torrance closure that still have some savings. So is it kind of 50-50 emerging markets versus developed? Or how do you think about that?","Raymond J. Seabrook","I don't have that in front of me, but I think that's reasonable. But I don't think we'd get much. Torrance closed in the fourth quarter of '10, I think. Was it fourth quarter? Yes. So we've taken -- a lot of that has come. We're already in 2012. So a lot of that's come. Some of that Torrance equipment is sitting in Vietnam and other places, so we got some nice benefits from doing that, but I would say it's in the neighborhood of 50-50.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just in the current quarter, the 10 million decline, was that -- was basically all of that in Brazil [indiscernible].","John A. Hayes","Not all of it is Brazil. But by far, the majority of it is Brazil.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just the guidance commentary on the first half being flattish, does that still hold at this stage? Or would you say you're thinking because you've implied 2Q will be down, but it doesn't seem like that should be the case.","John A. Hayes","Yes, no. I think what I said in my prepared remarks is given that we're slightly above in the first quarter, we expect it -- another way of saying it, we'd expect the second quarter to be roughly flat. Because as we said here in January, January, we said the first half would be flat. We are a little bit above after the first quarter, so you would expect that to carry through. But I wouldn't read into it too much for the second quarter.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it, okay. And just one other question, how big is your Specialty Can business. You said it's 20% in North America. How big is it overall and in North America?","Raymond J. Seabrook","Well, in North America, it's about 17% or so. And that -- in Brazil it's probably a little bit higher. In Europe, it's probably about the same. And in Asia, it's a little bit lower. But I think the trends in the emerging markets, we're seeing a shift from 12 ounce or 33 centiliter to more specialty cans accelerating as time goes on.","Operator","Our next question, from the line of Alton Stump with Longbow Research.","Philip Terpolilli - Longbow Research LLC","This is actually Phil Terpolilli calling in for Alton. I just wanted to focus a bit on your outlook in Europe. You mentioned in the press release the pickup in promotional activity there ahead of the summer special events. Any sense of how things are playing out maybe versus your initial expectations? And two, is it safe to say you expect a sequential volume acceleration versus what we saw this quarter?","John A. Hayes","Yes. We did get off to a strong start in Europe. Let's take a step back and think about all the drivers as we go forward. We've got the European Cup Championships that are in the 2nd half of June. We've got the Olympics that are in London in July. Recall that last summer from a weather perspective in Europe was dismal. And in fact, the third quarter last year, we had said that we had taken some downtime in August, which was unprecedented for us in our European beverage can plants. And so we don't expect that to happen. The can is continuing to take share. On the CSD market across Europe, generally speaking, it's been relatively flat from a total CSD perspective. But the cans are up mid-single digits, which means they're taking share. And the beer was off a little bit in totality. But cans, we're up upper single digits in terms of filling. So I think another example a lot of it is taking share. So as we look to the going through the balance of the summer and into the second half of the year, we feel pretty good about the volume trends in Europe.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Alex Ovshey from Goldman Sachs.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","You mentioned some pricing compression that you're seeing in Europe, can you just talk about when you expect to cycle through that pricing compression? And then as you look to the other parts of the world that you participate in, is there any issues with pricing there to note?","Raymond J. Seabrook","Well, when we look to Europe, as John talked about, the volume is increasing, so the capacity demand situation is tightening up. So -- and we had a situation where we had some people passing capacity, and we had a little bit of capacity. We are fundamentally sold out pretty much by the end of this year in Europe. And as that capacity tightens up, we would expect pricing to tighten up in Europe. I think in China, there's a little bit more open capacity than we'd like to see. The market is growing double-digit growth. We don't see that slowing down in the near future, and people have added capacity. So we're probably going to cycle what we got with a little bit more capacity China. We'd like to see some -- pricing is more difficult there. As that market grows, that'll tighten up for us. And in North America, we're pretty stable. It's pretty stable. We get -- so I think pricing is -- North America is pretty, as I said, pretty stable.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And on the volume trend in North America, it seems like it's coming in positive for you. And not just for you, a number of other companies exposed to beverages end market. And it's better than we are expecting. And part of that is we tend to look at some of the end market data as reported by AC Nielsen in the retail channel, which continues to be pretty soft. Can you talk about whether some of that volumes that you guys are seeing in North America if that's driven maybe by some inventory bill that's happening? Or just the benefit of nice weather, which is driving consumption in other channels outside of the retail channel? Do you have any thoughts on that?","John A. Hayes","I really think there's 3 issues ongoing. Number one, the economy in America, while it's not great, it's certainly getting better from a year-over-year perspective. So that's point one. Number two, the weather has been quite favorable in this winter and spring season across the United States. And I think that is helping. And then number three, as we've talked about over the past couple of years, there's been a fair amount of price-taking by our customers at the expense of volume. And as Ray had mentioned earlier, we're seeing and hearing about more increased summer promotional activities. So that bodes well for the can as we move into the summer.","Operator","Our next question, from the line of James Armstrong with Vertical Research Partners.","James Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","The first one is on the Aerospace division. Could you update us on your aerospace expansion project? And have you started looking at doing any geosynchronous or telecommunication projects?","John A. Hayes","Well, we are building out and adding capacity, if you will, to our satellite manufacturing facility, and that's well underway. In fact, it should be commissioned probably at the end of this year. It does provide us capability to do some things in addition to what we've historically done on some of the larger buses, which you're referring to in terms of geosynchronous activity. That's an area that we can certainly explore. But I think as we sit here today, we don't really have anything to comment on other than it does provide us the capability to expand into additional markets that, from a manufacturing perspective, we are unable to pursue prior to doing this.","James Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Okay, that helps. Switching gears a bit. Your tax rate was especially low. Can you give us some context around it? And is there any chance we could expect something similar going forward?","Scott C. Morrison","Sure, this is Scott. But we have reserves for a variety of uncertain tax positions. And when we get to the point in an audit process that are positioned with regard to those issues as determined, we can then release those reserves. So that's what occurred in the first quarter. We see a little bit more of that more happening potentially late this year, that's why I said our tax rate for the full year will probably be around 30%.","James Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Okay, that's helpful. And lastly, as you look out beyond -- looking out beyond 2013 or so, what are the top 2 or 3 markets that you think that you could expand into organically? And by that point, do you think the Brazilian market will be saturated, North and South?","John A. Hayes","Well, we're not going to go into great detail here obviously given the competitive nature of it. But as Ray and we talked about in our prior calls, we think Asia, generally speaking China, in particularly, but Southeast Asia as well, bodes well just because the overall demographics. The retail chain in China is one of the largest in the world right now. It's supposed to double in the top 50 cities of China over the next 10 years. And there's just a lot of built-in improvement from a can share perspective. We've talked about the can as a share of the package mix. And beer for example is only about 6%, yet it's the biggest and fastest-growing beer market in the world. So we continue to see that going well. We've also talked about in Brazil that we have been experiencing strong growth driven by the improved economy and driven by a rise in middle class, driven by the improved overall beverage volumes and can share penetration gains. We're in the upper 30s right now in Brazil. We're also benefiting and we will for the next couple of years because of the infrastructure builds related to the World Cup and the Olympics. But at some point in time, that will moderate out. And so we have been building some capacity in there because we see in the next couple of years some good trends. But that is going to start the level out over time, and that hasn't been lost on us. And then we continue to look at other areas that's probably premature to talk about. But the beverage can, over the past few years, has really taken hold in some of these more emerging markets. And it's actually solidifying in some of the stable markets. I mentioned that the can share penetration growth in Europe, which Ray talked about, the solid performance, at least in the first quarter, which is not a trend necessarily, but we feel pretty constructive about what's happening in North America. So we have solid underpinnings in the mature markets, and we think we have some growth opportunities in some of the places that we already play in.","Operator","Our next question, from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo Securities.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple follow-up questions if I may. Is there a way to somehow quantify maybe the price compression you're seeing in Europe? Maybe a different way of coming at this is I think earlier in the year, you guys have talked about thinking that volumes might be up only flat to up a couple of points. But you've been in better shape mid-single digits here this quarter. And it sounds like now you're more in line that things might be mid-single digits. And then we're seeing that other business, the Aerosol business over there are doing well, too. So how should we think about total profitability there for the year? And is there a way to somehow help us quantify how much price compression we've been seeing?","Raymond J. Seabrook","Well, I think -- Chris, this is Ray. I think what I would do is look at the margins in our European business. You'll probably find rough 100, 150 basis points, so that volume's up, the margin's off, and that's the way to quantify it.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. I'll think about contribution into pieces [ph]. The second question I had was with respect to also staying over there in Europe. If by the end of the year you're in a position again where you're sold out, can you maybe talk a little bit about how you would feel regarding adding additional capacity during '13 or specific markets where you think might be reasonable targets that would best support further capacity?","John A. Hayes","A couple of thoughts on the way we think about this. Recall back in January, Ray, I believe, had said that we had actually thought about sometime in 2012 we might need to add capacity, and we put that on hold. And it is going to remain on hold because we're trying to get the profitability where we think it ought to be. We would much rather run full out because this is a fixed cost business and you need to do that. So that's one observation. The other observation, as Ray also talked about, was we don't add capacity unless we have it effectively sold out with customer contracts. And so as our customers are continuing to look at growth with large in Europe because the can share penetration and other things, we're in very close contact with them. But we just don't want to add capacity because the market in the short term has been a little bit higher than our expectations. Now that's not to say we won't, but we'd much rather really focus on what we can control right now, which is the cost side of our business and the volume production side of our business, and then let the demand side dictate what we will do.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then last question I had was regarding the extruded aluminum technology. Is that something that was developed out of the JV in Europe? Or is that something that you guys did on your own on the slug side, I'm guessing? And then how does -- or is that transferable here to North America? I think I read in the press release that it was intended to start over there in Europe? And is that something that as you save the metal that you can effectively retain in your own profits? Or how does that work?","John A. Hayes","Well, we first developed it on our own here in North America. And using the technology of beverage can as I mentioned, beverage cans as well as the slug. Because we produce the aluminum bottles and aerosol cans over in Europe, we're going to start manufacturing them then. This is as much about an environmental sustainability play as it is an economic sustainability play. And we think that we've created a real breakthrough. And so we expect to get to be able to keep a fair amount of those savings, while at the same time providing an incentive to our customers to really push this product.","Operator","Our next question, from the line of Albert Kabili with Credit Suisse.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess the question on 2013 in North America the contract renegotiations and if you had any sort of early thoughts along those lines, how you...","Raymond J. Seabrook","Well, this is Ray. We only have one contract to do, and we are in the process of doing it. So everything else is under contract.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Right, but I guess it's a large contract and so...","Raymond J. Seabrook","Well, it's not that large. I mean there's 2 parts to it. So it's not as large as you might think.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. All right, that's helpful. Second question, along the lines of aerosol, if you could -- I may have missed it what your aerosol can volumes did. I was a bit surprised looking at the industry data how weak Aerosol was and what you're hearing along that front.","Raymond J. Seabrook","Well, tinplate aerosol was down, you're right about that. Our aerosol volumes in North America were down, a little soft in the first quarter. However, they seem to pop back up at least at the start of the second quarter. Food was just down a little bit. When I look at the aerosol volumes in Europe, we talked about it, it was up low-single digits.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then North America, should we be concerned or are you seeing any shift to aluminum away from tinplate? I mean that would obviously benefit you in Europe. But as we look about North America on aerosol, is there anything headwind on a package mix shift to aluminum away from aerosol that noticeably have impacted you thus far?","John A. Hayes","Nothing appreciably. You have to -- tinplate has its home in terms of insecticides and household products. And the aluminum has captured a fair amount of the growth because that's in the beauty and personal care. So everything from suntan lotions that are now going into aluminum and have extruded when they used to be in plastic tubes and other things like that. But there really hasn't been a shift because each -- both tinplate on one hand and aluminum on the other hand have natural submarkets relative to the overall Aerosol category.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, understood. And then final question on the Aerospace. The backlog was down a little sequentially. How do you see that playing out the rest of the year here? What are some of the next big projects, if there's any, on the radar screen that we should be looking out for?","John A. Hayes","We have a number of bids outstanding right now. And probably, candidly, more bids than I recall in the recent past. And that's the good news. One of the problem is we have a government right now that's in an election year. And so the ability to make decisions is quite -- is a bit uncertain. We have a lot of the economic issues about sequestration happening at the end of the year and tax cuts expiration, as well as debt ceiling. And so I think their focus is more on that, what to do with it. I will say this, in terms of some of the things we've been bidding on, it's -- we expect those things to continue as we go forward because as all of you know that what we do in the Aerospace side, those things are of national importance to what we do as a nation. And so we feel pretty good. We always talk about it being a little bit lumpy, and backlog is no different. We're down $40 million or $50 million from the year end. It's too early to predict exactly what it will be like in each quarter as we go forward, but as I said we have an awful lot of bids outstanding.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And along those lines, John, is there any way to maybe help us quantify, like in aggregate how big that bidding activity is in total size, like if it were 100%, which I know it never is? But is there a way for us to gauge just how big that is? You mentioned that it's healthy.","John A. Hayes","Yes. Let's put it this way. When we talk about backlog, it's funded backlog. And so that is what has already been funded by the U.S. government. We have a lot of unfunded backlog. And rough order of magnitude, it's usually twice the funded backlog is that is out there. And then on top of that, we have bids outstanding, and it's usually much greater than the funded backlog. So at any given time, we have well in excess of what our funded backlog is, well in excess in terms of things that we've won but have not booked or things -- bids that we have outstanding. And the trajectory of those types of things that I'm talking about, as I said, has gotten a little better for us, not worse.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question, from the line of Debbie Jones from Deutsche Bank.","Debbie Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I was just wondering. Can you guys talk about your trends in Germany for the quarter?","John A. Hayes","Yes. Well, the overall German market was up about 17%. We were up a little bit more than that just because we're quite large in that area. The good news is the beer is actually stronger. The beer was up 24%, 25% beer cans. And that is really a sweet spot we think over the long term for the German market. So obviously, it was -- first quarter is a seasonally slow quarter, but the trends that we have seen in Germany really haven't changed. We're still hoping and waiting that some of the 2 largest chains, retail chains in Germany start to lift. They haven't done that yet, but there's a variety of discussions going on with them. But where the can has been listed, the penetration rates have been equal to or a little bit better than what we had been hoping.","Debbie Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And also in Europe, I was just wondering are you guys seeing a bifurcation in pricing trends versus specialty versus standard cans. I assume that standard can is under a little bit more pricing pressure, but I just wanted to get your thoughts on that.","John A. Hayes","Well, actually, what we have seen is actually a little bit more of our customers' gravitation towards more of the standard sizes. As we talked about earlier, the European economy is tough, and so there's a lot of -- not only for us, but a lot of just industry generally are focused on value and are focused on cost and those things. And so we see the slight trending down from some of the higher-end specialty packages to more commodity packages. But to answer the question about pressured trends from a pricing relative to commodity versus standard containers, we don't think, see any appreciable difference there.","Debbie Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. I was also curious in China. There's a lot of capacity coming on. And I'm wondering, is there a risk in the near term that some of this new capacity does what happens [ph] you guys done in Brazil where you lost a bit of volume given your location or approximately to your customers. And the other thing that I've been finding surprising is just some announcements about the self manufacturing. For some of these players, I would think that, that would be something that we wouldn't be moving towards at this point in the market.","Raymond J. Seabrook","Yes, this is Ray. As I said, we're sold out in 2012 in China. So I've said that on the one hand. The other hand I can tell you that we've lost business. We've had some business with some customers, and we have lost on price. And so we're trying to do -- we're trying to weight the equation such that we have to be competitive, obviously. We're trying to weight the equation such that we pick the business and we look at the long-term potential of this business. But we certainly are getting competition in China, and we have lost business. However, we still remain sold out. So obviously, we continue to grow. The market continues to grow. So that's an equation that we spend a lot of time thinking about and working on. And we try to get it right.","John A. Hayes","I might add also that you talked about self manufacturers. There's some independent can manufacturers, is the way I'd describe it. And one of the things that we've been spending an awful lot of time is bringing the experience and expertise that we have in the North American markets that we have in the European markets from a cost, from a technology, from an efficiency, from a know-how perspective and making sure that we are leveraging it as much as possible in Asia and China in particular. Because at the end of the day in our business, low cost always wins. And we do think we have competitive advantages. We believe our cost structure is better than most, if not all, the competition over in Asia. And we're putting a renewed focus to make sure we're as efficient as possible there because that's the way you win in a game like that.","Debbie Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just last question in China. What is your mix between beer, CSD? And do you see that mix changing going forward?","John A. Hayes","The Chinese palate is different. So obviously, they like the teas. Our mix is much more heavily weighted towards beer and tea than it is to soft drink. It's probably reversed to the U.S.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Adam Josephson from KeyBanc.","Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Of the long-term growth you're expecting in China and Brazil, how much do you expect to come from beer market growth and how much do you expect to come from a shift from bottles to cans?","John A. Hayes","Well, I think it's a combination of both. And it varies by market. As I said, in Brazil, from a can penetration perspective on the beer side, we're in the upper 30s. And we think there's a little bit more runway there, but not a tremendous amount of runway. But the overall beer category has been growing 4%, 5%. So over the past few years, we've been getting a double whammy relative to the growth there. That's going to start to moderate out. I think in China, it's a bit different. We come from a very low level of can share penetration. As we said before, it's about 6%. China is the fastest-growing beer market in the world from an overall literage [ph] perspective. And I think those 2 issues alone create an algorithmic trajectory. Just to give you another data point that helps support that, I know in Vietnam, 3, 4 years ago, the can had a share of the beer market of around 16%, 17%. And now it's in the mid-20s, 24%, 25%, so that's just another proof point of some of the things that we are seeing over there.","Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","What would you say is the biggest risk to the long-term growth and profit expectations you have for those 2 markets other than just GDP growth slowing?","John A. Hayes","Well, I think in Brazil, as we talked about, they're benefiting as an economy right now in the rise of the middle class. And I think to answer your question, that's it, the rise of the middle class. In Brazil, because the infrastructure around the Olympics, around the World Cup, I think for the next couple of years, we can clearly see and have good visibility into the continued rise of the incomes of the middle class. In China, I think it's a foregoing conclusion as well. They have spent the last 3 years or so really putting emphasis on the consumer side of the business and going from an export market on the industrial side to an internal consumption. And so when you have all those people move, migrating from the rural areas to the urban areas, I think it just continues to bode well. But it is an element that when there is a rise in the middle class, our products always do well. And candidly, I think over the last 3, 4 years in North America, the reason why we're seeing softness in the overall categories of beverages as well as the can is because the middle class hasn't been increasing. It's been decreasing.","Operator","Our next question, from the line of Andy Feinman with Iridian Asset Management.","Andrew Feinman","Can you tell me -- I know the press release has the weighted average number of shares during the quarter, but can you give me the numbers you have at the end of the quarter?","Scott C. Morrison","Yes, it was 156,497,000, Andy, basic.","Andrew Feinman","Okay. And you said you made your annual pension contribution during the first quarter. So can you say how much it was?","Scott C. Morrison","Yes, I think it was like $85 million -- $95 million in the first quarter, which was the vast majority of what we have to fund this year. And the incremental increase was almost all in the first quarter.","Andrew Feinman","So for some reason I thought it was going to be $135 million. Does $95 million include the pace you go through stuff also or does that just include catch up?","Scott C. Morrison","No, the incremental. So right, the full year is still $135 million. But usually, a chunk of that is spread throughout the year. The big piece of it was done in the first quarter. So $95 million of the $135 million is done.","Andrew Feinman","Okay. And then the last question that I had was last year, your corporate overhead was I think $71.5 million.","Scott C. Morrison","Correct.","Andrew Feinman","I expected that they would be down this year, I don't know why. But in the first quarter, it was up a little. So the question is whether that number is likely to be lower this year or the same or up?","Scott C. Morrison","We're still having the same range that -- the first quarter, we had a huge run up in the stock price. And although we're hedging a good chunk of the stock price impact from various benefit plan, we're still a little bit -- it's not hedged, and so that cost us a few million dollars more in the first quarter than what we are expecting. So it's a little bit higher than what we thought in the first quarter. So around that range last year is still the number that we are expecting for full year.","Operator","We have a follow-up question from the line of George Staphos, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I have 2 last questions. Back to the question of Aerospace, John, could you maybe articulate what few projects -- let me say it differently. If things go as you expect, how many products do you expect to be awarded by the end of this year? Is it possible to predict that at all? And then the second question, totally unrelated. In aluminum bottle, I thought one of your competitors was perhaps adding some capacity. Do you not view that as a competitive threat down the road in terms of specialty cans and special aluminum packaging?","John A. Hayes","Yes, George, this is John. As you know, it's difficult to answer your question, but I'll try the best I can. At any given time, we have over 300 bids from very big to very small, and it varies by business. Some of the bigger ones that we have outstanding, we really can't talk about because they're in a classified world, but they do fit in the sweet spot of what was the progress we've been making over the past number of years in that. We have a variety of other things candidly that have been slipping to the right a little bit because of these funding issues. They are usually more on the smaller side and more on the tactical side, whether it's antennas for the joint strike fighter or other things as that. Ramp up of that new program doesn't go as quickly because of funding and because of other issues. But I think overall, as was mentioned before, the overall amount of bids we see stronger today than it's been in the past. And the only question mark in our mind is how quickly can the U.S. government and how quickly does the U.S. government need to move on some of these things when you have a bifurcated Congress, you have an election of not only the Senate, the Congress, as well as the presidency. And it's just I don't want to predict when people will make decisions in an uncertain environment like that.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And on beer cans? Beer bottles?","Raymond J. Seabrook","The person that's putting that capacity has not had access to our technology, so it's a self-make proposition for them. So I'm not really worried about it.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And you feel fairly comfortable about Alumi-Tek's cost position versus other technologies at this juncture? And if so, why?","Raymond J. Seabrook","Well, because we've been doing it for a while, and it's not easy to do. And if we've learned a lot of stuff, we've been doing that for 2 or 3 years, you'd be surprised what you can learn in 2 or 3 years. And we've a lot of learned a lot of things, George. And we make it at a lot lower cost now than we did when we first started making it. We've improved the technology. I'd said before, we got some stuff in the R&D -- in our R&D pipeline that looks really, really encouraging to us. So we're just -- we just have a big lead. Eventually they'll figure it out, probably but it's taken us a while.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Do you see Alumi-Tek taking share from mainstream glass in beer markets? Or really is the price gap such that it's still going to be more of an event or a specialty package?","Raymond J. Seabrook","I think it's a combination of both. What you are seeing, you certainly see it in the venue, event venues. So that is quite a positive. But you're also seeing an awful lot in the convenience stores. And that is quite honestly targeted towards some of the more premium and that really is glass. And you're able to buy 9 packs now and some other things like that. Our customer who's using it is promoting it an awful lot, not only marketing but also advertisement, television advertisement, radio advertisement, billboard, and so they're quite bullish on it, and we're here to support them.","Operator","Mr. Hayes, I'll return the call back to you, sir. There are no further questions at this time.","John A. Hayes","Okay. Well, we appreciate the participation of you all, and let's look forward to a good second quarter and the balance of the year. And we'll talk to you in July. So thanks, everyone.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today.

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday August 2, 2018.","I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, CEO. Please go ahead, sir.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Thank you, Malika, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's second quarter 2018 results.","The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements, including estimates related to the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings as well as the company's news releases.","If you don't already have our second quarter earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the notes section of today's earnings release. The release also includes a table summarizing business consolidation and other activities, as well as a reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations.","Now joining me on the call today are Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and CFO, and Dan Fisher, Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of our Global Beverage business. I'll provide some introductory remarks. Dan will discuss the global Beverage Packaging performance. Scott will discuss key financial metrics, and then we'll finish up with comments on our aerospace business as well as the outlook for our company.","Momentum continues across our businesses. Comparable operating earnings were up 11% year over year, as we continued to execute our strategies of achieving better value for our products through higher returns for our standard products and higher growth for our specialty products, aggressive cost-out programs in both our fixed and variable costs, and completing several large growth capital projects. Our comparable operating earnings improvement was despite a number of headwinds, including higher U.S. freight rates, an 11-day Brazilian trucker strike that affected shipments in May, soft domestic U.S. beer volumes, and to a smaller extent, currency. Our aerospace business continued to add to its already record high backlog, and its prospects have only grown with time.","In addition, in this quarter we announced and subsequently closed on the sale and formation of a joint venture for our U.S. tinplate food and tinplate aerosol business to Platinum Equity, where we received approximately $600 million in after-tax cash proceeds and will retain a 49% interest going forward. This transaction was the right thing for the business and for Ball Corporation, and it will allow us to immediately free up capital that was generating below our 9% after-tax return on capital threshold while retaining future upside in the business. The transaction does not include our global aluminum aerosol business, which continues to win around the globe relative to other substrates.","Our LTM comparable EBITDA through June 30, 2018 was $1.87 billion, and we are making progress toward achieving both our EBITDA and free cash flow targets in 2018 and 2019. Our deleveraging has been ahead of schedule, and we've been actively repurchasing our stock and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future, a commitment we made when we embarked upon the global beverage can acquisition.","As we continue to leverage our scale to further promote aluminum packaging growth through sustainability initiatives, I invite you to read our biennial Sustainability Report, scheduled to be released on August 7. We have an obligation to educate consumers, customers, retailers, and other stakeholders that aluminum packaging is the most sustainable package from an environmental, social, and economic perspective, and the choice for consumers of all generations. Our products are on the right side of the environmental debate, and that is certainly a tailwind for Ball, not only in beverage packaging, but also in our aerospace business, where much of our civil work is focused on creating and disseminating environmental intelligence.","Now moving on to the results for the second quarter, our South American business delivered solid performance despite the trucker strike in Brazil, which cost us approximately $10 million in comparable operating earnings. Our European business continued to sequentially improve on its performance through cost-out and volume growth.","Though our North American business continued to incur out-of-pattern freight and startup costs related to our new Goodyear, Arizona facility and lower volumes due to softness in domestic beer, other categories like CSD, crafts, sparkling water, import beer, energy drinks, wine, and other emerging categories continue to grow. And we've begun to execute on our value-over-volume strategy to address the long-stated need that our standard products do not generate the appropriate returns for the capital employed.","Anticipated cost savings were also realized in our G&A, our Spain and Arizona startups, and the plant optimizations in Birmingham, Alabama and Cuiab\u00e1, Brazil are complete. Global aluminum aerosol volumes were up 5% in the quarter, and our tinplate food and aerosol asset sale was completed, as I mentioned earlier, this week.","Lastly, our Aerospace business continued to grow its contracted backlog, and hiring continues at a very rapid pace. While the hiring surge and ramp up of new programs had a bit of a drag in the second quarter, we expect material operating earnings improvement over the coming quarters.","So despite continued U.S. domestic industry volume declines and volatile volumes in EMEA, the strength of our business, its strong cash flow and EVA returns, and the continued progress on our efforts and initiatives certainly offset any such headwinds. We remain confident that certain customer-specific volume softness will in no way impact our ability to achieve our near-term targets.","Within the last two weeks, we also received the good news that Ball was awarded exclusions on U.S. aluminum tariffs for certain countries' can sheet supply \u2013 great work done by our sourcing and government affairs teams.","As we go forward, we will continue to execute our long-term strategy of growing earnings over time through increasing revenues above our cost growth, driving more mix shift to specialty containers, actively managing our supply and demand, further developing innovative aluminum packaging products, and expanding aerospace with an EVA and return of value to shareholder mindset. As fellow Ball shareholders, investors can count on us being good stewards of our capital and cash flow.","All in, excellent execution by our global teams. Thank you to all of our employees for delivering on our commitments while dealing with the complexity of numerous projects and process initiatives to position our company for consistent long-term growth and strong free cash flow.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan.","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","Thanks, John.","Our global beverage business operating earnings were up 9% year to date. As John mentioned, it was a busy and rewarding quarter across global beverage. Our team completed two plant startups on time and on budget. And we kept up with strong demand for beverage cans across Europe, Russia, and Brazil during World Cup, despite a few transitory hiccups outside of Ball's control like transportation strikes and brief CO2 shortages.","Our global specialty mix remains at approximately 40%, and network optimization activities to balance standard can production and geographically position the broader specialty can portfolio in the U.S. are right on schedule, with Birmingham ceasing end production at the end of the quarter and Chatsworth and Longview slated to cease production by the end of the third quarter.","All of this is possible given the successful startup of Goodyear's two lines in the first half and the ongoing startups of lines three and four by the end of August. Note that the U.S. network optimization just described results in no new net capacity, and Scott will address the CapEx to fully scale out the Goodyear plant.","European process transformation projects to further improve our cost structure continue. And additional network optimization through the closure of one-line Cuiab\u00e1, Brazil plant will allow us to leverage equipment elsewhere in the South American network.","Ultimately, we are aligning with the right customers and markets, expanding into new products and capabilities via our ever-expanding offering our specialty can sizes, leveraging our technical knowhow around predictive maintenance, light-weighting, and process improvement, and positioning our products as the most sustainable in the world. The economic value creation the can brings our customers is real and growing.","Moving to the individual segments, Ball's North American segment profits were up slightly despite shipments being down just over 3%, all consistent with our first quarter commentary. Growth in Mexican imports, craft, sparkling water, wine, and energy is very healthy, but just wasn't enough to offset domestic beer volume declines, roughly $7 million of out-of-pattern freight and roughly $5 million to $7 million of startup expense in the quarter.","Hats off to our North America team. There have been more headwinds than tailwinds this quarter, but that will flip in the second half. July beverage can shipments are strong and our supply\/demand balance is tight. With this more favorable volume trend and a moderation of startup costs and out-of-pattern freight, the segment is positioned for notable growth in the second half and will also benefit from fixed cost savings in late 2018 and beyond following the previously mentioned plants closing late this quarter.","Our South American business was unable to claw back all of the impact of the 11-day trucker strike, but given the scale and size of our Brazilian operations performing $3 million lower in the quarter versus 2017 was an accomplishment. Segment shipments grew nearly 5% and, as we've teed up since late last year, underperformed Brazilian industry trends in the quarter. Overall beer consumption trends in Brazil improved, and our customers continue to emphasize cans across South America. Our business is positioned well for 2019 and beyond.","The timetable for expansions in Argentina, Paraguay, and Chile are on track, and we are excited about the can continuing to be embraced by customers and consumers across South America.","As we have acknowledged the past couple of quarters, we continue to anticipate tougher year-over-year comps in the second half for our Brazilian business due to the profit recorded on the INS manufacturing contract that supported the divestment business going away, tougher year-over-year volume comparisons and our value-over-volume response that played out in late 2017. Thanks again to our South American colleagues. We appreciate how effectively the team responded to the trucker strike and how quickly the business got back to normal.","The European business earnings were up 14% year over year, and once again saw mid-single-digit volume growth, led by Russia and Continental Europe. Our new Spain facility is shipping cans, and near and long-term initiatives to get segment performance back to our Ball's legacy business was or are on track. Transformation projects are progressing nicely and will contribute to planned G&A savings in 2019.","In EMEA, demand volatility remains. Saudi continues to be difficult. And on the positive side, we are seeing a better operating and demand environment in Turkey and India. Our China business continues to be cash flow positive, and we'll continue to exercise a disciplined approach in this country.","In summary, significant projects are up and running. Supply\/demand is tightening, and contract renewals are on the horizon. Thank you again to all of our teams around the globe. You're doing a great job.","With that, I'll turn it over to Scott.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Thanks, Dan.","Comparable second quarter 2018 earnings were $0.58 versus $0.53 in 2017. Second quarter diluted earnings per share reflect solid operational performance across our packaging businesses and lower corporate costs, offset by higher taxes and slightly higher interest expense. Details are provided in the Notes section of today's earnings release, and additional information will also be provided in our 10-Q.","Net debt ended the quarter at $6.8 billion, $200 million lower than first quarter and after a net share buyback of $175 million through the first six months. For 2018, we expect CapEx to be in in excess of $700 million, as excellent progress on major projects allows us to bring spending forward. The increased CapEx along with the timing of the sale of the U.S. steel food and steel aerosol businesses at the seasonal peak of the working capital build will put our free cash flow in the range of $800 million for the full year. Full-year 2018 interest expense is now expected to be just above $300 million.","The full-year effective tax rate on comparable earnings will be approximately 24% based on our current estimates of the impact of U.S. tax reform, and corporate undistributed will be just under $110 million for the full year 2018. Keep in mind that due to the sale of our steel food and steel aerosol assets versus the timing of using the proceeds to repurchase shares, it will be slightly dilutive to the second half earnings, likely in the range of $0.05. Prospectively, on a full-year basis, the transaction will be neutral to slightly positive relative to diluted earnings per share due to the incremental share repurchase and definitely positive to EVA dollar generation in 2019.","The cash flow was strong, and year to date through yesterday we have repurchased 8.34 million shares or $318 million worth of our stock, just over a 2% reduction in diluted weighted average shares outstanding. And by year end, we expect our stock buyback to approach $700 million in addition to paying out roughly $140 million in dividends. It's exciting to be able to ramp up our return of value to shareholders.","With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Great. Thanks, Scott.","Our aerospace business reported higher revenues and slightly lower second quarter operating earnings results, driven by solid contract performance and the continuing ramp-up of new contracts, offset by incremental labor costs while we rapidly scale up our labor base. Our staffing levels continue to increase, and year to date we've hired approximately 540 new employees and anticipate adding another 200 to 400 employees over the next 12 months. The aerospace team has done an excellent job managing this large onboarding process without taking their eyes off the execution of our business.","We continue to leverage our unique capabilities, world-class technology, and the best talent in the industry to further grow our aerospace business. With contracted backlog at record levels and our won-not-booked backlog at $4.3 billion, the future looks bright for aerospace for the next three to five years. And as I mentioned earlier, the compressed timing of onboarding such a large number of new employees temporarily compressed second quarter earnings, but we expect significant and material operating earnings improvement over the coming quarters.","Now, as we look forward for our corporation, we are on track to achieve our targets. We are actively managing and oriented our asset base within an EVA-accretive approach. We are leading the charge to ensure aluminum packages for beverage and aerosol are the most sustainable packages on the globe. And our aerospace business is operating from a position of strength as we ramp up and scale out our people, processes, and infrastructure.","It's been over two years since we closed on the largest acquisition in our company's 138-year history. We've delivered through some pretty interesting global economic and political dynamics. It's time to look beyond 2019. And with that in mind, we are having our investor field trip in Colorado on October 1 and 2. So please reach out to Ann Scott if you're interested in meeting our broader team and learning more about the \"and beyond.\"","For now, our balance sheet leverage is where we want it. The capital investments have been made. We are taking seriously the opportunities afforded us through our commercial, manufacturing, and supply chain activities. The outlook is on track. And we're a buyer of all stock.","There's probably not much more to say. So with that, we'll turn it over the Q&A. Malika, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you. And our first question on the phone line is from George Staphos with Bank of America. Please go ahead, your line is open.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Thanks for all the details. I'll ask a few questions and turn it over and try to come back.","I guess in terms of the outlook and guidance in relation to the transaction with Platinum, I think you mentioned, John \u2013 or Scott, that the back half of the year will be diluted about $0.05 just because of timing, and yet you're maintaining your outlook for 2019, recognizing I'm shifting gears a bit here. What within your ongoing fundamentals, your integration of Rexam is going sufficiently well that you can maintain the guidance even though this is a somewhat dilutive transaction initially anyway to earnings and to cash flow?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","George, why don't I take 2019, then I'll turn it over to Scott to give more color on the 2018? But when we started a couple years ago, we talked about the $2 billion and $1 billion in 2019. And that included our tinplate business, as you know. As part of the transaction, it was announced that for the fiscal year 2017, it reported EBITDA of about $78 million. And as you know, 2017 was not a good year in that business, so there was some growth.","So embedded in the $2 billion was somewhat south of $100 million of EBITDA that we just divested. But despite that, things are going well. We are accelerating some of the capital that we're going to be able to generate that incremental value in 2019. And so we think we can close that gap and still maintain the $2 billion of EBITDA guidance and $1 billion of free cash flow, despite losing just under $100 million of EBITDA and equivalent free cash flow from the food and aerosol business.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","And the dilutive nature of the transaction is really just timing because we'll start buying stock. We've got a lot of stock to buy in the back half of the year. And once we get to the end of the year, it should all be trued up. So on a full-year basis, it we really won't be dilutive going forward.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, I appreciate that. I think next question I want to just review is contracts, commercial efforts, and the like, and there are a couple more I think references to value-over-volume in this press release. I know you can't go contract by contract or give a lot of detail. But can you give us a little bit more in terms of the undercurrent in terms of your progress there? And I think you mentioned in EMEA, you have a bit more in the way of contract renewals. Did I hear that right, and how are those related?","And then lastly, if you can, Scott, back to the CapEx question going up $100 million, can you comment at all, other than the amount of spending increment, where you're putting that capital? Thank you.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Thanks, George. This is John. I'll start. That was a mouthful, I think. But first, with respect to our commercial strategies, for the past couple years, we have been very consistent, that said that the returns that are generated on the standard containers do not, for us, meet the hurdle rate to continue reinvesting in that. And so we have talked for a while now about our value-over-volume strategy. We also talked over the last couple conference calls that we have a couple of rather larger contracts coming up in Europe at the end of 2018 and in the United States at the end of 2019, and nothing has changed at all. We are in execution mode.","And I will also say, though, that you also know it's Ball's policy that we don't negotiate nor talk about customer contracts in a granular level on investor conference calls. So the only guidance I can give you is we are right in the throes of what we've said for the last two years we'd be doing.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","And on the CapEx front, our teams have done \u2013 all of these things were planned, George. It was just a matter of the timing of them. But our teams have done an excellent job of executing on the big projects that we have going on so we're able to accelerate the later phases of these programs.","So Dan mentioned bringing up lines three and four here in the back half of the year in Goodyear, adding a second line to the Spain plant. We're adding a warehouse in Monterrey to support the growth in that business; and to support our aerospace backlog, moving up some of the build-out of some of our test facilities. So these are all above-average return projects. And frankly, I'm usually a capital curmudgeon in terms of spending, but the faster we can do these things, the faster we'll get the returns and the longer we'll get to enjoy them.","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","And maybe I can add some color to the capital just for the beverage piece, and then I'll address your EMEA contract question. Goodyear, just to scale it, Goodyear is approximately $250 million. Cabanillas, our Spain facility, is approximately $150 million. We put up a fourth line, mega-line to support our 24 and 25-ounce growth in Conroe. That's approximately $60 million to $70 million. And then you've got ongoing M&R in the range of $100 million to $125 million. So it's obviously some significant one-time capital throws but it's been contemplated. It's being executed against, and obviously it's going to allow us to qualify customers sooner and get after some of the fixed cost savings maybe a quarter earlier than we had anticipated. So, I'm really pleased with all of that.","And then in EMEA, George, I would frame EMEA similar to contract lengths in North America. Our EMEA business, as you know, is principally Egypt, Turkey, India, and Saudi. And those contract durations are somewhere in the neighborhood of two to five years, so they don't turn over as frequently as, say, a China. And there are really no substantive changes in that market. It's consistent with where we entered the year and what we had contemplated a couple years ago in the guidance that we gave.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you very much.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Thanks, George.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Good morning.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Good morning.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Just a question on the trends in North America. A lot of the volume headwinds have been well documented. It seems like your comments imply a little bit of an improvement. I think even July you said things are improving there. I just wonder if you could expand on that. What are you seeing heading into 3Q and what gives you confidence that we might flip to growth at some point in the near future in that segment?","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","Sure, you heard correctly. We saw strength in June and then that's followed through in July. And it's essentially April and May there wasn't a ton of promotional activity by the major customers. You've seen a lot of innovation in terms of new products and new categories being pushed, especially in the mega beer customer. And so we're seeing those, and so we think there's probably a shift of Q2 softness into Q3 strength. So I think it's just a timing issue if nothing else.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay, that makes sense. And then one question about the announcement on the can plant in Brazil you had to shut down. The volumes have been really strong in that region. I'm just wondering why they need to close it. I know it's just a one-line plant, so I'm guessing some of it's efficiency gains, but any impact of that to overall volume? Do you think you'll be able to house those customers from other plants, and any color on any fixed cost savings or margin shift from it?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","You've hit it on the head. Really, what we're doing is we're taking a one-line can plant, taking the fixed cost out of it, and moving that equipment into other facilities, so we're not necessarily losing any capacity. And we are taking out fixed costs. In the grand scheme of Ball Corporation, it's not a huge deal. But anytime you can take fixed costs out, that's what we look to do, and that's what we're doing here.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Tyler Langton from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, thank you. I just had a question on South America. I guess it seems, at least versus our estimate, to have been a little bit better in the second half, especially when you take out the strike. Just when you think second half and I guess the full year, is it doing a little bit better, I guess, than maybe you previously thought, or just still in line?","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","I think it's largely in line. Q2 was so disruptive because of the 11-day trucker strike in terms of volume dynamics. But I would say volumes were better in Q1, hard to distinguish what actually happened in Q2 from a volume trend perspective. But based on what we're hearing from our customers, we think the can will continue to win, and we should do well in the second half. I would just reference my comments relative to the INS manufacturing agreement in the second half for year-over-year comps. I'm just speaking of volumes here.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","The only other thing I'd add is let's not forget that there's an election in Brazil this fall. And elections when they happen down in Brazil, they tend to create more volatility. So I think the caution you hear from us is really just more about an unknown than anything other than what Dan said that we know. It's just that these elections just create greater volatility. And it's not until the beginning of the fourth quarter that we're going to have this election.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And I think, Dan, you said, with the startup in North America, startup costs were $5 million to $7 million this quarter and then freight was $7 million. Do you have a sense of \u2013 I know you think it will get better \u2013 but in the second half, are just higher freight rates going to cause any pressure? I would think actually startup costs go down, but just any details around that would be helpful.","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","June was definitely a spike in freight rates. I would expect to see some of that continue. In that $7 million out-of-pattern freight number that I indicated, probably $2 million to $3 million of that was self-induced really because of the startup costs. So I think that that number would be mitigated somewhat, but we'll continue to see headwinds on freight for the foreseeable future unless there's any kind of underlying changes.","We should get the fixed cost savings like I identified. The startups are going extremely well. Some of the competitors I think have recently said they're looking to broker additional cans. We'll be the beneficiaries of that hopefully as a result of an excellent startup phase. So freight rates will continue, probably in line with what we've seen, but we've got a lot of tailwinds heading our way in the second half of the year in that business.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it, thanks, and then just a final question for Scott. Do you have \u2013 I know you're actually pulling forward some CapEx. And I know you had always used $500 million roughly as a placeholder. And I know it's early, but have you looked into 2019? Just do you have any thoughts on what CapEx could look like?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","I think we've been able to accelerate some of these programs that we had planned quite some time ago, so I think we'll see a meaningful drop in CapEx as we get into 2019.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","I think just to amplify that Dan did a good job of laying out the really big projects on the beverage side, and that added up to well in excess of $550 million. Layer on we're spending $100 million a quarter in aerospace alone this year on building out our manufacturing footprint here, that's where you can see how we're getting to the $700 million. And when you think about, as we sit here today, those big projects that are going on in 2019, most of what Dan referenced will not be there. Aerospace will still have some elevated expenditure, but not to the level it is now. So it should come down meaningfully from where it is this year.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","I would expect it to be lower than depreciation next year.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got you. Okay, thanks so much.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning. Thanks, everyone. Dan, just one question on your North American commentary, you mentioned your system is tight at this point. The segment was down 3% on volume in the first half of the year roughly. So I know you said July was better, but what exactly is causing the tightness given the volume decline you've experienced thus far?","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","I would say reference my comments just previously. But in April and May, April and May was just a function \u2013 it's promotional spend. You see significant declines in April and May on promotional spend by really the big customers. That spend has come back in conjunction with them pushing candidly a number of different new innovative products. All of that needed additional time to be marketed, and that's all selling through. And we've seen the benefits. Both in June we saw it, and thus far through July and into early August. So I think it's more of a timing issue, 2% to 3%, than anything just because of the promotional activity.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","And don't forget going forward, Dan also mentioned about the closure of Chatsworth as well as Longview, Texas.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Right, the capacity actions will be neutral to your overall capacity, right?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","That's correct. That's correct.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And then just, John, one more on I think what George was asking with the 2019 EBITDA. So if you're selling almost $100 million of EBITDA, I know it was a $78 million in 2017 and I don't know what it is now. But call it $80 million \u2013 $90 million. You referenced a number of external headwinds that the company has dealt with since you closed the Rexam deal, yet you're, it sounds like, effectively increasing your underlying EBITDA guidance by almost $100 million despite all these headwinds. So I'm just trying to better understand where that's coming from exactly, if there's a particular region that's been going markedly better than expected, just a little more detail there would be helpful. Thank you.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","I think it's excellent execution across all the regions. When I think off the top of my head, Europe is still on its journey but is delivering above what we initially expected. I think in North America, we still have a lot of on-the-come opportunities in terms of the fixed cost savings that Dan mentioned, but things are going well there.","I think in South America, I think our sourcing strategies is above where we were. So there's not just one or two specific buckets. I think across the board, our business has been executing quite well. That combined with the aerospace business is growing faster than what we expected as well. So yes, we have some headwinds. Yes, we're selling off $80 million to $100 million in EBITDA. And yes, we still think we can make the $2 billion of EBITDA in 2019.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","I think another point that we've commented on but maybe gets lost in this is, and maybe we should be tooting our own horn a little bit more, the project startups in Goodyear and Spain, six lines in greenfield facilities have gone remarkably well. And if those had not gone well, we would be having challenges and out-of-pattern freight qualifications with customers. And I think as we sit here today, we're much more on our toes with regard to those two projects, which we banked a lot on in terms of fixed cost savings in 2019.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning. In the North American business, it seems like you might be set up for a good second half. When I think about last year, you had the hurricanes and then related freight and supply chain costs. Is it possible to size how much of a benefit you could get from the non-repeat of hurricane and hurricane-related costs?","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","What we said last year and then it's really playing out and what we're anticipating as well was about we had a $30 million headwind, out-of-pattern freight, lost sales, inefficiencies from a production and absorption standpoint. Based on what we noted and what we're seeing out of the North America business, we should recover all of that. And hopefully, if things continue to go well from an execution standpoint and volume comes through, we'll see that year over year.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, that's helpful. And then just switching gears, John, you talked in your prepared remarks about the environmental benefits of cans. And I'm wondering with regard to some of the regulatory and media scrutiny on plastics, maybe especially in Europe, is this something that big customers are proactively coming to you about and you think could really drive incremental volumes this year or next year, or is it more of a general observation or something that you think could gain traction further on? Just any kind of color you could give there would be helpful.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","I think it has both short-term and long-term implications. I think the opportunity is probably greater in the long term because in the short term, inner material substitution you don't see a lot of. But this does play into our commercial strategy that we said we're trying to anticipate and really push from a retailer perspective, an NGO and government perspective, a customer and consumer perspective, the benefits of the can. But we also have to be in a position to be willing and able to invest in it where the returns are good. And on the specialty, we've been doing a very good job there. And so, we need to get the standard up.","But I think in terms of specifically what you're talking about around inner material shifts, I think in the short term that it's incremental, but I do think there's long-term benefits here if we play this right. And I encourage you to come to our October 1 and 2 Investor Day because we're going to be talking a lot more about the commercial reasons of why this is in our great interest to be pushing this.","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","On the long-term front, specific to the major customers, I can add just a little color. What we're doing now far more than we've done even a year ago is we're sitting down with our major customers and we are collaborating with them on science-based targets. And some of the targets have to do with 100% recycled packaging substrate.","Now the targets these customers are putting out are 2025 and 2030. That's why we're saying longer term. Absolutely, we know we're putting programs in place. How quickly that manifests itself, we need to just continue to push the message in work because ,especially in Europe, as you indicated, right now it's happening and the conversations are shifting.","And just to give you a little teaser come early October, we've looked at every major region in which we operate. And whether it's on the soft drink side, the beer side, or the other categories which is energy and sparkling waters, et cetera, we've looked at what a 1 percentage point share shift from another substrate to the can means, and it's meaningful bottom line improvement to our company. And that is why the economic case of trying to create these greater profit pools for our customers by using cans can be good for them and good for us.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, that's very helpful. I'll turn it over.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, good morning.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Good morning.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Good morning.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Scott, I just wanted to go back. I didn't quite catch all of your comments on share repo year to date, or I don't know if you gave it at the end of the quarter. And would your expectation on a go-forward basis be to go back to the \u2013 I call it the old methodology where you did most of your share repurchases in 1Q on a go-forward basis?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","So what we've purchased, what's in the 10-Q is $175 million for the year, but we purchased heavy since the end of \u2013 I'm sorry, for the six months. Sorry, for the six months. But what we purchased year to date as of yesterday, so we put a program in place. We were blacked out for much of the quarter because of the food transaction. So once we were out of that, we repurchased heavy. And so as of yesterday, we repurchased $318 million worth of our stock or 8.3 million shares, just over 2% For the rest of the year, we plan to approach $700 million, so it's another 3% of the shares or 10 million shares that should come out between now and the end of the year, as we basically spend the proceeds of the food transaction and our cash flow.","Going forward, we will orient \u2013 our leverage will be down to a point \u2013 we're almost there now. I think we're at 3.6 times at the end of the quarter. We said when we're at 3 to 3.5 times that we'll turn all of our free cash flow to buy back our stock and our dividend. So that's a lot of stock to buy over the course of the year, and we'll be opportunistic and we'll see how that plays out in terms of the timing early in the year versus throughout the year. You could probably count on more in the first half of the year but buying throughout the year.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And maybe splitting hairs a little bit, but when you had the announcement on the steel food, steel aerosol JV, it sounded \u2013 you made the comment that the guidance for 2019 was going to be more challenging to achieve, but I would say you sound extremely confident today. Is there anything that changed in the last, whatever, month and a half that would give you significantly more confidence than you had at that point in time?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","No is the short answer. I think when we put together two years ago the $2 billion EBITDA target for 2019, there were a lot of unknowns. We have derisked those unknowns, and we feel more confident. But having said that, when you're taking $80 million, $90 million, $100 million of EBITDA off the table through the sale of the food and aerosol business, you have an $80 million, $90 million, $100 million gap you need to fill. We have confidence that we have game plans to fill that, and that's exactly what we're doing. But there still is incremental risk. We still haven't realized the $50 million net savings here in North America around the three plant closures. That's still on the come and there's still other programs like that, but we have a line of sight to what we need to do. That's the important part.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's a big EBITDA hole to fill, so good luck filling that with some of these improvements. Just lastly for me, on the exclusion from the aluminum tariffs, is that an industry issue, or is that something Ball-specific that you were discussing there?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","That was Ball-specific. The industry cannot petition the Department of Commerce for exclusion. It has to be company by company, and we received last week the news that we received an important exclusion.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, thank you.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Edlain Rodriguez from UBS. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning, guys. A quick question on beer consumption in the U.S. For a while, Mexican imports were offsetting production in the U.S. But you saw the article yesterday in The Wall Street Journal regarding how Americans were drinking less beer, with younger people preferring cocktails and wine. Like how do you position the company for a sustained decline in beer consumption, and that would include imports and everything else? So how do you position the company for something like that?","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","So, I guess the data that you're referencing is nothing new over the last decade. I would say that, number one. And number two, you're talking about beer literage. You're not talking about the can. The can has disproportionately won share over that period of time. Craft beer continues grow, in the quarter up 35%. I think we look to things like seltzers, waters, wine we're getting into in a big way, energy. You've got to win in the categories that are winning I think is the answer. But the can continues to win from a substrate standpoint, and overall can volume for beer has grown slightly over the last five years. And if we continue to win in the markets that we're participating in, that's how we'll hedge our bet.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","The only thing I'll add \u2013 this is John \u2013 is in reference to the article you mentioned. It was describing a slow decline of traditional beer, and that's correct. But as Dan just pointed out, spiked seltzers and all the alternative categories that the beer makers are really pushing, we can tell you with great certainty that the spiked sparkling category this summer is growing faster than anyone anticipated. And so yes, that is taking share from what I would describe as traditional beer. It's still a malt beverage, which is the important part. And the can by far is disproportionately winning in that. So when Dan talks about focusing on wine and focusing on these new categories, spiked seltzer is a great example of that.","Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC","No, that makes sense. And also, in terms of the profitability of the different products, does it matter to you whether those customers are selling more seltzers and other products versus beer?","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","Yes, the short answer, they're going into specialty cans, number one. And number two, they're being sold in many instances in single-serve at higher profit pools. And if our customers are selling at a higher price, we have the opportunity to sell to them at a higher price. So the economic equation works really well on those introductory new beverage categories.","Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, thank you very much.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great, thanks. Good morning.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Good morning, Arun.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Just a question following up here on that same issue. I guess first off, have you noticed any changes? You referred to increased promotional spending. Is that a structural shift amongst your customers? I imagine that they're not happy, the large brewers, with the volume trends. Have they increased their spending at a sustained level from here on, and do you think that's going to have a material impact on master volumes?","And similarly, I think we've noticed something similar on the CSD side. So, A), has that actually happened, and do you think that's actually resulting in improved volume recovery? Thanks.","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","I can't comment on the long-term promotional spend, if it's going to be more in social media, if it's going to be different outlets, if it's going to be a different dollar spend or a different target. I will tell you that the largest brewer in the world has made a comment that they want to shift their product mix from 80% traditional to 20% alternative. In that 20% space, it will overwhelmingly be new products and it will overwhelmingly be cans. And so, I'm more interested in those new products candidly winning and us winning at a disproportionate rate, than I am concerned about the promotional spend activity on the core brands.","Another major brewer, just to add context, in North America recently made wholesale changes in their marketing department. That marketing department was not concentrated on core brand innovation over the last handful of years and their core products declined. And so, I think there's some rethinking going on, different thought in some of the major brewers, and we will be there to help them from an innovation standpoint, and they will be knocking on our door first. But what happens going forward and where they spend their money is yet to be determined, I think.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then as a follow-up, are there other mechanisms you can take on the pricing side to offset any of the inflation that you're seeing, whether it be non-metal but like freight and so on? And then what's the appetite for that kind of initiative? Would it be more challenging given soft volumes in North America and Europe, or is it a potential likelihood that you could actually achieve something like that? Thanks.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","We've talked about this a lot in past conference calls. And when you're talking about your commercial strategy, it's just not price. It's everything from terms. It's who bears the freight and how that mechanic worked. It talks about call-off and having call-off windows that if you're in a 72-hour window, it's at one price, and then there's a surcharge if you want to move it inside of that. And so there's a whole host of various things going on. And as I said, we're not going to negotiate or talk about any individual conversations with customers on our conference call, but I also said that we are in execution mode as we sit here right now.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning. I guess going back to the second quarter, I know we've talked quite a bit about 2019. And specific to Europe, how much of a benefit do you think you realized from the World Cup? How should we think about volumes in the region for the back half of 2018? And also, was there any sort of mix impact during the second quarter that was unfavorable? I'm just trying to reconcile the 6% volume growth with the reported 5.7% sales increase.","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","I would say there was definitely some benefit to us, and I think it had more to do with the fact that it was in Russia, and we have a very strong footprint in Russia. So that had more to do with it.","And the other thing that happened in Europe, Ghansham, that you're probably aware of is in the north the weather was remarkably good. So there were a couple elements that really furthered that strength. I think the overall European market was probably closer to 4% \u2013 5% growth and we were closer to 6%. And so I think that benefit had to do with our footprint, candidly, in Russia and the benefit of the World Cup.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","And, Ghansham, I'll just point out on the volume versus revenue line, remember that we talked about in the first quarter that we still have a couple of contracts where it's year-over-year price declines that we inherited, and those end at the end of this year.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Got it, that's helpful. And then since you last reported, the foreign exchange environment has changed dramatically, particularly as it relates to the emerging markets, some of the countries you operate in, Argentina, Turkey, et cetera. Can you just help us think through any sort of risk in the back half of the year? Are you seeing anything different than the underlying trend in the first half in those few regions?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","No, it was definitely more volatile. The markets, and John referenced this on his comments from an operating earnings standpoint, we had some headwinds definitely in Argentina, in Russia, and Turkey in the second quarter. We had some offsetting things as it relates on the corporate side. So the net impact when you get down to the earnings per share wasn't very much. Going forward, volatility seems to be a little bit less. But we're pretty well positioned to be able to deal with the currencies.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","I'll just add one other thing. Obviously, any time currencies relative to the dollar devalue, it makes our product more expensive because our products are typically dollar-priced. So you never like to see that. Having said that, when we think about what we see right now in the places Scott just mentioned, Russia, Turkey, and Argentina, can demand continues to be very strong there. Now, Russia was the World Cup. Turkey, it still has good economic growth. And even in Argentina, there's package share mix that's favoring the can there. But we keep our antenna up pretty closely to see if there's any adverse demand impact related to this, and we haven't seen anything yet.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay, just one final one. Going back to the comments on beer on the U.S., clearly it has been impacted by changing consumer preferences in the U.S. Perhaps it's had some parallels with what soft drinks went through over a decade ago in this country as well. How do you think more broadly about portfolio risk, specifically the U.S.? What's your beer exposure? I know craft beer has been growing. But if the category does start to slow more broadly, including craft beer, how should we think about your ability to perhaps do what you've been doing with tiering your customers on the soft drink side with specialty cans, et cetera? Is that an opportunity for you?","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","Absolutely, the specialty can and the new categories. At the end of the day, the major brewers are going to have to figure out how to sell products that the end consumer wants, and I think they're learning that pretty quickly. And I think your correlation to CSD is a good one. Just looking behind innovation pipelines and what we see and what we're working with those customers on, it looks a heck of a lot like five, six, seven years ago with the CSD folks.","The other comment, and some of it just has to do with our exposure to the core brands that are declining, we have a lot less exposure to that just from a structural standpoint in North America because the two major brewers are vertically integrated. And so a lot of that they're feeling on the backs of their system, so we felt less of it. And the folks in the customers and the categories that we're dealing with, the craft side, et cetera, those continue to do really well. So we've gotten out ahead of that aspect or this aspect that we're talking about, and we've got the vertical integration buffer, if you will, just because of the North American market and how it's structured.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thanks for all the detail.","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","You've got it.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Anojja Shah with BMO. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Anojja Shah - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Good morning, everyone. I just wanted...","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Good morning.","Anojja Shah - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","...to go back to that aluminum tariff exclusion. Does it cover your entire portfolio? And is there any financial impact to you, or is it more to your customers that you would pass it through to?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","First and foremost, we pass it through to our customers. So it's about making sure that the beverage can is competitive. It is related. It doesn't affect all of our \u2013 because the majority of our metal we acquire here in the United States, but there's not necessarily enough capacity to acquire 100% of it in the United States. And so we procure metal from a particular supplier in the Middle East, and that is what we were given an exclusion for.","Anojja Shah - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, thank you. That makes sense. And then my other question is the Brazilian trucker strike, do you expect any carryover impact in 3Q or 4Q?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","I'll quickly handle that. No is the short answer. One of the things just to watch out generally is with these elections coming up, there's going to be a lot of labor issues. We can't tell you what they are, but it always happens this way when you have the economy in Brazil as it is and the political disruption as it is. Many of the unions put forth their strong views on certain things, and that's just to watch out. We know nothing specific, but those things can happen from time to time.","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","And I think for full disclosure, it was a \u2013 the agreement that was reached was a temporary one, 90 to 120-day. So this all plays into the new election and what happens there. So based on what we're seeing right now and how we're operating, we don't foresee any additional disruptions. But there's always that lingering event out there with the election and the fact that this wasn't a permanent agreement.","Anojja Shah - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","All right, okay. Thank you very much.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","All right, thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Gabe Hajde with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Gabe S. Hajde - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning and thanks for taking the questions, just one on the Middle East. I guess notwithstanding a lot of geopolitical volatility over there, can you talk about just underlying demand and as we start to lap the sugar tax over there? And any response in the competitive landscape that you can speak of?","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","Sure. Just to reiterate, our EMEA region is Egypt, Turkey, Saudi, and India. And Saudi, I would say it continues to be incredibly weak. And I would have anticipated a little bit more of a surge back to growth via innovation, and that hasn't come to fruition probably as fast as we've seen in other markets. So that continues to be a challenge year over year. But in Turkey, Egypt, and India, those three regions are all growing and approaching double-digit growth for us. So they're very positive, and the team is doing a great job cultivating can growth and new customers there. But Saudi continues to be a very challenging environment for us and more importantly our customers.","Gabe S. Hajde - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, and then one just on Brazil, I guess bigger picture, your thoughts around underlying demand. I know there was a lot of volatility with the trucker strike and World Cup. But maybe just looking out in 2019, it seemed like the economy down there was on an improved trajectory. Do we still think about a, call it, 2% to 4% growth environment down there, or is there anything that's changed from that perspective?","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","Yeah, I think, and that 2% to 4% is probably like 6% to 8% on beer and probably continues to decline on CSD to get to that 2% to 4%, to give you more color. The can continues to win. The majority player in that market continues to push cans because all of their competition is going after them with cans. So from a can perspective, I feel bullish. Obviously, John's comment around the election, the uncertainty there, but from our business, in the can and the beer segment, things continue to look positive, and we're seeing continued investment by our customers in that region. So, I think your number is a pretty good one.","Gabe S. Hajde - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Thank you, good luck.","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","Thank you.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Malika, we'll take one more question if there's any more.","Operator","Okay. And we do have a question from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yes, good afternoon almost for us and good morning, Scott, Dan, and John. The question I have is on \u2013 I noticed that the equity income line, which is usually pretty material, $8 million \u2013 $10 million, was zero this quarter. Was there anything new there that we should take into account?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","No, it was exclusively the result of one-time mostly timing issues in one of our Asian JVs that will normalize going forward. The only delta for the full year will happen in the second quarter, nothing to be concerned about on an ongoing basis.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay, so that was part of the one-time takeaways that made that go down?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Yes.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And then I think it was great the detail you gave us on some of the CapEx. I believe you said the Arizona project was $250 million. And maybe I'm just rusty on my recollection. And of course, there's a specialty component. But I thought a can plant was \u2013 you build the first line, it was probably under $100 million, and then the second line would be maybe $50 million or $70 million or something like that. Could you just help reconcile those two perceptions?","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","Sure. I think I also \u2013 this is Dan \u2013 I also referenced the Camarillas plant, two-line plant, $150 million. This is four-line plant. This is a four-line plant for $250 million.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay, that is definitely very helpful.","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","If you reference \u2013 if you go back to even \u2013 the Goodyear plant is more in line with what we would have done in Monterrey too, if you referenced some of that a couple years ago.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yes, exactly. And that's still holding at three lines that are running pretty fully now.","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","Correct.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And then, the last thing probably...","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","Plus a significant end investment is the difference down in Monterrey.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","I got you. And then looking back at Aerospace, you mentioned hiring a lot of people, and it should improve in the second half. Would you expect the EBIT margin to get back into that 10% \u2013 11% range in the second half?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","I think 11% is probably a stretch, but certainly 9% to 10% is not unrealistic at all.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Okay, thank you. Malika, are there any other questions?","Operator","Yes, sir, we do have two more questions in the queue. Would you like me to go ahead and introduce them?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Why don't we quickly go through them?","Operator","Okay, and our next question is from the line of Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, your line is open. Ms. Jones, your line is open, please go ahead. Please check your mute function or pick up the handset. We are unable to hear you. Ms. Jones, we are still unable to hear you. We'll continue with the queue, a follow-up question from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Please go ahead, your line is open.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, guys. Thanks. I know it's late and I feel bad coming in now. But the one-way glass volume growth that one of the obviously largest glass companies was talking about in Brazil, are you seeing that have much effect on industry can demand in Brazil? It didn't sound like that was the case given your prior comments. That was my follow-up question. Thanks and good luck in the quarter.","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","George, I haven't \u2013 and I would just point to the fact it was such a disruptive quarter with the freight issues. We do continue to see the customers push cans and especially the major customer that does have returnable glass infrastructure. They're continuing to be forced into moving to cans because of retail outlets, et cetera. That's the best info I have right now.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you, Dan.","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","You bet.","Operator","And we have no further questions at this time.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Okay, great.

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, October 29, 2015.","And I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, Chairman, President, and CEO. Please go ahead.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Great. Thanks, Lena, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's Conference Call regarding the company's third quarter 2015 results.","The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings as well as the company news releases. If you don't already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website.","Now with regard to Ball's proposed offer for Rexam and consistent with the requirements of the U.K. Takeover Code, we will limit our comments regarding the transactions to: number one, what has already been made public via the 2.7 release; two, where we are in the regulatory process; and three, an update of ongoing economic hedging and debt activities related to the proposed transaction.","Also note that there may be certain limitations regarding the depth of our business commentary and certain other items we would normally discuss on a quarterly earnings conference call due to the nature of the proposed transaction. Given the nature of our proposed offer, today's issued press release, webcast and conference call are advertisements and should not be considered a prospectus. Investors should not make any investment decisions in relation to the new Ball shares issued in conjunction with the Rexam transaction except on the basis of information in the prospectus and the scheme documents which are proposed to be published in due course.","This presentation and transcription of comments are not for release in whole or in part in, into or from any jurisdiction where to do so would constitute a violation of the relevant laws of such jurisdiction. For more information on Ball's proposed acquisition of Rexam, please visit the Offer for Rexam page on our website at Ball.com. Now, joining me on the call today is Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'll provide a brief overview of our company's performance, Scott will discuss financial and global packaging metrics and then I'll finish up with comments on our aerospace business and the outlook for the remainder of 2015.","Our third quarter volumes and results from operations were in line with our expectations and a lower effective tax rate aided the quarter. The headwinds that we acknowledged throughout the year around earnings translation, project startup costs and tough volume comps in North American food continued while others like aluminum premium headwinds and tough volume comps in Brazil started to become slight tailwinds in the quarter. Scott will go into more detail in terms of quantifying these headwinds.","As we said in July, overriding these headwinds are the investments we are making to operationally and strategically position Ball for future growth. This week we announced that Ball's Brazilian joint venture partners are exchanging their remaining 39.9% interest in the joint venture for 6 million Ball shares. This exchange will allow us to further streamline our business decision making in the region and across the broader Ball metal beverage business as well as enable us to better serve our customer base and ensure that the beverage can remains a cost competitive package.","While we are making progress on around the proposed acquisition of Rexam including ongoing work with the U.S. FTC, receiving the formal Statement of Objections from the European Commission and moving to the next stage with the Brazilian CADE authorities, we continue to remain focused day-to-day on maximizing the value of what we currently do and generating strong free cash flow.","Growth capital projects that have become and or that we expect will become operational and we expect will largely benefit 2016 and beyond include the next generation aluminum bottle-shaping technology in North America, which has made its way up the learning curve. In fact we were just there yesterday with our board and I want to thank all of the hard work by the folks in Conroe and elsewhere to help make this a success.","In addition, the new Oss, Netherlands specialty beverage can line and the addition of end manufacturing capacity in our existing Lublin, Poland facility, which both help serve European market growth in the quarter; the construction of our Monterrey, Mexico two-line aluminum beverage can facility, which is on track and on budget and will become operational by early 2016; the construction of a new beverage can plant in Myanmar slated to open in early 2016, a new U.S. tinplate aerosol can manufacturing technology that shipped its first commercial product earlier this month; the expansion of our aluminum impact extruded container business in the U.K. is expected to come online during the fourth quarter. And our new impact extruded aerosol facility in India celebrated its grand opening earlier this month.","We began to cycle off difficult volume comparisons in Brazil, and the aluminum premium comparisons in Europe in the third quarter, and our continued focus remains on executing on the capital projects, implementing continued cost out initiatives in China and Europe and awaiting award of a variety of aerospace proposals that are in the pipeline. I'm amazed by the amount of work being done by the Ball team. Everyone is contributing day in and day out to our future success.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott for a review of our third quarter numbers. Scott?","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, John. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share for the third quarter 2015 were $1.10 versus last year's $1.10.","As John alluded to, the following factors contributed to results in the quarter: $0.07 of unfavorable currency translation, largely due to a weaker euro; $0.04 of start-up costs associated with capital projects coming on line in late 2015 and early 2016; and aluminum premium tailwind of $0.03; and $0.05 benefit from a lower year-over-year effective tax rate, due largely to the impact of our economic hedges put in place for the Rexam transaction; and on U.S. dollar borrowings in Brazil and some one-time discrete items. In addition, as mentioned in prior quarters, metal food volumes remain challenging in the third quarter due to the previously disclosed loss of a major food can customer in North America.","Much of the difficult comparisons for 2015 are behind us, and free cash flow is now expected to be in the range of $550 million, including approximately $500 million of CapEx, and excluding cash costs associated with the Rexam transaction. As we said earlier this year, our dividend will remain unchanged during the proposed acquisition process. However, we did opportunistically repurchase 2 million shares in the quarter. We will continue to view share repurchases as opportunity-dependent.","For the full year 2015, here's an update on various financial metrics. CapEx will be in the range of $500 million, a $50 million increase due to timing on a number of projects being executed as we approach year-end. Interest expense will be roughly $150 million, excluding debt refinancing and other costs. The full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings is now expected to be closer to 24% following the third quarter impact that I talked about previously. Corporate undistributed is estimated to come in just below $90 million.","Our GAAP results in the third quarter were unfavorably impacted by the economic hedges we put in place to reduce currency exchange rate exposure associated with the British pound-denominated cash portion of the announced acquisition price for Rexam and to mitigate exposure to interest rate changes associated with anticipated debt issuances also in connection with the cash portion of this proposed acquisition. These economic hedges allow us to lock in the transaction's purchase price economics, though they will likely continue to cause disruption to quarterly GAAP earnings and could accumulate to a sizable figure given currency rate volatility and the projected timeline associated with the proposed transaction. We will continue to break out these items to provide as much transparency as possible. Details on these economic hedges are provided in Note 2 of today's earnings release.","Credit quality and liquidity of the company remained solid with comparable EBIT to interest coverage of 5.6 times and net debt to comparable EBITDA at 2.7 times. The company has enough committed credit and available liquidity at quarter-end to consummate the proposed transaction and provide ongoing liquidity for the company. For a complete summary of third quarter 2015 results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis and details regarding the third quarter, please refer to the Notes section of today's earnings release, which includes a simplified table format summarizing business consolidation activities.","Now moving to operations, our metal beverage Americas and Asia segment comparable operating earnings for the third quarter 2015 were down just slightly year-over-year, mainly due to unfavorable pricing and slightly lower volumes in China and some project start-up costs in North America. Brazil volumes bounced back in the third quarter, up double digits versus an easy comp last year. And North American volumes were off just a bit versus the industry being up roughly 1% in the quarter.","Progress continues on our Monterrey, Mexico plant, which will start up in early 2016. It appears our cost optimization initiatives in China cannot keep up with the further price erosion in that region. Much great work has been done by colleagues across the segment to support the cost out initiatives taken so far in China. And we will continue to monitor closely the situation, as well as the political situation in Brazil. However to-date, Brazilian can demand has remained strong. And we're off to a good start to their seasonal summer. European beverage comparable earnings were down around $3 million in the third quarter. And on a constant currency basis, they were up year-over-year. Mid-single-digit volume growth and a slight benefit from aluminum premiums in the quarter were almost enough to offset the negative translation impact.","Food and household comparable segment earnings were down in the quarter, as segment volumes declined mid-teens following the customer shift in U.S. food cans. Excluding the customer shift, our food can volumes were up slightly with better pet food and salmon can volumes and upper Midwest vegetables faring well, offset by Midwest tomato yields being lower as the pact came to an end. This segment was also impacted by a couple million dollars of unfavorable earnings translation related to the European portion of the extruded aluminum aerosol business, and a small amount of start-up costs relating to capital projects across the segment.","We continue to ramp up the next generation steel aerosol can manufacturing technology and further grow our global extruded aluminum businesses, which will all contribute to improving segment performance in 2016 and beyond.","In summary, our global packaging businesses are extremely focused on the things that they can control, leveraging prior investments to serve the growing global demand for beverage cans and metal aerosol packaging, as well as preparing for new capital projects to come in online in early 2016. To employees listening in on today's call, thank you for the energy, drive and enthusiasm and working together during what's been a very busy summer.","With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Great. Thanks, Scott. Our aerospace business reported a solid quarter, given the difficult comps they were up against. Contracted backlog held steady, ending the quarter at $638 million. The aerospace team continues to perform well on existing programs and is focused on reducing its cost structure as it anticipates projects being awarded in early 2013 (sic) [2016]. A side comment, I might just mention that the recent budget agreements in Washington, D.C. actually help us and takes away some of the ambiguity that we were facing into.","Now turning to the balance of the year, this message is consistent with prior quarters. It's all about executing on capital projects, generating cash flow, focusing on costs, and reaching completion on the proposed offer for Rexam. Our outlook for the full year has not fundamentally changed since our last update. And while currency translations, start-up and pre-production costs will remain a headwind for the balance of the year, our business remains solid and is on track to generate a significant amount of free cash flow. Together, we are working hard to improve Ball in 2016 and beyond.","Now finally, I would like to acknowledge the contributions of and thank Mike Feldser and the excitement we have for Jim Peterson. As you know, earlier this quarter we announced that Mike would be retiring after leading our food and household product segment for 10 years. His commitment and dedication to our company and to our people are above reproach, and we will miss his drive. However, what we gain in Jim is a high energy leader who grew up in the commercial side of our business and we are very excited to build on many of the initiatives begun to make that segment world class. We wish them both all the best on their new journeys.","And with that, Lena, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for taking my call. Thanks for all the detail. Actually, congratulations both to Jim and Mike, and Mike did a great job after he took over and the food performance is a lot better subsequent to that. I would say my first question is around operations. It sounds like China has maybe taken another step lower. Perhaps it's a mischaracterization, but can you comment in terms of what kind of trend you saw sequentially 3Q versus 2Q?","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Maybe, George, I'll jump in and ask Scott to chime in. I think the good news is the beverage can continues to grow and take share in China. The bad news is the pricing has gotten worse. We have not been putting any capital in China for several years. We don't intend to because we don't believe with new capital you can make returns in it. So we are weathering the storm. We're battening down the hatches. We're taking out as much cost as possible, just to try and keep up with the price declines. And it's challenging to do that as we sit here right now.","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, I would just echo those comments. And that's why our volume was down just a couple of points, George, because we're not putting in additional capacity. So, it's a tough environment, and it continues to be tough. And I think the outlook is challenging.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Recognizing that this is always going to be the case in any quarter, any year, are you suggesting that there is maybe increased chance of capacity reduction? Because it sounds like you're having difficulty keeping up with the price compression through your own productivity.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well in terms of our own business, we're currently not contemplating that now. The real issue is there's too much over-capacity in the industry. And our industry is not alone in that. But the question is, with outside of our walls, will the market grow into the existing capacity? Will new capacity stop coming on stream? And could existing capacity be taken offline by other people? Those are the three things that we're paying close attention to.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, recognizing that you're sold out, there aren't higher cost operations that in theory, if you weren't running them, wouldn't help the P&L sufficiently? That's what I'm hearing.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Correct.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. A couple of quick ones and I'll turn it over and try to come back in queue. You mentioned Monterrey being on track. Can you just remind us? Do you have a contract in place for that facility? And I think you said first quarter, but could you affirm when you expect to start producing commercially there?","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Operations guys are never the one to get nailed down on it. We expect to be making cans starting up the line early in the first quarter and being producing commercial cans certainly by the end of the first quarter. When I say commercial cans, cans for sale. It might be a little quicker than that, but that's the plan we have currently on the table. It is secured by a long term agreement.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thanks for that. And then you mentioned EBIT was up in Europe, excluding foreign exchange. So, we appreciate that color, but is there any way to put a finer point on how much Europe would have been up ex the foreign exchange? Thanks guys. I'll turn it over.","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well think about the currency effect I mentioned was $0.07. The vast majority of that's in the beverage business. There is a little bit in the food and household business, but the majority of that's in the beverage business.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you, Scott.","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, George.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","In food and household, you referenced positive volume trends with pet food in the Midwest. I'm just wondering, ex the large customer loss last year, are you seeing stability in the North American customer base? And in terms of your asset footprint in North America, are you comfortable where you are from a food and household perspective?","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Absent the loss of the customer, we are seeing stability. I think we talked last quarter on the conference call about the vast majority of our business tied up in their long-term agreement and the overall market is holding in there. So, again, absent the loss of that customer, yeah we see volumes. In fact we were up just a little bit. But don't go crazy with that. I'm sorry, your second question was?","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Just in terms of the footprint in North America, are you comfortable where you are from a food side going into 2016?","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well, as you know, in light of the loss of the customer, we've actually made some footprint rationalizations relative to head count and other things like that. And we're always looking at trying to optimize it. It's a challenging environment out there. And so while we have nothing currently on the docket in terms of any major restructurings, we're looking at those types of things all the time.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, that's helpful. And then just a couple of questions on Brazil, first, is there anything that motivated the timing of the acquisition of the remainder of the Latapack stake? And then when you look at Brazil into next year, the country is in a deep recession. Do you expect volumes next year to be positive in Brazil, given can continues to gain share, or what are your thoughts about can demand given current market conditions in Brazil?","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well first with respect to your question about the timing of this, I don't think there was anything specific. Yes, we are in the midst of a regulatory approval and I can't go into that. But we've had a very good relationship with our partners for a very long time. And as the world has changed and as Ball has changed and as they have changed, it was just the right opportunity. We're quite excited about what our partners \u2013 that they have a conviction in the future of Ball. It does allow us to streamline some of the decision making. And I think really said another way, what they're not doing is our partners are not exiting Brazil. They're not exiting Ball. They're not exiting the beverage can. Rather, they're taking a broader perspective in the investment for the betterment of all. And so I think that's good.","Getting to the volume side, as we go into 2016, the first half of 2015 was quite soft. And so, I think the comps are relatively easy. Scott had mentioned our third quarter volumes were strong. The overall industry was up 11% and we were up a bit more than that. As we start into the fourth quarter, we see the similar trends continuing so that's all good news. You're absolutely right that the Brazilian economy and the Brazilian political environment is a challenging one right now. I do know that less beer and less soft drinks are being consumed. But given that beer can growth continues, I think that's a good example of this constant theme we've been talking about of cans taking share in the packaging mix.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, that's helpful. And when you refer to political challenges in Brazil, are you speaking specifically around taxes on beverage or maybe a more difficult tax environment for Ball, or what are the risks from a political perspective in Brazil?","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. I was just specifically talking about the potential impeachment of the President and what that means in terms of a change of a guard around the political side of that, and ultimately what it means. We have no point of view on it. But anytime you have an unstable government, it's usually not healthy.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it, got it. I'll turn it over.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Langton with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Good morning. Thanks.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Just following up on sort of the Latapack deal, I guess recognizing that you've seen a lot of your earnings variability over the two years, just given the effects of the World Cup, I guess could you talk a little bit about \u2013 I mean, I guess do you see this deal still hitting sort of the target level of returns that you look for that 9% threshold, and any kind of thoughts on sort of like a run rate level of earnings, if earnings can rebound from sort of the recent volatility? Just any details there?","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. I would say on the earnings volatility, it's been a pretty good, consistent long-term increase in the earnings in that business. The business has done real well. It does get a little bumpier quarter-to-quarter and it is a more seasonal business. But the overall long-term trajectory of that business has been very solid. We don't see that necessarily changing. I don't think we need much in the way of capital down there. And in terms of returns, this does meet our typical hurdles that we always look at in terms of we want to earn 9% after tax within three years, and this will do that.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Okay, great. And then just in Europe, could you quantify, Scott, the impact of the metal premium this quarter and then sort of if premiums to stay where they are, what that benefit could be in the fourth quarter and then looking out to 2016?","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. It was a $0.03 positive impact in the third quarter. It should be a little bit more than that in the fourth quarter. And then we'll still get benefit in the first half of next year.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. And then just final question for North America bev can, I think you mentioned your rates of growth were a little bit less than the industry. Could you just talk about how you're growing in beer and CSD and is that the lower growth rate, is that just sort of temporary customers sort of issues? Any detail there would be great.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. It is customer issues. On the soft drink, we were actually a little bit better than the market on the soft drink side. We're a little bit worse than the market on the beer side. And all of our differential relative to beer had to do with one of our customers taking more of the business in-house.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Fantastic. Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Philip Ng with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Hey. A quick question for Scott. To achieve your $550 million free cash flow target, at least based on our math, it's going to take $200 million plus of working capital benefit. So where are you finding some of those opportunities? And as a early read through for next year, can you help us kind of frame what are some of the major levers for free cash flow in 2016?","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well, I'm just going to comment on 2015. I'm not sure about your math because I have a working capital benefit this year a little bit less than last year's benefit. We have a lot of charges coming through non-cash charges that maybe you're not accounting for correctly. Maybe we can take it offline. But...","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay...","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","But we had a big pension benefit as well. So I don't know if you're including that. That's part of the cash flow. In terms of looking at next year, every year, we're constantly looking at our working capital, whether it's receivables, inventory payables, and figuring out what we can do better, where we can be more efficient. So it's too early to talk about next year. But rest assured, being an EVA company, we're always focused on that.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess Europe, you guys called out a hit from some out-of-pattern freight. Do you expect that to dissipate in the coming quarters, especially with Oss ramping up a little more fully? And then are you at a point where you need to add some capacity in Europe? And did you see some pricing? Just the market seems fairly tight at this point.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. It's \u2013 getting back, we \u2013 remember, it is more seasonal in Europe than \u2013 the second quarter and third quarter, certainly, than even some other parts of the world. And we were just getting the Oss line up and running. And so as a result of that, right at the peak, we didn't have full capacity. So it did create out-of-pattern shipping. I say that because as we go forward, we expect that to become less as time goes on. You are right, the market is still tight. It remains tight. It's growing nicely. And as a result, we have to think of it longer term about if we need to add additional capacity into that. No final decisions have been made, but we're certainly thinking about that.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And just one last one for me; can you kind of help remind us what are some of the dates that we need to be mindful of in terms of the regulatory agencies as it relates to Rexam? And what are some of the \u2013 what's the process in some of the next steps you guys are taking going forward? Thanks.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Maybe what I would ask is to take that offline and give our Head of Investor Relations, Ann Scott a call because every jurisdiction is a bit different. And I wouldn't want to confuse people by misstating something here.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay...","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's all in the various documents that she can guide you to.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay. That's helpful.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, John. Good morning, Scott.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Morning.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","I wondered, could you give us some sense of kind of what's been pushing up the CapEx number as we move through the year? I think it started the year it was about $400 million, then we were $450 million and now $500 million.","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. Sure. CapEx is always a little bit tricky to predict because you always have plans. And the question is how fast are you actually paying for what you're putting in place? We've got some pretty big projects. John ran through the laundry list of projects. Monterrey is a big project. The next-generation aluminum bottle is a big project. The plant build in Myanmar, the impact extruded in the UK, the new India plant, the tin plate aerosol in the U.S.","So we have an unusual amount of projects, kind of a higher number of projects than we typically have. And frankly, the faster we can get these things up and running, the better. So I don't look at the CapEx spend as a bad thing. I actually see it as a good thing. And the projects are moving along pretty well. And so, we're actually able to keep pace or even a little bit better pace than where we thought we would be. So that's why it's gone up. It's the same projects; it's nothing new.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Exactly. I think said another way, it's some of the carryover that we thought would be going into 2016 will probably be spent in 2015 because, as we said, we're making good progress on many of these.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah. Okay. So it's not like you've really had any big budget overruns on any of these projects contributing to that?","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No. In fact, all of them, the businesses have done a very nice job of managing to budgets. And we generally tend to be on budget and on time or even a little bit ahead of where we thought we would be.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Second question. John, can you talk a little bit about the implications of ABI, SAB and how that might affect you? Seems like particularly in Latin America, they're going to have a lot of market share.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I need to be careful because they're in a regulatory mode, as are we.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Sure.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","They currently have a big market share in South America. So, I just observed that. I probably shouldn't go into it, but a lot of the things I read in the public around the United States, China, even Europe, I wouldn't disagree with anything that I've read so far.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And then the last question I had is, I just wondered coming back to the Ball-Latapack, we can see what you paid for that 39.9%. I wondered if you could help us at all though get a range on what EBITDA down there has been running.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. It's a bit difficult because we don't \u2013 it's buried within one of our segments. I would point you to non-controlling interest on the P&L line, which is their proportionate share of net income that they have to give back.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Right.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And I think there's some other things in the public disclosure that Ann could probably help you with.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. All right. That sounds good. Thanks very much. Good luck in the fourth quarter. Good luck next year.","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.","A couple questions around Mexico. Are you starting both lines up at the same time?","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. There will be about a three-month to five-month delay in the second line coming up relative to the first line.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay.","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","That was planned for.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Just to be clear, that was planned. It wasn't really a delay. That's how we staged the ramp-up.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Got it, Scott. Okay. Then just the actual rate of capacity of each line and the expectation for how many cans you'll make this next year and in 2017.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, let me put it this way. The Mexican can market is growing quite strongly. And we're actually more excited, as we sit here today, about the opportunities ahead of us than we were when we initiated the project. The facility's going to be a state-of-the-art facility that has capability of approaching a couple billion cans.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you, John, for that. And just last ones here on the Mexico side, can you just say how much of the couple of billion is contracted versus open and how much is new can business versus a share shift from glass into cans?","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we feel real good about where we are. And as we said, we make these investments tied to long-term agreements, so I'll stand by those words. There is a lot of growth. The demographics in Mexico are good. The consumption is good in Brazil and the package share shifts are good in Mexico \u2013 excuse me. I mentioned Brazil. I meant Mexico. So you got three forces kind of as tailwinds for us there and the industry.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Got it. Got it. Just two last ones for me, so in North America and the U.S., taking a step back, just look at the CSD and beer trends over the last, call it, six months to nine months, do you think there's been any change in trend? And then just quickly on the food can side in the U.S., given that it's a smaller business, any thoughts around potential exiting the food can to be a lot more focused on aerosol, which is really where the growth fundamentally is?","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. First, I'll answer that question. The answer is no. Recall, we've talked about this in the past that from a tin plate perspective, our food and tinplate aerosol business are commingled from a manufacturing perspective. Every one of our facilities where we make food, we also make aerosol containers as well. And so, we've had some challenges in the food business. No doubt about that. But we actually think we are kind of cycling, starting to see some positive headway in terms of the cost side of the business.","It's not going to rebound quickly. We do continue to face challenges of overcapacity and that. But I do think that when combined from a cost of goods sold perspective with our aerosol container business, it makes sense. Getting to your question about North American trends, what we see over the last six months or nine months or so, I don't think anything really appreciably.","I do think that you're continuing to see a very good strong growth in specialty. I think you're seeing \u2013 actually the beer industry doing a little bit better, particularly on the can side. And I think can continues to take incremental share of the package mix there. I do think CSD is, while it's still declining, it's not declining at the rates it once was, so that's a positive. So, I think all of this paints a picture that it's a bit more constructive today than it was perhaps nine months ago. But we're talking on the margin.","I think a lot of it has to do with the economy. There's a lot of new housing builds. There's a lot of construction workers going into convenience stores, buying their energy drinks. Oil, the price of gasoline is cheaper which puts more disposable income in people's pockets. Typically when we see situations like that, we see a little bit more stability in our end markets.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Very helpful, John. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi. This is actually Matt Krueger sitting in for Ghansham. How are you guys doing?","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good. How are you?","Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good. Good. First, can you guys talk about what effects the customer consolidation and anti-trust-driven asset ownership shifts have on your business and the industry as a whole? And then how is Ball positioned to deal with that dynamic moving forward?","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I guess just a couple observations. And again, like I said earlier, I'll be a bit more general than perhaps you'd like. But consolidation in our markets generally isn't new. Our customers have been consolidating. Our suppliers have been consolidating. Our competitors have been consolidating. And we too have played a part in that consolidation. I do think in today's world, it's important to \u2013 where there's not as much growth around the world than there has been, I think people are looking for efficiency savings and the ability to pass those on to the end-user at the end of the day. And I think a lot of this consolidation is driven by that. So outside of that, this is a world that we've been living in for probably the past 20 years, if not, longer than that.","Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then earlier, you mentioned one of your North American beer customers taking capacity in-house. Is this a dynamic that you guys expect could continue moving forward in the industry, especially as consolidation accelerates?","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think this is a unique situation. But I do think that as maybe some third-party customers of that entity continue to be soft, they try and incrementally fill that in. So it's not a necessarily new phenomenon, nor one that's surprising to us.","Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. And then one last question. Can you guys provide any detail on intra-quarter trends by region? Anything that stood out.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Intra-quarter, you mean...","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Like full quarter trends year-over-year?","Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yes, just kind of things developed throughout the quarter. Did anything change meaningfully from the beginning to the end and kind of into October?","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Oh, I see what you're seeing. Well, we mentioned Brazil was \u2013 we've seen decent growth in Brazil when people were expecting it. And sequentially, quarter-over-quarter we saw through this year Brazil getting stronger, and it continues to. Again, some of it's off of weak comps of last year. Some of it's their entering the summer. I think over in Europe, I think as the year has gone on, I think you've seen some strength. I do think that we're entering into a seasonally slow fourth quarter. And so it's always difficult to make predictions around that. But I don't think in Europe or North America, we've seen any appreciable deviations from any trends.","Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. That's it for me. Thanks.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yes. Good morning.","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","The first one has to do with the composition or the changing composition of the standard beverage can in North America, or beverage cans in general. Could you talk a little bit about how much share you have seen the craft beer sector get, at least versus glass and other substrates? Do you have any updated data on that? And where do your customers see that going? And then secondly, within CSC, is \u2013 are water becoming a meaningful proportion? And I sense that you're underrepresented there. And are there moves to address that?","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Maybe I'll take a stab and Scott can chime in here. First on the craft market, we're very bullish and very excited about what's going on in the craft market. I don't, off the top of my head, have all the exact data points that you're looking for. But craft continues to be the fastest growing category of the beer in North America. The can as a share of the package mix continues to increase. It's in the mid-single \u2013 excuse me, mid-teens.","And as we talked about in past, that's up from virtually nothing a while back. It is a more complicated business because the run sizes are a bit smaller than others. But we've spent a lot of time, effort and energy helping to support and helping to grow the craft market, and we are committed to that. I think it's a great longer term opportunity for us. And we're going to continue to try to do the most we can because any time you have a category that's winning and you have a container that's underrepresented, it provides opportunity. So that's the way we look at that.","With respect to \u2013 I think you mentioned water. And it's an excellent question. We have, as Ball, been really focused on sparkling water, in particular. Water, we are \u2013 the can is underrepresented. On the still side of the market, candidly it's quite challenging just because the price points of that water and PET, it's \u2013 PET has become so thin it's almost like you're buying water out of a bag these days. And it's difficult for the can compete into that. And furthermore, when the consumer thinks about the can, they think about carbonation. They don't necessarily think about still. And so, our focus has been on the sparkling water category, and we've had some wins in that.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. Got you. And then I think I noticed on the release today that there was a very large, I think, hedging loss. And I think that was tied to financing for Rexam. I didn't notice the UK pound moving that dramatically in the third quarter. Could you just talk a little bit about what gave rise to that?","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. It's mostly currency and some interest. We're hedging about \u00a32.3 billion of the purchase price that we have to pay in sterling. So you don't need big changes in rates to have a meaningful impact on the GAAP earnings. So, it's really the hedges we put in place right after the transaction and the movement of the currency over \u2013 in the first quarter \u2013 or second quarter, we had a big gain, if you recall, and then in the third quarter, had a big loss. So that was the volatility I was talking about in terms of impacting our GAAP earnings.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Gotcha. And last question. You've been good to give us the details of the several projects, or the numerous projects you all have going on around the world in the legacy Ball. Assuming things go as planned with the closing of Rexam, would we expect to see a material slowdown with the expansion, I guess, in terms of thinking of the legacy Ball business? Or would we see that continue?","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think the best way to think about it is bandwidth. And as we've moved to close with Rexam, we want to make sure that it's a seamless and flawless day one and day 100 for our customers. And we're going to be really focusing on the execution and delivering on the commitments we set out for ourselves, our investors, our customers, et cetera.","To the extent that there are capital investments that are good growth opportunities that meet our return objectives, we'll certainly consider that because remember, this acquisition is as much about trying to create an environment where we help the can be as sustainable as possible and leveraging the footprint of the combined entities so that we can service our customers even better. So, if there's opportunities that fit within that window, we'd certainly look at them. But I do think if you said you have to prioritize, our prioritization is going to be on the execution of flawless day one, flawless day 100 and flawless day 1,000.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","I see. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we have a follow-up question coming from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, everyone. Couple questions on the new projects. If you can comment at all in terms of the next-gen aluminum bottle, what's unique to it? When do you think we'd start seeing it to a larger degree in the market? And then similarly, on the new tinplate aerosol technology, if you're at a position right now to comment at all in terms of what's new, what it does for the customer, what it does for you in terms of process supply chain, et cetera.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well, both of these are new technologies. They both have significant lightweight opportunities relative to the current out there. And even on the aluminum, it's \u2013 we would have the ability to shape it. And so where we are right now is, both of those are coming out of a startup curve. But there is a whole supply chain filling that needs to occur. I think as time goes on and we're sitting here at the end of October, I think over the \u2013 in the fourth quarter, you'll start to see more and more of each of these. And then, I really think as you go into 2016 is really where you'll start to see the difference.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And, John, if I could, and I appreciate the details that you already relayed. On aerosol, what end markets would we possibly see this in?","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it's an aerosol container.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Tinplate aerosol container. So think that. And we've been able to lightweight it, while maintaining the rigidity characteristics for allowing it to hold high pressure.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So you're saying we'd see it pretty much in everything from WD-40 to spray paints to starches to bug spray. So it's basically the whole waterfront.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, it has that capability. I'd rather, at this time, not get into the specific customer-by-customer. But you're thinking about it correctly.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. I appreciate that. In terms of the Aerospace backlog, it's been holding steady. Obviously developments in Washington have been out of your control. Is your sense that where there has been an opportunity to gauge your progress that you are at least maintaining market share on awards that have been made? And if you could give a little bit more color on the recent agreement, why that helps you out in Aerospace? You mentioned that takes away some uncertainties. If you can give a little bit more color in terms of how that uncertainty was impeding your progress there, or at least your customers' willingness to commit.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think most Americans don't realize that if we had not gotten a budget deal that the sequestering would have gotten worse, not better, and it would've reduced defense budgets, not maintained or even increased them slightly. And that's what this proposed new budget deal is, is a slight increase into that. We haven't had a budget for I don't know how many years. And so we've been working under continuing resolutions for so long, which is kind of just status quo. This allows our government officials to mix and match a little bit more.","And as I said on prior calls, we have more proposals in with our customers than I've ever seen at Ball Aerospace. And if we didn't have a budget deal that would've put some of those at risk. And so that's why we feel pretty good about where we are. These, as you know, George, because this business is \u2013 it's a portfolio of you either win or you either lose.","And so on a probability basis, we have to factor in these things. And so we look at it from a portfolio perspective. We have candidly not one, one or two things this year that we are hoping to, but not expecting to necessarily. But as we get more of these individual discrete programs awarded, I think the portfolio broadens out, and we fully expect to win our fair share of that portfolio.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. I'll circle back maybe a little bit later on on end markets here as well. But last question and I'll turn it over. Start-up costs, Metal Food, did you call that out? I know you mentioned it in the press release. But if you mentioned the dollar amount, I missed it.","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","More of the start-up costs were on the beverage side, but there was $1 million or $2 million of start-up on the food side as well.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Thank you. And we have a follow-up question coming from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah. Just a couple of follow-ups and both related to questions George just had there. One, in the release you mentioned the stabilization in backlogs in Aerospace. John, can you give us a little more color on why you're confident that that's taking place?","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it's stabilized because we had some big programs remember in 2014 that had rolled off and we completed. And that started a kind of a decline. I do think it's kind of leveled off and it's kind of at a steady state. And as I said, we have so many different programs that we're bidding on right now, I just don't want to \u2013 it's difficult to be tied down to the exact timing of not only when you're awarded them, but then when you sign the contract. But we expect the next, call it, three months to six months to be a very busy time around the bids and proposals we have outstanding with our Aerospace business.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah. Did you say that you'd either won a couple recently or that you hadn't won a couple recently?","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. We had not won a couple recently.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah. Okay. And then the other question I had is just when you think about sort of all these projects across Ball, is there any way to size sort of what the headwind from start-up costs is across all those businesses in 2015 and 2016?","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think we've been calling it out each quarter in 2015. So start-up in the quarter was $0.04, and for the year it's about $0.09.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay.","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","For 2015.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah. And would you want to make any stab at what that might look like next year, Scott?","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, it should come down. I mean I think there'll be a little bit of ramp up in the first quarter as Mexico comes online and Myanmar comes online. We're bearing some of those costs today. So, you're hiring people and training them at other plants. But as we move through next year, those costs should come down.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. That's good. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And we have a question from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, gentlemen.","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I have just actually one question. Most of mine have been asked already. As you're now eight months or so into the process of bringing together Ball and Rexam, you've I think previously said that, and even in your release cited first half 2016 as approximate time still for closing, so two questions related. One, perhaps now that you're this far down the path, do you have a better sense of when closing could be? Could it be more first quarter, second quarter, or potentially slip to later in the year?","And then second piece of the question is, you'd established a cap, I believe, of I think it was $1.58 billion at the time. As you now are pretty far down the path, again, with agencies and folks in three different continents, do you have a sense as to perhaps would you be higher or lower, or how that might be progressing as well? And any thoughts with respect to timing of potential divestitures, if there are any?","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I appreciate all those questions and I'd love to answer them. But quite honestly, and given UK takeover code, it's premature to update any of our guidance. And at the time that we think it makes sense to do so, we will do so. I know that's not the answer you want to hear, but that's the truth.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","No problem. I understand. The last question I had for Scott was, and I know you've been asked this a couple of different ways. A lot of the projects that you've undertaken, and you moved CapEx up a number of times, I think as someone else had noted. These sound like they're move ups as opposed to new projects being brought on stream. So, as we kind of think about 2016, would it be unreasonable to assume that you don't have a big slew of new product announcements or new \u2013 I'm sorry, new capacity announcements that you've had this year that CapEx shouldn't be appreciably lower?","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well, first, I would say that the changes to the CapEx, we increased it by $50 million in the last quarter and $50 million in this quarter. It has more to do with the timing of the spend than the totality of the spend. The totality is not any different. There's more pull forward from 2016 into 2015 because these projects are moving along at a pretty good clip. And so when you have the number of projects that we have and the size of the projects we have, you're always hoping they will go well. And frankly, they've gone pretty well. So the spend, we're getting the opportunity to get these things up and running a little bit quicker. Those are the projects we have on the table right now. We haven't announced anything different or beyond that in 2016. So it's premature to comment on 2016. But we're spending a heck of a lot of capital this year. I would expect that to come down somewhat next year.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Last question coming back to aluminum premium and I think you did detail what it was for the quarter and the plusses and minuses for the year. But could you just remind us cumulatively the last few years, what's your behind? And any change to the thought process that \u2013 I mean you haven't changed the number of your contracts yet, I don't believe. Help us triangulate around or make our guesses as to what the benefit might be in 2016.","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well, in 2014, it cost us about \u20ac13 million. In 2015, we've kind of detailed out each quarter. For the year it's a negative $0.06. For the quarter it was a positive $0.03. I said in the fourth quarter it'll be a little bit more positive than that and then we'll have more benefit in the first half of next year.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Do you remember what it was in 2013, by chance, as well? I think you were still behind coming out of 2012 and into 2013, if memory serves.","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","\u20ac8 million to \u20ac9 million.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful.","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Okay.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you, gentlemen. Good luck.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we do have a follow-up question coming from the line of George Staphos of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, everyone. One quick one on Aerospace; to the extent that you can, and recognizing perhaps you can't just because of the confidentiality on some of these arrangements, your backlog and some of the projects you hope to win, maybe saying it differently. Which areas of specialty or value add will we see the show up in relative to what Ball does well? I didn't phrase that well, but you know what I mean. So is it more DoD? Is it more vision systems? Is it more deep space explorations? Or any way to categorize where you're seeing more of the interest in what you do in Aerospace? Thanks, guys. And good luck on the quarter.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, George. It's an excellent question, and in some ways it's across the board. I mean when you think about our Aerospace business, we have a services business which is really a \u2013 sometimes the backlog \u2013 there really isn't that much of a backlog because it's an IDIQ type of arrangement. But that business has been growing. And the backlog visibility in that is kind of a close to a 12-month cycle than a three-year or four-year cycle.","On the NASA, NASA's been declining as an industry. The U.S. government hasn't been funding it to a level. We see some longer term opportunity. But that's probably not a lot in terms of what we see in the near term. Really the near term gets around the DoD and whether it's in our Satellite business or in what we call our Tactical Services business, which has everything from the cameras to antenna work. And we see big builds on the horizon for some of those types of things and that's where the opportunities are coming from.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you, John.","John A.

Welcome to the Ball Corporation's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, the call is being recorded Thursday, October 24, 2013.","I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please proceed.","John A. Hayes","Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's third quarter 2013 results.","The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings, as well as company news releases. If you do not already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website.","It was great seeing many of you in New York earlier this month at our investor field trip. We hope that you walked away with a better sense of who we are and more importantly, where we're going. A special thanks to Ann Scott for organizing a great event.","Now joining me on the call this morning is Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'll provide a brief overview of our company's performance, Scott will discuss financial and global packaging metrics, and then I'll finish it up with comments out of our aerospace business and the outlook for the remainder of 2013.","Our third quarter results came in ahead of expectations, excluding the impact of a provision for customer receivable, which Scott will speak to in a moment. Solid operating performance across our various business units, a strong year-over-year vegetable pack in North America and a normalization of volumes in our global beverage business, where volumes were up across all regions, save for the previously announced loss of some 12-ounce business in North America, all contributed to stronger performance as we expected.","As we have discussed previously, we knew that we had headwinds entering 2013. And while those headwinds in the first half of the year were quite frankly stronger than anticipated, the hard work and effort by all here at Ball have positioned us for a more constructive second half of 2013 and has created some tailwind for us as we enter 2014. As we cycle into the fourth quarter and more importantly into '14, the company is well positioned from a capacity utilization, product mix and earnings and cash generation perspective.","During the quarter, we continue to aggressively manage manufacturing output for 12-ounce capacity in North America with the rationalization of our 12-ounce capacity in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. We also improved our fixed cost leverage in our European segment, as we progress through the initial cost-out initiatives related to the headcount reductions and the announced closure of our Ratingen, Germany administrative office relocation.","In Brazil, we've completed the installation of a second line in our Alagoinhas beverage can manufacturing plant, which sets us up nicely for a double summer, as we prepare to meet our customers' needs in the summer down here in Brazil in 2014, as well as the 2014 World Cup.","In Asia, we optimized our footprint and improved our cost structure there with the relocation of our Shenzhen beverage can plant into our existing Foshan plant. We also completed the installation of another production line in our Mexican impact-extruded facility, and we expect continued growth in this region during 2014.","Lastly, in the quarter, we've completed the conversion of the standard can line to specialty can production in North America. We are seeing the benefits of our renewed efforts to manage our cost structure and drive further EVA dollar growth. In fact, since 2010, we've improved our EVA dollars generated, as defined in our 10-K, from $110 million to more than approximately $160 million today.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott for a review of our third quarter numbers. Scott?","Scott C. Morrison","Thanks, John. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the third quarter were $1 versus last year's $0.90. In addition, the company recorded an after-tax charge totaling approximately $32 million, primarily related to a provision for our customer receivable. Due to the confidential nature of the customer situation, we are unable to talk about it in great detail here, but will provide more details in the 10-Q.","Our metal beverage Americas and Asia segment comparable earnings were down roughly $7 million year-over-year. Cost containment program, excellent operating performance at the plant level and double-digit specialty can growth in the Americas nearly offset segment volumes being down mid-single digits in the quarter due to a loss of the 12-ounce business in North America that has been well documented.","Brazil volumes were up strongly, again, year-over-year and our China volumes were up mid-single digits. Across the segment, we are running at high-asset utilization rates and the recently installed second line at our Alagoinhas, Brazil facility is online and ramping up to meet our customer's new brewery located just down the road.","European segment profit increased in the quarter in the mid-upper-single digit volume growth brought about by better weather conditions, coupled with reduced labor and input cost, both of which continue to be addressed aggressively. In the food and household segment, earnings were higher due to better volumes, our recently acquired Mexico plant and good performance in our steel and aluminum aerosol business.","Segment volume increased nearly 10% in the quarter as a result of the favorable North American seasonal fruit and vegetable pack and solid aerosol container demand.","Transitioning from operations, during the quarter, our corporate undistributed cost and the effective tax rate were in line with expectations and year-to-date. We have repurchased of net $268 million of our stock. Net balance sheet debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $3.35 billion. Credit quality and liquidity of the company remains solid with comparable EBIT-to-interest coverage at 4.7x, and net debt to comparable EBITDA at 2.9x.","Committed credit and available liquidity at the end of the quarter was an excess of $1 billion. Given our seasonality and strong free cash flow, we continue to anticipate year-end net debt level to be in the range of $3.2 billion. For a complete summary of the third quarter results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, please refer to the notes section of today's earnings release.","Moving on to financial metrics for the full year 2013, really, no changes here. Interest expense will be in the range of $183 million, the full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings is expected to be approximately 27%. We're still anticipating full year corporate expense to be approximately $73 million. CapEx will come in, in the range of $400 million and free cash flow should be in the range of $450 million. And the majority of our free cash flow is expected to be returned to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends.","With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.","John A. Hayes","Thanks, Scott. Our aerospace business continued to perform well in the quarter with solid execution on existing programs. During this quarter, the Ball-built WISE spacecraft was roused from a 2-year hibernation to resume its near-Earth asteroid hunting mission. We also delivered the STPSat-3 satellite for the U.S. Air Force Operationally Responsive Space-3 mission, and contracted backlog at the quarter end was $942 million, down just slightly from the previous quarter. Despite lingering effects of sequestration and the recent U.S. government shutdown, we continue to see operationally -- opportunities, excuse me, both domestically and internationally to help grow our aerospace business.","Now looking out across our company today. Our businesses are leveraging new processes and systems, our world-class employee base and their EVA mindset to drive cost-out initiatives and execution on key programs and projects. We have invested prudently in our businesses for incremental EVA dollar growth, whether it has been specialty growth in North America, geographic growth in Latin and South America or cost-out initiatives in Europe and Asia, which we expect to generate positive returns in 2014 and beyond.","In Europe beverage, we are on track to get back to our operating margins consistent with the 2010, 2011 period by 2015. And in our global food and household products packaging business, we are ramping up aluminum aerosol production and focusing on maximizing the returns across our steel product lines.","In summary, we expect continued strong free cash flow and full year 2013 comparable results to exceed full year 2012 comparable diluted earnings per share. Given our operational momentum and reduced future CapEx target, we expect 2014 to be more consistent with our historical earnings per share growth goal of 10% to 15%, and higher free cash flow generation.","And with that, James, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Philip Gresh from JP Morgan Asset Management.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question for you, it sounds like the volumes are pretty good in Europe. I was bouncing between calls, but I think you said up mid- to high-single digits. I would just to get a little bit more color, just kind of regionally or by country or whatever additional color you could give about your volume performance.","John A. Hayes","Certainly. As you know, I think on our second quarter call we said -- we started to see at the beginning of July some more normalized weather patterns, and the good weather led to an increase in fillings in Europe. For us, I think it was largely driven by the Benelux region, by France, by U.K. even Poland, and to a lesser extent, Germany. And so those, as you all know, is the sweet spot of where we operate. So I think we were just the beneficiaries of much more normalized weather. And as we said, across Europe, for us, it was mid- to upper-single digit, kind of 7 percent-ish range.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. Okay. Second question on Europe, there has been so much out around this aluminum premiums issue. I'm just wondering if you think about like the past few years and the run-ups in those premiums, do you have any sense that you could give us about -- or quantification you could give us as to just how much of a headwind that's been for you over time?","Scott C. Morrison","Sure. Phil, this is Scott. Last year, it cost us probably around EUR 4 million. It started to ramp up in the back half of the year last year. This year, kind of a full year, it's probably going to be closer to EUR 8 million or EUR 9 million. They've just started to moderate recently. But with inventories, you know we have to flush inventories through the system, we really didn't get any benefit of that yet. But that's kind of the magnitude of the cost that's hit us in the past year -- 1.5 years.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. That's very helpful. And then just last question, curious how you're feeling about China today. Where are we kind of on the supply\/demand curve heading into 2014? How are you thinking about pricing for next year? It seems like maybe flat to down at best, but I just want to get your thoughts here.","John A. Hayes","Yes. I think you're spot on. Not much has changed from our point of view about China. And what I mean by that is, number one, we are -- do continue to see strong growth in volumes. Number two, there still is a fair amount of excess capacity. I think either some of the players have slowed down some of their growth plans, but others have continued on. And so from a pricing perspective, it's not getting any better as we sit here today. I don't think it's getting materially worse, but it's certainly not getting better. And so until some of this capacity is better utilized with growth in the market, I think our expectation is that we're not going to have much upward mobility in pricing.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of George Staphos from Merrill Lynch.","Alaxandar Wang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It's actually Alax Wang sitting in for George. First, can you discuss maybe what the pace of delayering in Europe and how that's going for you guys?","John A. Hayes","I'm sorry, you said the pace of what in Europe?","Alaxandar Wang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Delayering?","Scott C. Morrison","Delayering?","John A. Hayes","Delayering? Well, if you're talking about the pace of our cost, I think there's really -- we're just continuing to move down that continuum of taking cost out. We said on the second quarter it's going to take some time because you have to have the various discussions with work [ph] councils and unions. And we announced the closure of our Ratingen, Germany administration facility, but that won't close until the first quarter or so of 2014. And so while we've been taking some short-term measures to take cost out, and our guys have been doing -- our folks have been doing a great job of that, this is more of an 18-month type of play. And as we said, it's really the second half of 2014 and going into 2015 when we really will start to see the benefits of that.","Alaxandar Wang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. In terms of the timing wise, everything is to your expectations at present?","John A. Hayes","We are on track.","Alaxandar Wang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just second question. Can you discuss what you're seeing or maybe hearing from customers about marketing programs and trends in North America beverage, particularly in CSD?","John A. Hayes","Yes. We did see some -- particularly around the Labor Day weekend, we did see some greater than recent normal promotional activity by the soft drink customers, as well as some even some of the beer customers. There have been, I think, both on the beer and the CSD side, they continue to focus on the revenue line. But I also -- we also see that they are much more constructive about the volume relative to the price increases. And their price increases, I think, have been a little bit more moderate over the past few months as they go into 2014. I do know, in both of those segments, new products are very important. I think the biggest question on the soft drink side is not how cans are doing, but rather why are consumers drinking less CSD and what are they drinking instead? And I think the soft drink companies are very focused on that, whether it's natural, low-calorie sweeteners or new products that help respond to that new channel opportunities. So I think we are seeing a slightly more constructive end market. But having said that, it's still is -- the growth is anemic at best. And we need to -- if there's one thing that we are focused on, particularly on the soft drink side, I'm less concerned about beer, but we're very much focused on trying to make sure that we understand what's going on from the soft drink perspective.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chris Manuel from Wells Fargo.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions for you. First, could you -- as we think about what the free cash flow might look like next year and parts of working capital -- I'm sorry, CapEx heading into next year, where are you at, early thinking with respect to those and any big projects or things that may spill over into next year?","Scott C. Morrison","Well, we had -- Chris, this is Scott. We had about $100 million of carrying capital this year, so I would expect -- we're spending in a pretty decent clip this year and so I would expect to have less carryover capital into 2014. So I think capital will come down. There's still some growth projects that we're evaluating that would be in that number. But I think, overall, CapEx should start to trend down and free cash flow will trend up. We have some more things on the working capital front that we think will benefit us next year. And so we feel pretty good about the growth in the free cash flow for 2014.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. So when you think about weak metal in a different way, when you think about utilization levels globally and you put in a bunch of capacity in China, you've got -- some still going in, in Brazil, as you have those now all fully contributing or I guess the plants down in Brazil is still ramping up and coming together. But where do you think you'll be at utilization? Do you have pockets where -- including, I guess, Vietnam, and there too you did some work there, where do you think you'll end up being for utilization? Are you running -- going to be running tight over the next year or 2, that those would be areas you might be looking at for capacity? How would we kind of think about where you'd be targeting?","John A. Hayes","Yes. I think, across the board in every region in which we participate, we're running pretty tight relative to capacity. Certainly, with the closure of Milwaukee, that was -- and you all know that we've been very assertive in managing our supply and demand there. That really depends on what the market or growth, or lack thereof, occurs in 2014. But we're tight, as we speak, in North America and Europe, we're very tight. And I do think that over the next 18 months, our #1 priority is the cost-out. But as we start to think about going into 2015, we have to think about capacity because we are getting very tight there. China, we really haven't added all that much capacity. We've moved the facility from Shenzhen up into Foshan, but that wasn't necessarily net-net any significant increase in capacity. So we're running very tight there. You mentioned Vietnam, I think all of Southeast Asia, I think there's probably some more opportunity, but we're going to be balanced around that. And then in Brazil, as you rightly pointed out, the second line in Alagoinhas is just getting started up. So I don't see any new capacity going into Brazil. I think some of the growth projects Scott were talking about, we haven't finalized them right now, but it's looking at geography and it's looking at new products. I think those are the 2 big areas when you think about where it could come from.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Last question was when I looked at some of the language in your press release, you talked about investing in the extruded aluminum, are you referring to what you're doing down in Latin America or are there thoughts for additional potential lines either in North America or Europe there?","John A. Hayes","No. I think our intent was -- that was talking about Latin America. Mexico, specifically.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Usha Guntupalli from Goldman Sachs.","Usha Chundru Guntupalli - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A quick question. First, could you provide any early read on fourth quarter volumes across regions?","John A. Hayes","I think it's premature to talk about fourth quarter volumes. I will say the weather continues to moderate and we haven't seen any meaningful deviations from the trend lines we saw in the July, August, September. But as you know, the fourth quarter is seasonally slow. The only deviation I'll point out from that is probably in the food can business, where we thought a quarter ago that we would get some -- it would pushed -- some of the opportunity would be pushed into the fourth quarter, which it doesn't look like it will. You also -- we had a very strong fourth quarter in that segment in the third quarter. And so I think, while we thought some of that maybe pushed to the fourth, I think it stayed in the third. But absent that, the volume trends are -- particularly in the beverage side I was referring to, is nothing inconsistent with what we'd expect.","Usha Chundru Guntupalli - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And looking at the next 12 to 18 months, could you remind us about the major cost savings that you expect to achieve across segments?","John A. Hayes","Yes. Very quickly, in Europe, we'll start there. We talked about getting back to a more normalized margin structure, which was -- if you look back in the 2010, 2011 time frame, it was 11% to 12%. And we said over the 18 months, we have a clear line of sight and we don't have to rely on net pricing to get there, although we are also focused on net pricing. I think in North America beverage, our folks has done a very good job in managing a difficult situation, not only with the losses in 12-ounce business, but also with the very tough macroeconomic environment relative to the beverage can demand here in North America. And so we continue to take cost out. And I think the Milwaukee, Wisconsin rationalization is a good example of that. I think our food and household products business here in North America, over the next 12 to 18 months, is very much focused on it. As we start to cycle into end of 2015, when we'll have a lost of some business there. But our guys are very -- our folks are very much on top of that. And as we sit here today, I think our folks are up for the challenge, no doubt. Down in Brazil, it's not so much about a cost-out, as it is managing and optimizing the supply\/demand relative to what we expect to be a very strong year next year. Because, as I mentioned, the summer months are really October through March, and then they have the World Cup in June and July. And then in Asia, we have to be low-cost there. And I think we've proven over time that we are low cost and what we're trying to do is widen the gap relative to particularly the local competitors there, because of our global know-how and global expertise. So that's just a quick snapshot of the various levers that we're trying to pull from a cost perspective.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of James Armstrong from Vertical Research Partners.","James Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","My first question is on the food can segment. And I know this is really early days, but could you update us on any progress you've made to offset the volume being lost in 2015?","John A. Hayes","Well, the short answer is nothing material that we can add at this time. We had an Investor Day that was webcast a few weeks ago, if not close to a month ago, and we talked in a slightly more granular way about -- we have half a dozen or so various discrete items that we are focused on from a project perspective, and we expect to begin to execute on those in the fourth quarter. But really, more likely, the first half of 2014. This business remains with us throughout '14, so it's really '15. We've got 15 months or so to manage it. And I think our folks are very much in tune and focused on what needs to be done.","James Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Perfect. And then switching gears. In the aerospace segment, have you seen any major impact from the government shutdown. Also, as sequestration hits the government aerospace contracts with potential for more, could you give us a sense of what you are replacing those contracts with?","John A. Hayes","Yes. First, in term -- we did see -- and we've seen this since sequestration kicked in, in March. We've seen a slowdown in decision-making at the government and with the complete shutdown for what, 16 days or so it was, everything just stopped. And so that's why I inferred our backlog was down slightly, but nothing fundamentally has changed. I think just decision-making is taking a little bit longer. I will say it's a bit frustrating that they just punted just a couple of months, and so we're talking about the January-February time frame having a very similar set of discussion. And that just puts timing of decision-making up in the air as well. So that gives me little bit of concern. But again, as I said, the fundamentals of what we do for the U.S. government has not changed at all, nor has the opportunity set. We have, however, as we've talked in the past, looked at other scenes [ph] of growth and revenues, whether it's internationally or with some more commercial or commercially oriented opportunities. And whether it's a Sentinel program, which is done in a non-for-profit world that's not affiliated with the U.S. government or the GEMS just contract we won in South Korea, I think those are good examples of the types of things we're looking at, and we continue to explore those opportunities. And we do believe that, over time, we're going to win our fair share of those.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Todd Wenning from MorningStar.","Todd Wenning - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","As you look across your various businesses, which segment do you think has the most momentum in terms of EVA dollar generation going into 2014?","John A. Hayes","That's a good question. I think all -- to one degree or another, our European folks have really rallied around the cost-out. And given that, that is in our control, more than anything else, we don't have to rely on weather, we don't have to rely on external demand. We see a clear line of sight there. I think down in Brazil as well. As I mentioned, the 2 summers and -- actually, as we sit here right now, we're actually in Brazil, we've brought our board down here this week and we see a lot of very good momentum. And it's quite clear that a lot of the market share gains of cans relative to glass are not just temporary, they're permanent. And so we're feeling pretty good about Brazil. In North America, it really is a volume game there and so our folks have been doing a great job there. But it's just -- it's too premature to predict what 2014 volumes will look like. And I think the same with China relative to the volumes versus the price mix. So it's really about Europe and Brazil, I think, have the greatest line of sight into EVA dollar generation.","Todd Wenning - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Great. And then as more specialty can capacity is being added by the industry in North America and Europe, have you seen the margins spread between standard and specialty contract in a meaningful way?","John A. Hayes","No, we haven't. Any maturation curve of any new product, you need to expect over time that it will rather gravitate more towards a mean. But I think what we're trying to do is stay out ahead and have the flexibility for our customers. So when we talk about specialty, we're not just talking about one different can size, we're talking about a wide variety. In North America and\/or in Europe, we're making over 20 different sizes in each of those locations. And so it allows us the flexibility to flip between sizes on behalf of our customers, and I think they find there's value there -- in there for them as well.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Joe Stivaletti from Goldman Sachs.","Joseph Stivaletti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was just wondering, from a bigger picture perspective, if you could talk about your appetite for acquisitions, if that's something that you're spending much time on and what areas might be most likely?","John A. Hayes","Well, I think we're always spending a fair amount of time on acquisitions. Many times nothing happens, but that doesn't mean there isn't a lot of activity going on. As we've talked about in the past, it's -- given that we're a very disciplined EVA company, sometimes it's challenging to compete against private equity and other buyers when interest rates are still low and liquidity is still free. And I think we see that right now. As we go forward though, I think there has been great opportunities when we're disciplined and we're tenacious on one hand, but also patient on the other hand to take advantage of situations when they arise, when others are not as aggressive or cannot be aggressive from a financial or operational perspective. So we haven't announced anything, but don't assume we haven't been looking and haven't been actively pursuing opportunities. And as we sit now, liquidity is still relatively free. And so it makes it a bit more challenging for us to compete. But over the long term, we've been able to make a lot of money for our shareholders and for our company by maintaining our discipline.","Joseph Stivaletti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Are there any particular areas, whether it's geographic areas, product-type areas that would be -- that are sort of higher up on the priority list as you consider potential acquisitions?","John A. Hayes","Well, our pipeline, I think, is full of everything. Everything from aerospace -- in January, we made a very small acquisition and that's gone exceedingly well. And so that was more trying to get into a new customer base. On the packaging side, whether it's geographic -- we've talked about the need for consolidation in China, in particular. I think over the longer term, there could be opportunities there. I think there's further rationalization opportunities in some of the more mature markets and mature product lines, and we're focused on those. But the one thing about acquisitions that we've realized is, if you overpay for an acquisition, in our markets, it's always very, very difficult to get it back. And so that's why we've been maintaining a disciplined approach.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ghansham Punjabi from Robert W. Baird.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just kind of judging by your customer comments, whether it's branded or private label, it seems like most of your customers were surprised at the rapid decline in diet soda over the summer, and I guess that's been true for the full year as well. John, can you just sort of touch on how your portfolio is positioned against that trend in terms of how it falls in North American footprint compared to the average, if you will, for diet soda as a function of the category? And also, are you seeing anything comparable in Europe as well in terms of declines in diet soda?","John A. Hayes","No. In fact, let me start with Europe first. No, in fact, the strength -- soft drink was stronger than beer, at large [ph] as an industry and for Ball in Europe during the third quarter. And I do think some of it has to do with market share gains and other things like that. I think here in North America, Ghansham, there are several things going on. The first half, there was some weather issues. There's also has been a pricing versus volume strategy, I think, of the soft drink industry generally speaking. But then it is also a demographic, and people are drinking less sodas and people are drinking less diet sodas. Diet soda is skewed towards the older consumer, and they've been drinking less. And so I think our customers are acutely focused on that from a product formulation perspective, as well as a channel perspective. You're seeing the -- many more different types of SKUs out in the marketplaces, our customers try and find the sweet spot relative to those various demographics. And I -- we expect a fair amount of innovation from a category perspective in 2014 because those customers are very much in tune with the macro trends going on.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of Europe, was there anything unusual for the industry as to why volumes were so strong? Because, again, kind of reverting to -- for example, Heineken, yesterday, they weren't exactly thrilled with the volume profile in Europe. So what drove the strength in Europe for the industry during the third quarter, you think?","John A. Hayes","It's always difficult to tell just in the quarter, but you're absolutely right. I think it has to do with -- the can has been winning relative to other packaging substrates. At the end of the day, we continue to see slow but steady in Europe. Slow but steady improvements in terms of cans as a share of the package mix, and that adds incremental growth to any of the liquid growth. So that's probably the biggest thing that's going on.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from the line of Al Kabili from Macquarie.","Danny Moran","This is Danny Moran in for Al this morning. Just one quick one for me. Did you receive any benefit from lower European metal premiums in the quarter? And can you give us any visibility on any potential tailwinds in '14?","John A. Hayes","No. The premiums just started to moderate in the quarter. And with the inventory that we are running through the system, we saw really, virtually, no benefit of that. It provides some potential upside next year if they keep moderating, but we're not -- we haven't until we bake that in. So no real impact in the third quarter. We're still seeing higher cost than we were a year ago.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Debbie Jones from Deutsche Bank.","Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I was curious, if we could just go back to Europe one more time. I was wondering if there's any specific regions or countries where you're seeing this outsize growth? And then you talked about getting back to 11% to 12% margin in the region by 2014 and '15, but it appears we're already there. So I'm just wondering if this is sustainable in the near term?","John A. Hayes","Yes. First, the answer is, as I mentioned, the volumes were up nicely in the third quarter relative to where our strength is, which is really Germany, Benelux, France and the U.K. I do think some of that was a bounce back because the first half of the year was very tough. And as the summer came, I think there was just the consumer unleashing, if you will, of getting out and taking advantage of the weather. So I wouldn't read into that too much. Overall, as an industry, we're a little bit stronger than our long-term expectations. We've said 2% to 5% growth over the medium to long term in Europe, in part driven by the market share gains I've talked about for cans relative to glass and others. And that was kind of at the upper end. The growth was at the upper end up that, so I wouldn't read too much into it. And then -- I'm sorry, your second question, I forget now.","Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I was just talking about the margin and whether or not that's going to be sustainable in the near term, because I thought that we -- you had discussed at the Investor Day being more of a 2014, '15 event when we got back to 11% to 12% margins in that business.","John A. Hayes","Yes. Well, in the quarter, I know we are above that. But remember, we're a seasonal business, so we look at that on an annualized basis. What really drove the improvement in the third quarter, a little bit of cost out because there are folks who've been getting after that. But as we said, that's a longer-term issue. It was really that we have strong volume. And when you're in a volume-sensitive business, those things help. We had negative volumes in the first half of the year, and I think that hurt. But -- so I wouldn't read into that other than, number one, we are on track of what we said; and number two, these cost-out programs really to hit in a more meaningful way the second half of 2014 and 2015.","Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. I guess my follow-up question is on Brazil. It appears the ramp-up is going as planned, but industry trends appear to be subdued right now. So I'm just trying to understand what gives you confidence that you will actually see a double summer materialize, even with the World Cup coming. Now what are your customers expecting? And I would expect that you guys are -- your volumes should outpace the industry given your new capacity, but I just wanted to get your thoughts on that.","John A. Hayes","Yes, I think in Brazil, everyone, I believe, is very much looking forward to 2014. There's going to be a tremendous amount of promotional activity here. They're expecting millions of visitors, which is going to help. I think, to your point, we do have new capacity coming on. And as you know, this business is chunky, if you will. And when you have new capacity on, you're usually the ones grabbing the incremental growth in the near term. But I think over the long term, our competitors have grabbed some growth in the past when we weren't putting capacity in and they were. So I just think from our product perspective, our customer portfolio perspective, we're in pretty good shape for 2014 in Brazil.","Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And you're happy with your mix of specialty cans in that region?","John A. Hayes","Yes. We definitely are.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citi.","William Mitchell","This is actually William Mitchell filling in for Anthony. Just one quick one for you guys. How much of the volume growth in metal, food and household products was due to the annual food pack?","John A. Hayes","Well, we -- as Scott said, we were upper-single digits on volumes, and the overall market was up about 3%. It's interesting when you look at it, what was strong and what was weak relative to the industry. What was strong was the vegetable pack and pet food. And what was weak was fruit and soups. We do not participate in a large way in the fruit or the soups. And so I think we just benefited from a customer mix that had a strong pack. So what I'd say is all the growth we saw was related to the pack because that's the way the business works.","Operator","There are no further questions from the phone lines at this time.","John A. Hayes","Okay. Well, thank you very much for participating. We look forward to what hopefully is a strong finish to 2013 and a more constructive 2014. And we look forward to talking to you in January.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Thank you."],"2901":["Ball Corporation (NYSE:BLL) Q2 2019 Earnings Conference Call August  1, 2019 11:00 AM ET","Company Participants","John Hayes - CEO","Scott Morrison - SVP, CFO","Dan Fisher - SVP, COO of Global Beverage","Conference Call Participants","Anthony Pettinari - Citi","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W.

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is recorded today Thursday, August 1, 2019.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hayes, CEO. Please go ahead.","John Hayes","Thank you, Lila, and good morning everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the Company's second quarter 2019 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the Company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings as well as company news releases.","If you don't already have our second quarter earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the notes section of today's earnings release. The release also includes a table summarizing business consolidation and other activities as well as a reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations.","Now joining me on the call today are Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and CFO and Dan Fisher, Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Global Beverage. I will provide some introductory remarks. Dan will discuss the global beverage packaging performance. Scott will discuss key financial metrics. And then we will finish up with comments on our aerosol and aerospace businesses as well as our outlook for the Company.","Growth in our businesses continued at or reason above our expectations. Overall, global beverage volumes were up approximately 5%, and our aerospace revenues were up more than 30%. Across the globe can demand continues to increase as sustainability progresses from a special interest initiative to a mainstream lifestyle, and innovation and execution drive more customers to seek out solutions in all of our divisions.","To say this is an exciting time to be at our company and we said before may be an understatement. With this strong growth, we've experienced short-term costs to serve this growth particularly in our North and Central American and South America beverage can businesses. In fact, we probably less as pointed to a volume growth on the table as we're unable to deliver to and service to our customers at the level we typically expect ourselves.","To stay on top of this growth and mitigate our line conversions, other pattern freight and others short-term headwinds, we plan to deploy additional capital to debottleneck existing lines and build new capacity in order to provide for even greater growth and flexibility to supply our customer's needs at the levels that they demand. Scott and Dan will discuss our investment opportunities to grow profitably across our various geographies and businesses.","In aerospace, the team continues to deliver on its growth ambitions. Contract performance is strong, hiring is up and we expect to pursue further investments in this business to keep up with the strong growth that we continue to see. From an earnings perspective, our results were up despite tough year-over-year comps given the 2018 steel food and can business sale and conclusion at the end sale agreement in South America.","As I mentioned, our North and Central America segment was challenged with previously discussed U.S. aluminum scrap headwinds and sequential project startup cost. All other segments were at or above our expectations. We expect these near-term costs headwinds to mitigate as we progress through the second half of the year and continue to expect year-over-year improvement in each of our main geographies.","Now key highlights for the quarter include, as I mentioned previously, overall global beverage can growth of approximately 5% driven by 13% specialty can growth. In fact growth in our three key regions North and Central America, Europe and South America grew 6% when you exclude the declines we experienced in Asia. Dan will get into this later. Today specialty can represent over 42% of our mix on a global basis.","The growth is prevalent our largest markets with North and Central America up approximately 4% year-over-year, South America up 12%, and Europe up 7%, while EMEA was down slightly due to continued difficult macroeconomic issues in this region. We received antitrust approval for the sale of our China beverage can business and we expect the transaction to close later in the third or fourth quarter depending on other governmental approvals around tax closeouts and foreign exchange flows.","Our aerospace revenues were up over 30% and operating earnings were up 55%. While we don't expect this level of growth to continue, we do expect revenues to be up nearly 25% for the full year and operating earnings should continue to grow at revenue growth rates. Aluminum aerosol was up low single digits with new product innovation worth continuing. We continue to focus on raising awareness on sustainability, the benefits of aluminum packaging, and proactively investing in and offer aluminum packaging solutions to our customers.","One interesting note regarding in a growth is that while many new products continue to move in the cans, our growth today has not been meaningfully impacted by any conversions of existing brands from plastic or other substrates to aluminum beverage cans, particularly the nonalcoholic categories including CSD and water. That said there have been several public announcements regarding such conversions that Dan will discuss and they will begin to hit the market later this year or early next year.","In addition, this fall we will launch our new infinitely recyclable brandable aluminum cups that will make their commercials debuts in college and professional stadiums during the fall football season. With an addressable market of over 90 billion units globally, a third of which are in the U.S., we're incredibly excited about this new innovation product launch. Stay tuned for further media announcements.","So in summary, we continue to see strong growth across our various businesses and while we've been challenged with short-term costs of service growth, we believe these headwinds will begin to moderate and dissipate as we move through the second half of the year. We have many exciting opportunities in front of us that set us up -- set our business up well going into 2020 and beyond.","We will continue to execute our long-term strategy of deploying capital and supportive growth opportunities, increasing EVA dollars in earning over time through higher revenues above cost growth, driving more mix shifts and especially containers, growing new innovative aluminum packaging products like the cup and expanding aerospace, all with return of value to our shareholders mindset.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan.","Dan Fisher","Thanks, John. Across our global operations, our team is navigating tremendous growth, complexity and incredibly tight supply demand conditions. Sustainability and new categories are fueling customer demand. And looking ahead, when existing products convert from single-serve PET to cans in 2020 and beyond given the recent announcements by two of the world's largest beverage brands, the growth for beverage cans will accelerate.","In the near-term and until we have more assets up and running, costs to serve the surge in growth dampened in the North America's performance, given the U.S. aluminum scrap situation we called out last quarter, and pushing our existing plans and new lines to the maximum to keep customer in cans.","Turning to growth. Our second quarter global beverage can shipments were up 5% and excluding declines in China and EMEA, global volumes were up 6%. However, comparable operating earnings were down slightly year-over-year due exclusively to the previously disclosed U.S. aluminum scrap issues and continued U.S. line inefficiencies.","Completion of the South American [ENS] manufacturing agreement, macroeconomic issues in EMEA and some Euro FX earnings translation headwinds. All-in, these issues impact the comparable global beverage earnings 55 million in the quarter, with roughly 35 million in the North America business, 14 million in South America and 5 million in Europe.","Across the globe, our teams kept pace with tremendous growth in Europe, Brazil and North America, which as John mentioned, is still experiencing operational and logistical inefficiencies given a tight U.S. industry and higher than anticipated growth in Brazil. The unfavorable impacts of U.S. aluminum scrap, logistics and customer ordering complexities have largely been addressed in contracts renewing in 2020 and beyond.","Before I move on to the segment commentary, a brief update on some internal talent moves. After decades of successfully leading numerous Ball regions, we recently brought Colin Gillis over from Europe, and he will now be leading our North America operations. And Colin's European role will be backfilled by Ron Lewis, who is joining Ball from Coca Cola European partners, where he was their Chief Supply Chain Officer. Ron worked in the coke system for nearly 20 years, and we have known him throughout that time. His experience and leadership will be a great addition to our team.","Moving to the individual segments, Ball's North American segment volumes were up 4% in the quarter, continuing double-digit growth in spiked seltzers, wine, craft beer, new water brands and developing categories of fitness energy drinks and spirits and premixed cocktails, and cans led to year-over-year growth and specialty.","Inventory levels for our specialty portfolio are low and every plant in our network is running at maximum utilization. Given the combination of strong growth, the upcoming transition of traditional products such as still water from single-serve plastic to cans, the demands on our existing operational assets are such that we will not be able to sustain current growth rates without additional investment. Conversions, wind speed ups and additions at existing facilities in Georgia and Texas are in process.","We look forward to offering new products and more specially aluminum can and bottle capability to support our customer's growth. Following these investments, our plant teams will gain some operational breathing room across the system, allowing us to get costs in line and with previously negotiated contracts favorably resetting at the beginning of 2020. I fully expect strong earnings momentum across North America in late 2019 and beyond.","Turning to our South American segment, volumes were up 12% in the second quarter, led by incredible strength in Brazil. As mentioned earlier, the completion of the [ENS] manufacturing contract required as part of the Rexam transaction led to just slightly lower second quarter earnings. Higher than anticipated Brazilian volume growth led to incremental logistics costs. Comps will improve as we move toward the fourth quarter, which is the seasonally strongest quarter for South America.","Our expansion in Paraguay is on track for late 2019 startup and the 2018 expansions of Argentina and Chile or performance expectations. And similar to North America, overall, South American industry trends remain strong with cans. New products and brand launches for beer, wine, energy and still watering cans as well as multiple brewery expansions will support additional investment across the industry and specifics of all a new customers multiple brewery expansions will support additional capital in Brazil, including a multiline greenfield facility.","Europeans beverage earnings were up 16% in the second quarter due to volume growth and improved year-over-year operational performance despite a 5 million unfavorable operating earnings translation impact in the quarter. Volumes increased 7% in the second quarter despite mixed weather during the quarter. Cans are winning and customers operations continue to add new can filing lines.","For 2019 contributions from our new lines, the year over impact of our 2018 G&A improvement and plant cost initiatives will provide further year-over-year earnings growth and margin expansion as we progress through the balance of the year. Looking ahead, we will leverage our existing Continental Europe network with near-term line speed ups. While in Russia, we are executing a capacity expansion strategy in the short, medium term to support in country can grow.","Turning to EMEA and Asia, the demand environment was softer than anticipated, as Middle Eastern conflicts escalated in the quarter. Operationally, the plants have lowered their costs and focused on controlling what they can control. And as John mentioned in China, Ball has secured antitrust approval and has begun the multistage closing process for the Chinese manufacturing plant sale to ORG.","In summary, global beverage can demand momentum has continued in our three largest regions of North and Central America, Brazil and Europe. Supply demand globally for cans is tight and our commercial sustainability and recent talent moves will benefit Ball going forward. As John mentioned earlier, the amount of growth we are seeing today and are securing into the future is amazing. We will invest wisely with an eye on EVA returns and a proper pace relative to customers long term needs. Thank you again to all of our teams around the globe.","With that, I'll turn it over to Scott.","Scott Morrison","Thanks Dan. Comparable second quarter 2019 diluted earnings per share was $0.64 versus $0.58 in the second quarter of 2018. Second quarter 2019 results reflect $0.04 comparable earnings per share diluted impact of the July 2018 sale or U.S. steel food and steel aerosol business. Details are provided in the notes section of today's earnings release and additional information will also be provided in our 10-Q.","Second quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflects strong global beverage can shipments and solid aerospace contract performance. A lower effective tax rate and lower corporate costs offset by the sale of our U.S. steel food and aerosol business and low lower year-over-year end sales in South America and U.S. scrapping startup costs as Dan just outline.","Net debt ended of the quarter of $6.5 billion and reflects our typical seasonal working capital build and ongoing share buyback. We continue to anticipate year-end 2019 net debt to remain around $6 billion as the buyback stock and invest in our businesses and pay dividends throughout 2019.","Close to 90% of Ball's balance sheet debt is a fixed rates and we've reached our post-Rexam target leverage levels. Ball's balance sheet is healthy and provides ample opportunity and flexibility to service growth and shareholder value return needs.","As we think about 2019, our 2019 financial goals originally laid out in mid 2016 are largely intact. With the North American scrap and operational headwinds that we faced in the first half, that makes the full year $2 billion of EBITDA challenging to hit.","Having said that, our second half expectations haven't changed as the scrap and operational headwinds begin to moderate and our unit volume growth continues to show strength. We'll exit this year on a $2 billion EBITDA run rate.","Given all the excellent growth opportunities and dependent on the pace of CapEx spend and incremental pension funding, we see 2019 free cash flow being in the range of $1 billion. Full year interest expense will be a little bit more to $310 million.","Full year effective tax rate and comparable earnings will be in the range of 19% to 20% and corporate undistributed will likely run just under $75 million, representing benefits from strong overall cost management and the benefits of our shared services structure. We anticipate benefiting from this low cost structure in 2020 and beyond.","Year-to-date, we've executed nearly $400 million of repurchases of stocks and paid out approximately $80 million in dividends. The accelerated stock repurchase program that we announced earlier this year continues to be executed.","Following the year-to-date run up in the stock, we get asked a lot about capital allocation plans. The significant long-term growth opportunities we have in cans, cups and aerospace will require growth CapEx over time. And despite this growth CapEx, we continue to flow meaningful amounts of free cash flow like always we will manage for the benefit of our long-term shareholders, when you invest in volume, you invest with us.","With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.","John Hayes","Great. Thanks, Scott. In our aluminum aerosol business which is now reflected in other non-reportable results, and as I mentioned earlier, global volumes grew 1% in the quarter. Industry dynamics are beginning to change and we continue to see opportunities to broaden our global footprint either through bolt-on M&A or greenfield investment. These opportunities varied by geography.","We are proud of the progress the team is making on innovation and sustainability initiatives. As I mentioned, our aerospace business reported 31% revenue growth and 58% operating earnings growth on solid contract performance partially offset by incremental labor costs. In addition, we welcome nearly 600 new aerospace employee year-to-date and we anticipate adding at least another 600 employees by year-end. Total aerospace headcount recently surpassed 4,200 people. Our focused remains firmly on on-boarding these new employees, further expansion of our Colorado facilities and executing on our strong backlog.","Looking forward to the new two-year U.S. budget agreement further underpins the growth that we see, and aerospace now has the potential of growing its earnings in excess of 20% 2019 and with contracted backlog levels exceeding 2 billion and our won not booked backlog at 4.8 billion, the future continues to look bright for the foreseeable future. While we make great strides towards the 2019 financial goals originally laid out mid-2016, our longer term prospects have never been brighter. Ball is uniquely positioned to lead and invest in sustainable growth in a global aluminum packaging and aerospace while delivering significant value to our shareholders.","We look forward to receiving our long-term 10% to 15% diluted earnings per share growth goal in 2019 and over the next several years. While we're striving in the short-term to manage costs and squeeze as many cans at our existing operations, we're completely immersed in our long-term growth plans and increasing value creation for our shareholders. Our ability to succeed is because of our people, our culture, EVA mindset, our healthy balance sheet and exceptional products and technologies. We will continue to responsibly invest in our businesses for the long-term and do what is best for Ball and our shareholders long-term success.","And with that, Lila, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead.","Anthony Pettinari","John, the view that you'll be able to grow earnings beyond the 10%, 15% EPS range over the next few years. I guess what kind of volume assumptions underlie that on the bev can side? And can you give us any detail on maybe customer commitments you secure that give you confidence that you'd be able to reach that volume number?","John Hayes","First, with respect to volume growth, as we said in the first quarter, historically, we always thought this business to be plus or minus globally about a 2% unit volume growth around the world and we think it's double that. We've been outperforming that relative and I think in the very short-term, we can continue to see that. But I think over the long-term, 4% unit volume growth is a good way to think about it. And if there's upside to that, we're going to be spending more capital, because we assume it's going to be good at EVA return projects to meet our customer's needs.","In terms of specific customers in the contract, we don't get into anything. But for example, the new plant we're building in Brazil is secured by a new long-term customer. In North America, here we've been, as I mentioned in my comments, we've been leaving growth on the table because we haven't been able to serve incremental. So the demand certainly is there. We just need to get our supply caught up, so we can get a little breathing room and give our operational folks more opportunity kind of slowdown the conversions as they've been experiencing, which have been increasingly short-term, which happened increasing the short-term headwinds that we talked about.","Anthony Pettinari","And then, Dan, you talked about 55 million of headwinds in the quarter from operational inefficiencies, and you broke that out between North America, Europe and LATAM. Any view on what that number could look like in 3Q? And then just directionally, would you expect those headwinds to abate in all three of the regions that you mentioned? Or could they intensify or be relatively stable, say on that in 3Q?","Dan Fisher","I think we're very hopeful that the 35 in North America in particular will dissipate. And we've got plans in place on the metal scrap issue that will start to trend in a more favorable direction. It will still be a headwind year-over-year, but it'll be less of the headwind than we saw in the first half. The performance in our inefficient lines, we had two conversions that took place in the quarter. And then we still have, we're still a little behind on two lines and the Goodyear startup. We're seeing progress there.","So I think that momentum will continue through the quarters. I don't know if it dissipates entirely in 3Q, but it will continue to progress in the right direction heading into certainly beginning of '19. And then really, Europe FX that we described, I probably can't give you much guidance there. And the 15 million that I quoted or the $14 million in South America is, that will dissipate in the second half the year the last as it relates to the [ORG] amortization.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird & Co.","Ghansham Panjabi","First off on the 13% increase in specialty can volumes in 2Q. John, can you sort of break that out by region? And then you also mentioned growth came in above your expeditions for the second quarter. And I am sorry if I miss this, but which region in particular surprise you to the upside?","John Hayes","Well, I think the momentum continues to answer your question. First, in North America, especially volumes were all single, upper single digits. As I said, they could have been higher, but we just didn't have enough cans to get out in the marketplace. I know, South America was very strong, was low 20% growth, in the specialty and even in Europe we're seeing a lot. What, fundamentally what's driving this, as you're seeing all these new categories and all these new products moving to the specialty containers and that's what we get most excited about.","Ghansham, as you know over the past 5 to 10 years, we've really been a put a focus on putting supply of specialty containers into our system. And that only continues to accelerate. I think to answer your broader question about where were we surprised. I just think overall, global growth in a very seasonally strong quarter up 6% of you exclude China. And when you think about that and we left growth on the table for, we could have very, if we had the capacity, we very easily could have replicated the first quarter. But we did. And that's why you're we're talking about putting more capital in.","Ghansham Panjabi","Okay, then just based on your current projects you know that you've announced including line speed, speed up and debottlenecking. How much incremental capacity will your footprint generate in the developed markets going into 2020? And then up the new categories that you're benefiting from, how is the filling location dispersion different relative to your legacy customers? I'm just trying to get a sense as to how logistics costs are different for these new customers. And also, it may impact your capital allocation plans willing to join the new capacity going forward?","John Hayes","Yes, I would say by mid 2021. What we're signaling here is somewhere between $4 billion to $5 billion of additional capacity. And the reason 2020 is a difficult comment for us is I think, in Texas specifically that is the most difficult environmental permitting area that we deal with anywhere in the world. So, you can't even start civil engineering projects until the permitting, is officially signed off and that could take as long as the year. So 2021, I've got good line of sight that the new facility the two lines and the speed ups that are all in process will be up and running. And we should be executed against those by mid-2021. Maybe 60%, of what I've described falls in the second half of 2020.","Scott Morrison","So, the best way to think about it, if you break it into line speed up versus lines versus new facilities, kind of a third, a third, a third is the best way to say it. Line speedups will -- that will be able to help us out for most of 2020, certainly in the summer selling season in North America. And as Dan said, the lines between the lines are putting in North America. One, we have a pretty good line of sight that should be able to help in the second half of next year. And then the other one in Texas is dependent upon the permitting. And then as we go into South America, thinks it's really more for 2021.","Ghansham Panjabi","And just the new categories in the filling locations? Thanks so much.","John Hayes","Yes, definitely benefiting from new categories in North America. And the one of the investments will be targeted to a new filling location. The rest of the incremental investments will be falling into existing filling locations.","Scott Morrison","And Ghansham, as you know, we don't talk about specific customers, contracts and\/or growth plans, but we are aware of a variety of specific customers that are adding, filling, can filling, capacity whether it's North America, whether it's Europe, and we're dovetailing our geographic investments with those. And so, there have been some customers that have been, having to buy cans from us, and one geographic location, ship them across [audio gap] country to another one where they fill it. We're aiming and looking to work with them on streamlining a lot of that. So, it will not only help us but it will also help them.","John Hayes","I think one last question on the new category expansion or one last comment is. We absolutely are looking at what products and what customers are winning in the market and which months we want to be with. And those definitely played into some of these expansions and investment call us.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Edlain Rodriguez with UBS. Please go ahead.","Edlain Rodriguez","John, question for you. I mean, you'll be adding new capacity. Your main competitor is adding more capacities, like gaining concerns that the industry may be attracting too much capital too soon, or do you feel that volume will be strong enough to absorb it all over the next couple of years?","John Hayes","We feel pretty darn strongly that the growth in the various markets is more than sufficient to cover that up. As I mentioned, just giving context here. In North America, it's approximately 100 billion can market has been growing at 4%. That's 4 billion cans right there alone in any given year.","You multiply that over a couple of years and next thing you're looking at 12 billion of new capacity and that's 8 to 12 new line. That is why we're getting out ahead of me as you all know we've invested depends on where you look, but across our whole system globally, we've invested in 11 in line so we're last 18 months and we've been able to keep up with live growth, but not completely old.","And so, what we're doing is this is just the next phase trying to get out ahead because I know we believe strongly that by 2021, that in given everything that our customers have been talking about that's in the pipeline right now that we see this growth continuing. And that's not even talking about the broader picture of this whole anti plastic sustainability and that continues to accelerate. This is where we're going to be talking about more capital as we go forward, also.","Edlain Rodriguez","Okay, and in terms of capital allocation, so that new and all those investments you're making. Are they going to be coming at the expense of share buyback? Or do you think you can still do that $1 billion that you've talked about over the next couple of years share buyback?","John Hayes","Here is the way we think about it and I'll turn it over to Scott a minute, but when you talk about this growth, as we all know, we've talked about this. Our DNA is approximately $550 million. And we set our maintenance of no growth capitals in the range of $250 million. We've also said people have asked over time and how much does it cost for new line and it varies tremendously by region and what capacities you want to put in.","But if you say up roughly, a new line is approximately $75 million. And you get anywhere from 800 to a 1 billion cans on it depending on how many swings you have in that. That means to keep up with this growth on a global basis. You're talking about a growth for us on a base of 105 plus 1 billion cans as growing 4%. That's about four new lines a year. And if it's a 75 million, that is about 300 million.","So you later on top of that, you get 250 maintenance plus 300 of growth, that gets about DNA, then you layer on the growth that we have for aerospace. And then you grow on cups and other things even quickly see how we get the kind of 700 million. If that global beverage can growth continues, and we need to put more in, we have the capacity to because then I'll turn it over, Scott now. Even with all this elevated CapEx, we're still generating a tremendous amount of free cash flow.","Scott Morrison","Yes, I think we're going to continue to invest in our business on all these projects where we can grow EVA dollars grow our earnings, we're going to continue to be buying back or stock paying dividends. I think the 50% increase earlier this year is pretty strong evidence of that. And I think we'll be both kind of a consistent buyer of our stock, but also an opportunity to repurchase of our shares and take advantage of volatility. And so that means that any quarter to we may buy more or less depending on that volatility. But we're going to continue to invest in our business and return a lot of capital back to the shareholders.","John Hayes","Yes, let me just reiterate, over the last 20 years, we have done that exact same model. We've invested in our business. And we've generated a tremendous amount of our shareholder, value for shareholders by being consistent allocators of capital back to our shareholders. Yes, we have elevated CapEx, which is exciting, because that's going to provide the growth. And we also have the flexibility to be consistent, and over the long term and returning value to shareholders.","Operator","The next question is from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","George Staphos","Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the commentary. I just wanted to ask a question kind of a point of clarification to start. The additional 4 billion to 5 billion cans of capacity Dan that you said you think you'd get to on an annualized basis by mid 21. Does that include capacity, does that include within the number for aluminum cups or does it not? And similarly, I thought it would have, but given John's commentary earlier. Does that include anything for any of these still water conversions or not?","Dan Fisher","I would say cups. No, it's not in there. And still water conversions. That's it. We don't have much built into that 5 billion. And as you imagine, George, we're having very different conversations with the customer base. All the 3 major markets are incredibly tight. And so if there was going to be a move in the water, and there are certainly conversations about that. It will require some significant collaboration between us and our customers to make the supply chain, they'll have to invest in doing, they'll have to invest in potentially different logistics structures and warehousing, and we'll have to add capacity for him. And so those conversations would be in very early innings right now.","George Staphos","And I would take it probably not prudent to size what the opportunity could be either for cups or for still water, maybe not 21, but 22, 23, because it obviously, so you don't have a full agreement yet on the water side. You can't bring in permitting. You can't bring in CapEx yet. But is there a way to size what it could look like maybe in 22, or 23?","Dan Fisher","Yes, I'll let John comment. It would be difficult. It's a massive market. I think single-serve waters 500 billion units and global cans is 300. So, a 2% move, 3% move would require a very different investment pattern for us. On the cup side, we are commercializing the product. It will be in some sporting venues now. The thing that we're trying to get our head wrapped around is exactly the outputs that will come from a massive line or footprint, expansion. We're working through those and those details right now. So given you commentary on the specific volumes for the investment still a little premature, but we'll know that the next 60 to 90 days, I think.","John Hayes","Yes. George just amplifying, the cups are completely agreed on the water side. But just on the cups as I mentioned in my comments, around the world in terms of the addressable market for this, it's over 90 billion units, a third of which are in the United States. This will come at a premium aluminum's not inexpensive, but what we see is so far is a very strong willingness to pay a premium for a sustainable product, particularly as college campuses and professional sports venues go plastic free.","George Staphos","Understood. I thought that some of the investment and lines that you're talking about now would include some capacity for cup is that incorrect. So if, I know, you're commercializing, you're doing some pilots this coming football season. Am I mistaken that if you really go full force with this, that the investment really hasn't been lined up yet for that, those revenue streams?","John Hayes","Yes, that is correct. We have already put in a pilot line that we're currently serving for this fall, but to really scale it out. It requires a new investment that we have not announced yet.","George Staphos","Okay. Thanks for all the back and forth on that. Last question on investment and I'll have one shorter term one, and I'll turn it over just out of fairness. So, the return on capital that you're seeing out of these new investments, is there a way to say whether it's, perhaps a lesser rate than what you've seen, but you're getting so much growth, you're willing to take a lower return than what you've seen in the past? Are the returns on these new projects equivalent or above? What you've seen with returns on your last two or three year's worth of growth CapEx?","And then separately and maybe shorter term, given all the growth you're seeing, what gives you confidence, which is the investor takeaway is why we should be confident that the startup costs and all the other variable expense that's been sort of a record has been something that will dissipate by 2020. Is it mostly in the contracts? Or is it the learnings that you're getting from all of the work you're doing right now? What would it be? Thank you guys and good luck in the quarter.","John Hayes","Thank you. I'll answer the return question. First, the conversations that we're having with our customers are very different. I think John indicated this. And that is resulting at least all the projects that we've approved thus far or at North of historical norms returns on these projects. In Europe, North America and South America, the markets are tight. And so the conversations are, in many of those markets that used to have excess capacity, they're just very different. And so we should be doing better from a returns threshold standpoint at this point.","Fair question and I think when John indicated, the three buckets of capital investments or how will get units, the easiest units to get our speed ups and conversions, the second most difficult are our full line expansions and the third are greenfield. And where we have admittedly struggled, whether it's Monterrey or it's Goodyear or it's Cabanillas over the last couple of years, we generally had an 18 month time horizon on seeing the commercialization of the products and getting up to a run rate.","And I think it's probably going to take a little longer than that. And we'll probably communicate that more explicitly. One thing that we do know that we have to spend a hell of a lot more time on training. And the other thing and some of these markets, these are the first -- in North America, Goodyear is really the first market where we built a greenfield plant in 30 something years. So, we will get better at it. And I think we'll hire better. I think we'll train better. And we're fully committed to that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Tyler Langton with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Tyler Langton","Good morning. Thank you. I think you just mentioned from the sustainability, you really haven't sort of seen a benefit yet then you kind of mentioned just Northern Europe, you're starting to see some customers convert from PET to can. Can you just talk about how significant that move is? Or just provide a little more color on that?","John Hayes","Yes, well, this is John. Maybe I'll turn over to Dan. We didn't say we have got a better from sustainability. All these new products, I think are being driven by sustainability. What we haven't seen in any meaningful way, is existing brands that are already in existing substrates converting to aluminum. We -- there have been some public announcements by customers, we are obviously aware of other investments that they're making for those conversions. And that's what gives us some conviction as we look forward into it.","I do think that many brand owners are struggling as their retailers are demanding more sustainable products, and a reduction of their footprints, both environmentally and from a greenhouse gas perspective, and they're turning to products such as aluminum, and that's what I was talking about. You're absolutely right. In Europe, you're seeing it. I think you're starting to see it in North America. I think someone asked a question earlier about, how big could that be? We're in early innings. So, it's too early to tell, but so far so good in terms of what we've seen.","Tyler Langton","And then in terms of the corporate expenses, Scott, I guess, I think 16 million this quarter having a low-20s. Is that 16 million a good run rate going forward? And is that mainly from sort of the shared services initiative?","Scott Morrison","It's a ton of different things, but our run rate should be pretty good. I said it it'd end up kind of just under 75 million for the full year. We're benefiting -- we're doing a lot of things whether it's restructuring, legal entities. Some of the things we've done in pensions, shared services, it's all those things that are adding to that, basically lowering our costs that will get the benefit, not just this year, but into the future.","John Hayes","Let's not forget a couple of years ago. We talked about over the 2018 release, latter half of how '17, we're going to actually be making investments in standing up shared services, and we should start to get the benefits as we get into the second half of '19. And that's exactly what we're seeing. But to Scott's point, that's just one of it. There're hundreds of different projects that all incrementally may not look that exciting, but cumulatively they start to add up.","Tyler Langton","Final question in terms of CapEx, most of these projects and most of that, in 2020, just kind of how to think about CapEx for this year?","John Hayes","Yes, I think CapEx, we initially set around 600 million for CapEx. I think it could be more than that. I think next year could be a little higher than this year. And all of these projects, we just approved at our board meeting a week or so ago, 350 million of capital to be spent over the next 18 to 24 months to add capacity across our beverage system and another 150 in our aerospace business to keep up with the growth in that business. So I think we could spend a little more than 600 this year, and I think we'll spend a little bit more than that next year.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Arun Viswanathan","Just wanting to understand that the outlook statement of EPS growth of greater than 10% to 15%. It sounds like volume's potentially trending a little bit better than you thought. You also discussed contract renegotiation in the statement and the release, but you have experienced quite a bit of cost. So is it implicit in that statement that contract renegotiations and pricing improvements and mix is going to more than offset the logistics issues and the cost and that your inflation you're experiencing? Or is it a greater pivot to buybacks as well? Or maybe you can just sense what kind of goes of that segment.","John Hayes","Well, qualitatively, and I'm not going to hash through all the numbers because I think we've in one way shape or form talked about them already. But number one, we've had a variety of headwinds that we said, we're going to dissipate, certainly, as we get into the back half this year, but more importantly, going into 2020. So that's a source a year-over-year improvement. We also have unit volume growth that is much stronger than we historically have seen and\/or anticipated.","And the mix of that more specialty is a kicker on top of that. So that's a big data point relative to our historical 10% to 15%. You think about the growth and aerospace that we've been going it's been growing much stronger than we've historically have. There is other thing as well, but those and then you're talking about the new capital we're putting in and we're an EVA company, so we better darn well, we generating returns on that. So, you put all that together, and absence, just normal share repurchases, you can see your line of sight of why we feel bullish on the next few years.","Arun Viswanathan","Okay. And then just from another perspective, I'm just wondering South America, you guys experiencing very good growth there hasn't been some extra capital is coming there though. Any concerns that growth there could slowdown eventually and with new entrants and a little bit more capacity? Thanks.","John Hayes","Yes, we're probably less concerned about the new entrance just more concerned with the volatility of the region. But the reality is the movement and I think the things John, we've talked about this historically, but what you're seeing an accelerated growth rates in North America and in Europe is the sustainability impact. What you're seeing in South America, which is a real tailwind, and it should continue for some period of time obviously given the macro environment is remains somewhat healthy.","If it's a shift from returnable glass, by the largest incumbent to cans meaningfully and they're making significant filling investments to support that. They have last year or the last two to three years in that marketplace by premiumization of beer and all of that going into specialty aluminum packaging. And so they have made a conscious decision to move away from returnable glass.","And so that's why you're seeing these accelerated growth rates in that marketplace. And they're committed, as best we can sell to doing that for a long period of time. So we like the growth trajectory in that market in particular. And also further underpinning it over the last few years, we've actually seen very strong growth, but that was despite overall consumption of beverages to be down.","I can tell you years in the second quarter 2019, beer, total beer consumption, irrespective of what package type it was in, was up by 2% software and was also up by 2%. That's the first time in a long time, those have been positive. And so we had good growth underpinning with negative overall volume. And now it's turned positive, then you layer on with and so that's why we feel constructive over the next several years.","Arun Viswanathan","Okay. And last follow-up on free cash flow. Assuming that you do grow EPS in the 10% to 15% or above range, given that your investments look like increasing your CapEx outlook, would you expect slightly lower free cash flow growth? And how should we think about that?","John Hayes","No, not necessarily because I think we'll get -- As Dan talk about, the projects that we're investing in and the mix of those projects gets better. And I think the earnings acceleration will offset some of the growth in capital over the next few years. So I don't necessarily seen free cash flow are going to be hit as we go forward.","Dan Fisher","Yes and the other thing I'd point out is actually, cash flow from operations is going to be growing quite strong. And when you really think about free cash flow is a function of the cash you generate from running your business, less the maintenance CapEx, you need to support that business and then plus or minus growth capital and that growth capital could be M&A, it could be Greenfield investments as we talked about. So, we actually over the long-term that growth investment is a one-time type of thing, and so yes, in 2019 or 2020 or '21, we may have elevated CapEx, but it's one time growth CapEx that's going to accelerate the free cash flow from operations.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Kyle White with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Kyle White","Just curious if you guys, what kind of volume impact you saw from the weather conditions in the quarter? And then what have you seen in July, any impacts from kind of the heat waves that we're seeing?","Dan Fisher","No issues in North America, I assume that's where the questions coming from, but we did see in the second quarter, kind of some dissipate about as good as our volumes were in Europe, the weather wasn't on our side and that is certainly turns so. But from a weather perspective, as long as it's not over 95 consistent, people are going to drink candy products. I mean, that's kind of the temperature range we usually see.","John Hayes","And then standpoint in Europe, we did get qualitatively, the volumes were quite strong. But we do think that they were more muted than they otherwise would have been because of bad weather. You go into July it's actually got incredibly hot. So, it's almost too hot for people stay indoors, but having said that volumes continue along the growth pace that we've always talked about. So there's for different reasons, it really hasn't impacted it over the longer term, we're going to have short-term dislocations because weather good and bad.","Kyle White","And then turning to aerospace continues to grow nicely. The won not booked backlog close to about 5 billion. Can you just provide some details on these backlogs and kind of the typical timeline that we should expect them to materialize into one contract and materialize into actual sales?","John Hayes","Yes, it's truly across the board when you look won not booked. We have things such as I'll just give you 2 book ends. We have on one hand, the shorter term in that is contracts we have one for specific satellites with specific customers in the classified arena that because the government didn't have a budget, they couldn't sign an agreement. Now that budget is behind us, it significantly improves the prospects over the near term that we will go on contract and that will move from one not booked into a funded backlog status.","On the other stream, we do all the sensors that are on the fuselage and wings of the F-35. That contract will go out to 2030 or 2040 in the various lots that we have produced. Some of them will move in the short-term to from one not booked to funded backlog. Others will stay out there for a number of years as these planes continue to be built. So those are just two extremes. And there's hundreds of programs in it that have similar characteristics within those parameters I just laid out.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Neel Kumar with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. The line of Neel Kumar with Morgan Stanley is now open and interactive. Please proceed with your question.","Neel Kumar","Sorry, I was on mute. I just had another question on aluminum cups. Do you have a preliminary sense of what the receptivity of customers is to cups and aluminum versus plastic? And are there any other new revenue opportunities outside of beverage cans that you're considering?","John Hayes","Maybe I'll take the first one. We've done a bunch of quantitative and qualitative research that says. This could be very -- there could be a lot of upside here. I think what we've seen at a high level that people see the experience of the container as much better than all the existing alternatives, they see a colder, they see a sturdier, they see a willingness to pay more as a result of that.","And so everything that we've seen says, yes, there could be a lot of interesting upside in here. And as it relates to other innovation innovations, we always have other innovations pretty consistently revolve around the markets in which we currently serve. And so this is for beverages. I would not anticipate us going into food, for example, which consciously made the decision to exit that, but we have a lot of things in the pipeline. Now, Dan, do you anything to add?","Dan Fisher","I would say, I mean, obviously, you're presenting this in kind of the entertainment space and food service space. And look, we are a 100 for 100 in terms of the percent of showing this cup to a potential customer and then wanting to place an order right now. We're turning down and we're allocating is what we're doing. But where you'll see this is entertainment venues, and you'll see the sports venues where there is a massive push to have a green facility.","Neel Kumar","Very helpful.","John Hayes","It further helps leverage us on the college campuses, for example, because when college campuses in terms of sustainability, that is probably the greatest area, when you think about demographics, you think about people 18 to 25 years of age. So those are probably the, those that are most conscious about sustainability. And when college campuses talk about going plastic free, yes, they can convert their soda. Yes, they can convert your beer. Yes, they are starting to convert their water, but they never had an alternative from us in terms of costs. Now they do. And so that's what we've been talking about them using this as an opportunity to accelerate going plastic free that their customers being the students are asking for.","Neel Kumar","Great. That makes sense. And I was just wondering if you can also update us on how sustainability conversations with customers have been progressing aerosol. I recall you mentioned those conversations started surfacing in the space in the first quarter of this year. So any update there will be helpful.","John Hayes","Yes, as I said in the first quarter and it kind of continues, there is discussion but it's further behind the beverage category. I think sustainability and recycling in the personal care space is more and more difficult. They have many more resins. They have many more colors within those resins. And so, as they try and think about how they're going to deliver their products in a sustainable world, it's just taking longer, it's much -- I won't say easier, but you can see a have a much more clear line of sign when you're talking beverages, and you see what you need to do. I think it's a little bit more challenging when you get to the aerosol side, but I still think there's great potential. It's just we cannot point to you right now any specifics like we can in the beverage. Any specifics in the aerosol sides that we said that is a direct result of sustainability.","Neel Kumar","Okay, and then just lastly. With specialty can growth of 30% and global volume growth of 5%, your portfolio make is about 43% seems to imply that traditional can volumes came down during the quarter. Is that generally a fair characterization that all the growth came in specialty cans?","Dan Fisher","Yes, overwhelmingly. I mean, relatively flat, some slight decline especially in EMEA and Asia contributed to that, but almost overwhelmingly all the growth came from specialty and that's what you, that's what was reflected in that mix.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Brian Maguire","Good morning everyone. John, back at the Investor Day, simply a long time ago now back in October. You've talked about just one of the challenges in adoption of the cans historically was just the difference in the price point at the retail level between the beverage bottles in PET for example versus aluminum cans. Just wondering, as you've seen this take off in growth, how you think customers are getting around that? And presumably input costs are up, you're doing an admirable job of renegotiating contracts to capture the value you guys create. Do you see customers being able to kind of price appropriately to maintain or improve margins on cans? And just a general kind of how do you see the growth and specialty helping customers with that price conversation?","Dan Fisher","This is Dan. Good question. I think this lends itself to, when I think when John describing this. He's really talking about kind of core brands shifting out of high margin packaging, and it was established, because higher retail prices as they put on those packages and plastic. The growth that we're seeing is coming in specialty packages, new products. Those are still being launched by the large CPG companies. And they're being launched at a far greater rate. And I think we've been touched on it's basically 2x, the amount of new product launches in both North America and parts of Western Europe that are going into cans versus the historical rate of about 35%.","Those products are -- they're able to garner a higher price point, which is -- has not been much of a conversation because they are in some of these emerging categories like fitness energy, spiked seltzers. So, they're able to step into cans with new products at really nice margins. And although they probably won't say this, they won't say it publicly. They also don't want to compound an issue in their supply chain by putting more plastic into that supply chain. And that's why we're inferring there's absolutely a correlation to sustainability.","John Hayes","And the only thing I'd add on top of that is even with the existing grants, which I was specifically talking about. Dan's absolutely right. That's why especially growth is going so much. But let's not forget, there's many of our existing brands, they have put packaging and whether it's a 7.5 ounce here in North America or 250 ml or 150 ml in Europe. And they've been able to ride that price curve up to reduce and\/or eliminate the retail price per fluid ounce delta between their plastic offerings and their specialty can offerings.","Brian Maguire","And your comments just about the forward look on can opportunity to, maybe take some share from other substrates in those traditional markets. Are we at the point where the concerns around customer perception on sustainability overwhelm more challenging retail price point or the fact that cans costs more than plastic? You mentioned you haven't seen much benefit today from such substitution, but the forward look sounded positive there. Are we just seeing your inner conversations with customers that really sustainability is trumping economics in these new decisions?","John Hayes","They won't necessarily say that directly, but what we do know is the investments in cans going lines are happening at a massively accelerated rate versus historical norms. And we also know that some of our major customers are putting in a lot more cans filling capacity over the next two years. So, the combination of those two would suggest that there's absolutely contemplation that they need to get out ahead of this for a potential move whether its regulation or they're willing to take a slight margin dilution by moving into aluminum. I think there's -- in addition to all, but I think there's a recognition of the consumers requiring it that's the most important thing.","Operator","So the final question is from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Chip Dillon","Yes, thanks for taking my question. I just had a quick one on the cup introduction that you're going to roll out. Obviously, the water bottle is very similar to an aluminum beverage can for beer, let's say, but the cup there is different concept, and I just didn't know if you were able to use similar machinery or if you had to go out and either put something together on your own or buy a different type of technology or set of equipment to make aluminum cups.","John Hayes","Yes, great question. What I'd say is there's parts of it's similar but a good chunk of it is very different. This has been in development for nearly seven years within Ball. And we think there's a lot of proprietary to this, that we'd rather not disclose. But, it's very easy to make cups when you're banging in about 100 or 200 per minutes, but the key is to do it at scale to get to a price point that actually opens up the market. We think we've done that and that's why we started with a pilot. We wanted to test it with three or four weeks in the pilot. Things are working well with brand new technology in parts of it. And so, I think it's a -- and that's what gives us a lot of hope, but it is it's similar but different than making a beverage can.","John Hayes","Okay, Lila. Well, thank you very much for everyone's participation, and we look forward to a great second half of 2019 and as we go forward. Thank you all for your support.","Operator","That does conclude the conference call for today.

Welcome to the Ball Corporation Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct the question-and-answer-session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, January 31, 2019.","I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, CEO. Please go ahead.","John Hayes","Great. Thank you, Chris, and good morning everyone. This is Ball Corporation\u2019s conference call regarding the company\u2019s full year and fourth quarter 2018 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements, including estimates related to the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company\u2019s latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings as well as the company\u2019s news releases.","If you don\u2019t already have our third quarter earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the Notes section of today\u2019s earnings release. The release also includes a table summarizing business consolidation and other activities, as well as a reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations.","Now joining me on the call today are Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Dan Fisher, Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Global Beverage. I\u2019ll provide some introductory remarks, Dan will discuss the Global Beverage packaging performance, Scott will discuss key financial metrics, and then we\u2019ll finish up with some comments on our aerospace business as well as our outlook for the company.","2018 was a strong year for Ball and its shareholders. Strong global demand for our aluminum beverage and aerosol packaging products, growth in our aerospace business and a strong long-term focus on earnings and cash flow performance allowed us to return approximately $850 million to our shareholders, which was well above our original expectations dating back to 2016.","Our fourth quarter results were slightly below in our own expectations due to some transitory issues in our North America and Central America beverage segment that Dan Fisher will comment on. Yet as we look forward, we like the position we\u2019re in. We have good momentum in terms of our volume growth. We\u2019ll begin to reap in earnest the footprint activities that we have implemented and largely completed. We have a clear line of sight to achieve the $2 billion in EBITDA and $1 billion in free cash flow that we set out as a target in 2016, we just need to execute. And all of our free cash flow will be returned to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","During 2018, we continued to actively adjust our overall manufacturing footprint. And since we closed on Rexam acquisition, we\u2019ve rationalized eight facilities globally with four in the U.S., two in Brazil and one each in Germany and in Italy. We started up three state-of-the-art beverage can facilities in Arizona, Spain and our joint venture in Panama to cost effectively meet growing demand in these regions. We\u2019ve installed or are installing additional specialty can capacity with new lines in our existing facilities in Argentina, Chile, Switzerland, Serbia, Texas and Mexico in addition to a number of other smaller speed-up projects.","We\u2019ve grown our aerospace backlog 26% to over $2.2 billion, while also growing headcount by over 35% to approximately 3,700 people and the company continues to expand our aerospace infrastructure to meet growth of this important segment. We\u2019ve divested our U.S. steel, food and aerosol business into a 49% owned joint venture and realized approximately $600 million in cash. And we announced the sale or Chinese beverage can business.","As we look more deeply into 2019, we are on the cusp of achieving better value for our standard beverage can products as the majority of our negotiations for the next 18 months are largely concluded which much of this value to be received beyond 2019. We are well invested to capture global growth for our specialty product portfolio. We are benefiting from the final phase of initial acquisition related cost-out programs. We are embarking on additional efforts to streamline global processes. We are commercializing the sustainability benefits of aluminum packaging to provide our customers solution -- solutions versus environmentally challenged substrates. And we are initiating additional products to further expand our aerospace infrastructure and testing capabilities.","As we go forward, we will continue to execute our long-term strategy of growing earnings over time through increasing revenues above our cost growth by focusing on our value over volume strategy in standard containers, driving more mix shift to specialty containers, further developing innovative aluminum packaging products and expanding aerospace all within EVA and return value to shareholders mindset.","Ball is uniquely positioned to lead sustainable growth in global aluminum packaging and aerospace, while also continuing to return significant capital to shareholders following the board\u2019s recent $50 million share repurchase authorization as well as achieving the 3.5 year plan we laid out in mid-2016 of comparable EBITDA and free cash flow of $2 billion and $1 billion respectively.","Thanks to all of our employees who helped our company achieve these results as well as win numerous customer awards and recognitions including inclusion on the Dow Jones\u2019 Sustainability Index and the recent humbling recognition of being ranked number one on Forbes Magazine\u2019s List of America\u2019s Best Employers for Diversity. All of this is possible because of our people and our culture. We\u2019re proud of our 139 year history and we\u2019ll continue to do what\u2019s best for Ball and shareholders\u2019 long-term success.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Dan.","Daniel Fisher","Thanks John. Our global beverage business comparable operating earnings were up 3% year-over-year on full year global volume growth up 2%, offset somewhat by plant start-up costs, higher freight and the late year plant inefficiencies. Our global teams kept pace with notable growth in Europe, Russia and North America, which at times also created some operational and logistic inefficiencies given an oversold U.S. industry and strong demand in the UK, Nordics and Russia. We left some money on the table in 2018 and with new plants now 80% to 90% up their line curves that should flow through in 2019.","Moving to the individual segments, Ball\u2019s North American segment volumes were up 4% in the quarter. New categories led the way with wine, sparkling water, craft and spiked seltzers experiencing double-digit growth. And 2018 was truly a tale of two halves. Demand lagged in the U.S. during the first half as mass beer slowed, while in contrast, other customers struggle to properly gauge consumer demand for new product introductions during the busy summer selling season, ultimately leading to tight supply demand for specialty cans in the second half, leaving little room for air.","At the same time, we were experiencing such growth; U.S. aluminum suppliers struggle to provide quality metal to us and this issue wasn\u2019t resolved by year-end 2018, leading to plant network inefficiencies late in the year, resulting in our North American business producing lower than expected results despite strong volume growth. So far this year, the suppliers delivering metal we can run and our plant inefficiencies in the affected plants are improving.","In order to ensure that this does not occur again, we have focused our efforts on ensuring that our metal suppliers doing the necessary things to deliver quality metal on time, exploring other metal options despite the aluminum tariff situation and by working with our customers to lay down safety stocks in this seasonally slower part of the year and ahead of what we anticipate will be a very strong year in North America.","Given our customers\u2019 current demand profiles, we anticipate selling 2 billion more units in 2019, while also reaping the net $50 million of fixed cost savings following the successful decommissioning of three plants and wrap up of our four line specialty point in Goodyear, Arizona.","Turning to our South American segment, as expected, our Brazilian volumes were flat versus the industry being up 6% in the fourth quarter. Ball\u2019s 2017 decision to forego some can business in Brazil and the completion of the INS manufacturing contract required as part of the Rexam transaction lead to lower fourth quarter and full year earnings. Looking forward, this second half 2018 trend will continue in first half of 2019 until we anniversary these items.","Overall the South American industry trends remained strong with cans being the favorite package in the beer, tea, energy and hard alcohol categories. Our expansions in Argentina, Paraguay and Chile are on track and we are excited about the can continuing to be embraced by customers and consumers across South America. With these expansions benefiting second half 2019, full year 2019 should be roughly in line with full year 2018 performance.","European beverage earnings were up 29% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and 21% for the full year. Volumes increased 10% in the fourth quarter and 8% for the full year. Cans are winning as customers shift their packaged mix away from plastics and into cans. Tailwinds such as this, the new facility in Spain coming on line successfully and the closure of our one line San Martino, Italy facility earlier than planned led to a strong finish in 2018.","As we look forward, continued good market growth, the addition of two new lines in Switzerland and Serbia along with several other specialty line conversions scheduled to be brought on line in early 2019, the year-over-year impact of our 2018 G&A improvement and planned cost initiatives will provide further earnings growth and margin expansion in 2019.","Turning to EMEA and Asia, the demand environments in Turkey, Egypt and India improved, but were offset by regional volatility and poor operating performance in our Saudi joint venture, which led to meaningfully lower volumes in the region and operating earnings down by more than $20 million year-over-year. And in China, the business remains cash flow positive and Ball continues to actively manage the business ahead -- excuse me, of its sale to ORG, which following regulatory approval should close in the second half of 2019.","In summary, global beverage can demand remains robust in our three key regions of North America and Central America, Brazil and Europe. Supply demand for U.S. standard containers in certain specialty sizes is tight and commercial and sustainability initiatives will benefit Ball going forward. Thank you again to all of our teams around the globe.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Scott.","Scott Morrison","Thanks Dan. Comparable full year and fourth quarter 2018 earnings were $2.20 and $0.55 respectively. Details are provided in the Notes section of today\u2019s earnings release and additional information will also be provided in our 10-K. Fourth quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflects solid operational performance across our businesses, a lower effective tax rate than expected and slightly lower corporate costs offset by the sale of our U.S. food, steel food and aerosol business and lower year-over-year performance in North America and South America as Dan just outlined.","From an overall cost perspective, our people have been doing a great job with our SG&A as a percentage of sales at an industry leading 4.1% for the full year. Also we mentioned on prior calls the timing of the U.S. steel food and aerosol sale versus the timing of using the proceeds to repurchase shares was slightly dilutive to earnings in the second half of 2018.","Net debt ended the year at $6 billion and we anticipate year-end 2019 net debt to remain around $6 billion as we continue to actively buyback stock and pay dividends throughout 2019. Close to 90% of Ball\u2019s balance sheet debt is at fixed rates. And we\u2019ve reached our post-Rexam target leverage levels with net debt to comparable EBITDA at 3.3 times as of year-end, leaving us well positioned in a rising interest rate environment.","Our 2018 stock buyback exceeded $700 million and we paid approximately $140 million in dividends. In 2019, we expect to buyback $1 billion of stock and pay roughly a $135 million in dividends. As of yesterday, we have already acquired roughly a $100 million of stock in 2019.","Looking forward and including 2018, our plan is to buyback approximately 18% of our outstanding shares by mid-2021 or approximately $1 billion of stock annually in 2019, 2020 and 2021. Once completed, we will have successfully repurchased the 75 million shares issued to execute the Brazilian JV and Rexam acquisitions.","As we think about 2019, we continue to expect full year comparable EBITDA of $2 billion and free cash flow in excess of $1 billion after CapEx in the range of $600 million, full year interest expense of approximately $300 million and the full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings will be in the range of 24% for all of 2019 and corporate undistributed should be roughly flat with 2018 levels. By investing in our businesses pursuing bolt-on M&A, repurchasing stock and paying quarterly dividends, we continue to put the cash machine to work for the long-term benefit of our fellow shareholders.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to you John.","John Hayes","Great. Thanks Scott. In 2018 our aerospace business reported 21% revenue growth and 15% operating earnings growth on solid can performance, partially offset by the start-up and ramp up of many of these new contracts and new hires. As part of this, we welcomed 900 new aerospace employees, of which 42% were diverse hires. Given recent contract wins, we anticipate adding at least another 600 employees over the next 12 months.","The entire management team has done a great work to ensure our new people are on-boarded, mentored and trained, our existing people feel part of this success, our facilities are fit and ready for the added throughput and our processes are redesigned and resilient enough for the higher standards expected, all while delivering on our financial commitments.","Looking forward, aerospace is poised to grow earnings in the range of 15% in 2019 and with contracted backlog levels exceeding $2.2 billion and our won-not-booked backlog at $4.7 billion, the future looks bright for at least the next three to five years. As a corporation I truly believe we are positioned for long-term sustainable growth. We continue to manage our asset base with an aviated mindset. We are leading more efforts on our sustainability initiatives to ensure our aluminum packages are positioned as the environmental solution for our customers\u2019 brand portfolios and we are supporting the rapid growth of our aerospace business.","We\u2019re controlling the things we can control, managing headwinds and leveraging our strong free cash flow to invest for the long-term and consistently return value to shareholders via share buybacks and dividends. We continue to reaffirm our 2019 goals of $2 billion of comparable EBITDA and free cash flow in excess of $1 billion. And in 2019, we look forward to exceeding our long-term 10% to 15% diluted earnings per share growth goal.","And with that, Chris, we\u2019re ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead.","Anthony Pettinari","Good morning.","John Hayes","Good morning.","Anthony Pettinari","Yeah. I was wondering if it\u2019s possible to quantify the impact of the supplier issue in North America for 4Q and maybe for 1Q if there is an early view there. And then you spoke about you know step you\u2019re taking to kind of guarantee supply going forward with your suppliers. Do those initiatives -- is that -- does Ball incur costs as a part of those initiatives or just any kind of color you can give there would be helpful?","John Hayes","Sure. In the fourth quarter, as I said in my comments, in first quarter I don\u2019t anticipate any ongoing inefficiencies, this was really marked by late October November. One supplier and it\u2019s a toll relationship with the customer approximately $10 million of the impact is centered around that. Now we are in -- we\u2019re in discussions with this particular supplier and the customer and hope to kind of reconcile that issue and the only issue there was we couldn\u2019t get to the proper accounting treatment in the fourth quarter to recognize the offset.","Daniel Fisher","Yeah. I\u2019d just add on to that. Those are the direct costs and there is many other indirect costs because it force freight rates to be higher because various plants were down as results of that. And so, that\u2019s just the direct cost, but I think it probably had twice the -- double that was for the full impact what happens in the fourth quarter.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay, okay. So it sounds like there is still an impact for out-of-pattern fright in 4Q. I guess same question for 1Q has that kind of dissipated or is there still a freight headwind in 1Q?","John Hayes","No, not ongoing in 1Q. And I guess to answer your other question, it\u2019s we do have people that are certainly supporting the ongoing efforts there, but you\u2019re talking about four to five folks and there\u2019s no ongoing costs by us to help support that initiative.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay, okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe just one quick one for Scott, I\u2019m sorry if I missed this. But for the full year free cash flow guidance is there assumption on working capital embedded in there?","Scott Morrison","There\u2019s not much. We\u2019ve gotten tremendous benefits in the last couple of years. So there is not much benefit expected from working capital on those numbers for $1 billion of cash flow in 2019. It\u2019s really the earnings growth, kind of tax effect the earnings growth and then a couple of hundred million dollars less in CapEx from this year to 2019 gets you to the $1 billion or over $1 billion.","Anthony Pettinari","Understood. I\u2019ll turn it over.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","George Staphos","Thank you. Hi everyone. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question and thanks for all the details. I guess -- and congratulations for the year. I guess the first question I had is around growth. And so, in the last quarter we saw some interesting patterns in terms of can shipments and some of the end market data. One of things that we had heard recently is you\u2019re seeing some pick up in beer consumption partly driven by the new labeling as consumers are starting to sort of look at beer versus alternatives. Are you hearing that or not really from your customers? And then relatively in terms of growth, there was a big pick up in can growth in the fourth quarter in non-alcoholic. It would seem that most of that was around the newer beverages categories that you have sighted, but how much of that is also, at least a part of it was, but -- and how much of that do you think is being driven more by sustainability and the shift out-of-plastic to can specifically within North America? And I have a couple of follow ons.","Daniel Fisher","Sure George. This is Dan. And I would say we didn\u2019t see any -- in North America specifically in big beer versus craft beer versus the other beer categories, we didn\u2019t see anything markedly different than can than what we\u2019ve been seeing for the last several years. Craft beer continues to grow, cans continue to win share there. I would say the new alcoholic categories and the new non-alcoholic categories and product launches, those are disproportionately coming up in cans and that we\u2019ve got IRI data and even Euromonitor data that would suggest that that\u2019s a pretty sizeable shift from new product launches even 18 months, 24 months ago.","George Staphos","All right.","Daniel Fisher","We would believe that sustainability influenced. Our customers aren\u2019t telling us that specifically, but everything would indicate. They\u2019re launching new products in specialty can sizes. They\u2019re garnering better price points. And I don\u2019t know why we continue to build on in already huge issue for a couple of large CPG companies by launching new products and PET. So that\u2019s our view is that is a sustainability move. I think it\u2019s fairly significant, but we think that\u2019s got a lot of tailwind for a longer period of time.","George Staphos","Okay. I mean it remains to be seen, but we\u2019re hearing that even the megabeer guys are starting to see some pick-up in demand, we\u2019ll see if it plays out actually or not. In terms of John\u2026","John Hayes","Definitely in other parts of the world, we\u2019re definitely seeing hectoliter expansion for the first in Russia, for the first time in Brazil. And I think they\u2019re putting more dollars behind the promotional and advertising in big beer in North America tailwind to fourth quarter what we\u2019ve seen to start the year, but whether that trend continues and for how long that will be something we\u2019ll keep our eye on.","George Staphos","Okay. Thank you. John if you could repeat again what you were saying about your value over volume efforts, the commercial activity, the progress, I think that you\u2019ve seen so far. I think you mentioned that some percentage, some large percentage of your contract renewals for the next 18 months are largely done. Can you go back over the details that you had in your formal comments and what implications we should be drawing from that to the extent that you can related to our own forecasting entries, forecasting of all results?","John Hayes","Yeah. George as I said, I think I\u2019ll be repeating myself, but the vast majority of our contracts to come due in North America over the next 18 months are largely concluded. And we signed the agreement not necessarily, but we\u2019ve reached commercial agreement and now we\u2019re getting to the documentation thereof. As you know, many of those kind of kick in at the end of 2019 going into 2020 and that\u2019s why I said the majority of the value of that will come after 2019.","George Staphos","Fair enough. Let me leave it there and I\u2019ll turn it over to the rest of the queue. Thank you.","John Hayes","Thank you, George.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Scott Gaffner","Thanks. Good morning. ","John Hayes","Good morning.","Daniel Fisher","Good morning.","Scott Gaffner","I think you said before that your freight transportation costs in the U.S. had flattened out, but when we look at the recovery from 2018 you had fairly significant headwinds on freight costs. Are you able to recover meaningful amounts of that in 2019 based on the current faster mechanisms you have or do you have to wait more until 2019 when you get contract reset?","Scott Morrison","No. Scott, this is Scott Morrison. We have PPI escalators in our contracts specifically in North America that will -- there\u2019s a catch up to it so we\u2019ll catch up with the PPI escalation and we\u2019re seeing moderation of those other headwinds.","Scott Gaffner","Okay. Dan when you mentioned some weakness in Saudi Arabia, I mean I think you said Turkey, Egypt, India all improved, but Saudi was still weak. Is that a new trend or is that just a continuation of the sugar taxes that were put in place or soda taxes that were put in place in Saudi Arabia over the last year or so?","Daniel Fisher","Just, yeah just a continuation of the sugar tax degradation in that area. Everyone else is -- and it\u2019s -- we feel like it\u2019s stabilized in Q4 and starting off on a piece of foot, but just a stabilized environment. We\u2019re not going to see any appreciable uplift in that country or a JV relationship there for a period of time.","John Hayes","Yeah. And Scott, this is John. I\u2019d just -- financially I\u2019d just point out, you can clearly see that in the equity line where that -- you\u2019ll see the negative impact of that. And Dan can provide you more details.","Scott Gaffner","All right. Last one for me just in the prepared remarks you mentioned 2 billion units of volume growth in North America. Can you remind us what the 2018 number of units in North America were? And then on that volume growth, should we assume that most of that is actually coming in specialty versus 12 ounce? Thanks.","John Hayes","Yeah. I think it will continue to be a similar composition from a specialty standard can, probably a little richer on the specialty is those are the new lines that we put in place. We were kind of mid-to-$46 billion approximately in terms of unit volumes sold. So you put two on top of that in North -- Central America.","Scott Gaffner","Okay. Thanks, guys. Good luck in the quarter.","John Hayes","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please go ahead.","Matthew Krueger","Hey, good morning. This is actually Matthew Krueger sitting in for Ghansham. How are you doing?","John Hayes","Good.","Daniel Fisher","Good. Thanks.","Matthew Krueger","Good, good. So my first question is can you provide a bridge from the $1.83 billion in EBITDA generated during 2018 to the projected $2 billion for 2019 just in terms of any major puts and takes like volume contribution or cost savings initiatives, et cetera, et cetera? ","John Hayes","Sure, let me take a shot of that. So if you think about aerospace, given their growth, we expect them to be up $30 plus million in EBITDA. So you\u2019re starting at $1.830 billion so that\u2019s 30. North America and Central America, we talked about $50 million of fixed cost savings on a full year basis, 2 billion more units of volume with better mix and the rest is the PPI pick-up that I mentioned earlier and moderation of headwinds. All that toll should be something in the neighborhood of a $125 million on a full year basis. Europe, we\u2019ve been able to --they\u2019ve done a great job of improving their margins year-on-year. We\u2019ll get probably another $40 million of growth in EBITDA from both cost out and volume growth.","South America is probably pretty flat and then EMEA and Asia up a little bit. So kind of a slight positive when you combine those together. And then aluminum aerosol or probably can and a little bit of upside in corporate costs. And then you have the absence of the tinplate business for seven months. So all that tolls to a little bit over $2 billion.","Matthew Krueger","That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. And then just expanding a little bit on the cost savings programs, how should we expect the $50 million in cost savings to flow through the North America business kind of on a quarterly cadence? And then can you detail on any of the other cost savings initiatives that we should expect to impact 2019 region-by-region in a similar fashion?","Scott Morrison","Yeah. I would say in North America, all of the facilities are shuttered and our Goodyear facility is probably closer to 90% through the start-up phase. So absent any kind of marginal cost impact in Q1 as the continued ramp up for our Goodyear facility, you should see that almost on an annualized basis streamline throughout the year, the $50 million.","John Hayes","And then maybe a qualitatively on the other cost initiatives if we go through Europe as Scott and Dan had mentioned, Europe has done a very good job from a cost out within the plant perspective. We have the San Martino that came down towards the end of the year. And we also have a lot of transformation from a G&A perspective. And as Scott alluded to, we\u2019ve done a very nice job overall as a corporation on the G&A and particularly in Europe, so kudos to all of them.","I think in South America, we are lapping as Dan said, some headwinds in terms of the INS contract, as well as foregoing some of the business that we were benefiting in the first quarter and even first half of last year, but they\u2019ve done a great job on the cost side. And I think we\u2019re going to have some headwinds year-over-year in the first half of this year, but you\u2019re going to see it reverse in the second half of the year. So I think that\u2019s going well.","We talked about EMEA and the issues going on there and there\u2019s a lot of effort and focus and working with our joint venture partner Saudi to right size that business and really participate in the growth of Turkey, Egypt and other places like he said. And then lastly in North America, Scott mentioned -- Scott and Dan mentioned the $50 million. We also have been putting a lot of effort on making sure that from an efficient supply demand point of view that we\u2019re minimizing any of that out-of-pattern freight that we experienced last year.","Matthew Krueger","Great. That\u2019s very helpful. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Neel Kumar with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Neel Kumar","Hi, good morning.","John Hayes","Good morning.","Daniel Fisher","Good morning.","Neel Kumar","I was wondering if could you talk about what plants in particular were impacted by the aluminum issue and you still generated 4% volume growth in North America despite the downtime at the affected plants. So how are you able to increase production at your other plants given that they were likely already running at capacity from the oversold industry?","Daniel Fisher","Well we, number one to answer your question, we drew down inventories to do that. We\u2019re not going to go into specifics of what plants were affected, that\u2019s not what we do, but recall that we only have a limited number of metal suppliers. And so, any given -- a metal supplier probably serves multiple plants and you should think about it that way.","Neel Kumar","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then in terms of the commercial opportunity you\u2019ve talked in the past about some contract renegotiations in Europe in 2019. Could you give an estimate of what percent of contracts could be up for renegotiation there?","John Hayes","Well, we -- I'm sorry. What year, at the end of 2019, did you say?","Neel Kumar","For the end of 2018 and 2019?","John Hayes","Yeah. Okay. Yeah, approximately a quarter or so of our European volume was renegotiated and we\u2019re pleased with where we are right now.","Neel Kumar","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Langton with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tyler Langton","Good morning. Thank you. I just had a question on European volumes and I guess up 8% this year. Could you just talk a little bit about I guess what was Russia and what was Europe and then just kind of thoughts for this year, as you know it\u2019s tough comps, but I guess you\u2019re still seeing good growth and benefiting from substitution, so just some color there would be great?","Daniel Fisher","Sure. In Russia as you recall had the World Cup and strong summer and benefited from actually some legislative actions in Russia moving away from some larger PET. And so, they grew at approximately 20% for the year. In Central and Eastern Europe we had one customer, large customer that grew nearly 10% that we have a sole supply relationship with. And then we stepped into the new Cabanillas facility, we stepped into a new contract. So in the second half of the year you saw Iberia grow year-over-year north of 10%. That was contractual volume. But you saw solid growth low-to-mid single-digits in the Nordics in the UK and other parts, but the three large areas that really drove our volume were Iberia, Central and Eastern Europe and Russia.","John Hayes","Yeah. Just to add on to that and it gets to an earlier question about the whole sustainability. You know some of the bigger -- what\u2019s perceived is more mature markets. Just to give you context and I think about the UK, I think of France, I think of Germany. In the fourth quarter alone the UK was up 7%, France was up 7.5% and Germany was up around 20% so that is on relatively flat overall liquid consumption. So I think that strength does reinforce our belief around this whole sustainability movement.","Tyler Langton","Got it. Thanks. And then Scott, could you just update us sort of the shared services savings I don\u2019t know if there was sort of lump in sort of the segments when you provided the sort of the EBITDA bridge before, but just what you\u2019re expecting there?","Scott Morrison","That\u2019s really kind of spread everywhere. So there\u2019s some of it shows up in corporate, but some of it shows up in the business. So we don\u2019t really break it down that way, but that\u2019s part of the improvement across the board. When you look at the operations as John mentioned, the cost out that they\u2019ve done in South America and Europe and in North America as well. So it\u2019s kind of spread across the board.","Tyler Langton","Got it. Okay. Thanks so much.","John Hayes","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Arun Viswanathan","Right. Thanks for taking the question. You know you guys had talked about kind of 2% to 4% bevcan volume growth over the next little while; obviously there were some issues in Q4 related to metal. But how do you feel about that forecast, any potential upside or downside given some trends in non-12 ounce and maybe you can just give us your view and also tie that in with your regional expectations? Thanks.","Daniel Fisher","Yeah. It\u2019s a great question. I would say my lean would be based on what we saw in the second half of the year, what we saw in Q4 particularly and in conversations with our customers and anticipated forecast going into next year and even through our strap pulling period. There would be reason to believe that we could grow at an accelerated cliff above what we\u2019ve -- kind of historical norm would have been. So, and I think a lot of that is just probability affecting and assessing the impact of sustainability and how fast that will move. That\u2019s the biggest question mark, but we\u2019re certainly excited about it and believe we\u2019ve got more tailwind there than anything else.","John Hayes","Yeah. As Dan had mentioned, just the full year our global volumes were up a little over 2%, but in the fourth quarter they were up 4%. So I think that\u2019s a good proof point in terms of the momentum we\u2019re seeing.","Arun Viswanathan","Appreciate that. And just as a follow up, in Brazil, have you noticed any changes in the market? Have things gotten better or worse and any thoughts around political shifting that would affect that? Thanks.","Daniel Fisher","We\u2019ve been actually reasonably encouraged by the political shift. We know that -- and from an overall market, you have the new entrant, but with the growth rates that are there and I think John\u2019s commented on this historically, it doesn\u2019t take much growth outside a 4%, 5% and the markets start absorbing all the excess capacity that was introduced. So we think heading into 2019 and the plan period here that market is definitely tightening and there is reason to believe that there is margin expansion opportunities going forward.","Arun Viswanathan","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Maguire","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Daniel Fisher","Good morning.","John Hayes","Good morning.","Brian Maguire","I just wanted to come back to the comments around the $2 billion can production growth in North America in 2019. Just wondering if you could give a sense of how much of that is just replenishing the inventories you drew down in the quarter due to the aluminum sheet issue. I ask because it seems like the end markets probably aren\u2019t growing that much even with the upsurge we saw in the fourth quarter can shipments in the U.S. were up less than a million this year. So just wondering if that comment is indicative of you guys expecting to take a little bit of market share here in 2019 or are you expecting the market growth rate to kind of meaningfully pick up from where it has been the last couple of years?","Daniel Fisher","Yeah, I would -- good question. I would look at it as -- keep in mind in 2018 we shut our three facilities, we stood up new four line can plant; we added some additional specialty capacity in Conroe all with an eye towards contracting that volume which we have done historically. So there is a piece of this where we\u2019re stepping into increased specialty volume. It\u2019s been contracted; there is good line of sight there. We do think the market is going to grow at an accelerated rate in North America versus what we saw in 2018 largely on the basis of the second half movements and new product introductions. The 2018 versus 2019 for us, we will grow at an accelerated rate versus the market. But again, those are contracted volumes that were initialized by our footprint.","John Hayes","Yeah. And I\u2019d just layer on top of that. Remember over the last some years we\u2019ve put an extremely large focus on specialty. And we can go West Coast to East Coast, North to South and we have a network and footprint that we think is better than any of our peers. And as a result of that, as these new product introductions and the shift from standard containers to specialty, it falls right in the sweet spot of what we\u2019ve been focused on.","Brian Maguire","Okay. I appreciate that. Just as a follow up, this one might be a little bit of an accounting one. But Dan, I think you mentioned the $10 million impact in the fourth quarter from the aluminum issue that there was a toll in customer and there was just some of the accounting didn\u2019t let you recognize maybe offsetting compensation in the quarter. So do you get $10 million back in 2019, is there some kind of pass through or compensation from the customer here?","Daniel Fisher","We have to wait until we resolve the issue and then we\u2019ll let you know.","Brian Maguire","Okay. But anything embedded in the 2019 outlook or the $50 million kind of comment of fixed cost saving, I guess that will be separate, but just anything embedded in the 2019 outlook for that?","Daniel Fisher","No.","Brian Maguire","No? Okay. I appreciate that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Debbie Jones","Hi. Good morning. I\u2019m going to be the another person asking on the $2 billion can number you threw out there. But could you comment on -- is this really being driven on the specialty side by a couple of customers shifting into specialty or using it or are you seeing this is very broad-based? And then also how much of the growth in 4Q and the number that you\u2019re throwing out for 2019 do you think is related to the sustainability efforts of some to your customers?","Daniel Fisher","Just to parse out the sustainability one, but if we\u2019re -- it could be 1% to 2% of growth in specific markets where this is a bigger issue and it\u2019s more broad, it\u2019s in Western Europe, it\u2019s in the UK and it\u2019s starting to manifest in the U.S. The other question was on specialty and I would just -- Debbie I would reference the fact that in North America we have 800 customers. So it\u2019s across the entire breadth of those customers, it\u2019s not a singular focus of one or two, it\u2019s everyone\u2019s moving.","John Hayes","Yeah. And as -- in the fourth quarter our specialty was up 13% in North America. And when you look it\u2019s everything Dan just said, it was traditional CST, it was spiked seltzer, it was beer, it was energy, it was all new categories, emerging wine, seltzer waters et cetera. So it truly is broad-based.","Debbie Jones","Okay. Thank you. And second question, there has been an announcement of a new can plant in the Europe, I think in Belgium with the new entrant and we\u2019ve received a lot of questions about it. So I wanted to just see if you had any thoughts on it. I do think that the European industry is growing enough to absorb this, but I think investors are a little confused as how to think about it and how it might impact some of the larger players there?","John Hayes","Yeah. Well, I might point out a couple of things. The overall can industry in Europe grew by in the range of 4 billion units or so in 2018. It\u2019s our best understanding that this new entrant is a small one line facility in the Benelux region focused on one customer that\u2019s going to be using standard containers. So you have to put this in context. I do think as we look forward, we\u2019ve -- as Dan had mentioned, we have some new capacity, obviously Spain coming up, but we\u2019ve put some new lines in Serbia as well as Switzerland. And so we\u2019ve been growing. And so we fully anticipate other people that are going to be investing to meet the demands of the market.","Debbie Jones","Okay. Thanks. I\u2019ll turn it over.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Edlain Rodriguez with UBS. Please go ahead.","Edlain Rodriguez","Thank you. Good morning, guys.","Daniel Fisher","Good morning.","Edlain Rodriguez","Just one quick one. I mean you seemed pretty confident in achieving your targets for 2019, but when you look at everything that\u2019s going on, like what do you see like the most risk in achieving those targets?","John Hayes","Well, I mean this is John Hayes. Maybe I\u2019ll take this. I think a lot of what Scott Morrison laid out in the bridge is in our control. Obviously we had some metal issues in late 2018; we\u2019re out of our control. We have been very focused on making sure number one the situation getting better; number two, we have sufficient supply; and number three, we\u2019re working on other alternatives longer term so that we have a plan B if something like that were to happen.","Obviously this whole sustainability provides big tailwind for us, but if for some reason there is a big dislocation in the demand side of our business around the global that could have an impact. But I will point to the financial crisis of 2008 when our volumes in the worst quarter were down 4%. So we don\u2019t expect that to happen. I think really the biggest risk to us is our ability or inability to execute on what we have in front of us right now.","Edlain Rodriguez","Okay. That makes sense. That\u2019s all I have.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris -- excuse me, Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Chip Dillon","Yes. Good morning, everyone. I thought I\u2019d be the first one perhaps to ask the question about what your, one of your fastest growing businesses which is aerospace. And you mentioned some pretty large growth initiatives there including the employee growth and I believe you said the income growth of 15% 20 versus 2018. However, it looks like looking at your backlog that we could see either several years of that kind of growth or maybe it could even accelerate in 2020 and 2021. And so, obviously not knowing everything, but just given your current line of sight, what kind of progress do you think we will see in 2020 and 2021 especially given the 30% plus increase in the employee base?","Daniel Fisher","I think the logic you just laid out is sound and we would agree with that with one caveat. Our government, we rely on our government to be operating efficiently and funded effectively and we just have come out of the longest of furlough in the history of the U.S. government there is potentially that going forward. It has not affected us to date, but strategically when you\u2019re running the deficits that we are, something is going to give. That\u2019s why we talk about both funded backlog which is money good and then won-not-booked.","And as we said repeatedly over the last six or nine months the won-not-booked we feel good about, but there is some risk to that going forward and that affects the 2020, 2021, 2022 timeframe. And so as we sit here today, the thing I would be focused on the most is about that because the rest of it\u2019s in our control.","Chip Dillon","Got you. Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And then just quickly, as -- you guys give us great data for example on volumes and periodically you tell us your mix with specialty versus standard. It just seems with especially the categories that are growing that you\u2019re seeing so much more growth now in the specialty area. And I didn\u2019t know like for example, if we took this the 2% companywide growth last year, is it fair to say standard or down, I don\u2019t know mid-single-digits and specialty waiver took that? And just so that we get a better view or sense of what the mix is doing?","John Hayes","Yeah. Chip, I\u2019ll tell you this, our specialty globally grew for the year at around 9% and it\u2019s approximately 39% or 40% of our mix. So when you do the math you can see standard had declined. And that\u2019s why, to Dan\u2019s point, we took out three facilities in North America in 2018. That\u2019s why we closed the San Martino, Italy plant which was a standard container. So we\u2019ve been managing this mixed shift as we go forward. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been investing on all these specialty lines.","Chip Dillon","Okay. And last one quickly, as you look out past 2019, you\u2019re giving -- CapEx is coming down, you\u2019ve listed a lot of growth opportunities you wanted to jump on top of. Again, based on your line of sight, is 600 something we would -- you would -- would be a good best guess for 2020 or are there reasons it could go up or down from what you see today?","Daniel Fisher","Yeah. Chip, I would use 600, I think it\u2019s a good proxy. We really -- there is a lot of growth in there, it\u2019s probably up $50 million from where we were six months ago in terms of accelerating things and kind of bringing them to the left to take advantage of some of this growth. I would use that as a decent proxy, but if the sustainability thing really takes off, we could spend more money, but we\u2019re going to do it just like we\u2019ve always done with the mindset of putting capital to work where we\u2019re getting the right returns.","Chip Dillon","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Adam Josephson","Good morning. Thanks. Thanks everyone. Dan just a couple of questions on the sustainability topic again, I think Brian was asking about your outlook for the U.S. market, it was up 0.6% last year and you\u2019re expecting that to accelerate and you saw the acceleration, particularly in the fourth quarter. Do you tie that directly to this sustainability move that you\u2019re talking about? Is there any other reason why you think shipments meaningfully accelerated in the fourth quarter and that you\u2019re expecting them to accelerate in 2019 versus 2018?","Daniel Fisher","Yeah. It\u2019s a good question. I don\u2019t think I have the answer, but my thesis would be it\u2019s largely because of sustainability. I mean we know that the large CPG players in particular, they don\u2019t have a very attractive mix shift. I mean some of their CEOs were getting beat up pretty good over in Davos a week ago. And the one thing we can point to, Adam, I just keep coming back to new product launches. We\u2019re seeing much more activity in and around innovation from a can perspective and we\u2019re dealing with the marketing groups in the large CPG companies and we are attributing it to in North American, Western Europe, UK, the Nordics to sustainability being a fairly significant driver of that.","John Hayes","Yeah. Just one little proof point, this is on more the alcohol side, but craft beer is our best estimation that for the first time ever cans as a share of the packaged mix is now over 40% in the craft market. Our volumes in craft are still up well in excess of 30% despite overall volume of craft, meaning liquid volume up only about 1%. So that sustainability, we can\u2019t point to any specific fact to tell you that\u2019s the case, but I do think that there is a consumer trend out there that\u2019s much more focused on us.","Adam Josephson","Thanks. And Dan just on Europe, I think you said volume was up 8% for the year if I\u2019m not mistaken and forgive me for missing this. Did you give any expectation for 2019 in terms of European volume? And again, how much of that -- how much of whatever growth you\u2019re expecting would you attribute to that same sustainability movement?","Daniel Fisher","I would think it\u2019s going to be a little off that. I mean keep in mind it was unprecedented weather conditions and a lot of big beer drinking jurisdictions, but you know I could see mid-single digits. And again, I think where we play and where our network is we may grow at a faster rate than the overall market just because of our customer mix, Russia continues to be incredibly strong, we\u2019ll lap our Iberian new contracts and the standup of Cabanillas. But I\u2019d say market -- you know 4% to 5% we could do better. That\u2019s certainly our plan and our hope.","Adam Josephson","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Deanna Stottler with Ball Corporation. Please go ahead. Looks like line has disconnected.","Daniel Fisher","Chris, unless there is any other questions I\u2019d recommend we conclude.","Operator","Okay. We do have one more question in the queue from the line of Mark Wilde with Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead. ","Mark Wilde","Good morning, John. Good morning, Dan.","Daniel Fisher","Good morning.","Mark Wilde","Just curious to come back to Europe, how much capacity do you have or how much could you grow in 2019 just given your capacity base?","Daniel Fisher","Yeah. It\u2019s a good question. We have, as indicated in the prepared comments, we have added a couple of lines one in Serbia that just came on line actually last week, I was over there earlier this week. Another line in Central and Eastern Europe that one is ready to go, we haven\u2019t flipped the switch on. And then ramp up curves in basically in Spain stepping into improved efficiencies there and approved efficiencies across the rest of the jurisdiction. ","But we\u2019re certainly tight; we\u2019ve got a couple of pockets of opportunity to continue to grow. But keep in mind, historically we\u2019ve always got speed up opportunities, we\u2019ve got a laundry list of areas where we can spend minimal capital. And we\u2019ve waited for this tailwind and it\u2019s here now. And so we\u2019re not going to miss out on volume opportunities at the right price.","Mark Wilde","Okay. And Dan I\u2019m just curious over in Europe in terms of bottled waters or whatever picking up. I know that you\u2019ve got a lot of people that are interested in looking at the format, but I wonder whether capacity constraints right now make it hard for some of those customers to make a large move. So what kind of conversations are you having, and is there a potential that we could see one or two very large moves over there at some point or do you think it will be just more kind of incremental?","Daniel Fisher","There will absolutely -- yeah, there will absolutely be the opportunity for large moves. The constraint is not necessarily on our end, it would be some of those major customers making filling investments in their infrastructure. So we wouldn\u2019t be the deterrent for those moves. I mean we\u2019re in front of a number of them right now as they\u2019re contemplating shifts. There is an off a lot happening from independent start-ups that are driving that inertia from some of the big CPG players.","I do think that that is something that we\u2019re having conversations on, something that we believe will happen. It will probably start at the high end of the water market, but you know depending on what legislation hits and single use water bans that are popping up that conversations happening everywhere now, something will be a catalyst for a major move and we will have enough time hopefully to move into that in a meaningful and a smart way.","Mark Wilde","Okay. And then if I could, Scott, you mentioned the PPI escalators. I\u2019m just curious, PPI I think kind of has been moving up maybe 3%, 3% plus, but you might had a much bigger move in freight cost. So will the PPI really catch you up for freight this year fully?","Scott Morrison","Good morning, Mark. It probably won\u2019t offset the -- if you look back -- kind of probably what timeframe you\u2019re looking back, but if you look back at our incremental freight cost all of 2018, the PPI will offset a large portion of that, but not all.","Mark Wilde","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks very much. Good luck in 2019.","Scott Morrison","Thanks.","John Hayes","Thank you.","Daniel Fisher","Okay.","John Hayes","Chris, I think we\u2019re concluded. So thank you all for participating. And we look forward to having a successful and productive 2019 and talking to you three months from now. Thanks everyone.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the conference call for today.

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, August 4, 2016.","I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, CEO. Please go ahead, sir.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Great. Thank you, Dmitra and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's second quarter 2016 results.","The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K, and in other company SEC filings, as well as the company news releases. If you don't already have our second quarter earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the pro forma's reference in today's presentation and the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website and in today's webcast slides.","Now joining me on the call today is Scott Morrison, our Senior Vice President and CFO. I'll provide a brief overview of our company's performance. Scott will discuss financial and global packaging metrics, and then I'll finish up with comments on our aerospace business.","In addition, while we normally do not give short-term guidance, given the complexity related to the simultaneous acquisition of Rexam and divestment of those assets required by the various regulatory agencies, as well as the purchase accounting and transaction-related activities related to such, we will be providing more assistance than typical on the outlook over the next couple years from an earnings and cash flow perspective.","In his comments, Scott will give you some visibility as to where we are and what we see over the next 18 months at our company, and I'll talk a bit about our aspirations with respects to the earnings and cash flow generation capabilities over the long term.","The momentum in our business is visible from today's earnings release. Our strong second quarter results were operations-led. We couldn't be prouder of our team to execute on our existing business while planning for the integration. As we had mentioned on the past couple of conference calls, we expected to gather earnings momentum as the year went on, and this is exactly what is happening. We have strategically and operationally positioned Ball for a multiyear value-compounding period of growth on all key financial measures.","Now in the second quarter, we began producing cans on our second line in our new Monterrey, Mexico, beverage facility, serving our growing customers under long-term contracts. We began production in our new Myanmar facility. We improved operational performance in our Food and Aerosol business, we grew our aerospace contracted backlog to over $1 billion, and we closed on the acquisition of Rexam while completing the required sale of the Divestment business. Now, that's one heck of a first half. The second half and beyond is where the real fun begins. It feels really good to finally have the steering wheel firmly in our grip following 17 months of external oversight and regulatory reviews.","Rest assured that our people executing our integration and value-capture initiatives have skin in the game, and we are all aligned with our fellow shareholders from an EVA and share ownership perspective. I'll share more about our exciting future in my closing comments.","So, Scott will now talk a bit about the second quarter performance, the baseline to work off of and some key financial metrics so that the strength and trajectory of our businesses and cash flow can be seen through the fog of purchase and acquisition accounting. Scott?","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, John. I'll try to keep this as simple as possible, and we ask that the folks following our company align with our framework and financial metrics that we're able to provide at this time. I plan to bucket my comments in three areas, where we have been, where we are now, and where we are going.","Let me start with where we have been. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share for second quarter 2016 were $1.05 versus last year's $0.89, an 18% increase. Second quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflects strong year-over-year operational improvement, lower aluminum premiums, and a more normal level of corporate costs, partially offset by higher interest costs, a higher share count, and the tail end of startup costs related to recently completed projects.","Our GAAP results for the first half were impacted by transaction-related hedging, purchase accounting, and other customary closing adjustments. Details are provided in note 2 of today's earnings release, and additional information will also be provided in our 10-Q, expected to be filed next week. For a complete summary of second quarter results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis and details regarding the second quarter, please refer to the notes section of today's earnings release, which includes a simplified table format summarizing business consolidation activities.","Our Metal Beverage Americas and Asia segment comparable operating earnings for second quarter 2016 were up year-over-year due to solid volumes and operational performance in North America and Brazil and cost-out initiatives in China, which is helping to offset some of the impact of price compression in that region. The segment also saw a few million dollars of net startup costs in the quarter.","Now that we've completed the legacy capital projects, we do not expect any notable comments on startup costs for the rest of the year. Segment volumes in the quarter were up just over 2%, with China volumes being down upper single digits as weather impacted demand and we proactively managed our business due to competitive industry pricing in that country. Americas volumes were up 4.5% in the second quarter, and specialty volume continues to grow nicely with specialty being up just over 10% in the first half.","European Beverage comparable earnings were up nicely in the quarter due to the final benefit of aluminum premium tailwinds and low single-digit volume growth. The Europe market continues to grow. Industry supply-demand remains tight and specialty demand remains strong.","Food and Aerosol comparable segment earnings improved in the quarter due to strong global demand for aerosol containers and improved operational performance, offset by high single-digit food can volume declines due to timing of the Midwest pack related to our customer mix. Initiatives to further improve production efficiencies are on track and set to benefit early 2017 performance.","In summary, our Global Packaging businesses continue to be extremely focused on integrating the new assets, achieving their synergy goals, and driving EVA dollars from the recent capital and efficiency projects. Thank you again to all of our Global Packaging people.","Now, as we speak about our results going forward, we will adjust for and identify all one-time items impacting free cash flow and operating earnings; things like fees associated with the transaction, severance and accelerated compensation payments, the special one-time tax payment on the estimated gain on sale, et cetera, so that the underlying strength of the business is clear.","Make no mistake, we have a cash machine on our hands. The business we acquired is not fundamentally different than our legacy business. It has great potential to generate cash. In 2016, the free cash flow will be clouded by all the one-off impacts and how much working capital we can squeeze out of the newly combined business in the back half of the year. Regardless, we see no deterioration and definitely potential in the comparable pro forma business.","As we look at where we are now and for the remainder of 2016, let's start with the baseline. Using the U.S. pro formas filed in early July and today's reported first half performance, on a last 12 months basis, the business would roughly have been $1.53 billion of comparable EBITDA, which represents $1.1 billion of comparable operating earnings plus $430 million of depreciation and amortization. This comparable EBITDA excludes amortization of customer-related intangibles of approximately $140 million annually, and approximately $60 million of one-time inventory step-up.","Our baseline adjusted net debt is approximately $7 billion, which takes into account the repayment of Rexam's revolver, private placement, and hybrid debt, settlement of derivatives, the UK change-of-control pension payment, and the cash payment to the Rexam shareholders.","As we think about the second half of 2016, here are some key metrics to keep in mind. We expect full year 2016 comparable operating earnings just north of $1 billion. And to be clear, our comparable EPS going forward will exclude the amortization associated with acquired customer intangibles, which should be in the range of $70 million for the second half of 2016. Also excluded from comparable EPS would be roughly $60 million of inventory step-up, most of which will occur over the remainder of 2016.","The full year weighted average diluted shares outstanding for 2016 will be in the range of 161 million shares, which reflects the half year impact of the 32 million shares issued for the acquisition. For third quarter and fourth quarter, weighted average diluted shares outstanding will be approximately 177 million.","Full year 2016 interest expense will be in the range of $230 million, given the negative carry associated with the timing of when the acquired revolver, private placement, and hybrid debt came out, third quarter interest expense should run about $7 million higher than fourth quarter. The full year effective tax rate for 2016 on comparable earnings is now expected to be in the range of 28%, taking into account the earnings distribution of the combined company going forward.","Corporate undistributed is estimated to be in the range of $105 million for full year 2016, which includes second half incremental costs of approximately $30 million to support the integration from locations such as Millbank, Rexam's former global headquarters location, which we will exit by December 2016.","As we referenced in the debt reconciliation included in our earnings release, the funded status of acquired pensions was improved by the change-of-control payment made to the UK pension plan at the closing of the transaction. For the remainder of 2016, approximately $50 million of pension funding will occur in the U.S. plan. And given the size of the remaining cash transaction-related payments to be made during the remainder of 2016, we do not anticipate a meaningful reduction in net debt by year-end.","So now, where are we going? As you can view on the reconciliation backup slide provided on our website and based on current operating conditions and FX rates, our preliminary target for 2017 comparable operating earnings is a range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, excluding the effect of approximately $140 million of intangible amortization.","For 2017, we expect interest expense of approximately $280 million, a 28% effective tax rate, and full year weighted average diluted share count of approximately 177 million.","Given that we are just 35 days post-close, our early estimate for full year 2017 free cash flow, after $500 million of CapEx, is that we'll be in the range of $750 million to $850 million, excluding one-time items related to the transaction, which is a great step towards our goal of free cash flow being in excess of $1 billion by 2019.","And with that, I'll turn it back to you, John.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thanks, Scott. Our aerospace business reported second quarter results that were relatively flat with last year. However, I'm happy to report that our contracted backlog closed the quarter at over $1 billion, with approximately 70% under a cost-plus approach and 30% more of a fixed price nature, which provides a good balance going forward. We are ramping up and staffing up for all of the new contracts, which will benefit second half and future years' performance. We're excited about the prospects of this business and, politics aside, we have more opportunities for growth assuming the government does not go into any prolonged continuing resolution.","Now, across the company and as we look forward, as Scott mentioned, by year-end 2017, we currently believe we should achieve $150 million of synergies for the year and grow our operating earnings even greater than that on the back of our prior capital growth projects, and show improvement in all of Ball's businesses. While recognizing it is early days in the integration process, we have more visibilities into the opportunities we thought possible. And while no doubt there will be challenges, we still expect to generate in excess of $300 million of synergies by the end of 2019. And as Scott said, we are also tracking towards our goal to grow our comparable annualized free cash flow to \u2013 in excess of $1 billion. And when our leverage gets to the 3 times to 3.5 times debt-to-EBITDA range, we are poised to execute a more robust share repurchase program.","In summary, our company has taken a step-change forward as a result of this acquisition. And whether it be in the commercial arena, our cost-out efforts, our supply chain and footprint work, our innovation efforts, positioning the can as the most sustainable packaged in the beverage world, and\/or any other area, we are going to take our responsibility as a leader seriously.","And with our current aspiration of generating $2 billion of comparable EBITDA and in excess of $1 billion of comparable free cash flow by 2019, we see a clear path to growing EVA dollars, which will allow us to double our long-term goal of 10% to 15% comparable diluted earnings per share growth over each of the next several years.","And with that, Dmitra, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please go ahead.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey, guys. Good morning. Appreciate all the detail in the slide deck, so thanks for that.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","On the LTM EBITDA at the end of 2Q of $1.53 billion and a $1.8 billion midpoint for 2017, obviously synergies alone should be $150 million, based on your parameters. Can you, John, give us some of the other assumptions? Volume growth by region, and also the benefit from the growth initiatives, Monterrey and Myanmar, and also some of the growth that Rexam was also executing upon.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, well, you're absolutely right. When you look at what we have just said, there's year-over-year on a relative to the LTM, we expect $200 million to $300 million more of comparable operating earnings. $150 million of that is from the synergies we expect to realize and the balance of it comes from a variety of things. But let's not forget, over the last 18 months to two years, we have spent a fair amount of growth capital, whether it's building a new facility in Monterrey, the contour bottles, Myanmar, Lublin ends, India impact extruded, our new G3 technology devices, or other things, we expect to get the returns on that capital employed. And I think that makes up the back half of that.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","So just to quantify on the volume side, what do you think the various regions would look like?","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think, let's take a step back and say where the various regions are. United States actually has had two quarters as an industry of positive volume growth. We've had a little bit more than that just because of our customer mix and some of the new Monterrey facility, which is great. The can continues to win in the United States. I'd say that as we \u2013 here in the summer months, it's slowed up a little bit over the last month or so, but nothing appreciably. But if you assume relatively flat growth in the United States, that's probably a good parameter.","Down in Brazil, it's been relatively flat, down a little bit. Ball's, again because of our customer mix, has done fairly well. But we're expecting the second half of this year and going into 2017 to be relatively flat. It could be down a little bit at the second half of this year after the Olympics are finished up, only because the economy is challenged. Europe continues to be a growth area. It's up a couple percent year-to-date and we expect that. And then when you look at Asia, you have to look at China and as well as Southeast Asia. China continues to grow strong, but we actually have been declining, in part because we're trying to rationalize our business and not make these cans for practice.","Southeast Asia continues to grow mid to upper single digits. And then in some of the newer regions that we're getting our hands around, whether it's Middle East, whether it's even Russia \u2013 I think Russia is doing reasonably okay. The Middle East is a mixed bag. We can talk about what's going on in Turkey; we can talk about the challenges that Egypt is having with their currency; you can talk about some other places. But I think those fundamentals that I just laid out, we don't expect appreciable differences. But I do expect and we do expect as we go forward the can is going to continue to do well relative to other substrates.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Just one question for Scott on the projection of net debt of $6.3 billion by the end of 2017, basically a $700 million reduction versus 2Q. Can you bridge that for us? How much in combined cash restructuring are you estimating, and also working capital contribution? Thanks so much.","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","At this point, there's not a huge amount of working capital. If you just bridge from the pro forma to that debt reduction next year, you'll have some element of working capital reduction; but really it's too early to call how much working capital. And then we just \u2013 $500 million for CapEx is a good marker at this point. But as we get further into this year and as we get probably to the January call, we'll give a lot more clarity as to what we think the cash flow will look like.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, the only other thing, Ghansham, I would add is let's not forget also we pay a dividend. And so in that net debt range at the end of 2017, that also is included.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks so much, guys.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Langton with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just on the 2019 free cash flow guidance, I know, Scott, you said it's a little early to know the exact timing of working capital gains. But should we assume there's working capital gains in that number, or should it largely be achieved in 2017 and 2018?","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No, I think if you look at what we've been able to do on our balance sheet, we've been able to get working capital out for a number of years in a row. And while it's way too early to talk about 2019, being an EVA company we focus on our balance sheet every day. And so that tends to lead itself to all kinds of opportunities, a lot of which we probably don't see at this point. But I think we have good alignment with the new folks that have joined our company, and it will be an ongoing process to get after that on a year-on-year basis for the next few years.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it; okay, thanks. And then the EPS guidance from 2017 to 2019, for EPS to double your long-term goal of the 10% to 15%, does that include any share repurchases in those numbers?","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, as I said in my comments, once we get to 3 times to 3.5 times range, we will be dedicating our cash flow to a share repurchase program. So by definition in 2017, will we? It's unclear. It really depends on when we get to those targets. But the sooner we can get to that 3 time to 3.5 times range, the sooner we'll be buying back our stock.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. The final question, just with the special incentive plan and then the deposit program you laid out in the 8-K earlier in the week, could you just provide some detail, I guess, on number of people who are eligible? How deep it will extend into the organization; any details around that would be great.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, good questions. Two programs there. When I talked about we all have skin in the game, that's what I was referring to. There's a special incentive program that actually does go pretty deep in the organization, gets into the plant level. It's broad-based, distributed. The measurements are very similar to what we've done in the past; so that is tried and true. It's based on EVA dollar generation and on free cash flow generation, relative to our expectations and what our board signed up on the acquisition. And so it's a 3.5-year program and it's paid out in stock, which is another important component of that.","The second one is a deposit share program. It's a bit more limited for \u2013 we have done a number of these programs, a number \u2013 three or four of these over the past 15 years or so. The concept is up to a certain amount by individual, that individual has to buy their own stock and then would get a restricted stock that lapses over a period of time. In this case, I believe it's four years so long as they hold on to the existing stock. So you have to put your own money in, and then you'll be matched up to a certain point. And we think both of those have served us very well over the past 15 years, 20 years and it's just a reaffirmation that we're making sure that we, as people within Ball Corporation, are completely aligned with all of our shareholders.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right, great. Thanks again for all the details.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. Regarding the $150 million synergies by the end of 2017, do you have any thoughts on which buckets might be driving those synergies in the next 12 months, 18 months in terms of procurement, G&A, best practices, versus which buckets may be a little bit more back-end weighted? And then in terms of big moving pieces with the synergies, you obviously identified the London headquarters closure. Are there other big projects we should think about or big components of the synergies?","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, let me just preface it by \u2013 as Scott said, we're 35 days into our 90-day review. But what you're really getting at, kind of a timing issue. And I do think the G&A is more front-end loaded. You mentioned Millbank, which is a good example, which is not immaterial at all. From a sourcing perspective, there are certain things we can get after right away, there's some things that we have to wait for contracts to renew and so that's in process. But whether it's those, whether it's about being more disciplined from a commercial perspective, that's probably a longer-term, multiyear game plan. Managing our networks more efficiently, effective from a \u2013 where you make\/where you ship perspective, that we can probably do that more short-term or around our overall fixed-cost leverage and some of that can be short term, some of it can be longer term.","I really do think that we are going to be looking at a multiyear plan, as you all know. But I do think there is some low-hanging fruit upfront. What we aren't going to do is hire an army of accountants to manage what bucket is generating to the million dollars happening where. We're confident that we can reach in excess of $300 million by the end of 2019. And as we said, we're pretty confident that we can get at least $300 million during 2000s \u2013 or excuse me, $150 million during 2017.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's very helpful. And then, John, just following up on one of your earlier comments. Rexam had invested in some regions like Middle East, Russia, India, where Ball had chosen not to. And now that you've been able to get a closer look at Rexam's assets, I guess you'd call them frontier markets, how would you characterize the return levels there? And are there areas or regions where further capacity adds makes sense, or alternately where maybe the returns met the Rexam threshold but not the Ball threshold and you might consider pruning capacity, as you have in China?","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We're still getting our hands around that as part of a 90-day program. In some of the things you have to look at the growth of the market, and then some of the things you have to look at is around risk, and whether it's political risk or economic risk or currency risk. And some of the areas that we've acquired that we hadn't been into are actually better than perhaps we thought. Some of them are not as good as we thought. So it is a mixed bag. As we get to October and into our January conference call, we'll have much more visibility and conviction around our point of view on those things. So, please just give us a little bit of time.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Thank you. I'll turn it over.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Hi, everyone. Good morning.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Congratulations \u2013 good morning. Congratulations on the results and closing the deal in the first quarter out. First question I had for you, John, is there anything that you can relay to us at this juncture about what you might have done differently in your plants that's an opportunity as you bring in the Rexam facilities and vice versa that in turn gives you comfort in the synergy target that you provided? The related question I had is on the corporate expense figure that you gave us for on a pro forma basis. Does that figure, do you think, once you bring on the U.K. headquarters folks and the services related to that, do you think that figure has opportunity to be lessened over time, to be reduced over time?","And my last question and I'll turn it over, on capital spending of $500 million, is there some implied or are there some implied growth projects in that figure that you're not in a position to talk about? Or do you think that's a good number and growth would be additive to that? Thank you.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Let me jump on the first one, and then I'll let \u2013 have Scott weigh in. In terms of what we're seeing and how we might do things similar or different from the old Rexam, one of the things I'll point out is we are very excited about the engagement of the people that we acquired. I think this has reenergized everyone at our company, but also our new employees that are coming in. And anyone who runs businesses knows that if you have the engagement of the people that is a big chunk of it. So we're very, very excited.","When you talk about the assets, you really have to go by region, and so I'll start in South America. They've got some great assets down there, they've got some great people down there and we're very excited about that.","In Europe, they've recently been doing some restructuring in Europe, which is actually helping them there and I think the asset base there is very good. Obviously, we have to divest a majority of our old asset base. But I think on apples-to-apples, it's relatively comparable.","In the United States, we think there is opportunity. I think the level of housekeeping, the level of safety, we're going to have to think about putting a little bit of capital in. But I'm talking about $3 million to $5 million per plant, not wholesale capital, but to get it up to our standards from a quality perspective, from an efficiency perspective, from an output perspective.","And then in many of the other regions that we talked about, many of those assets are relatively new. So while we're getting our hands around that, I think it really more has to do is with \u2013 a question was asked earlier. On a risk-adjusted return basis, would we have done some of the things that they had done? And it's \u2013 let's look forward, not back, and we're going to manage these things as best we possibly can.","On the CapEx and then I'll turn it over to Scott to talk about corporate unallocated. Remember that it's very preliminary, and Scott said the $500 million is a placeholder. What I would tell you is as we think about it, the CapEx really falls into three or four different buckets. Number one, we have a level of maintenance CapEx. We always talked about Ball's was $150 million to $175 million. You ought to think probably adding about $50 million to $75 million onto that for the totality of what we acquired. But then the additional capital is like we always do, and it's tried and true at Ball. It's a bottoms-up approach and it falls into three of our Drive for 10 buckets. It's about, number one, maxing the value, the existing value of what we do. I talked a little bit about some of the opportunities we have in North America.","It also talks about geographic growth where, as you know, we're just \u2013 in the last 12 months we've started up in Mexico and we've started up in Myanmar. There's probably some opportunities there; but we're going to be very judicious about that. And then last but not least in terms of new customers and new products, our specialty continues to grow very strongly. We've been successful in converting our facilities into specialty containers. Rexam hasn't done nearly as much and so there's some probably opportunities along that path, but that's going to be customer and specific opportunity by opportunity. So that's a holistic context way to think about our capital, at least the way we are thinking about our capital going forward. And maybe I'll turn it over to Scott now.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Thanks, John; that's great.","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, on the corporate costs, George, I mentioned $30 million incremental in the second half of the year, so this is kind of a $60 million run rate. We would expect to get a big chunk of that here as we \u2013 a lot of that has to do with Millbank that closes by the end of the year. But we've got to get through that 90-day review to have a better idea of what that corporate cost looks like on an ongoing basis as we get into 2017.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay, Scott. I'll turn it over. Thank you very much.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, George.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your question.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks, John, Scott, and good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. John or Scott, just one on the EBITDA target for 2017. And it sounds like you're expecting about $150 million of synergies from now to then, and there's underlying EBIT growth of about $200 million, it sounds like primarily coming from the recent growth projects. Can you just remind us how much you spent on those projects? So what kind of return on those projects this EBIT or EBITDA target implies.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Adam, one thing I'll point out. When we said there's a $200 million to $300 million of operating earnings growth year-over-year on a comparable basis, not \u2013 I think you said $350 million or something, so I just wanted to level-set you on that, of which $150 million will be coming from it. But if you go back and look at our CapEx over the last couple of years, we've probably spent around $300 million, $350 million plus or minus on some of these growth projects. And if you say that we're EVA-based company and you've got earn 9% after-tax, you can quickly do the math on that and see it's approaching $75 million or so. And then we also have continued efficiency gains and other things, the daily life that we do at Ball in terms of improving our business day-on-day.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks, John. Just a couple of others. The 2019 free cash flow target, what EBITDA growth is implied from 2017 to 2019 in that target roughly?","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we gave in \u2013 on that slide we gave what we believe to be comparable EBITDA 2000 \u2013 or actually I said in 2019, I said \u2013 you might have missed me \u2013 we're approximately $2 billion of comparable EBITDA.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","In 2019? Okay. And just one on Brazil. Can you just talk about what you're seeing there? And to your knowledge is there additional capacity being added there at the moment?","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well, probably like you, it sounds like we've heard that there has been discussions about potential capacity additions in that area. Let's not forget this year the can market has been slightly down actually, but not appreciably; down a couple of percent maximum over it. But the can penetration still continues to go real strong. There has been a bit of a pause here. We'll have to wait and see what happens if there is new capacity put on. I don't want to speculate at all. But we're very much focused on maximizing the value of what we do down there. We've got a great team; we're very excited about the people there, their knowledge of the business, their knowledge of the industry, their knowledge of the customers, and their knowledge of the asset base.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks a lot, John. Best of luck.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, John; good morning, Scott.","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","I wondered, Scott, first of all, that free cash flow guidance for next year, just to be clear. You said that didn't assume any big shifts in working capital?","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No, there's still \u2013 there is some working capital. I would bucket it with a bunch of things working capital, what happens in deferred taxes, what happens in pension. To get to that number, there is other category beyond just operating earnings growth that you need to get, to get to that number.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah, okay. I guess one of the questions people have had is just you guys have done a very effective job of factoring out a lot of your receivables; Rexam hadn't done that. So I'm just curious about how you are thinking about that and what the timeline on that might be.","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well, we're going to look at all the things that we've done over the last number of years, whether it's factoring supply chain finance, managing our inventories better, payable terms. Every lever that we have to pull from a working capital standpoint, we're going to re-look at all of those with the newly acquired business and apply those things. Some of them do take time to put in place and that's why I think there will be incremental benefits over a period of time, over a couple-year period. But everything's on the table. That review \u2013 that 90-day review that we talked about is getting into more detail on all of those things and figuring out okay, what are the opportunities? What are the timing of those opportunities? And then how do they sequence over the next few years?","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And then, John, I'm just curious. With the closing of the deal, has this led to any new, fresh conversations with customers and maybe even talking about different tenures in terms of relationships with some of the customers?","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, absolutely. I mean as you know, we pride ourselves on being customer focused. I do think that the engagement with the customer base right now because there's a lot of change going on is quite active. And it varies by region, it varies by customer and it varies by segment. But rest assured, we are very much focused on being the best in terms of making the can the most sustainable package from an economic perspective, while at the same time being very disciplined from a commercial perspective, ensuring we get paid for our innovation, we get paid for our quality, we get paid for our service and so more to come on this, but rest assured, we're always actively engaged with our customers.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And then just a final question. Any thoughts on further pipeline in the aerospace business in terms of bids that are out there?","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. As we still have a number of won but not booked type of things out there. But what I was saying indirectly in my comments is we're entering the election season, and we are not anticipating many new wins to be booked just because of the ambiguity of the election cycle right now. I think the continuing resolution risk is still out there. And so realistically, it's difficult to assume any meaningful new wins during this election cycle. But we feel really good about the long-term prospects of that business.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks a lot. Good luck.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, gentlemen, and thank you for all the color and the commentary in the slide deck; it's very helpful.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good.","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I wanted to \u2013 kind of two points I wanted to hit on. One, Scott \u2013 and again I appreciate you're still working through the review and don't have everything exactly ticked and tacked yet. But when we think about the timing of the $280 million spend, clearly if you want to get after a good slug of those synergies flowing through next year, there's probably a good component of that coming this year. Would you maybe want to hazard a guess or help us a little bit with the timing of that? I'm guessing probably close to half goes out over the balance of this year. And would the bulk of the rest probably go out in 2017? How would we think about that?","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well, I mean big chunks that I know will go out, so there's a big chunk of severance for folks that are leaving the organization. There was a chunk for compensation for people that were divested to Ardagh. I mentioned some of that pension funding. There's lots of fees and things that have to get paid. But the biggest chunk would be taxes that have to get paid on the gain, which we think is around $250 million. So those are the big chunks that will happen probably by the end of this year. Each quarter, we'll highlight the unusual or one-time, if you will, impacts of those.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then, John, if I could drill into a couple areas within the can business, maybe if we could talk about Mexico for a second and then also talk about China. Within Mexico, it sounds like you have the second line up and running. I know you built that for three. Do you feel that \u2013 how are things going? As you sit today, do you feel that you'll be able to get a third line in there at some point over the next couple years?","And then with respect to China, I know that's been a hotspot where you've had some problems. I think you spent a good bit of time talking about that last quarter. But I think you were going in, putting the full diagnostic suite to work of opportunities to take cost out. What perhaps can be the \u2013 you think can be the outcome in China?","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well, first with respect to Mexico, everything in Mexico is going quite well. The volume growth in Mexico that we're seeing, not only for the Mexican market but for the export out of Mexico, is going very, very well. Our customer is doing quite well and so we're excited about that. I'd rather not put specific timing on new capacity in Mexico, but rest assured the market continues to grow, and we think we've aligned ourselves with the right folks down there; so more to come on that. But nothing has changed from what we've talked about in prior conference calls around our long-term prospects about Mexico.","With respect to China, probably the same holds true. We are executing very well on our cost-out program. As you recall, on the last call, I talked about in excess of $30 million of cost-out, and we are right on track with that. And I give our folks a tremendous amount of credit because without that, it would be a very, very challenging situation in China.","The bigger question is, as you look forward, what does that mean, because you can't save your way to prosperity. We think the industry needs a level of consolidation in the China market. There's too many independent players out there. The strategic question is how that occurs and when it occurs. And I can't go into detail, but we are taking it very seriously because as you look through from a supply-demand perspective, there's too many suppliers chasing too few customers. And every time in the history of our company and the beverage can business when we see that, it speaks to consolidation. How that looks, when it looks, what it looks like, too early to tell.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, that's helpful. Thank you, gentlemen. Good luck.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","Yes, hi. Good morning, John and Scott.","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","First question is just on the timing of the synergy capture. I just want to make sure I get this right. You're saying for the year 2017 you expect $150 million. And so I guess at the end of 2019, it would be in excess of $300 million. So I just want to clarify that. I guess that would suppose you would be somewhere \u2013 hoping to be in the higher $100 millions by the end of 2017 on a run rate basis?","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. We said we would generate $150 million in 2017 \u2013 in excess of $150 million in 2017.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","Got you. So that means you would end the year at a higher level, obviously.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I understand where you're going and I'd rather not go there because we're not going to be \u2013 as I said before, we're not going to be tracking all this. All I know is we have our own goals and aspirations and we're going to generate in excess of $150 million in 2017. And our goal is to generate in excess of $300 million by the end of 2019.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","Okay. And then just looking at the corporate expense, Scott, you mentioned that day one the incremental impact would be around $60 million, which I guess in rough numbers takes you to $130 million to $140 million. How much of that do you think can go away over the next year? And let's say, if you were to make a guess or bracket what 2018 corporate expense would look like, could it be down closer to $100 million by then? Would that be reasonable?","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I'm not giving a 2017 number yet. As I said, we have to go through the 90-day review. And you're right, that's a $60 million run rate. I think a lot of that will come out between now and the end of the year, and so the run rate will be lower than that. How much lower, it's too early to tell yet.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","Okay. And then the last question. John, you mentioned the start \u2013 or think, Scott, sorry \u2013 the start-up costs are largely behind you. And I guess my question is, I believe you guys have a project in the Czech Republic that starts up late this year. And I didn't know \u2013 maybe that's just too small to matter, if I have that right. And then you look at the CapEx for next year being about double that new maintenance level, I would suppose that \u2013 certainly not to the extent you saw this year in the first half, but should we expect some startup experience next year, given that CapEx number?","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You raise a fair point. First and foremost, we are expanding our Czech Republic impact extruded business and it is expected to come on either later this year or early next year. It is \u2013 from the totality of Ball Corporation, I think the startup expense related to that would probably not be material. Within the Food and Aerosol segment, it could be. But I wouldn't get too concerned about that. And then as we go forward on it, the only reason that over the last 18 months we've talked about the startup expense is because we had such a compression and preponderance of these growth capital projects.","I mentioned Monterrey, contour bottle, G3, Lublin ends, India, devices, it all was happening at once and so we felt we needed to point that out. As we go forward, if that were to happen again, which I'm not saying it will but if that were to happen again, we would be as transparent as we can. But I wouldn't get too worried about startup expenses as you look forward.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","Okay. Real quickly, 28%, is that your best guess of a long-term tax rate?","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, for right now that's a good thing to use.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","Thank you.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Philip Ng with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Hey, good morning, guys. The free cash flow guidance for 2017, does that figure include any of the cash cost to realize the synergies and the line conversions as it relates to Ardagh?","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, what we're going to do as we get into next year, we'll highlight any cash costs related to getting after synergies. We'll break things out so that you can decipher exactly what our run rate free cash flow would be versus our one-time cost to get after some of those synergies.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","But just to be clear, it does not \u2013 yes, I'm sorry.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Just to give you a sense of it, if we're talking about severance, for example, cash flow severance, we'll point that out, because that's more one-time in nature. If we're looking at converting a standard line to a specialty line, that's more operating from our perspective. And so, as Scott said, as we go forward, we will lay that out with as much transparency as we're able.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay.","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Phil, in your question, you said something related to Ardagh. I didn't quite \u2013 how does that...","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Yes, I thought there was some part of the divestiture process, you had to agree on converting some lines; I think steel aluminum in Germany. Is that in the CapEx guidance for 2017? And I just want to make sure. So the free cash flow guide for 2017 does strip out potentially some of these more one-off in nature, like cash items such as severance, right? Is that how we should be thinking about it?","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And with respect to the other things, let's just assume it's behind us, not in front of us.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay, okay. And then are there any big slugs of contracts up for renewal over the next few years and change-of-control dynamics that we should be mindful of?","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","As we go by region by region, certainly not over the next 12 months or so. We always have contracts coming up for renewal, but there are some in different regions that over the next few years will be coming up. But from an overall perspective I think the vast majority of our business is under long-term contract.","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Any change-of-control issues were dealt with prior to closing.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Right.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay, that's great. And just one last one for me. North America on the bev can side, growth has been pretty stable. Are you seeing any mix shift on the CSD side from PET into cans? Just because it's leveled off quite a bit Thanks.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, it has leveled off a little bit. I do think that when you really look at CSD, we have to think about fountain versus PET versus cans. Fountain has been actually the one most hit by the declines more recently. PET has been doing a little bit better than cans. But cans has been holding their own, to your point. The thing that still continues to go very well is on the craft beer side. In our business alone, it's up year-to-date 30%. And as \u2013 you, as a consumer, you go out there and you can see cans continuing to take a greater share of the package mix in the craft industry.","And then, last but not least, the overall beer category is up. The overall category itself is up almost 2%, just under 2%; and can volume is up over 4%. So we continue to take share from glass even in some of the more mainstream brands as well.","Scott C. Morrison - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","And soft drink specialties, specialty sizes is doing reasonably well too. So...","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Very helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, good morning.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, obviously, this deal makes you a much bigger beverage company. But I know that I think a lot of people are expecting your Food and Aerosol business to improve looking into 2017. But can you talk about how you feel about the Food and Aerosol business and how it fits into your portfolio right now, and the capital you think you are going to need to spend in that business going forward? And then lastly, just a volume trajectory here. As we think about there being \u2013 the idea that there is excess capacity in North America right now, specifically on the food can side.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well, as I mentioned I think on the last conference call, it's a food and an aerosol business. And those are different end markets. The aerosol business in that is actually bigger than the food business, and that's important to note. And we continue to see good growth, whether it's on the tinplate side here in North America or down in South America where it exists, or on the impact extruded side where we're here in North America and also over in Europe. We continue to see very good supply dynamics \u2013 supply-demand dynamics; we continue to see good growth; we continue to see good economic opportunities for investment on that side.","On the food side, that's where the challenge has been and it's no secret that there has been overcapacity in there. We've taken our lumps over the last couple years in that business. Some of it was market-related from a pricing perspective and some of it was self-inflicted related to the cost side. We are 70%, 80% of the way through completing a project that is going to have significant cost reduction in that business to make us more competitive. And that's where I think, Debbie, because of the growth in the aerosol and because of the cost-out we have in food, that's why we, as well as many other people, do expect a better 2017 relative to 2016. I think longer term, I've just laid out really what the strategies of those two different segments is. It's continued to grow with the aerosol and continued to be the supplier of choice for our big, multinational customers on the aerosol side. And then on the food can side, service our existing customers as well as possible and recognize that's a cash business.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thanks. That's helpful. If I could just move to the Americas segment, I think you saw 10% growth in specialty in the quarter. Could you talk about specifically what's driving that, how sustainable it is, and how you think about that when you put the two businesses together with Ball and Rexam?","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Oh, gosh. It comes from a variety of things. Our bottle strategy and bottle technology continues to go well. Scott mentioned on the CSD side some of the smaller sizes continue to go well. Some of the larger sizes on the beer category continue to go well. Energy drinks, sleek cans. It really \u2013 there's not just one area; I think it's across the board. And I do think part of our strategy has been as the 12-ounce declines, either through absolute declines or through cannibalization, we want to grab that cannibalization by having specialty cans. And that's \u2013 there's a good chunk of the loss of 12-ounce being captured by specialty cans and that's why we've been focused on it.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thank you. I'll pass it over.","Operator","We have a follow-up question from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Thanks, operator. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my follow-ups. On the subject of the market dynamics post the Rexam deal, have you seen any change, perceptible change, in the level of competitive activity post-deal? Has it been fairly status quo within your various regions? I know that's a very broad question, but figured I would throw that out there nonetheless.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, it is a very broad question. And remember, we're 30 days, 35 days into this, George, and this is a time of year where you're really not having discussions around price with our customers. And so, quite candidly, we've been very much focused on getting our folks aligned over what our strategic objectives are.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay, fair enough. Now, next question I had, more in terms of the portfolio and strategy. You talked earlier about China and the parallels with other case studies in your time at the company and in Ball's development. If an appropriate consolidation opportunity arose in the next couple of years, do you think you could manage that while also integrating Rexam? Do you have enough depth to manage that? And the related \u2013 well, let me stop there and then I had one more question.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Well, let me remind you that our folks in Asia have been doing a wonderful job in terms of the cost-out programs and managing a challenging situation. But they haven't really been affected at all by the Rexam transaction. They have not been involved in the integration just because Rexam had no presence over there. And so as we look \u2013 your question is about bandwidth. We're quite cognizant from a corporate perspective of the bandwidth issues, but from a management people on the ground issues over there, we've got a very good team.","The biggest question from my \u2013 our perspective, George, on that is, is one consolidation enough to really change the dynamics? And you've heard us be pretty consistent that we're not going to be investing in China to become the biggest. If there is an opportunity to make us better and meaningfully better as part of that, then we'll evaluate it. But that's the criteria by which we will look at it.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Understood. The last question I had \u2013 and again recognizing this is not the steak in the middle of the plate; it's more the vegetables or maybe the dinner roll. Again, in Food and Household, that's been a business that's been struggling. It's \u2013 again, as you mentioned I think to Debbie's question, two separate markets, two separate sets of dynamics. Does there come a point where the food business recognizing that you have every intention of improving the performance next year gets so challenged that it begins to impair your ability to compete in aerosol? Said differently, again using what you said about China, does there come a point \u2013 is there an opportunity, perhaps, where combining businesses might make sense in the food market? And I'll leave it there. And thanks, guys, and good luck in the quarter.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, thanks, George. We've talked about this in prior quarters. Recall, though, that from a manufacturing footprint perspective, we make tinplate food cans in the same facilities as we make aerosol tinplate. And so when you talk about separating it out, it does become more challenging. But on the flip side of that, that provides the leverage of that. And so if the food can business continued to decline, we would be taking out a line here, a line there in existing plant. But I don't think you can necessarily separate those two.","But having said that, we don't believe nor do we see exactly what you're talking about. And that's why I said you've got to understand who you are. And that part of the business, it's a cash business, so treat it as such.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Fair enough. Thank you.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, George.","Operator","There are no further questions registered at this time.","John A. Hayes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, great. Well, thank you, Dmitra, for your help and we look forward to talking to everyone on our third quarter conference call, which is at the end of October \u2013 excuse me. Thank you, everyone.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

Welcome to the Ball Corporation Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]","As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, February 5, 2015.","I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, CEO of Ball Corporation. Please go ahead, sir.","John A. Hayes","Good morning, everyone, and thank you, Rebecca. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's fourth quarter and full year 2014 results. Before I begin and as you've all seen earlier today, we issued a statement confirming that we are in discussions that may lead to an acquisition of Rexam PLC. The announcement was made following a statement made by Rexam consistent with its obligations under the U.K. Takeover Code, which regulates any such transaction. Consistent with our policy and the requirements of the U.K. Takeover Code, we will not be making any further comment or responding to any questions on that topic during this call. I would ask you to please respect the U.K. Takeover panel and its rules. Rest assured for any investment that Ball contemplates, we will do it through the lens of our disciplined capital allocation process.","Now the information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings, as well as the company news releases. If you don't already have our earnings release, it's available in our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website.","Joining me on the call today is Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'll provide a brief overview of our company's performance, Scott will discuss financial and global packaging metrics and then I'll finish up with comments on our Aerospace business and the outlook for 2015.","2014 as a whole was an outstanding year for Ball. Together, we executed well through some adversity early in the year and have been focused on positioning our company for success now and in the future as we navigate the dynamic, economic and competitive landscape.","During the year, we grew comparable diluted earnings per share by 18%. We achieved record free cash flow in excess of $620 million and we increased EVA dollars by 28%. Operationally and strategically, we are also well positioned. The cost-out program we initiated 18 months ago in our European beverage can segment has met expectations and positions us well for the future. Our investments in specialty containers in North America, Brazil and in Europe had allowed us to participate in a meaningful way in a key growth segment of the beverage can world, and specialty cans now represent over 28% of our mix on a global basis.","Our impact-extruded aerosol investments continue to do well and allow us to participate in another growth segment of the metal packaging world. The Aerospace team delivered multiple affordable technology solutions to our customers, generating record results for the segment. And as One Ball, we achieved recognition for our focus on sustainability and received supplier and\/or customer awards in each of our businesses during 2014.","As we move into 2015, we remain focused on controlling the things we can control and on ramping up numerous capital projects on-time and on budget. We will maximize the value of what we currently do while making investments in new geographies, new products, new customers and new segments to help grow our company. We have a number of new opportunities that are at various levels of investment, whether it be the next-generation aluminum bottle shaping technology in North America for a customer under a long-term arrangement that will begin at the end of the first quarter, a new tin plate aerosol can manufacturing technology that will begin during the second quarter, the new Oss, Netherlands line that will start up during the second quarter, the construction of a new beverage can plant in Myanmar that is scheduled to begin early 2016, the construction of a new aluminum impact-extruded aerosol facility in India, or chasing several billion dollars of outstanding commercial and governmental opportunities in our Aerospace business. We have a good runway as we look out over the next 12 to 24 months.","Now sometimes you are the victim of your own success, and we have created some challenging comps for ourselves during 2015, particularly in the first half, which Scott will discuss later. However, we feel confident that despite these headwinds of lower food can volumes, or Asian pricing, of foreign exchange volatility, we are well positioned for the long term.","Life at Ball and our EVA philosophy is about continuous improvement, so we are happy to take on the challenge. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott for a review of our fourth quarter numbers. Scott?","Scott C. Morrison","Thanks, John. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share for 2014 were $3.88 versus last year's $3.28, an 18% increase. And in the fourth quarter, comparable diluted earnings per share were $0.84 versus $0.86, including unfavorable currency translation of $0.02. For the full year, the following factors contributed to improved results: Growth in global specialty cans, record earnings in Aerospace, lower interest expense, a lower effective tax rate and a lower share count.","Turning to cash flow. Ball generated in excess of $1 billion in cash from operations and generated $622 million in free cash flow in 2014. We also acquired a net $360 million of stock and returned another $73 million to shareholders in the form of dividends. In total, the cash return to shareholders was below our prior guidance, driven by lower than expected share repurchases in the fourth quarter. Some of what will likely be a question during Q&A, sometimes there are limitations as to when you can and cannot buy shares and the fourth quarter fell into the bucket when we couldn't buy shares. Rest assured that our philosophy of returning value to shareholders has not changed.","And at this time, barring additional opportunities for capital allocation in 2015, our free cash flow is expected to be returned to shareholders via a combination of share repurchases and dividends. For the full year 2015, as we sit here today, here's our initial take on financial metrics. Free cash flow will be in the range of $600 million, CapEx should be in the range of $400 million, if project dollars are spent on schedule. Interest expense will be roughly $145 million. The effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 26% and 2015 corporate undistributed will be approximately $80 million.","Due to our strong 2014 free cash flow and additional funding at year-end, minimal cash pension contributions are required in 2015. Though as with everyone these days, we will be impacted by roughly $7 million of higher global pension expense in 2015, due to factors including lower discount rates and updated mortality assumptions.","Net balance sheet debt at year end was approximately $3 billion. Credit quality and liquidity of the company remains quite solid with comparable EBIT-to-interest coverage of 5.7x and net debt to comparable EBITDA at 2.5x. Our current committed credit and available liquidity at year end was in excess of $1 billion. For a complete summary of fourth quarter and full year 2014 results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, and details regarding the fourth quarter $45 million pretax non-cash charge for settlement of certain pension obligations, please refer to the Notes section of today's earnings release. Now moving to operations.","Our Metal Beverage Americas and Asia segment comparable earnings for full year 2014 were up $22 million on double-digit specialty growth, the first half benefit of the World Cup and excellent operating performance in the North American beverage container operations. As we commented in the earnings release, fourth quarter 2014 was impacted by muted volume trends in China and the startup cost associated with ramping up our next-generation aluminum bottle shaping project in our Conroe, Texas facility. The stark reality in China is that can pricing has suffered yet another blow and this has created difficult market conditions. We will focus our energy on leveraging every single cost-containment and process improvement we can to further improve our cost base and get the most out of our existing asset base in the most effective way.","The team there is working very hard and has the full support of the global beverage team to pull it through. The Americas-Asia segment as a whole will be solid in 2015 due to better absorption in our legacy North American and Brazilian facilities, and the conclusion of start-up costs related to the aluminum bottle project coming online during the second quarter.","European beverage comparable earnings were down $10 million in the fourth quarter and low single-digit volume declines, higher year-over-year aluminum premium headwinds and the impact of unfavorable earnings translation. Full year 2014 results improved roughly $40 million, with volumes up almost 3%, and cost initiatives -- cost-containment initiatives taking hold. Good work by all of the Ball Europe team. Tough year-over-year comps in the first half of 2015 to do FX translation, aluminum premiums and the Oss startup cost should be factored into your full year 2015 expectations for this division.","On a constant-currency basis, we expect European beverage will increase operating earnings in 2015 as the third line in Oss starts up mid-second quarter. Food and household comparable segment earnings were only off a bit in the quarter as segment volumes were stable and manufacturing inefficiencies in our U.S. metal service center lessened compared to prior quarters, which impacted full year 2014 by roughly $15 million.","Our global extruded aluminum product line continues to perform at a high level, and buys in Europe have held up well, given economic conditions. As the Food and Household segment enters 2015, steel operations have been right sized for its current book of business and will focus on improving manufacturing performance, ramping up the next-generation steel aerosol can manufacturing technology to be launched commercially mid-2015 and further growing the extruded aluminum businesses in Europe and India. There will be some quarter-over-quarter noise in this segment related to the customer shift, which transitioned on January 1, 2015, but this has been known since late 2013.","In summary, our global beverage packaging operating teams continue to execute projects that will improve our business in North America and Europe in the second half of 2015, while also identifying additional cost efficient, high returning growth opportunities to benefit Ball in 2016 and beyond.","With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.","John A. Hayes","Great, thanks, Scott. Our Aerospace exceeded business expectations, really an amazing accomplishment considering government budgets in the recent election cycle. During the quarter, solid program execution continued and much work was completed to bid on additional work. Contracted backlog ended the quarter at $765 million, an anticipated reduction year-over-year as we await word on program bids that are in process. Our capabilities and products are well positioned as affordable solutions. We just need some decisions, and the right decisions at that, to be made in Washington.","Now looking out across our company today, we are thankful for the team we have, the incredible results we've produced last year and the progress we are making on new capital being put to work. 2015 presents some known headwinds other companies are dealing with as well: FX, pension expense and aluminum premiums to name a couple. We are excited about the many opportunities in front of us to improve our business.","Our long-term diluted earnings per share growth goal of 10% to 15% is out of reach for 2015 as we sit here today. We currently expect the earnings run rate to pick up steam in the back half of 2015 as projects ramp up and carry us onto the bridge for building into 2016. In the near term, our businesses are generating significant free cash flow for us to put to work. So let's start the Q&A so Scott and I can get back at it.","And with that, Rebecca, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from George Staphos with Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess the first question I had for you, can you give us a little bit more detail in terms of what's happening with Asian pricing, I'm guessing specifically Chinese pricing, what kind of impact it is. Can you also comment as to what FX headwind from an EBIT standpoint or from an earnings per share standpoint is built into your directional guidance, and I had a couple of follow ons.","Scott C. Morrison","Sure, George. This is Scott. On the Asian pricing, it continues to be very challenging and we thought last year it might have been a new low, but I think it continues to have pressure on it. I'm not going to quantify it because it's a pretty fluid situation. But it's obviously impactful. I think the other parts of that segment will do well and make more money, and it's a question of can they offset what the -- the pressure that we'll have in China. So on the second front, on the FX side, if the euro -- if you think about it this way from an EPS standpoint, roughly a 1 point move in the euro is about $0.01 a share, roughly.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. Thank you for that. To the extent that you can comment, could you put a range on what you think your EVA per share might grow by this year or -- no, maybe not, I mean, I shouldn't be too judgmental here, but what's the direction this year on EVA per share. Could you put a bracket in terms of the growth rate? And then, I guess I'll turn it over at that point and come back in queue.","John A. Hayes","George, this is John. From an EVA perspective, we were up very strong in 2014, up 28%. It's going to be a bit of a challenge. We have a lot of investment going in, it's not generating any return right now because it's in the startup mode, so I would expect our EVA dollars to be roughly flat, maybe down a little bit depending on how the year goes. But -- and that's largely due to this capital we are putting out -- a lot of it doesn't come on until midstream and when it is coming on, we've got some start-up cost associated with it.","Scott C. Morrison","I would expect EVA dollars, George, they're going to be up in North American beverage, it's going to be up in Brazil and it's been a be up in Europe. The other businesses will be flat to slightly down.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Gaffner with Barclays.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just following up on China for a minute. Scott, I think you also mentioned that volumes were actually muted in the fourth quarter. Can you talk about that, and then can you also talk about, from the pricing front, I thought some of your business there was on a little bit longer term contract. Can you talk about what's more spot versus longer-term contract there?","Scott C. Morrison","Yes. Our volumes grew kind of low single digits in the fourth quarter, and I think everything in China seems like it's slowing down a bit. So I don't think that was uncommon. We had been at a better growth rate throughout most of the year. From a pricing perspective, that's why it's kind of a mixed bag. There are some contracts that have longer-term nature to them, but there is a lot of spot business, and that's what I was referring to.","John A. Hayes","Yes, I think the main dynamic there, Scott, is there -- we continue to see capital going in, and it's just the -- it, the overcapacity remains there, and I think so that means on a spot pricing perspective, that's where it puts the most pressure on it.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then taking a step back and looking at the broader beverage can business, can you talk about what you're seeing from your customers as far as global pricing initiative, if you've seen this in your markets, how long you've seen it for, and maybe, sort of what impact do you think it might have on margins on a go-forward basis?","John A. Hayes","When you talk about global pricing, you're talking about our product to our customer, I presume. There is -- we have a mixed bag around the world, regional, global. We don't -- as Scott said, we expect many of our beverage can segments, with the exception of China, to be up year-over-year. And so we're -- some of that's a function of volume, some of it's a function of net price, some of it's a function of our mix. So I think we feel pretty good right now. The beverage can as an industry is actually doing quite well, relative to other substrates. You've heard me talk in the past about Kansas as a percent of the package mix in the beer category, and I think in every region we operate, it's up. It's over 60% U.S., it's over -- it's around 45% in Brazil. It's north of 20% in whole in Europe, obviously it's a little bit stronger in the U.K., for example, relative to some other places. And then even in China, we've talked about 5%, 6%, 7% as a share of the package, makes it up to 10% now. The fourth quarter was soft, I think the industry was down, we were up a little bit. But putting that aside, as we go into 2014, we continue to believe the beverage can has a bright future.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. And just one last one on working capital and the free cash flow guidance. Looks like you've built, or used a significant amount of cash, or sorry, you had a big source of cash in the fourth quarter and in the full year of 2014. What should we be thinking about in 2015 around working capital?","Scott C. Morrison","We think it's going to be a source again. We continue to -- our folks both from a treasury perspective and an operations perspective, continue to find ways to get more money out of the working capital, so I think it's going to be another source in 2015 as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I guess I'll skip the question on what your acquisition pipeline looks like, but good luck with what you [indiscernible] this morning with Rexam. Maybe we can start on the volume outlook by region for your beverage can business for '15, and maybe you could start off with Brazil, just given the comp set the industry had in the first half of '15 from the World Cup?","Scott C. Morrison","Yes. I think obviously, that leads tougher comps for Brazil, definitely. We think there'll be market growth, but we think it's going to be pretty low. The economy there has got some struggles, and we'll have to wait and see how it plays out, but we're not expecting -- we expect it to be positive, but not in the huge way. North America, we kind of return to more normalized trends, I would say, last year and we expect that to continue. The soft drink business continues to be under pressure, but beer continues to hold up pretty well, and a lot of new segments continue to hold up well, and specialty is doing well. So probably somewhere in '15 as it was in '14 for us. Europe, we think the market will grow again. Kind of low to mid-single digits. You know what it's been growing over the last year or so. And China, China's slowed down from where it was before, and I still think it'll grow, but the question is how much.","Scott C. Morrison","The other thing I'd add, Ghansham, is this last summer in particular, we had World Cup, we had other things going on. This summer, as we look forward, there's not many of those either European championships or World Cup or Olympics or other things like that. And so, it's an off year relative to those big promotional types of things, and so that's factored into what Scott just says.","John A. Hayes","And last year, I mean, for instance in Europe, the comp in the first quarter was up quite a bit, and we don't expect that again.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then, just in terms of what you said in your press release, I'm sorry if I missed it, but the lower exports you said, that's out of Europe, can you just expand on that?","John A. Hayes","Yes. That's really Middle East and Africa, and I think in part because of some of the geopolitical issues going on there. The export market for us, at least, was down, particularly in the fourth quarter. I think our core European volumes are actually up slightly. It's just the whole segment was down because the export market was down.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","When you look at the free cash flow guidance for 2016, which is actually quite impressive, because on my numbers, the working capital contributed $171 million last year. Can you help us get there? First of all, on the pension, you said no contribution in '15. What was it in '14?","Scott C. Morrison","I would just do it this way, I'll look that up with the -- from an expense standpoint, the expense will be up about $7 million, but the funding for '15 will be less than $30 million.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay, less than $30 million?","Scott C. Morrison","Yes. We funded a lot in '14.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay. How much in '14 did you fund?","John A. Hayes","Well, Scott's speaking, I think it's fair to say, in the U.S. we don't expect, hardly any, if any, funding. I think a lot of the European, particularly our German pension, is more of a pay-as-you-go, and so that's where that funding would come from.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Got you. And maybe I missed this, but when you look at 2015 volume in the U.S., how would -- and you say some more -- if you look at it on a more normal basis, does that mean that, on a net basis, you see maybe a little bit of growth as the standard cans probably overall decline, but most of that's from soft drink, with some beer offset? And then specialty also will more than offset the soft drink decline, so that you do see a positive can number including specialties in the U.S.? Or is that too strong?","John A. Hayes","Let me preference this by saying it's the beginning of February, and so tell me what the weather's going to be like, tell me what some other things are going to be, even with the price of gasoline coming down, you really haven't seen a pull through from the average consumer. They've been trade -- they aren't buying more, they're trading up a little bit and they're not buying more. But I think what Scott was talking about, when you look at 2014 and the U.S., the overall beverage can market was down less than a percent, it was down 0.07%. Euro was up, and we see those trends continuing, whether it's the craft beer or whether some of these other segments that are growing has been beneficial with can as the can continues to take share from other packaging substrates. And it's really all past few years, it really has been the softness in the soft drink. It's not as if the can has been losing market share relative to PET and other substrates, it's just overall soft drink volumes are declining and, to date, our customers haven't been able to arrest those declines. So as we look into 2015, we don't see those trends changing materially. Scott did mention that some of these other alternative segments, whether it's energy drinks or sparkling waters or other things like that, that there has been some decent growth in that, and a fair amount of specialty goes into things like that. So I don't think the core trends, we see a fundamental change to as we look forward the next 12 months or so.","Scott C. Morrison","Back to your pension question. We funded a little over $140 million in '14, in the pensions.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Very helpful. And that definitely helps us to -- that $600 million makes a lot more sense now. And then, when you look at the food can business, first of all, I think John mentioned some $15 million issue and maybe just to clarify what that was in '14. But if I hear you right, you're saying that with the work you've done to mitigate some of the changes plus the growth, you should -- you would expect to see an up second half and maybe a chance of at least a flat full year on the EBIT line there. So if you could address those 2 points?","John A. Hayes","Yes, I think a flat EBIT year for the full year is a very tall order. We had -- the $15 million I referred to was manufacturing inefficiencies on the, particularly on the service center side. We've made some decent improvement on that, but that's a longer runway than I think you may be expecting. And then with the -- just the overall market continuing decline, continued with the loss of the ConAgra business. I think a year ago or so, we thought we might have a shot at being flat EBIT in 2015 in that segment. I think it's a bit challenging. And that's on the food side. There's a lot of good things going on, on the impact-extruded side, as well as this new technology on the tin plate aerosol side. So you see a blend of it, but I still think with all those, because of the start up costs on the India project, because of the startup cost related to the G3, I think it's a tall order to think about -- we'd be flat in that segment.","Operator","And our next question comes from Tyler Langton with JPMorgan.","Tyler J. Langton - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just Europe, the sort of the drop in year-over-year profits. Could you just provide a little color about, I guess, what kind of came from sort of the lower volume premiums, I guess, currency? And then maybe what, I guess, was offset by cost reductions?","Scott C. Morrison","Yes. The cost reduction continues to -- they've really done a nice job of getting the cost out. It was really premium. We've got a little bit more headwind, about $7 million in the fourth quarter of euro headwind with the lower volume, and then FX that's kind of a total difference of why it was down. Why have a little bit more premium that will come through in the first half of '15, and then we'll be at more even comps, year-over-year.","Tyler J. Langton - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","When you think of cost reductions, I guess, for Europe, for this year for 2015, I mean, can you kind of match what you did in 2014, or is that going to start getting tougher?","Scott C. Morrison","No, it's -- I mean the guys did a really good job in '14. A lot of cost came out in '14. I think there's still -- they have a lot of aggressive plans continuing for '15, but I wouldn't expect it to be at the same level than it was in '14.","Tyler J. Langton - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then just, I guess comp question for food can. I mean, the sort of the improvement this quarter, just for the service inefficiencies, I mean, were those largely down this quarter, or were they still having an impact?","John A. Hayes","Well, it still has an impact. As I said, the runway of it's a bit longer, and I recall last summer we talked more specifically about it. Some of it was self-inflicted, that we weren't running as efficiently as we could or should be, and some of it was outside of our control in terms of quality issues with some of the tin plate. I think the quality's gotten better. I think our manufacturing efficiencies have improved as well. But again, I think you're -- we're going to see steady improvement throughout the year, and so it's not just a big bang theory that it happens, starts and stops in one period.","Operator","Our next question comes from Philip Ng of Jefferies.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Can you kind of help frame what the headwind will be on a year-over-year basis for metal premiums in 2015?","John A. Hayes","We have a little bit more of it, probably in about another $7 million to $10 million in the first half of '15, and then we get to the second half, where we'll get some more even comps.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And just curious, I know a portion of your business resets every year in Europe. Were you able to pass some of those headwinds, cost headwinds through via pricing this year?","John A. Hayes","I think the best way to describe it, Scott had mentioned, on a currency-neutral basis, on a euro basis, our segment, we expect to be up year-over-year. Some of it's cost, some of it -- someone mentioned earlier about pricing and it's been a bit difficult, but on the other hand, we've been able to take this time. We're limited to be able to try and recover the premium and other costs as well.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","There's been a clear bifurcation in how demand is tracking, at least for beer in North America, bev cans versus glass. How much of that is driven by the push into specialty cans versus the brewers just trying to push volume through the grocery channel, and do you see that dynamic kind of continuing into 2015?","John A. Hayes","I really don't think it's pushing volume through the grocery channel. When you look at the beer market, it was relatively flat, for example, in the fourth quarter and it was relatively flat for the full year. The only thing that was really growing in a material level was this -- the craft beer industry. And that was predominantly, as you know, 100% bottle business. And now it's over, I think it's 12% plus or minus, don't hold me to it, but it's in that range as the cans as a share. And so cans are getting an inordinate share of that. And that's one of the reasons why, even though the beer market is relatively flat, I think cans are performing quite well.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Got you. One of your competitors on the food can side in North America announced they're going to be adding a plant in the Midwest, it doesn't sound like it's going to be incremental from a capacity standpoint. But just curious, do you anticipate any impact from that move, and can you remind us what percentage of your business in North America, food is locked up from a contractual standpoint, the next few years?","John A. Hayes","Yes, I don't have that last question first, but the vast majority of it is. I know we have a couple of contracts outstanding, but no, the answer to your question is, we are aware that they announced in their earnings that they're going to be rationalizing and building at the same time, and we don't expect any appreciable change to the market.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Wilde with BMO Market.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Canada","I know you don't want to get in front of your customers here, but I wondered if you could give us just any color, incremental color on that new bottle. Is it a conversion of an existing line, is it a new line, any sense of kind of perspective volume there, incremental volume for you guys?","John A. Hayes","I will tell you, it's a new line, it's new capacity, and it's -- and we'd rather not go into the specifics about the customer or the segment, but we're excited about this. It's a new, a next-generation bottle shaping technology and it fits right into the sweet spot of our drive for 10 vision around expanding our new product portfolio.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And is it proprietary to this customer for any period of time?","John A. Hayes","I'd rather not get into that.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Okay, that's fine. Second, on the FX side, does that FX impact that you talked about, does that include this increase we've seen in the Swiss currency, because I know you have your European headquarters in Switzerland?","Scott C. Morrison","Yes. Our -- the exposure there is really just on the people that are there, for salaries. So we don't have a lot of cost in Switzerland. So it's not that significant.","John A. Hayes","Remember, our European business is a euro-denominated business.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Okay. All right. And then the last question I had, John, was just on Aerospace. Last quarter, you talked about perspectively having some news for us on this earnings call about new wins. I noticed that your backlog is down by about $70 million quarter-to-quarter. Can you just talk with us about sort of where some of those bids are right now, and what you think time frame might be?","John A. Hayes","Gosh, I wish I could tell you, because every time we think something, everything moves to the right. The dysfunction in Washington continues, and that we have -- I will tell you this, we have more bids outstanding than I can ever recall in the history of Ball Aerospace. We do expect some of them to happen first quarter. I think more likely, they're going to happen in the second quarter. We actually won some things, some commercial things in the fourth quarter. The issue there is these commercial entities are in the fund raising mode now. And so they need to raise the financing, but whether it was the 2 things that we announced in the fourth quarter, we feel pretty good about them, but they, they're in the process of raising money. So it's a whole amalgamation of things, and as you know, even though we've won those projects for those commercial entities, we don't count them in backlog until it's funded. And so, those are some of the things that we had referred to, and it's just -- it's taking candidly, a bit longer than we like. But despite that, the long-term prospects of the Aerospace business, we feel good about.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Okay. And would you say, today, John, that you've got sort of even more pipeline than when you talked with us in the -- at the end of the third quarter?","John A. Hayes","Yes, I think we do.","Operator","Our next question comes from Al Kabili with Macquarie.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Just on the specialty can start-up cost, if you could just help us size what that was in the fourth quarter? And do you anticipate any spillover of those costs early in the year?","Scott C. Morrison","Yes. It was around $6 million in the fourth quarter, and then we'll have some of that in the first quarter, too, as we get to production capability near the end of the quarter.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Okay. Okay. Got it. And then, you would expect by 2Q, hopefully, we're sort of at a more normalized operational rate there?","Scott C. Morrison","Yes. These start-ups -- our guys do, usually a pretty good job of getting these things going and running well, but there's always a learning curve as you start the line and you start to get into it. But that pressure should reduce as we start producing cans and selling cans.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Okay. Got it. And I think last call you had mentioned perhaps a chance with some cost savings activity that the Americas and Asia segment could be up year-over-year. But with the additional pressure, I guess in China, maybe some of these start-up costs, maybe you could, if you could, update us on your thinking there?","Scott C. Morrison","Yes. I think the -- yes, I think we still have a shot at it, of offsetting the decline in pricing with the performance at the other segments or the other areas where we produce. But it's a little too early to call yet. It depends a lot on volumes and how things mature through the year.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Okay. But assuming like similar volume trends in the U.S. and similar trends in the industry that we had last year, you still think that there's a shot at offsetting some of these?","Scott C. Morrison","Yes, I think there's a shot at it, I wouldn't say -- I wouldn't call it victory by any stretch yet.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then I guess last question's for Scott. It's just on the interest expense guidance, I think you'd mentioned $145 million, and I believe this year, it was $160 million. So are we -- or last year, I'm sorry, in '14. So is there an assumption of debt paydown or some refinancing going on in that interest expense outlook for this year? Thanks.","Scott C. Morrison","We have a variety of plans. So that -- I'm just giving you the number that we think we'll end up with at the end of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","In American bev, in Brazil you talked about the timing of contractual payments as a headwind, and I was wondering is there a portion of EBIT that gets pushed into 1Q or 2015? And then some packagers are flagging electricity cost in Brazil as a major headwind for '15. I was wondering if you could comment on electricity cost for your business there?","Scott C. Morrison","Sure. The contractual payment part of it will spread out further. I wouldn't come at it, early in the year it will spread our further, it was -- it's complicated. But we'll pick that up, but it's over a period of time. On the energy side, it's definitely, with the drought that's been going on, energy costs have been going up, and that will be -- we do have a bit of a headwind from that standpoint in Brazil in '15. But despite those energy headwinds, we still expect the operating performance to be better.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then on the Food and Household side, I was wondering if it was possible to size the headwind you had in the quarter from the Danville closure and the lower production at Oakdale?","John A. Hayes","Yes, I don't have that in front of me. I don't think it was material, is what I'd say. The profitability in that segment, the fourth quarter year-over-year was down very slightly and our volume on the food side was down very slightly. So I don't think it was material.","Scott C. Morrison","Those closure costs runs through business consolidation, so it doesn't show up in the segment.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then final one, apologies if I missed this earlier, but do you have a tax rate guidance for 2015?","Scott C. Morrison","I think we said 26, around 26%.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Josephson with Keybanc.","Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","You talked about beverage cans doing well in a number of regions. Can you hazard a guess as to what utilization rates are in North America and Europe? And along those lines, do you think there's a need for capacity reductions in the foreseeable future in either region?","Scott C. Morrison","Let's go region by region. I think Europe, as Scott had mentioned, it was growing low to mid-single digits. I think it was 3.5% plus or minus in the growth. And so, we're putting a new line in Oss because we are sold out there. And so I think the capacity in the industry is reasonably high there. I think as you go into North America, I don't want to speculate, I can only speak about Oss. We're running relatively full. We actually were up slightly because we were more and more weighted towards the beer segment and the specialty side of the business. And so we feel pretty good about that. I can't comment on what others are thinking. I can just tell you that for us, we have no plans in terms of further plant rationalization as we sit here today in North America.","Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And just a couple of others. One on EBIT for 2015. Obviously, you've talked about pension expense, FX, aluminum premiums, Chinese pricing pressure, Aerospace backlog being down, the ConAgra contract startup, et cetera. Can you give us some sense as to, assuming you expect your EBIT to be down this year, rough order magnitude?","John A. Hayes","It's too early to tell. I mean, this is what I would tell you is, you mentioned a lot of the headwinds, but we also mentioned a lot of the tailwinds that we have. Whether it's this new shaping technology for bottle cans in North America and getting that up and running, whether it's the new tin plate aerosol technology that we're going to be rolling out, whether it's the Oss facility that's going to be starting up in the second quarter, whether it's about the continued cost-out and not only in Europe but the folks in North America that have been doing a wonderful job and that's in part why our working capital's been positive, because they're on their game and being able to reduce inventories and other things like that. So we have a lot of good tailwinds as well. As I said, as we sit here today, given the headwinds you said and given the tailwinds I was mentioning, it's going to be -- I don't think, not only don't think, it's going to be very difficult to make 10% to 15%. But we're -- operationally, we're very strong, we're making investments, we're doing the right things, we're generating tons of cash and at really, your -- at the end of the day, your question, the answer to it depends on volume.","Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","John, thanks. And just one more, on consumer spending. Have you seen any pick up in your business on account of the recent decline in gas prices and do you expect one?","John A. Hayes","No, we haven't so far. But that doesn't surprise us, because the slowest months of the year, kind of the first couple of months of any year. As we go forward, I think there is a -- we believe that there would be a reverberation and a redistribution to those consumers. Anecdotally, I know that customers are not necessarily buying more at the convenience store when they go in and pay for their gas. They're trading up right now. But speaking to customers and others, I think people expect that to become more of a tailwind as we get to the summer. But that obviously depends on a variety of other factors as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions for you. First, with the shaped aluminum bottle stuff, I'm presuming, and help me if I'm wrong, if that starts to show up in 2015 and 2016 through revenue and through earnings, et cetera, is this in the metal food side -- the target for this, is this beverage or is this food, personal care or what have you? And so, what segment might it show up in?","John A. Hayes","Well, we have two. The new bottles, generation 2 bottle shaping technology is in the beverage side. And as we said, we expect that to be up and running by the end of the first quarter. So the way I think about it, I wouldn't expect much in the first half of the year, but in the second half the year, that's when you really start to see it. But we also have this new tin plate aerosol technology. That won't get up and running until mid -- perhaps even late second quarter, so you won't really see much of it this year because by the time it's ramped up, the large season in terms of tinplate aerosol sales is over, and so I think that's more of a '16 opportunity.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then, maybe if I could dissect by some of the segments. I think you already earlier said that it's -- and I'm really thinking about these things on an EBIT basis year-over-year, '14 -- I'm sorry, '15 -- '14, '15. I think you said that the metal food, household segment would be difficult to be flat, and may have some headwind. As we think about some of the other regions or some of the other element, Europe in particular, with -- if you quantify it or could you quantify for us how much of a headwind currency is, and is it likely that EBIT may be down in Europe given more metal premium and currency there, and then I'm going to kind of work through some of the other geographies as well.","Scott C. Morrison","Well I -- what I said in Europe is on a constant-currency basis, their earnings will be up. Now what happens to currency, I'm not smart enough to know what will happen this year. So it really depends on where that settles out. But on a constant-currency basis, though, we're...","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes, no, I can appreciate on a constant-currency basis, given some of the work, but at where we sit today, at $1.14 on the euro, and with aluminum premium, is it likely to be still up or flat down?","Scott C. Morrison","No. I think if you -- I made this comment earlier. Think about a 1% move in the euro is roughly a $0.01 impact to the company.","John A. Hayes","The reason why Scott answers it that way, don't forget, we have a bunch of euro-denominated debt.","Scott C. Morrison","Sure, pension expense...","John A. Hayes","Exactly. And so they kind of offset, so we look, we don't necessarily just look at it on an EBIT basis, because that's pure translation. You got to look it on an economic basis, which includes the interest expense and other things like that.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then, when I think about -- last person I want to ask is, John, I want to take you back to 2009, when you purchased some of the metal container assets. Given your experience with that, and working through that process, I think you elected, if memory serves, to buy 4 of their facilities and left some of the other piece that's still there. At that point in time, given -- again, as you work through that process, once you learn, do you feel that you would've been able to shepherd through the process, to have acquired the whole piece from a regulatory standpoint? Or do you feel that, that would've been too difficult of a hurdle?","Scott C. Morrison","That would be pure speculation, and I'd rather not comment on it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Krayn with MidOcean Partners.","Robert Krayn","I was wondering if you guys could reaffirm some kind of leverage targets, and then maybe comment on, if something either tuck-in or anything were to kind of come up, would those -- will leverage targets be flexible, or if there's any kind of other outer bounce? And then also, if you can just comment on your cap structure. You've got some bonds that are becoming callable in a couple of weeks here, I'm wondering your thoughts on that.","Scott C. Morrison","Yes, I'm probably not going to comment on any of that, actually. I mean, we're full on a lot of cash, our balance sheet's in very good shape. I think we have a lot of flexibility, and I'll probably leave it at that.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We do have a question from Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank.","Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","One of your competitors had a pricing reduction for specialty cans in the U.S., rolling through in 2015, and I realized sizes and contracts differ, but can you comment as to how this might relate to your capacity, and could this have an impact when you're making decisions about additional conversions going forward?","John A. Hayes","What I'd tell you is from our portfolio perspective, our pricing is stable in that part of the world. And so, as you know, any investment we make, we look at what the terms of the contract are and make our decision there. So that's probably all I should say.","Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then my last question, just on China. Again, a lot of people have talked about volume and price, but I think incremental supply is sometimes hard to pin down in this region. I'm just curious with pricing and volume being a bit of an issue, are you seeing the influx of capacity slow down?","Scott C. Morrison","I think it's slowing down, but there's still a lot of excess capacity.","John A. Hayes","Yes. There's net capacity additions, but it's not at the rate it was. In part, we think because the can market slowed down a little bit. But again, let's put it in context. For the full year, I don't have the number it front of me, but I think it was up, it was up double digits as an industry. As the fourth quarter, it was down. So it's been strong and there's many small, individually owned plants, that they're have been adding capacity on that, and I think they're -- we're starting to see a slowdown there. But we started to see a slow down before, too, and it still had net increases.","Scott C. Morrison","Yes, I think full year, it's still up 13%, roughly.","Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Can you remind us what the penetration rate is for cans right now in China, and how that differed a year ago?","John A. Hayes","Yes. It's -- on the beer side, and that's what really we track because the information's better, but it's about 10%, cans as a percent of the package mix and that's, gosh, I don't know exactly what it was last year. I want to say 8%, but it's been growing, which is helpful, because as we all know, China is the largest beer market in the world.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up from George Staphos with Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Recognize that you may not be able to cover too much detail here. I just wanted to try to follow on. One, the new shape and size aluminum aerosol -- or excuse me, the aluminum bottle line. Does that technology allow you to, on the fly, adjust shaping? Obviously you probably have to change tools and dies and that sort of thing, or basically it produces one type of bottle?","John A. Hayes","It's a new technology, George, and once we get it up and running, we'd be delighted to have you -- to show it to you.","Scott C. Morrison","We'll pass along that suggestion to our manufacturing guys. I'm sure they'd love it.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I had a similar question, and therefore I'm guessing it's going to be a similar answer on the tinplate technology line. But can you share any more color in terms of what makes it new there?","John A. Hayes","It is -- same answer, George. I would just tell you, it's a new technology on the way to make tinplate aerosol containers that we think have significant opportunity for metal savings.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess, the last question I have, I'm just going through my list here. Taking a step back, you mentioned that the can is doing very well in most markets, and I'm paraphrasing there, correct it how you'd like. As you think about the next 2, 3, 4 years, whatever the right longer-term interval is from your vantage point, what do you think the biggest challenge or two, is to the beverage can? Is it global procurement, is it some potential supply threat on aluminum sheet, because everything now is going to go into automobile. What do you think the biggest threats are, and how in turn do you manage your business against those threats?","John A. Hayes","Yes, thank you, George. It's -- I hesitate to answer that question, because I don't want to run afoul of anything that we're very respectful of, relative to announcements as far -- so I'd rather not answer it. But I would tell you this, the -- not the beverage can, but the industry, writ large, there is continued -- there's relatively anemic growth, and where there is growth, there's a lot of competitors. And I say that whether it's in the automotive market or whether it's in the metals market or other things like that. I do think we have done a very good job at Ball Corporation, really focusing on the supply chain, and like you said, on the working capital side. And as we go forward, we're going to continue to do what we've been always doing.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up from Scott Gaffner with Barclays.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just one quick follow-up on the North American beverage business. As we go down the aisles in the grocery store these days, it seems like there's a proliferation of maybe trim cans coming into the market. Can you talk a little bit about, if you're seeing that as well in your business and maybe what the outlook is there?","John A. Hayes","Yes, we're, yes. The trim, the slim, the smaller sized cans in the soft drink. There's been a big emphasis on that over the past couple of years, and we played our part in that. It -- not only on the soft drink side, but also even on the beer side. When you think about some of the new products that have been coming out by brewers, both large and small, the standard 12-ounce container, while still very important, they're trying to add incremental growth, kind of like what I said before about creating new products with different types of packaging, different size of packaging, and that's where the specialty growth has been coming from, and we've been playing our part in it.","Operator","And our next question is a follow-up from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","A couple of questions. One is, as we think about the beverage can, you've talked a lot about penetration. But I think of any beverage that you pour into a glass from a tap, like water, what would basically be in a single or serve container. And if you think about it in that context globally, or even by region, whatever -- how big actually is the beverage can, and is that a fair way to look at the market? And I guess secondly, are you finding that your -- I know another competitor had mentioned that some of their bigger customers in beer, I think, in particular, but maybe other areas, are trying to push you guys to negotiate can contracts, at least in a globally coordinated fashion. And is that a trend that is relatively new, and something that you feel is going to change your approach to negotiations?","John A. Hayes","With respect to the second question, because I can't remember the first question. We'd rather not comment on that. I think the world is globalizing, but that's all I'll say about that.","Scott C. Morrison","On the first question, we think there's all kinds of beverages that should go into cans, and you throw out water, but I think water and sparkling -- what I'm drinking is sparkling water right, out of a can. So I think there's a lot of products that can go in cans. And that's helping the growth in finding some of these new categories.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","But would you say, like the can is less than 20% of all beverage containers, when you throw in plastics and glass?","John A. Hayes","Yes. When you think about it that way, yes. I don't -- we don't -- we'd be guessing if you gave a specific number right now. But yes, it's because when you think about still and sparkling, there's a whole plethora of packaged beverages out there.","Operator","And our next question is another follow-up from Al Kabili with Macquarie.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Scott, just on the pension. If you could help us clarify, if you have any sizable benefit this year from the Highway Funding Bill, in terms of pension funding? And if so, how you expect your required U.S. pension funding to ramp up as this benefit kind of abates?","John A. Hayes","Well, what I mentioned was, in '14, we funded up a little over $140 million into the pension plans, globally, and in '15, we'll fund less than $30 million and our pensions are in pretty good shape, from a funding standpoint. So I don't think it's -- it moves around from year to year, and frankly a lot of our funding is dependent upon timing and how strong our cash flow is, so our cash flow's quite strong. Last year we put a lot into the plan, so. We're just commenting on '15, what that looks like.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Okay. And I don't know if you have it handy, but what's the funded statuses at year end?","Scott C. Morrison","We have a number of different plans, but I think around 80% for the funded plans. We have a large German unfunded, kind of pay-as-you-go plan, so I kind of look at just the funded plans. The Americas and the U.K. were roughly around 80%.","Operator","Our next question is from Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","You talked about cost take out as being an offset of some of the headwinds. Would you be able to frame that for us a little bit, maybe perhaps talk about what that number was, and what you accomplished in '14, and maybe talk about a range for cost take out for the company in '15?","Scott C. Morrison","Well, I mean in '14, you saw a lot of improvement year-over-year in terms of the European earnings, so that's despite some metal headwinds that we faced, even in '14, and '15, I think the cost take out will continue. We still have metal headwind in the first part of the year, first half of the year. But they continue to do a good job of reducing costs and so what I commented was that, on a constant-currency basis, we expect that business, the operating profit, to be up, despite the metal premium headwind.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Got it, Scott. And then, I believe there's a can sheet facility in Fort, one that was off-line here in the beginning part of the year or it may have started the end of last year. Can you just talk about, sort of supply of can sheet, and how that's looking right now, whether that may create some issues for the business in North America this year?","Scott C. Morrison","Yes. It's all back up and running. The -- both that can sheet supplier and our whole supply chain, including all of our sourcing folks, did a really good job of managing through that, so it wasn't impactful.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then, just last one, so I think you said $7 million of higher pension expense. So just for modeling perspective, that would just be allocated across the segments. Is that fair?","Scott C. Morrison","That's -- yes, generally. I mean, it's probably more North American-centric, but that's -- you'd be okay...","John A. Hayes","And Rebecca, we'll take 1 more question, if there are any more.","Operator","Our final question is a follow-up from Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","It relates to kind of business conditions and things within China. Last quarter, and maybe this is just my perception, but it seems as though you sounded much more opportunistic, with respect to deploying or potentially deploying more capital into China, in particular. The change in pricing that you talked about earlier in the call, has that, a, maybe changed the appetite for doing so? I guess really what I'm trying to get at is, you had some longer-term contracts in China and -- that were seemingly priced maybe a little above where the market was. So as stuff now has -- the pricing has changed for you, has your thinking changed with respect to what you would want to do, or potentially allocate capital in China?","Scott C. Morrison","Yes. I think, I mean given the challenging pricing environment, we'll put capital to work where we're getting decent returns. We've got some things to do in our own operations, where we think we can improve our cost structure meaningfully. And so we're focused on the things we can control, because we can't control the pricing. And so we're going to do things in our own operations to get incremental volume out of our existing operations, and then we're going to be really prudent with additional capital in China. So it probably is a little different tone than it was a quarter ago.","John A. Hayes","Okay, thank you. With that, Rebecca, I think we're finished. And as you can tell, we're quite excited about our prospects as we go forward. We have some headwinds in 2015, but we think we have our handle on them, but we also have a fair amount of tailwind. And as we go into the second half of '15, we feel real good about the long-term prospects for our company. So we appreciate your support, and look forward to a solid 2015.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, July 26, 2012.","I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, CEO. Please go ahead, sir.","John A. Hayes","Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning, everyone.  This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's second quarter 2012 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-Q and in other company SEC filings, as well as company news releases. If you don't already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website.","Now joining me on the call today are Scott Morrison, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Ray Seabrook, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Global Packaging.","In a moment, Scott will discuss our financial results for the quarter. Ray will follow up with details about our packaging operating performance, and I'll close with comments on aerospace and the outlook for the second half of 2012.","Today, Ball reported second quarter 2012 results slightly ahead of last year's results. Recall that we had mentioned in April that our first half results would be relatively flat as compared to the first half of 2011. And to date, we performed slightly better than we expected. Our Drive for 10 levers include maximizing the value of our existing businesses, broadening our geographic reach, expanding into new products and capabilities, aligning ourselves with the right customers and markets, and leveraging our technology expertise to create competitive advantage.","During the quarter, we made progress in all of these. And several highlights include new metal beverage container plants in Qingdao, China. Alagoinhas, Brazil and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam all began production in the second quarter, further broadening our geographic reach. The Alumi-Tek reclosable bottle continued to add to its customer portfolio as we expanded this product in the new end markets including craft beer and CSD. In fact, year-to-date, our total specialty can portfolio in North America grew approximately 24%.","Ball Aerospace is leveraging its technological expertise. The B612 Foundation recently announced that Ball Aerospace will build a space telescope named Sentinel, which will scan the solar system for asteroids posing a threat to Earth. This will be the first privately-funded deep-space mission. And in addition to this, we want additional work that will soon be included in our backlog, highlighting the growth of this business despite an uncertain funding environment. We continue to make good progress in all 5 of our Drive for 10 strategic levers. And while we wish our end markets were just a little bit more robust, 2012 is progressing just as we expected.","I'll turn it over to Scott to talk about the quarter, and then Ray will provide color on our operations. I'll return with comments on our aerospace business and the outlook for 2012.","Scott?","Scott C. Morrison","Thanks, John. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2012 were $0.89 versus last year's $0.85. The following factors contributed favorably to the second quarter results: higher volumes in Brazil and China, as well as continued growth in specialty can volumes; solid program performance in aerospace business; a lower effective tax rate and a lower share count. FX translation negatively impacted the second quarter by $0.04. For a complete summary of the second quarter results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, please refer to the Notes section of today's earnings release.","Recapping the key financial metrics for 2012, interest expense will remain the same at approximately $175 million. Taking into account certain tax benefits achieved in the first half of the year, the full year 2012 effective tax rate is projected to be around 29%, so the tax rate in the remaining 2 quarters of 2012 will run closer to 32%.","Given recent global growth trends, full year 2012 CapEx is now anticipated to be in the range of $350 million. With the change in CapEx and some improvements in working capital, we now expect 2012 free cash flow to be at least $0.5 billion, with most of the free cash flow being returned to shareholders through share repurchases. Year to date, we have repurchased approximately $275 million of our stock. At current exchange rates, year-end net debt is expected to be approximately $3 billion, roughly flat versus 2011.","With that, I'll turn it over to Ray to talk more about the packaging operations.","Raymond J. Seabrook","Thanks, Scott. Comparable second quarter operating earnings in the metal beverage Americas and Asia segment were up 8%, and through the first half, are up over last year's level. Remember, first quarter sales volumes in Brazil were slow due to customer geographic supply relocation. But as Scott mentioned, have picked up in the second quarter and are up 10% through the first half. We expect this trend to continue in the second half and still expect mid-teens growth in Brazil for the full year.","Sales volumes in North America were relatively flat through the first half, with custom cans continuing to grow -- to show nice growth. Second quarter operating earnings in the Americas were up on the strength of tighter cost controls and better sales mix in North America, partially offset by higher cost inventory from Brazil production curtailments, primarily late in the first quarter and second quarter, and start-up costs at our new Alagoinhas plants, which came on line in the second quarter. For the balance of the year, we foresee the North American favorable sales mix continuing and expect that the Brazilian start-up costs are behind us.","In Asia, the new can plants in Vietnam and Qingdao, China are performing well. And from an operating standpoint, we're coming out of start-up by the end of the second quarter. Sales volumes in China through the first half are up low double digits, with operating results a little ahead of last year's level in the quarter and for the -- and through the first 6 months.","Comparable European operating results in the quarter were lower than a year ago, primarily due to a lower euro exchange rate, and to a lesser extent, some price cost squeeze in the beverage cans. Beverage can volumes in Europe were up low-single digits in the quarter and through the first 6 months in spite of poor early summer weather. Despite an appreciably lower euro exchange rate, we expect third quarter segment earnings to be comparable to or slightly better than a year ago due to some relatively easy comps.","Second quarter and first half earnings in the U.S.  Metal Food & Household Products segment were on plan, but below last year due to inventory gains made in 2011 that were not realized this year. Food can volumes through the first half were mid single-digit below last year's level, and this trend will probably continue in the second half due to the drought weather conditions being experienced in most of the U.S.","Despite this difficult weather situation, we still foresee quarterly earnings -- segment earnings returning to a more typical seasonal pattern this year, which was reversed in 2011. With that said, we look forward to higher segment earnings in the second half than we earned in the first half.","With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.","John A. Hayes","Great. Thanks, Ray. Aerospace and technologies posted near double-digit EBIT margins for the quarter. Backlog ended the quarter at $780 million, which is holding in nicely, and as I mentioned earlier, is poised to grow as we move forward due to some recent wins. Previously awarded fixed-price programs continue to ramp up, and the program performance in that business is excellent.","As is evident with the Sentinel win, our aerospace team is executing on their Drive for 10 game plan. Our best cost, best value positioning provides Ball Aerospace a firm foundation heading into the election cycle. Now looking out beyond 2012, late in the second quarter, the company was notified of a shift in CSD customer requirements for our North American metal beverage packaging business beginning January 1, 2013. While we've lost some volume due to this shift, we have also gained some business from new and existing customers. In keeping with the Drive for 10 strategic lever of maximizing the value on our existing businesses, Ball will act appropriately in the -- to the resulting changes in supply and demand across our manufacturing footprint. And we are currently finalizing our plans, which are expected to include both permanent and temporary capacity realignment to address the situation. More information will be forthcoming in the near future regarding these activities. We believe that the net impact of this customer shift is not material to Ball's 2013 results and does not impede our ability to execute our Drive for 10 operational and financial goals.","In summary, we are slightly better than what we had planned halfway through the year. And as we always do, we are responding to the market environment from a cost and capital perspective that should generate higher free cash flow this year. We will continue our long-standing disciplined capital deployment strategy to return value to our shareholders and grow our company. With a slightly improved first half behind us, we are positive about the rest of this year and beyond. Profitability in the back half of 2012 will ramp up as new emerging market plants and the food and household business enter their seasonally stronger quarters, and we remain on track to achieve our 10% to 15% diluted per earnings share growth goal.","Recall that Drive for 10 is a mindset about perfection in everything we do, and it will play a key role in achieving our goal to more than doubling the EVA dollars generated over the next 10 years, as well as generating a compound average growth rate of 10% to 15% earnings per share over that time.","So with that, Jennifer, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess the first question I had, you said you wouldn't let us know about your plans for, I guess, capacity and production within North America at some point in the future. Will that happen before the third quarter earnings call, or when do you expect that you might be able to talk a little bit more about that?","Raymond J. Seabrook","Yes, George, this is Ray. The -- some details on that plan probably will be announced before the third quarter call, I would suspect. So let me see if I can lay this out for you. So late in 2011, we extended a long-term customer contract. And as part of that extension, as John mentioned in his comments, we picked up some fairly substantial volume, which would start in '13. And so that's been done. And as part -- and then I would say, in probably 3 or 4 weeks ago, we were notified by our customer that we'd lost some volume in '13. We've lost more than we've picked up. And so we have put together a tentative plan that, as John mentioned, rationalizes some surplus capacity. We've been doing a lot of shipping of our specialty cans across the country, so we're going to use this situation to improve our specialty can footprint. So we're going to do some of that. And then the capacity that we rationalize, we're going to move it to growing markets. So what you'll find is when we move this capacity, it costs us about half as much to install capacity that has been reconditioned as opposed to buying new. So that's the initial plan. We have 2 or 3 -- we have several near-term opportunities that probably will flesh themself out in the next 60 days. And once we see what those look like -- and those opportunities primarily are not in 12-ounce cans or specialty cans and other things. And so once we flesh those out, we'll finalize our plans and move forward. So as John said, the initial look at this is that it's not that significant to us as we look at '13. Does that help?","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, it does. I appreciate the color. One additional follow-on to that, and then maybe a couple other quick ones, I'll turn it over. Would it be fair to say that what you lost is maybe 2x what you gained going into this year? And does this affect at all the Columbus lines that I know you haven't been running this year?","John A. Hayes","George, this is John. I think it's premature to talk about any of that right now. It's -- I think the key highlight is, we've got a game plan. We have a variety of stakeholders that we need to deal with. And at the appropriate time, we'll let people know what that is.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Sure. I mean this has been a long time coming, so it's probably not a total surprise here. I guess, can you comment at all in terms of how the new plants are coming up the learning curve? Have you gotten to a point where they are at least breakeven from a margin standpoint? Are they still -- from an earnings standpoint, are they still dilutive at this juncture on the curve?","Raymond J. Seabrook","They're pretty much -- as we sit here today, they might be out of it. But pretty much for the second quarter, they were all in start-up. So they were dilutive. So they weren't adding anything. They've all come up differently. So the plant in Vietnam, it's come up a little slower because the work force is totally new. And it just takes time to learn how to do this thing. So Vietnam is fine, but it's come up a little slower. Qingdao, which is the one in China has come up quicker. But remember, we relocated a lot of employees from an old plant that we shuttered to the new plant. So we had much more expertise in Qingdao. So it's come up better. And as a matter of fact, we're even converting it to a different size right now as we speak. And then the one in Brazil, as I mentioned in the first quarter, we had some customer relocation situations with it. So it's really wasn't much -- it really wasn't a situation for the plant not coming up. It was to get the customer situation sorted out, and that's been done. So they're all a little bit different. But they're kind of all running now to speed, and we expect, as I said, a better third quarter.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So Alagoinhas is where you wanted it in the second quarter and...","Raymond J. Seabrook","Alagoinhas, yes, it's now where we wanted it, but it took a while to get there because if you'll remember, we got a new customer location there. And so it just took a little longer than we had first anticipated.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Understood. The last one for John. John, what does Sentinel add to the backlog? And do you have a view on project awards that have been funded that maybe didn't get to your June 30 backlog, what that would -- what that increment might look like?","John A. Hayes","Yes, Sentinel is not funded, and it's not in the backlog as well. The non-for-profit, the 501(c)(3) needs to go through a fundraising exercise. But they have announced that we will be the prime in building that. So it's a bit uncertain when they'll do that fundraising. We have in there very -- in the past couple of weeks have won a couple of other things in the classified world that, for obvious reasons, we can't talk about, but we believe will add materially to our backlog in the second half of the year and most likely in the third quarter.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","John, just more color on the CapEx reduction. Which regions does this adjustment -- which region is this specific to? And also, is this a function of you not winning some business that you thought you might have had at the beginning of the year, or is it just market condition based?","John A. Hayes","No, it's exclusively market condition based. And what I would say is things are moving out to the right. The overall growth of the global economy has slowed down. So I hope people aren't surprised by this. We're being prudent about it. But, as you know, the vast majority of our growth capital was allocated more towards Asia, generally speaking. So I think the vast majority of what's being pushed to the right is probably in that same area.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe I misheard this, but the custom cans, were they up 24% year-over-year in North America? Is that right?","John A. Hayes","That's correct.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And where were standard cans down for the quarter in North America?","John A. Hayes","Ray, do you have that?","Raymond J. Seabrook","No, I don't have that. But, obviously, that was the difference, obviously. So we were flat. So if -- you can kind of do the math.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, I can try and do that. And the volume trajectory in Europe on the beverage can side, has that changed inter-quarter, month-to-month?","John A. Hayes","It was -- in the second quarter, it was a little bit slower than the first quarter. I think the big reasons for that were largely weather. It's -- we talked last year, this time last year, about Europe having a terrible summer for weather. Well, it's equal to or worse this year than it was last year. Offsetting that, we had some of the World Cup and some others things going through. So we've been holding our own. But it was up low-single digits.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. On Americas, Asia, the cost-mix benefit in North America, any -- can you calibrate roughly how much is cost and mix there?","John A. Hayes","Ray?","Raymond J. Seabrook","Yes, it's more mix than cost. I don't know the exact numbers, but I would say that it's 70-30. The mix been 70% of the improvement and 30% being cost.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it, okay. And just with respect to the specialty cans and the mix benefit there, would you say you're pretty much fully ramped on that benefit in the second quarter in terms of how we think about the run rate of that towards the -- through the second half?","John A. Hayes","Well, when you say fully ramped, I'm not quite sure. We expect continued growth in the specialty cans side of the business. We've -- for external market reasons, and we've been doing a lot of marketing and push from that overall product line, whether it's the Alumi-Tek bottle, smaller sizes, larger sizes, punch-top ends, things like that. It's a whole variety of different things.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, I guess I was just referring to -- I mean, you brought on some new capacity, and I was just wondering if you're kind of -- you're essentially running full, getting the full profit benefit today?","John A. Hayes","Well, we're certainly running very strong.","Raymond J. Seabrook","Yes, we are to a point -- as I said before, the footprint isn't quite the way we'd like it. So we're spending a lot of money in freight shipping stuff in places we'd rather make it close to where our customer is. So we're going to fix that.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it, okay. And just with the CapEx reduction for this year, how should we think about preliminary thoughts around CapEx for next year? Perhaps, Scott, you could kind of talk about maintenance and whatever carryover there might be from any existing projects that would be kind of the starting point for next year?","Scott C. Morrison","Sure. Well, it's a little early to talk about CapEx for next year. But think about -- we just started up 3 new plants, and so just to keep up with incremental growth, you don't need to spend as much capital. So I would expect CapEx to trend down. But it's really more of a question of how strong global growth will be or not be. And I think we'll make more money next year, and so I think free cash flow probably goes up again next year. It's just a question of how much.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it, okay. And then final question is just on the comment about moving some of the can lines from North America to emerging markets and the cost saves from doing that. I mean, as you look at the emerging markets today, which markets do you think actually need new capacity? And if we think about Brazil and China, it feels like they don't.","Raymond J. Seabrook","Well, I said -- I purposely didn't --  I said growing. So you could even see some of the stuff -- we're fundamentally sold-out in Europe as we speak. So it's been growing 5% in the last -- since ever. So I'm not saying -- and it cost about half to redeploy -- to get a line in that's been refurbished versus buying new. So I don't know exactly as we sit here now where this is going, but it -- we definitely have growth markets for beverage cans. And this equipment that we rationalized as part of this exercise is going to end up somewhere where we need it.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Philip Ng with Jefferies.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","When I look at your bev business, if I heard you correctly, volumes were up low-single digits. But your EBIT on a year-over-year basis was down considerably. So I just want to know if there are any other factors other than FX weighing on the quarter?","Raymond J. Seabrook","Yes, the primary effect -- now remember, in the European numbers is also our extruded aerosol business, Aerocan. And the volumes were down just a little bit in that business, so it's not all beverage cans. So most of it is FX, but there's about EUR 6 million that probably is -- what I would classify as price cost. We haven't been able to pass on all our cost increases to our customers as part of our pricing...","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And that's also on the bev can side, is that correct?","Raymond J. Seabrook","Those are on the bev can side, yes.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And demand ticking up, I mean, at least holding up decently in Europe on the bev can side. How do you feel about pricing next year because as you mentioned earlier, supply sounds to be pretty tight at this point.","John A. Hayes","Well, as you'll recall, I think earlier this year on a conference call, we talked about in 2012 we had plans to put some capacity in. But we shelved those plans because we said, \"You know what, there's price cost going on in the marketplace, and we need to get our pricing right.\" So as we sit here today, Ray just mentioned that we continue to see some growth. But in terms of prioritization, our first priority is get our pricing right, and then we'll start to look at growth. And so as we go on the balance of 2012 and into 2013, that is kind of our strategy and go-to moves relative to what we're trying to do.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just one last final question for Ray. Demand for Brazil and China did pick-up in Q2. Is the back half still pretty robust? Because one of your competitors kind of talked about how both demand in China and Brazil is slowing. There's excise tax in the back half. So I just want to get a little clarity on what's giving you the confidence that demand is going to still be pretty solid?","Raymond J. Seabrook","Yes, that's all true. We -- actually, we had lower demand in the first quarter. I think we're up like 30% in the second net-net through year-to-date. In Brazil, we're up 10%. I said in my comments that we expect full year to be up 17%. So that means that we got to have a pretty good back half. And in our particular can -- and the thing about the beer is correct. The new beer taxes has caused some slowdown. There's no question about it. But we really have our contracts in place and our customers' positions in place where we're highly confident with what I said is going to happen.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson from KeyBanc.","Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Regarding demand in Brazil, to what extent are you experiencing a slowdown of the conversion from returnable bottles to metal cans there? One of your competitors talked about that earlier decline.","John A. Hayes","Well, this is John. When you look at the aluminum can market growth in Brazil in the second quarter, it was reasonably healthy, both double digits in CSD and beer. I can tell you that on the beer side that we continue to see an uptick in can penetration. If you look year-over-year and again, you have to look at month-to-month, but it's up about a point. And we're not quite at 40%, but we're worth a stone's throw of that. And so we continue to see improvement there.","Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","With regard to the free cash flow guidance, how much of an additional benefit do you expect to get from better working capital versus lower CapEx?","Scott C. Morrison","There's a chunk of working capital, too. We've got a number of plans across all the businesses, really, a variety of different things that we're doing from an operation standpoint, a treasury standpoint, a sourcing standpoint that are all benefiting us. So we still expect -- part of the improvement of free cash flow for this year is coming from benefits that we're going to get on the working capital side. It's not all the CapEx.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just following up on the beer penetration question. Moving to Asia though, in particular, China, it sounded as if penetration there has slowed somewhat. I realize you're adding capacity slower than the market over there. But what are you seeing overall with can penetration in Asia? And how do you feel about your capacity additions versus market growth right now?","John A. Hayes","Why don't I talk about can penetration and Ray can talk about our capacity. I think in the second quarter, our overall beer market in China was up 5.5-or-so percent and cans were up double digits. So that says cans continue to have further penetration. Recall it's only in the beer segment, for example, it's only about 6% penetration. So there's a lot of room for improvement there. But as I said, it is growing -- the cans growing at a rate faster than the end beverage markets, which obviously means better can penetration.","Raymond J. Seabrook","Yes, and as far as the capacity goes, our original plan in China this year, we were importing, I think, 300 million or 400 million cans. And I think that's gone down. As you said, the market has slowed a little bit. But fundamentally, we're sold-out. Every can we could make, we're selling. So -- and as we look to next year, we are putting in a little capacity this year. We've -- some of that slowed. We've had some issues getting some land in the South that we thought we had. So we will be sold-out again next year. So everything we can make, we can sell.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just overall for the metal beverage and Asia business, looks like operating profit was essentially flat in the first half of the year. You had said before, I think, that you thought you could get the operating earnings up somewhere in the 10% to 15% range for this segment for the year. How are you feeling about that right now? And do you think you can get there with improvement in the second half?","Raymond J. Seabrook","Yes, we will definitely improve in the second half. There's no question about it. The -- whether I can get to the 10% to 15%, I think, is more difficult now because we're a little slower than we thought. But we will come close to the bottom part of that range. Let's put it that way.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And how much do you think currency is impacting that though?","Raymond J. Seabrook","Well, we've had a little negative currency in China actually. And the Brazil currency tends to devalue, which really doesn't have an impact -- such a big impact to us. We have lost actually a little currency in our China business.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, on this shift in business in North America. I mean, it sounds as if maybe it's more of a price issue rather than you not having obviously the capacity to serve the customer. Is that your sense of the shift in volumes at this point?","Raymond J. Seabrook","Yes, these things happen from time-to-time. If you -- I think some of it is sheet for me since 1990 on who's gained, who's lost, volume, and actually, I think we're net-net. I think after this that we're like 500 million with where we started with. So these things come and go a little bit. Usually, if you lose volume, it's price. And we don't do things for practice here. And we're not going to do things for practice. So we've got a plan to deal with this situation. So we're going to deal with it and try to make the most amount of money we can.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A couple of questions. Scott, I wondered, look like you made some changes recently in depreciation assumptions. Can you just give us a little background on that?","Scott C. Morrison","Yes, we looked at all of our -- if you look at our 10-K, there is a fairly detailed explanation of what we did. But we looked at -- as we standardized accounting practices around the world, if you look at the different lines that we're using in different places, and so we standardize that. And with that came a change in depreciation. What also happened was change in how we expensed some things, too. So net-net, on a full year basis, there really wasn't much of a difference. But that was the change.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then over in food and beverage, can you talk about the fallout, if any, from the drought? And can you also talk about how much that slug business may be adding to EBIT right now?","Raymond J. Seabrook","Yes, this is Ray. The slug business is fairly small. It's up year-over-year. In our food can business, you've heard a lot of commenting on corn. We heard a lot of comment on the radio about corn. Corn is not that big of an impact for us. We're much heavily weighted towards, let's say, green beans or tomatoes. And the drought certainly has an impact. But it hasn't impacted those crops quite as bad as it has corn. The yield even on corn is something like 50%. So our guys -- it's going to hurt us no doubt in the second half from otherwise what it would have done. But I don't think it's a huge impact for us. It'll be lower, but not that significant.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","If you try to put that in just volume terms, right, what would it be, kind of a ballpark, as you see it right now?","Raymond J. Seabrook","I got it more on EBIT terms. But in volume terms, it's probably a 2% or 3% lower than otherwise for us it would have been.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And in EBIT?","Raymond J. Seabrook","Yes, I got it in my head, I'm not trying [indiscernible]. I've got it, but I'm not sure I'm sharing it.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And, John, probably can you just talk about the acquisition landscape and whether you think given the slowing in emerging markets, whether that may present some more opportunities for you if you're patient over the next year or 2?","John A. Hayes","Yes, I think you've hit the nail on head. I do think when you look at where Ball has been successful about acquisitions, it's usually not in times of rosy economic environments, but in more challenging ones. And I'm thinking back into the 2009 when we acquired Metal Container. I'm thinking about the 2006 time frame when we acquired U.S. Can and then back -- even going as far back as 2002 into the headwinds of a credit issue in Germany, we did quite well with Schmalbach. The environment today feels a bit like that. And I think sellers' expectations are coming down. You guys know we're very disciplined in what we do. And so sometimes we're quite competitive than in an acquisition sense, and sometimes we're not because credit is flowing freely, and we have to compete with sponsors, et cetera. But it does feel a little bit better today and as we go forward, not only in developed markets but also, as you said, in developing markets that expectations are becoming a little bit more rational.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Alton Stump with Longbow Research.","Philip Terpolilli - Longbow Research LLC","It's actually Phil Terpolilli calling in for Alton. Just 2 quick questions. A lot of ours have been answered. You mentioned weak volume conditions still in standard cans in North America. Any signs of the major CSD players picking up promotions so far this summer?","Raymond J. Seabrook","That's been one of the issues that there hasn't been a lot of promotion in CSD. I think there's been pockets. But generally speaking, most of our customers have been sticking to their knitting, and they've been going for price and not volume. And I said there's been pockets of it, but there's probably more promotion in beer than there has been in soft drinks.","Philip Terpolilli - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And then Scott, can you quantify that impact of currency to European beverage at all for 2Q?","Scott C. Morrison","From a translation standpoint or on the -- I'm sorry, on the EBIT side you said?","Philip Terpolilli - Longbow Research LLC","Yes.","Scott C. Morrison","I think the translation was $10 million of EBIT in the quarter from a currency standpoint. The rest was the price cost mix that Ray talked about.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Al Kabili with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just on Europe bev, you guys, from the sounds of it, outperformed the overall industry a little bit in the second quarter. And I was wondering if you gained any share this year, or if that's just a geographic mix difference?","Raymond J. Seabrook","I think maybe a tad, but not much. I think we did outperform the market just a little bit. And I think we did gain just -- but it's not a lot. It's -- the shares are still fairly comparable, but I think we did gain a little bit of share.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And can you just help us with -- if you saw any noticeable differences by region across Europe, how that's trending recently?","John A. Hayes","Across Europe, generally speaking, I think in the West -- in the Western part of Europe, it's actually held up okay, for example, in the Benelux region, which is a big export for many of the multinational beer companies there. That's been reasonably healthy. You've clearly seen some softness in the U.K. because of the weather. I don't know who watched the British Open, but you could see how wet it was there. And then as you go into the East, it varies so much. You have some strength in certain areas and some weaknesses in other areas. So I don't think there's big, big deviations between regions in what I just said, however.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's helpful. On the aerospace side, you had a great second quarter there. And I was wondering if that's a sustainable EBIT that you see, or if there was any kind of benefit from onetime project closeout benefits, or how we should be thinking about the run rate for aerospace with the backlog you've got?","John A. Hayes","Yes, the short answer, there was no big material onetime items that impacted the second quarter. Our guys are performing very well. As we've talked about this in the past, we have a bit more -- a fixed cost business as a percent of the total business, which usually is helpful from a margin perspective. And that, combined with our strong execution, we feel pretty good about that business.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And along those lines, you've indicated some potential new business that you're looking at or bidding on there if I caught other earlier comments right. And I was just wondering if you could just help us with potential size of that as relative to backlog. What's in the pipeline there, or what are you seeing for potential new business?","John A. Hayes","Well, I think maybe you hopped on late. We did talk about that we've won some new business. It hasn't been booked, but we expect in third quarter for it to book, and we expect it to be material. Remember, it wasn't, what, 18 months ago that we're close to $1 billion of backlog. We weren't quite there. We can see a line of sight if certain things happen that within the next short period of time, probably not in the third quarter but certainly over the next few quarters, that we could be at or even above that level where we were just 18 months ago.","Raymond J. Seabrook","Was that aerospace or packaging, that question?","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","It was aerospace. Okay, great, that's helpful. And then the last question is just housekeeping on the corporate line. It was lower than at least I expected this quarter. And I was wondering what we should be thinking about for corporate expense?","Scott C. Morrison","This should be similar to what it was last year for full year. There were just some things that occurred in the quarter that were a little bit favorable, but we don't expect those to continue. So full year numbers should be very comparable to last year.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","If we go around the world and just focus on your beverage can business in the key regions, can you provide a guesstimate or maybe you actually have the data of what the market was up in the second quarter and the first half for beverage can demand?","Raymond J. Seabrook","Let me give you the U.S. So the -- let's start with the U.S. So the quarter was down a little bit. You got soft drinks down, and you had beer up. But net-net, the quarter was down about 2%, a little bit less. And then year-to-date, it's kind of flat. And in Europe, you've got the quarter down about 1%, or flattish or down to 1%. And you've got year-to-date of 3%.","John A. Hayes","Up 3%.","Raymond J. Seabrook","The numbers -- yes, up 3%. In Brazil, you've got about 8% market growth in the quarter year-to-date. And I think that was about the same for the second quarter. And in China, it's somewhere between 9% and 12% year-to-date.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. Right. And then Scott, did you guys buy back any stock in July thus far?","Scott C. Morrison","Yes, the comments I made in the prepared comments is through year-to-date, through right now, we've repurchased about 275 million net of shares.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's year-to-date. I thought that was for this second half. Okay, and then it's been really impressive to see how much stocks you bought back over the last couple of years, evident in the share price performance. Looking forward, can you just remind us how you think about buying back stock versus potentially a special dividend versus potentially a more incremental sustainable dividend?","Scott C. Morrison","Yes, we look at the dividend level all the time. We've raised that quite a bit in the last couple of years. But we continue to orient most of our returning value to shareholders through share buyback. And we'll continue to do that. But we do always evaluate what level of dividends we're paying, and where we want to be so.","John A. Hayes","And one of the positives, at least as we sit here today, is tell us what the government's policy is going to be 6 or 9 months from now and we can probably have a firmer answer. But with the elections coming up, I think there's lot of things on the table our government needs to deal with.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo Securities.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of -- kind of help me clarify a few items. When I look at -- Scott, you said that the total impact was about 10 million of currency translation in the Euro bev piece, I believe. If I look at the 19 million differential, at least there's 9 other that part price, but volume were up as well. So can you maybe help me, if you don't mind, parse what the differential is? How that -- the price cut, how that continues through the rest of the year? And then really what I'm trying to drive at, and I think this goes along with another question is, do you feel that in 2013 you can recover a chunk of that?","Scott C. Morrison","Well, I'll give you -- I'll talk a little bit about the quarter though, and maybe let Ray chime in. In the quarter, that [ph] was currency. Remember, we said Aerocan was a little bit softer, so that was a couple. And the rest was on the beverage side price cost mix with volume obviously offsetting some of the price cost, but not all of it. So going forward, as John mentioned in his comments, one of the things we need to do is improve the price cost situation in Europe. And I think we're going to be real focused on that as we move into '13.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And is that event you can do in '13, you believe, carve back even half of that?","John A. Hayes","Well, it's...","Scott C. Morrison","The short answer is, it's too early to tell, but that's what's going to be our objective.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then if you can help me clarify earlier comments where you talked about -- you tried to provide us some color around -- or at least some thoughts around preliminary -- what the contract movements and then what your own actions on the specialty cans and then realignment -- things could do for '13 versus changes. I think you said it would not be material to the enterprise. So -- I mean, should I basically interpret that as 2013 EBIT out of your metal beverage, Americas, Asia could be at worst case flat?","Raymond J. Seabrook","Yes, I -- obviously, it will be lower than otherwise it would have been without the loss of business. No question about that. With the growth in China and Brazil, I would say that that's a reasonable assumption. I think we -- it's too early to predict '13, but based on things that we know, we would tell you that '13 will be flatter than it otherwise would be. And we don't think that -- we think it will be flattish.","John A. Hayes","Yes. Our guys -- having said that, our guys in North America have done a very good job of planning. And while we haven't announced anything, they're well on their way to recouping most, if not all, of the impact there. And so work continues on that. As Ray said -- Ray articulately outlined some of the things we're thinking of, and so stay tuned.","Raymond J. Seabrook","Yes, and the thing is, I would have stressed this, we do have some several near-term opportunities in specialty cans and even in some other things we're working on. So that's one of the reasons we haven't finalized our plans yet. We need to see how these things turn out. So -- and they're not 12-ounce opportunities. They're specialty cans and end situations. So stay tuned.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Fair enough. I guess this is a -- probably a question we'll follow-up with again, after your next quarters, you get a better sense of what you're doing or where things are moving around and what you might win. But that's very helpful. Last question I had was with regards to change of can size and some of the things going on in China. That's a new line that you just put in. I think there had been some conversions from T [ph] that were taking place from 3 to 2. Can you talk a little bit more about what you are seeing in China? What -- why a new line you're putting in place, you're already making  conversion to, what you're seeing?","Raymond J. Seabrook","Yes, we're seeing sort of the same phenomenon. We didn't talk about Europe at even our specialty, what we call non-12-ounce business in Europe, it's up 8% year-to-date. So we're seeing generally a trend from our customers. As they look at their markets, and business is tough out there, they look at new products and new opportunities to expand their markets. And they wanted different sizes, different shapes, different types of things. And even in China where the can is in its infancy, they're still looking at different types of situations for cans. And we want to -- we make sure we give our customers what they need. So you, yes, we -- in China, we've already got our brand new Qingdao line, we're converting to a different size for while. We're going to be on that size for a while, and then we'll convert back to 12 ounce. We put enough flexibility when we built that plant that we have the ability to convert it.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Todd Wenning from Morningstar.","Todd Wenning - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","With the recent fire at your plant in North Wales, do you know yet how that might affect your U.K. supply going into the back of the year?","John A. Hayes","Yes, it's -- this is John. It's -- the short answer is, it's not material. We had a small fire on July 22. There was no injuries. It was just contained in a portion of the facilities. The warehouses wasn't impacted. We expect -- and this happened, I guess, it was on Sunday, I guess, it was. We expect 2 of the 4 lines to be up and running by the end of this week. And then a third line running in the very near future, and then the fourth line, it's too early to tell, but probably a couple of weeks out beyond that. So, not a material impact.","Todd Wenning - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay, well, that's good news. Could you give us an update on your volume expectations for the punch top cans going into the back half?","John A. Hayes","Yes. For those who don't know, the punch top cans, I think, you're referring to is in one of our beer customers. And they've had a lot of good success with that. It's always tough to tell the incremental growth because you don't know what it would have been and without it. But what we've been hearing from our customers is that that's been actually helping the overall brand for them. And they have seen a lift in cans with that package relative to their glass containers. So that's probably all I should say right now. But it's a good example of how innovation can add growth into a category that historically has not been as strong.","Todd Wenning - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then finally, how much of the North America specialty can volume gains came from craft beer versus other beverage types?","John A. Hayes","Difficult to tell. I don't have it in front of me but from a product...","Raymond J. Seabrook","With several energy drinks, we're growing quite strong. We got 16-ounce energy drinks, 24-ounce energy drinks. But I don't have that number either. But it's - - all those specialty can segments are -- continued to show a lot of promise.","John A. Hayes","Yes, and it's not isolated into the one size either. We had good growth in the smaller sizes, good growth into the larger sizes, good growth in Alumi-Tek. So it really is spread across the board.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","John, you mentioned that one of your key near-term priorities in the beverage can market is to get pricing a little bit stronger relative to costs and can you just give us a little more color on the geographies where that needs to be done sort of more than others where it doesn't need to be as much of a focus?","John A. Hayes","Well, I think my comments were related more to Europe than anywhere else. And we've been talking about a little bit of price cost compression. It isn't wholesale, but it's not where we want to be. And so what we're focused on is we can add capacity. Typically, when we do that, it's on the tail-end of a customer contract. You all know how we do that. But we're more focused on a relative sense of getting pricing to where we think it ought to be and getting back to where it was as opposed to adding capacity into a market that has been over-served and has been a bit soft. So that's particularly to Europe. I think generally speaking, the overall economy is putting pricing pressure on many, many different industries, and our industries are not any different. We've been able to weather much of that because we focus on what we do best, which is getting more for less and being very efficient with not only our capital, but our labor and things like that. We continue to have a lot of initiatives over in Asia, here in North America, down in South America and over in Europe to make sure we're focused on that. And we're seeing a lot of good opportunities that our folks in the plants do a great job at making sure that we're doing that day in and day out. And so we're going to continue to focus on that but with particular emphasis on the European side.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Got you. And then I know Ray was talking about the -- using some of the equipment that you might not -- no longer needed in North America, overseas, and just sort of 2 tangents to that. One, I would assume that you cannot effectively use some of the older standard can equipment in making specialty, and that's why you would do that. And secondly, can you give us an idea of the timing? It would seem like this could be stretched out really more into, say, '14 or '15 as opposed to '13 when we could actually see equipment moving. Is that a fair assumption?","Raymond J. Seabrook","As I said, in the next probably 60 days, we'll finalize these plans once we see all these other near-term opportunities sort out. So we will sort that out. We will -- obviously, not all of the equipment is usable, as you just mentioned, but a lot of it is. And we've got a pretty good idea where it goes now, but we will fine-tune that. And by the end of the year, we'll know where it's going. Now it may not be all bolted down and installed right away, but we know basically what -- probably what markets and what we're going to be doing with it.","John A. Hayes","And as Ray -- to follow-up on that as well, there's 2 binary things here. It's one, about the capacity curtailment, permanent curtailment, but then the other thing is about where to put that. And that's dependent upon market growth. And so we're not just going to automatically put it in somewhere just to say we have it in there. I think Ray's point is from a capital avoidance, as we go forward, as new projects come onstream, we have that used equipment at our disposal, which should help drive down some of our CapEx as we go forward.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Got you. And you might have answered this, but just to be clear, you gave us the breakdown between the U.S. volume changes, specialty versus standards, and I'm guessing that standard was down around 5%. So you might clarify that? What was the breakdown in Europe? Overall, you said it was up mid-single digits. How would you break that down between specialty and the standard cans?","John A. Hayes","Well, Ray, I think, mentioned that specialty was up 8%, and we were up just low-single digits. So that would imply that standard was down just a little bit.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We now have a follow-up question from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just want to come back first to a comment that was made on the outlook. Now from your press release, I think you said that the second half you hope to be able to do as well as in the first half, if I remember correctly and --","Raymond J. Seabrook","That was for food can? What segment?","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","No, I think that was in total in earnings per share. So I was just trying to basically take the conclusion one would draw from that, Ray, with your comment that you would hope to be at both, maybe at the low end of your earnings growth target that you have annually, which is 10% to 15%. Because taking a second half that's a little bit better than your first half, if I'm not mistaken, would get you into your range?","Raymond J. Seabrook","Yes, the 10% comment I made is, I think, I was just talking about the Asia and North America segment. Someone had asked me -- I think earlier, we said we still think we could potentially grow that 10% to 15%. I think that's going to be difficult. I think we've got a shot at the bottom into that range, but we're going to get close to it, close to the bottom end of that range.","John A. Hayes","Yes. And I think, George, what's implied there, we expect, as we sit here today, to do a little bit better in the second half than we did in the first half.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, we'll keep that in mind as well. Secondly, same vein of question, when you were talking about the business shifting within the Americas beverage can business, you ultimately mentioned that you didn't think it was significant, and that it would ultimately not be -- I forgot what your phrasing was, but I'll say significant again -- wouldn't be significant relative to your overall Drive for 10 goals, which again includes a 10% to 15% EPS growth. At this juncture, given what -- and I realize some things can change and obviously, you don't control the economy or the weather. Is it your view that next year, you would not be able to hit your 10% to 15% range, or you think you shall be able to do that even with this dent on the volume front?","John A. Hayes","Well, it's -- how I'd describe it is, number one, we haven't changed our view short-term or long-term, point one. Point two, it is too early to tell because there's many things outside of our control. But we have good plans in place, not only in our North American metal beverage business, but in all of our businesses over the next 18 months and beyond. And number three, based upon all of that, as we get into 2013, we expect to do as well as we possibly can, and we're not changing what our long-term goals are.","Operator","There are no further questions on the phone lines at this time.","John A. Hayes","Okay, terrific. Well, thanks, everyone, for participating. As a heads up, our third quarter earnings conference call will be held on October 25, and it's going to be a little bit earlier. It's going to be at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time. And so everyone, have a good rest this summer. Have a good third quarter, and we will look forward to talking to you then. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

Welcome to the Ball Corporation Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call.","During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Wednesday, February 7, 2018.","I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, Chairman, President and CEO for Ball Corporation. Please go ahead, sir.","John Hayes","Great. Thank you, Nelson, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation\u2019s conference call regarding the company\u2019s fourth quarter and full-year 2017 results.","The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements, including estimates related to the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially for those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company\u2019s latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings, as well as the company\u2019s news release. If you don\u2019t already have our fourth quarter and full-year 2017 earnings release -- release, it\u2019s available on our website at ball.com.","Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the Notes section of today\u2019s earnings release. The release also includes a table summarizing business consolidation and other activities, as well as a reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations.","Now, joining me on the call today are Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Dan Fisher, Senior Vice President and COO of our Global Beverage business. I\u2019ll provide some brief introductory remarks, Dan will discuss the beverage packaging performance, Scott will discuss the key financial metrics, and then I\u2019ll finish up with comments on our Food and Aerospace businesses as well as our outlook for 2018.","We were very pleased with our strong fourth quarter comparable operating earnings and free cash flow. Each of our public reporting segments were up year-over-year from an earnings perspective and much of the hard work in terms of cost out and value in and for each of our businesses continued to show up. While we are pleased with this performance, we are not surprised.","Since the closing of the acquisition, there have been questions and opinions regarding our ability to hit our 2017 and 2019 comparable EBITDA and free cash flow targets. When we closed on the acquisition of Rexam 18 months ago, we had a pro forma comparable EBITDA of just over $1.5 billion and laid out a 3.5-year plan to increase that by the end of 2019 to $2 billion, while generating free cash flow in excess of $1 billion.","We also said that we expect it to generate in 2017 comparable EBITDA of $1.75 billion to $1.85 billion, free cash flow in excess of $750 million. Along the way, we knew that there would be ups and downs, but we're confident and had conviction that these targets were achievable.","Nothing has changed in our view. In the 18 months since then, we indeed have had our ups and downs, in the ups column, we have met or exceeded our initial synergies in terms of G&A, sourcing and footprint activities.","We have had exceptional performance from our South American business, continued improvement from our European business, greater stability in terms of North America CST volumes, continued strong growth in craft, sparkling water and other emerging categories, and strong growth in Central America, particularly in Mexico.","We've had good aluminum aerosol growth and continued strong performance from our aerospace business. In the downs column, we have had and continue to face headwinds in terms of domestic U.S. beer consumption, difficult manufacturing performance in our food and aerosol business in the first half of 2017, that is now behind us.","Challenging food industry dynamics, supply disruptions in North American beverage due to the hurricanes last fall, volatile volumes in our EMEA beverage can business driven by governmental regulation, carbonation tax and economic disruptions and continued pricing pressures in China.","However, because and in spite of all of these, we achieved or exceeded our 2017 targets. Our long-term strategy is intact. As we go forward, we will continue to execute our long-term strategy of growing our earnings through a mix of volume, price, cost and supply demand and innovation management, generating higher free cash flow, reinvesting in EVA dollar value creating growth projects and returning excess free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","Now, as we look back over the fourth quarter 2017, several highlights include; the beverage can continue to win versus other substrates across the globe. Depending on geography and on beverage segment, this is due in part to the economic value creation of the can to our customers and their consumers.","It\u2019s recycling and sustainable attributes relative to other substrates. The superior product protection that the can provides the beverage itself, and the overall efficiency the can provides from our freight distribution warehousing and retail shelf perspective. We continue to believe that the can has much further runway to capture a greater share of the packaging mix. Dan Fisher will amplify that a bit more later.","In addition to lowering our G&A cost structure and achieving sourcing savings, we recognize cost savings from the beverage can, plant network optimizations in North America and Europe.","We continue to improve manufacturing efficiencies in our tinplate businesses, and saw a slight pull forward of certain food can shipments in the fourth quarter in advance of anticipated raw material hikes and we achieved record contracted backlog of $1.75 billion in our aerospace business.","Going into 2018, it's on us to execute on our existing plans to maximize the value of each of our businesses, broadening our geographic footprint, aligning with the right customers and markets, expanding into new products and capabilities, leveraging our technical knowhow and positioning our products is the most sustainable in the segments in which we operate.","Key areas of emphasis for us will be the successful startups of our Goodyear, Arizona and Madrid, Spain beverage can facilities, effectively managing our various beverage can footprint initiatives, positioning the can as the most sustainable package in the world in which we live, successfully managing the growth and investment in our aerospace business, profitably growing our aluminum aerosol businesses and improving the probability of our food can and China beverage can businesses.","Thanks to all of our 18,000 plus employees, who helped the company achieve these results with numerous customer awards and once again being recognized as an industry leader on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and on the Corporate Equality Index.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan.","Daniel Fisher","Thanks, John. As we begin 2018, our global beverage businesses are poised to execute on numerous growth projects, network optimizations and product launches. Our global beverage can volumes grew nearly 2% in 2017 and almost 2.5% in the fourth quarter led by South America, Europe and our specialty portfolio.","The beverage can is the most environmentally sustainable and capable package in our customer's line up and you will continue to hear us from all of these qualities to consumers and customers like. John referenced the disciplined growth investments and efficiency activities going on across each of our regional segments. Project teams are aligned on budget and on schedule.","Moving to the individual segments. Though much gets said about continued pressure on domestic mass beer declines, Ball\u2019s North American segment volumes were flat versus the industry, which was down slightly and this is largely due to continued growth in Mexican imports, craft, sparkling water, and brands using specialty containers to promote their products.","And let's not forget that Ball is well-positioned with the two fastest growing segments of the U.S. beer industry, which are Mexican imports and craft and that the beverage can continues to win versus other substrates.","In 2017, cans picked up another 1.5% of share from glass. The North American team did a great job in the fourth quarter and they recorded good financial results despite the lingering effect of higher freight rates.","In advance of our second half 2018 planned network optimization, where will we add no new net capacity and tightened 12-ounce supply demand, we will be contemplating line speed ups and other efficiency programs that remaining facilities across the network.","With this in mind, our first quarter utilization rates will likely be lower than fourth quarter. We have a busy and exciting year in North America and the team is much more on its toes as we position ourselves for additional fixed cost savings in 2018 and beyond.","Our South American business had a really nice quarter. Segment volume grew mid-teens versus mid-teens declined in fourth quarter 2016. In addition to better weather, the overall bill beer consumption trends in Brazil stabilized and our customers further emphasized cans over glass across South America.","With cans growing its share of the beer segment from 43% to 45% in Brazil and even higher package share gains in other surrounding countries. To further support beverage can growth in countries surrounding Brazil and having a multi-year contract in place, we\u2019re building a beverage can plant in Paraguay to serve its needs as well as continued growth in Argentina and Bolivia.","In Brazil, our resulting discipline response to competitive behavior will likely lead to Ball's volume growing slower than the market rate during 2018. Despite this comment, year-to-date demand trends have remained quite favorable in advance of Carnival, and I would expect will remain strong through World Cup.","I do anticipate tougher year-over-year comps in the second half for our Brazil business, due to the profit recorded on the INS manufacturing contract, that supported the divestment business. Going away and challenging year-over-year volume comparisons.","The European business once again saw mid-single-digit volume growth led by Russia and Spain, our ongoing plant construction in Spain is right on track with the plant likely starting up late May, early June, which is a bit ahead of schedule. Our near-term and long-term initiatives to get segment performance back to where Ball's legacy business was are on track and the cost savings from the German plant closure will anniversary in early August.","The ongoing finance transformation projects will largely be complete by year end 2018, which will contribute to planned G&A savings in 2019. The European team finished the year strong both from a free cash flow and earnings perspective and I'm sure everyone is looking forward to World Cup being held in Russia, where we have a nice presence and an outstanding regional team.","In EMEA, demand volatility remains with full year volume down mid-teens yet, the team continues to do a great job dealing with the complexity. As we look forward in the region, we are lowering our cost structure and helping certain governments understand how legacy laws on their books are stifling job growth, and impeding environmentally friendly, packaging growth.","Our China business continues to be cash flow positive and we will continue to exercise a disciplined approach in this market and prudent larger chunks of capital when appropriate.","In summary, our global beverage business posted strong results to close the year. We have a feeling of momentum across most of our regional businesses. We know what we need to do in 2018 and our multi-year thesis for acquiring Wrexham and deploying growth capital remains intact. Thank you again to all of our teams around the globe.","With that, I'll turn it over to Scott.","Scott Morrison","Thanks, Dan. Comparable fourth quarter 2017 earnings were $0.60 versus $0.44 in 2016, a 36% improvement. And full year 2017 comparable earnings per diluted share improved 17% from a $1.74 in 2016 to $2.04 in 2017. Fourth quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflects solid operational performance across every segment and lower corporate costs.","Full year results were driven by strong operating results in our largest global beverage businesses and our aerospace business, offset by slightly lower Food and Aerosol segment performance and higher year-over-year interest expense. Details are provided in the notes section of today's earnings release and additional information will be provided in our 10-K.","Net debt ended the year at $6.5 billion, which was right on top of our expectation after $200 million of pension funding and returning over $200 million to shareholders and despite $275 million of unfavorable FX impact on foreign-denominated debt.","We exceeded our free cash flow goal for 2017 coming in at $922 million after spending $556 million of CapEx. Activities to squeeze working capital out of the balance sheet were incredibly successful and a team effort across all our businesses.","As we think about 2018, we expect full year 2018 comparable EBITDA to be pretty much a straight line straight-line into our 2019 goal of $2 billion of EBITDA. Free cash flow is expected to be in the range of $900 million after spending at least $600 million of CapEx, reporting the completion of the Goodyear with Madrid and Paraguay plans as well as the Aerospace expansion.","Full year 2018 interest expense will be in the range of $295 million. The full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings will be in the range of 23%, we saw on our current estimates of the impact of U.S. tax reform. And corporate undistributed will be in the range of $115 million for full year 2018.","The cash is showing up, so in addition to our ongoing quarterly cash dividends, we\u2019re planning for our share buyback to step up as well. Our initial estimates are for $350 million of share buybacks in 2018, largely but not exclusively in the second half of the year, given the timing of our season seasonal working capital bill.","We feel good about where we are, and at this early stage in the year, we look forward to returning even more value to shareholders in 2019 and beyond.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to you, John.","John Hayes","Great. Thanks, Scott. Our Aerospace business reported an improved fourth quarter results driven by solid contract performance and the continuing ramp-up on new contracts. We\u2019ve been saying that the Ball Aerospace team was winning new work, and it now has translated into contracted backlog.","Our staffing levels will continue to increase in 2018 as we ramp-up on these key wins. The Aerospace team has done a wonderful job leveraging the capabilities of our customer focus, world-class technology and knowhow in talent and year-over-year profitable earnings growth which will extend beyond 2018.","Now, as we look forward for our corporation, as mentioned previously, we\u2019re on track to achieve our 2019 targets largely through the stated synergy benefits from the transaction, continued growth of our beverage can, improved performance from the food and aerosol business, and the ramp up of new business in aerospace. From a synergy perspective, recall that we had a three and a half year plan to realize $300 million of net synergies.","Phase 1 and 2 of synergy capture would be in the form of G&A office reduction in sourcing synergies, which would come within the first 18 month of the closing of the acquisition. We are currently at or above our targets in both of these phases and still have more synergy opportunities that we should realize on the sourcing side in 2018, as well as realizing our shared services, G&A efficiencies in late 2018 and 2019.","Phase 3 is our footprint work, which would come in years one through three following the closure of the acquisition. We have already closed the Recklinghausen, Germany and Reidsville, North Carolina facilities and have announced three plant closures in the U.S.","We were also building new plants in Arizona, Spain, Powerglide in our joint venture in Panama and are installing new lines in several other plants, including Texas and Mexico. Once realized we should be above our goals with this phase.","Phase 4 is to leverage any commercial benefits from the transaction, including but not limited to providing our customers anything, anywhere, anytime with respect to product, service, innovation and other discriminators.","We did not count on any synergies in these \u2013 in this area and if we are able to realize some we said it would be in the backend and beyond to the three and one-half year planning period. We are delivering on our commitments and see a path to further growth beyond 2019, as our newly deployed and 2018 growth capital hits its stride.","And with that, Nelson, were ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird & Company. Please proceed.","Mehul Dalia","All right. Good morning. This is actually Mehul Dalia sitting in for Ghansham. How are you doing?","John Hayes","Good, thanks. How are you?","Mehul Dalia","First question on EBITDA. I guess, your EBITDA comments imply a $1.6 billion in EBITDA for 2018. Is that right? And how should we think about the cadence on a quarterly basis, just given there's a lot of moving parts with plant additions and shuddering throughout the year?","Scott Morrison","No. I don\u2019t think the number you're referencing is right. I would take in the back of the earnings release, I think it rolls up to $1.752 billion. I take that and add $2 billion and divide by 2, that\u2019s kind of get you where I was referring to.","John Hayes","Yeah. Said another way, we finished the year about $1.75 billion. We said by 2019, we'd hit $2 billion. So, split the difference between to that and that's a good guidepost for 2018. I think as we said in the first half of 2018, we actually have some good momentum going into it.","When we go through, there is going to be some ups and downs, but we continue to expect continued improvement in each of the quarters. I think, as we get to the second half of the year with the fall, with no longer providing the ends as we talked about in South America, that will be a little bit of a headwind in South America.","But at the same time, if we execute correctly, we'll be ramping up on some of our cost out initiatives in North America as well as continuing our cost out initiatives in Europe. And so, remember, its February right now, so I think it\u2019s premature to give any additional guidance, but that\u2019s what we see as we sit here right now.","Mehul Dalia","Okay. Great. Yeah. And sorry, I did the calculation wrong, but that makes sense. And just one follow-on, can you \u2013 do you have your expectations for Brazilian growth in 2018? How much lower do you expect that to be for you guys on a relative basis?","Scott Morrison","Yeah. Well, I don't expect it to be lower, I expect it to be higher on a year-over-year basis. I think we will \u2013 with the new market entrants that we gave guidance on in our last earnings call, I expect all the participants to have a slower growth profile than the overall growth in the marketplace.","John Hayes","Yeah. The Brazilian, in particular, but also surrounding countries, the growth in that was quite strong. We mentioned in South America, we had 13% to 15% growth in the fourth quarter and for the full year, it was close to -- just under 10%.","We don't expect that to continue, but I do think in the first half of the year with the World Cup coming up, we'll continue to see some strength but in the second half of the year we're going to be facing some very difficult comps. And I think as Dan alluded to with a new competitor in there, we expect to be growing at a rate lower than the overall market for 2018.","Mehul Dalia","Sorry, I guess my question wasn't clear. I think that's what I was trying to ask. So how much lower do you expect it to be versus the market in 2018?","John Hayes","It's premature to tell. What I would say is probably a couple of points, three to four percent points lower than the overall growth of the market, but that's just a guess because here's the reality, we have a new competitor coming on, they're adding a couple of new lines into that market, which is about a $1.5 billion.","We understand that they are in the process of ramping up and we understand that's largely contracted. Much of that business was able to -- came out of Ball\u2019s business but we still see overall growth well on access of that, so we're going to see some growth in our business just not as great because we face that headwind.","Daniel Fisher","The other signal to the point is to go back to the last World Cup, there will be a winner and a loser from a retail presence and a customer. We don't know who that's going to be at this point and that could -- that makes answering that question a lot harder given the year and the events that are going to take place.","Mehul Dalia","Makes sense. Thank you so much.","John Hayes","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Langton with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Tyler Langton","Good morning. Thank you. I just had a question on the free cash flow guide for 2018. Scott, give us a sense I guess how much working capital is baked into that $900 million number?","Scott Morrison","I think we really overachieved in '17 on getting a lot of the working capital out, so I still expect the benefit in 2018, but it's probably more like a $100 million in '18.","Tyler Langton","Got it. Thanks. And then, just South America is down. I don't know if you can give any -- I know the third-party sales of ends are benefiting. Can you give a sense of like how much I guess they benefited 4Q results and sort of what do you expect for 2018?","John Hayes","We were -- what we\u2019re trying to say it's tough to parse out because we've had that since the close of the acquisition. What we're saying is as part of the divestiture, the company we sold it to is going to be building their own capacity that we expect that to be coming online sometime in mid-2018. So, we've actually been selling them in mid-2016 through mid-2018, in the second half of 2018, we won't be selling those ends.","Tyler Langton","Okay. And then, just final question on CapEx, and I know it's going to be a little bit higher in '18 is $500 million is still sort of depending on projects, a good run-rate kind of through 2018 and beyond?","Scott Morrison","No. We said in '18, we\u2019ll probably spend a little over $600 million -- in the range of $600 million, because we\u2019ve got the big projects are good year, finishing up spending, getting that up and running, some specialty investments and then all the aerospace capital that we\u2019re spending for their facilities.","John Hayes","Yeah. And we also announced yesterday a new -- yeah, a new Paraguay facility.","Tyler Langton","And also, if I may, post-2018 like 2019 beyond is $500 million sort of a\u2026","Scott Morrison","Yeah, I think that\u2019s a good proxy. It depends on growth, right. And if it grows and we continue to find places to deploy capital, we\u2019ll do that. If it's a little bit slower, we\u2019ll probably dial it back. These are some pretty big chunks. So, I would expect it to come down in '19.","Tyler Langton","Got you. Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please proceed.","Anthony Pettinari","Good morning. I had a couple of questions on Europe. I think in your last Q, you discussed pockets of negative pricing in bev cans, obviously had a very strong 4Q. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s abated or to the extent you can if you can talk generally about price cost in the region?","And then, can you remind us in terms of World Cup, typically how that helped your volumes and the timing of that \u2013 of that bump in Europe and maybe the host country?","John Hayes","Yeah. Why don\u2019t I take your first one and I\u2019ll turn it over to Dan. First, in terms of your question, we inherited some comment \u2013 contracts that had year-over-year price increases as we went into the 2017. As we go into 2018, we still have a little bit of it, although it\u2019s a little bit less of a headwind and then those contracts expire.","And so, we still feel some of the effects of it. But I think overall in terms of the overall market tone it\u2019s a relatively flat market right now, in terms of the price cost mix. In terms of your quite second question about the World Cup is, as we\u2019ve alluded to in our prepared remarks, it\u2019s in Russia where we have a very good presence and a very good team.","What we have found is always World Cup \u2013 always adds some benefit, but quite candidly it depends upon what geographies and which regions are doing well in the World Cup. If South America does well, it\u2019ll benefit that, if a European team does well, it will benefit that, and unfortunately, I wish I could say if an American team did okay, but other than Mexico, I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s the case. So, Dan, do you have anything up to add?","Daniel Fisher","Yeah. Just one clarifying comment. I think, John said price increase it was obviously, a price decrease on those contracts that we inherited. So that wasn\u2019t in the negotiating context that was just being inherited and what was built into those. And then the other point specific to World Cup is if the World Cup\u2019s happening in a region, where it\u2019s already peak season you\u2019ll have a negligible increase.","So, to John\u2019s comments if you\u2019re in an off-peak season in a place like Brazil, the World Cup can stimulate growth in that area. So, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily read into Europe\u2019s going to have a significant benefit given the timing of when that happens in it relative to the peak season.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And then just switching to North America, quick question, freight and weather was a big concern in 3Q, is it possible to say how much of an impact higher freight costs had in 4Q? And kind of as you said today, would you say those costs have kind of mostly normalized or how do you think about freight in North America?","Scott Morrison","Well, I would say that the freight rates have definitely increased, what we experienced in the third quarter was disruption because of the weather patterns and with that you get expedited freight rates as opposed to just a natural rate increase.","The natural rate increase is probably in the area of $5 million to $7 million in a quarter in North America, and we\u2019re experiencing that right now in Q1, and we don\u2019t see that dissipating until fuel prices or oil prices come down.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll turn it over.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Edlain Rodriguez with UBS. Please proceed.","Edlain Rodriguez","Thank you. Good morning. Some questions on U.S., like how much was volume down in the U.S. from for Big Beer? And two, do you continue to expect like the strength in Mexico imports and the region down there to continue to be able to offset the weakness we've seen in U.S. mega beer?","John Hayes","Yeah, well, I would say I mean, what we've continued to see when you talk about kind of the top 10 brands in mega beer, they were off double digits for the full year. And then craft beer, Mexican imports and other things like cider, seltzers that go into that category, essentially offset it, so it's negligible a couple of decimal points down in aggregate for North Americas.","Yes, we continue to see all the trends will suggest with the Hispanic millennial, so that will continue to be a demand stimulant and craft beer, it may not necessarily be that the craft beer segment is growing, but substrate penetration has a lot of legs left on it for us in the can.","Daniel Fisher","Yeah. I may just add, I do think people are talking a little bit too much about this mass beer in the United States. It's been in a slow decline for a number of years now and it's been declining.","There's two large mass beer companies in the United States and they've collectively been declining around 3% on some of the bigger brands that Dan alluded to, one of them manufactures their own cans in-house and the other one we do effectively a 100% with in the United States.","We\u2019ve been able to more than offset that through exactly what Dan said and through other categories that have been growing whether it\u2019s Mexican imports, whether it\u2019s Kraft, whether it\u2019s the alcoholic seltzers and we expect those trend trends to continue.","One of the things we are seeing in terms of the mass is they are trying to use different types of cans and specialty cans to really help drive incremental volume. And we expect as we go forward, we\u2019re going to see more and more of that going on.","Edlain Rodriguez","That makes sense. And one last one on Food and Aerosol, I mean I think you\u2019ve noted that some of the volume growth was due to customers carrying more inventories into 2018. Will that lead to lower volume in 2018 given that it\u2019s far been taken away volume from the first quarter or the second half?","John Hayes","You know it could. As we\u2019re sitting here now, we really haven\u2019t seen it. But you know that is a really a seasonal business. And until you get into the big seasonal selling season and planting season, it\u2019s premature to tell. You are right, there was some pull ahead or appeared to be some pull ahead, but it was also a relatively muted pack as well.","And so, it\u2019s difficult to separate those two. I think overall though the market in the fourth quarter was up about 3%. We were up a little bit more than that. But again, for the full year, the overall market was down only about 1%. We were down a little bit more than that. But I wouldn\u2019t read too much into that.","Edlain Rodriguez","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Adam Josephson","John, Scott, Dan, good morning.","John Hayes","Good morning.","Adam Josephson","Just a couple on Brazil, and thanks for taking my questions by the way. Dan, I think you mentioned you expect to grow by a few points less in the market in 2018. Did you -- forgive me if I missed this, but what was the market up by in 2017 and roughly what are your expectations for 2018 in Brazil?","Scott Morrison","I think let me jump in because I have that in front of me. I know the overall market in the fourth quarter was up about just under 5%, 4.5%, 5% and I think overall for the full year, it was up about 3% to 4%.","Adam Josephson","And \u2026.","John Hayes","And in reference to the \u2013 yeah, I said in reference to the go \u2013 the feature question. As we sit here today and refer back to my comment on who the winners and losers are going to be relative to the World Cup. I would expect this to grow slightly below the aggregate market because of the new market entrant.","Adam Josephson","Okay. But a similar level of market growth it sounds like an 2018 versus 2017 up three four sort of thing.","John Hayes","Yeah. The Brazilian economy is coming back, it's still \u2013 unemployment is still higher than what we'd like to see, but you're actually starting to see some positive economic indicators coming out of that. You're starting to see investment that's going to create job growth going into Brazil and that \u2013 to Dan's earlier comments about continued can penetration growth particularly in the beer side which makes up the majority of the can market. Those are the things that underweight the continued growth there.","Adam Josephson","Thanks. And just one other on Brazil, I think you mentioned about 1.5 billion cans coming in and I think let's call it a 26 billion can market. Correct me if I'm wrong there. So, we're talking 5% or 6% capacity growth, you\u2019re talking about growth of 3% to 4%.","So how do you think about just the interplay between those two factors and any pricing impact that you would anticipate based on the fact that it appears as if supply is growing a bit faster than demand this year?","Scott Morrison","Well, remember though, that\u2019s a $1.5 billion, and it all doesn\u2019t come on at once. It\u2019s phased in. And they \u2013 that our competitors started up in the fourth quarter, but they haven\u2019t completely ramped up all the way. So, you\u2019re not going to get a full $1.5 billion in 2018.","Adam Josephson","Thank you very much, John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Mark Wilde","Good morning.","John Hayes","Good morning.","Scott Morrison","Good morning.","Mark Wilde","I wondered, Dan, if you can give us a little bit more guidance on the expansions that you announced yesterday in terms of both the cost and just the timing?","Daniel Fisher","Yeah, I think for, I mean, typically a new \u2013 this is a greenfield startup. And so, you think about in the 18-month to 24-month range depending on environmental permitting, and all the fun stuff that happens relative to that. We\u2019ve obviously made some commitments to our, to our anchor investor there.","The capital outlay would look consistent to a one line can point at startup. The difference for us is we\u2019re going to use a lot of used equipment. So, it\u2019ll be somewhat significantly less than a typical greenfield startup would be. And a greenfield startup one line could be somewhere in the neighborhood of $80 million to $100 million. It will be less than that, depending on how much used equipment and how much new equipment we have to use.","Mark Wilde","And what about in Argentina, Dan?","Daniel Fisher","Yeah in Argentina, we\u2019ve got, we got a facility that -- we\u2019ve continue to make small investments in and we\u2019ll continue to build that facility out. It\u2019s relatively insignificant in terms of capital dollars. So, I think our latest installment will be in the $10 million to $15 million range.","Mark Wilde","Okay. And then just as a follow on, I wondered we\u2019re seeing a little bit of an uptick in aluminum premiums, and I think some of your business in Latin America.","America may be influenced by alumina premiums, can you just talk about sort of what type of impact and what you\u2019re might be doing to kind of hedge yourself there?","Daniel Fisher","You\u2019re able to hedge those premiums so, we won't see a near-term impact for any of that.","Mark Wilde","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks Scott. I'll turn it over.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Debbie Jones","Hi good morning.","John Hayes","Good morning.","Debbie Jones","You made comments about the sourcing benefits and shared services that you think you can get. Should we assume that the opportunity is really in the U.S. and Europe or is this -- are you approaching this across your entire system?","John Hayes","No, it's really across our entire system. There's different opportunities in different places, so it's really across the three big segments and its just different buckets in different places, but in total we're really happy with where we're at, and what we expect to show up in 2018 and beyond in 2019.","Debbie Jones","Okay. And then just it seems to be a bit of renewed debate about plastics specifically in Europe as single-use plastics and I'm just wondering if you think that there could be an opportunity to kind of increase the shift away from let\u2019s say PET and kind of the non-beer categories, are you having any of those conversations, is this an opportunity for you in certain regions?","John Hayes","Absolutely it is. I think all of us for a long time have recognized not only the inherent advantages of aluminum and used aluminum in a recycling stream, but also people are increasingly waking up to the very difficult fact that we're polluting our oceans and putting our world with plastic.","And people often confuse recycling with collection too often that what happens is plastic gets collected, but doesn't necessarily get recycled. And last fall China turned off that spigot where they\u2019re no longer accepting any import of any plastic and that's creating more and more of a discussion about it.","I think it's a wonderful opportunity for the beverage can really be extolling our benefits as the most sustainable package in the world. And I would \u2013 you should expect to see Ball Corporation really starting to put its shoulder into that because I think it's the right thing to do, but more importantly it's in our economic best interest to do.","Debbie Jones","Okay. Thank you. I\u2019ll turn it over.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays. Please proceed.","Scott Gaffner","Thanks. Good morning.","John Hayes","Good morning.","Scott Gaffner","Dan when I think about some of the added complexity that you've mentioned on prior calls within this system, a lot of it seems to be on the printing side of the equation. I\u2019m just wondering from a technological standpoint, has Ball or the industry really being able to solve some of that complexity, such that, it's not nearly as much of an issue as far as changeovers, et cetera within the system. How should we think about that?","Daniel Fisher","Yeah. I think there's been an awful lot of work that's gone on twofold. Obviously, digital printing is really sexy. I think a lot of folks are investing in that. That might be able to apply to certain segments of our business, think about craft beer. And obviously, the proliferation of labels there and \u2013 but the biggest thing right now, it's still costly. I don't know who's going to pay for it right now.","There are some solves but it's at lower speeds and not quite what the industry needs in a $300 billion marketplace. But the other more likely is using robotics and automation on the printers, and obviously a lot of investments going in there.","Nothing has really cemented itself in the four walls of our plans, but I think we're probably a lot closer to that than we have been historically, and why we\u2019ve organized the way we have and around the global businesses to make sure that we're prioritizing investments and increasing skill mix in areas like that to get after that ahead of our competitors and in line with what our customers expect.","Scott Gaffner","Okay. And Scott, when I think about the share buyback for 2018, you said weighted to the second half of the year and I understand that's when you typically generate most of your free cash flow for the year.","But if I look back historically, most of your share buybacks have been in the first half of the year. Is this only in the second half, because we're at an inflection point of trying to pay down the balance sheet first and then getting the free \u2013 to share repurchase or has there been a fundamental sort of rethink about when the timing of share repurchase throughout the year?","Scott Morrison","No, no fundamental change, it\u2019s just we have a big working capital build that happens in the first half of the year, we'll be able to reassess our business after we get through the first quarter and be able to dial it in better. So just as we sit here right now that working capital build will use a lot of our cash right now.","But I think 350 is a good starting point for 2018. And I see that growing in 2019, because I think our cash flow, we expect to get a $1 billion of free cash flow and will be at a point from a leverage standpoint we're really non-delevering has to occur. And I would see us being able to orient all or if not all, the vast majority of that cash to our share buyback and to our dividends and I see that continuing for a while, because this is going to be a cash machine.","Scott Gaffner","Sure. And the last thing is just on the working capital that you generated in 4Q, I mean, how much of that was coming out of the European business because if I recall correctly, I think that business in particular had higher than expected working capital uses in 4Q of 2016, just as broadening our line?","John Hayes","I think you're thinking about it right. The businesses, the large businesses that we acquired from Rexam, they weren't a EVA company. So obviously, there was more opportunity on those balance sheets to get a lot of cash flow.","And we saw that going into the deal and our teams both from kind of our corporate treasury, sourcing legal standpoint working with the finance teams in each of those businesses did a fantastic job and there's more to come.","Scott Gaffner","All right. Thanks guys. Congrats on a good quarter.","John Hayes","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Brian Maguire","Hi, good morning, everyone.","John Hayes","Good morning.","Brian Maguire","Just wanted to cut back on South America, is obviously a really strong performance in there, at least relative to what we were expecting. Just wondered if you could, looking at the 23.5% margin you generated there, is that kind of in line with how you guys thought the quarter was going to shape up.","And I just wanted to get a sense of how sustainable that was or if there were any sort of one timers or good guys in there that would reverse out in 2018 other than the \u2013 other than ends plant and the new entrant to the market that you called out?","John Hayes","Maybe, I\u2019ll point, because as we've said in the past that you know that, that is an excellent management team we have scale there which is very important. It's a seasonally strongest quarter. And we grew volume wise 14%.","That in large part is what drove the continued strong performance as Dan had mentioned and as I had talked about, as we go into 2018, I do think that, that is unsustainable from a margin perspective, because the competitive nature that Dan alluded to and because we'll be losing some end volume and so we're going to have to right size that size of it.","But yes, we had a better than expected quarter in South America, but not just South America. Dan alluded to it, it\u2019s in the rest of the surrounding countries, Argentina. That's why we're building in Paraguay, and Chile was another one that will continue strong growth. So, I think we did very well there and candidly above our own expectations.","Daniel Fisher","Yeah, I would just echo that. We were better than expected, but we were not surprised, and that's why we were able to deliver. So, we had \u2013 we were reading in August and September that this was going to be a strong fourth quarter from some of our major customers there, and we made sure that we had capacity on line in metal to deliver, and that's what showed up.","John Hayes","Okay. Great. And then just switching gears to the Food business. I think in the past, you've sort of articulated it, it doesn't consume a lot of capital, generates a lot of cash. Just wondering if the thought there on its strategic position in the overall company has changed at all in the last couple of months and just any thoughts on how that business will contribute to Ball going forward?","Daniel Fisher","Well, it's an important part of our business and it is part of our business until it\u2019s not anymore, but our sole objective is to maximize the value of each and every one of our businesses, and we\u2019ve had some manufacturing issues in the first half of 2017. We got pass those and you see since that time, they've had year-over-year profitability improvement.","And as we go into 2018, we continue to expect continued improvement in that business. We are facing headwinds in terms of secular decline in terms of the Food category, the food can category, but that doesn't mean we don't expect to make more money as we go forward.","Brian Maguire","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Chip Dillon with Vertical. Please proceed.","Chip Dillon","Yes, and good morning. A couple of questions. Could you update us on the start time that you expect for the Madrid plant? Number one. And number two, you mentioned I think Scott mentioned that CapEx in 2019 would likely be down. Would that be the case if it made sense and could it make sense to add capacity somewhere in Mexico given that it will have been a while since you last added that third line in Monterrey?","John Hayes","For the startup in Madrid I referenced in the notes at the beginning a little ahead of where we thought maybe 90 days ago, but tail end of May, beginning of June which is probably three to four weeks ahead of where we thought this time last quarter.","Scott Morrison","And on the CapEx side, as I mentioned, we've got some big projects coming on that'll come online in 2018 and then we'll see what kind of opportunities we have going forward. We're always talking with our customers to make sure that if they're growing we're able to supply that growth and we'll see where that takes us.","Chip Dillon","And then just as a quick follow on. Can you talk a little bit about how your mix changed last year or either you know in a given region or as a company when you look at specialty versus standard? And is that partly a factor in what's going on down in South America?","You mentioned the new competitor. Are they mainly coming into the standard sizes and that's sort of and therefore that's what you're losing in terms of share and maybe that will be over time offset by higher specialty volumes? Any comments there would be helpful.","John Hayes","Yes, so it's hard to parse out the definition of what is standard and specialty can is outside of the U.S. because all the other markets around the world have essentially gone through something other than a standard 12 ounce or 33 scintillator can.","So, the competitors coming in with cans that are not at 33 scintillator can, but that doesn't mean that that's not the overwhelming majority of product that shift in that marketplace. And I think our specialty growth has been in line or slightly ahead in probably every region in the world and we continue to see that continuing as that's what the end consumer preference is, that's what our customers want and that's what we've been investing in.","Scott Morrison","Just to give you context, sorry, on a global basis, our specialty mix is about 37%, and to Dan's point in South America, it's almost 50%. When you think about how we define it in the United States, and it's even much greater in EMEA, it's closer to 80% to Dan's point. And so, it varies, but we are seeing growth in specialty stronger than growth in quote, \"standard in every major market\".","Chip Dillon","And the 45% in Brazil, that's just for beer or for everything?","Scott Morrison","No. That's for everything.","Chip Dillon","Okay. Thank you so much.","Scott Morrison","Yeah. And when you said 45%, I want to clarify. I said just under 50%, so it's between 45% and 50%.","Chip Dillon","Okay. Of the share that can have them all \u2013 all beverage continues?","Scott Morrison","Clarification, the 45% is can mix. And so what John referenced was the mix within that can mix. Yeah, the specialty \u2013 set in other way, just under 50% of all cans we sell in South America are specialty containers.","Chip Dillon","Understood, but you had said earlier that the can share of all substrates I believe or was it just for beer went from 43% to 45%? That was in the prepared remarks. I didn't know if that was for beer or for everything?","Scott Morrison","I'm sorry. That was just for beer.","Chip Dillon","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of George Staphos of Bank of America. Please proceed.","George Staphos","Hi everyone. Good morning. Thanks. Thanks for all the details and for taking my question. So, I know you didn't really want to chat too much about or you feel that we chat too much about North American beverage.","I want to come back to a question here as it relates to the fourth quarter. Was there anything aberrational from what you saw in terms of your customers and\/or their customers in terms of destocking.","We had heard from some of our contacts that there might have been a little bit of effect there, were in effect related to changes in excise taxes part of the overall tax policy regime change that we've had in the states. I don't know if you have any numbers around that but I was curious.","And then on specialty, maybe piggybacking off of Chip\u2019s last question, what was the specialty growth for you? Recognizing it's difficult to parse, you had to put a number on it either globally or within North America in the quarter?","Scott Morrison","I'd say on the destocking and in excise tax really no, no impact to us. And then on the specialty growth\u2026","John Hayes","Yeah, it was about 10% on a global basis.","George Staphos","Okay. Thank you for that. And then the next question I had, if we think about the synergies with Rexam, and again traditionally, it was around SG&A procurement footprint.","And it sounds like from your comments earlier in the presentation that those are at least trending in line or better than your expectations.","I know better than to ask you for a specific number guys but is there any one bucket that is seeming maybe a little bit better than your initial expectations, recognizing that the whole pie is at least in line or better than where you initially started? And if so, could you provide some additional clarity around that?","Scott Morrison","Yeah. Let me -- let\u2019s take a step back and when we said that net 300, it roughly broke into about a third a third, a third between G&A, sourcing and then manufacturing\/footprint\/all other.","On the G&A side, we said we'd probably get half of it through closure of offices, and recall that we closed the Millbank office, and remember that in June of last year, we closed the Charlotte office. We probably got a half or a little bit more of that.","The second half of it, it's going to be coming from moving a lot of activities into our shared services areas that we stood up in 2017, including Quer\u00e9taro, Mexico and Belgrade.","So, we have yet to get half of that $100 million from G&A, and we expect to get that late 2018, but really going into 2019. On the sourcing side, we have gotten all of that, and of that roughly $100 million and we think there could be a little bit more as we go into 2018.","And then, as you know, on the footprint side, we have announced the closure of Recklinghausen and closed it in August, we announced the closure of Reidsville in United States and closed that last summer.","We have only haven't even gotten a full year benefit of those, and we've announced three additional closures in North America that we've gotten zero benefit from. And we said between those three things on a run rate basis, it's approximately $120 million.","George Staphos","Okay. Fair enough. And so, when it actually occurs then you can measure it, then we can ask you at least qualitatively how you performed there, but certainly nothing that would suggest that you're not trending where you expect to be on that front.","Phase 4, can you provide a little more clarity in terms of what phase goes into Phase 4 and is there any commercial benefit built into that recognizing it would be in excess of the $300 million dollar plus that you had guided to.","John Hayes","Well, I'll stand by what I said, that we have counted on no benefits in any of the numbers we've talked about from a 2019 perspective in our related to the commercial activities.","But the various types of things that you should think about that we are contemplating is number one, let\u2019s just focus here in North America. Dan, talked about we are building a new plant and closing three new facilities and we're adding no new net capacity.","So, we're closing standard 12 ounce and adding specialty. The continued growth of that is a part of it. Changing the customer mix over in Europe where we were far too over weighted to soft drink is a part of it.","I talked about in Europe that we inherited some contracts that were declining year-over-year to at a minimum stop that decline is another example. I could go on and on, but there's hundreds of different things, in terms of being more disciplined about the call off, fences that we allow our customers to order, so they can't change their orders within 12 hours, but they need 48 hours or 72 hours to do it.","There is hundreds of different things. Those often require renegotiation of contracts. And as you know George and the other people know that when we closed on the acquisition of it, we said we have no big contracts coming up for a couple of years. So, you put that all together and hopefully you're starting to see a mosaic that we're painting towards.","George Staphos","That's where I was going with the remaining question so. I appreciate the color guys. I'll turn it over and congratulations on the year.","John Hayes","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Chris Manuel","Good morning, gentlemen. Congratulations on a strong finish to the year and really good outlook here for 2018 and beyond. I wanted to switch gears a second if I could, and help us a little bit with aerospace.","So, I kind of look at the progress of the backlog, just two years ago the backlog was around $600 million, so you almost tripled the backlog over the last couple of years and I know there kind of tends to be a little bit of a lag as that gets monetizing goes forward.","But appreciating that we\u2019re packaging analysts moonlighting in this aerospace business to try to cover help us with how you would anticipate revenue and EBIT growth goes in the next couple of years?","Thinking about something that\u2019s $10 million to $20 million of EBIT growth that does that sound crazy to you in the next couple of years?","John Hayes","No. I think that\u2019s not the realm of possibility at all. The only point of nuance that I would add is usually the growth of the profitability on the frontend of those contracts is a little bit slower as you de-risk those contracts and it ramps up. And so, I think as we start to execute on this you\u2019re going to see all things being equal or slightly muted growth and then if we perform well, we see it on the backend as you know and we\u2019ve done that time and time again.","Chris Manuel","Okay. And the new business has come in is it proportionally weighted towards fixed or cost plus or how should we think about kind of where that sits?","John Hayes","Yeah. No. It\u2019s a little bit more proportionally weighted towards cost plus and we have been over the last three to five years. A lot of these are very big programs, some of them are developmental programs and as you know in a developmental program, the cost plus is far more favorable for us and our customer because the specs, if you will, have not been defined.","Chris Manuel","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, one question for Scott. As we think about the working capital component, I think you indicated this year perhaps another $100 million and how should we think about that going forward?","Does it start to appreciating at a lot you wanted to bring out of Rexam as you translate it -- migrated them towards an EVA platform, but metal costs are going up a little bit, should we kind of think that working capital begins to flatten out after 2018 or do you feel you start a little more runway?","John Hayes","I was way too early to tell. We think 100 is a good proxy for 2018, but every year, our people have been \u2013 when people are motivated by EVA, they get incredibly creative on ways generate even more. And so, I'm sure as we get through 2018, they'll be thinking about what we can do in 2019.","Chris Manuel","Or perhaps, there's something as you open up Goodyear and you get the other three plants closed that can continue to move as well. So okay, that's helpful.","John Hayes","Yeah.","Chris Manuel","Last question I had was book and cash tax. So, I think you indicated that the book rate was going to migrate down in 2019 or 2018, I'm sorry.","John Hayes","2018.","Chris Manuel","2018. You have a number for us to what you did cash taxes in 2017 and what you think kind of a reasonable cash tax rate might be on a go-forward basis from here?","John Hayes","We didn't pay much in the way of cash taxes in 2017. We've got NOLs that we\u2019re utilizing, and we will pay much in the way in 2018. That wasn't \u2013 that wasn\u2019t different with the tax reform that was already anticipated.","Chris Manuel","That's for our U.S. tax.","John Hayes","Correct U.S. taxes.","Chris Manuel","Yeah. So, as a whole corporate. I mean, there\u2019s something in the 20%-ish range reasonable for cash taxes going forward?","John Hayes","It would be -- there would be -- let me check on that, Chris, and I'll get back to you, I think it's lower amount.","Chris Manuel","Okay. Thank you. Good luck, guys.","John Hayes","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Arun Viswanathan","Great. Thanks. Just a question on the European margins. They are slightly below our estimate. And just wondering, if that was more due to a metal pass through or if it\u2019s just kind of delayed benefits from some of the actions or if it\u2019s just kind of delayed benefits from some of the actions you\u2019ve taken there like working housing?","John Hayes","You\u2019ve got a -- are you adjusting for the depreciation change?","Arun Viswanathan","Yes.","Scott Morrison","Well, I think there -- to answer is they\u2019re in line or ahead of where we anticipated 90 days ago. So, I can\u2019t comment on it Bob.","Arun Viswanathan","Okay, no problem. Similarly, in the U.S., I guess, your margins also on our basis was little bit lower. But how would you characterize that versus your own expectations? Was there added softness from the beer weakness?","John Hayes","No, we didn\u2019t, I mean, we didn\u2019t experience the beer weakness in Q4 largely due to our customer mix and our segment mix. The only thing, we were favorable on basically every line item of our cost structure in the fourth quarter with the exception of the continued headwinds on the freight rates. But all-in-all, we were ahead of where we thought we\u2019d be in Q4 in the U.S. as well.","Arun Viswanathan","And then just real quickly what will an appropriate level of corporate expense per quarter going ahead?","Scott Morrison","Well, I\u2019d say it\u2019d be 115 for the full fourth quarter.","Arun Viswanathan","Okay. Thanks.","John Hayes","Well, thank you.","John Hayes","All right. Nelson, we\u2019ll take one more question, then we\u2019ll wrap it up.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is a follow up from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Mark Wilde","Yeah, I\u2019m just curious if we can get any sense of what the incremental CapEx is in Aerospace?","Scott Morrison","Yeah, so it\u2019s an excess of $100 million.","Mark Wilde","Spread over several years.","Scott Morrison","Yeah, spread over couple of years. We\u2019ve got, if you come out to Colorado market, we\u2019ve got a number of big projects going on right now to expand the number of test facilities and manufacturing facilities. And that will be mostly in 2018 and in 2019.","John Hayes","Yeah. And just to give you a context, in our satellite manufacturing, we're building some more chambers by which you test, so much larger chambers. And then, as you know, we've experienced some very strong growth in our tactical products, which are the -- everything from the stealth antennas to the video cameras.","And we are building on a very large manufacturing wing onto our existing manufacturing site. Those were the probably the two biggest ones and if you came out and wanted to visit, we\u2019d be happy to show you.","Mark Wilde","I'd love to do that. John, I just wanted to ask about this diet coke rollout. That's they've been publicizing over the last several weeks, and lately, it\u2019s going into sleek cans. And I wondered if you\u2019re just \u2013 you're seeing kind of more inquiries from the beverage companies on that sort of thing.","John Hayes","Yeah. I think that hits to the trend that Dan talked about earlier and I did as well, I think you're seeing that's why we're seeing 10% growth on a global basis of our specialty. And I think repositioning that is a great example of creating profit pools for themselves and using specialty cans to help do it for them.","Mark Wilde","And if that works, if that roll out takes, will they usually use the same packaging format kind of globally, so they use the sleek cans in other markets around the world.","John Hayes","Not necessarily because tastes are very different by geography and region, and also they have different bottlers that have different areas of focus, but I do think the use of specialty generally is you are seeing more and more across all of our customer base.","Mark Wilde","Okay. That's helpful. Listen, good luck in the year.","John Hayes","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And there are no further questions.","John Hayes","Okay. Great. Thank you, Nelson, and thank you, everyone for your participation and we look forward to a strong 2018.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line."],"2731":["Ball (NYSE:BLL) Q1 2014 Earnings Call May  1, 2014 11:00 AM ET","Executives","John A.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, May 1, 2014.","And I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hayes, Chairman, President and CEO. Please go ahead, sir.","John A. Hayes","Thank you, Jasmine, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's first quarter 2014 results.","The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings, as well as the company's news releases.","If you don't already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website.","Now before I begin my formal comments today, I'd like to thank everyone on the call and many others for the support, caring and understanding during the loss of both of our friends and colleagues, Gerrit Heske and Ray Seabrook. Many of you know them, and words cannot describe the outpouring of support from our family here at Ball, our customers, our suppliers, shareholders and competitors. Thank you.","We will move forward as they would want us to and build upon the legacy of excellence that they have helped create and perpetuate.","Now joining me on the call today is Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Like many here at Ball, Scott has also stepped up and is acting as Interim Chief Operating Officer for our global beverage can business. I'll provide a brief overview of our company's performance. Scott will discuss financial and global packaging metrics, and then I'll finish up with comments on our aerospace business and the outlook for the remainder of 2014.","Our first quarter results came in nicely ahead of expectations. The momentum we carried into the year continued across all of our businesses throughout the quarter, truly a testament to all of the hard work put in by our people here at Ball. Excellent cost management across our global packaging businesses, volume growth in Europe and Brazil, continued specialty can and beer container growth in North America, key aerospace program deliveries and our disciplined returns-oriented capital allocation strategy drove these results.","During the first quarter, we experienced much more constructive beverage can volume throughout most regions of the world than we had seen in the first part of last year. We further improved operating costs in our European segment, and we saw continued growth for beverage cans in the region. We are proud of the work our European beverage team has accomplished at both the plant level, as well as the support functions.","We continued to experience strong demand in Brazil, which contributed favorably to the results as preparation for the 2014 World Cup and Carnival extended the summer selling season.","North America tinplate container volumes were lower-than-expected in the seasonally slow quarter. And operationally, we got off to a slower start than we would have liked. Scott will go into that in more detail in a minute.","And aerospace, for the second year in a row, was awarded Boeing's Avionics Supplier of the Year award. Out of a total of 14,000-plus suppliers that service Boeing, this is yet another example of our close-to-our-customer focus as part of who we are.","As we entered the year, we believe that 2014 was shaping up to be a better year than 2013, and the first quarter helped to reinforce this. We're experiencing good global beverage can volumes versus this time last year. Our focused efforts to identify pockets of growth and manage our cost structure are bearing fruit. Both will drive EPS growth, EVA dollar generation and strong and consistent cash flow in 2014 and beyond.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott for a review of our first quarter numbers. Scott?","Scott C. Morrison","Thanks, John. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share were $0.81 versus last year's $0.58. In addition to John's comments around better year-over-year global beverage can volumes and cost-out progress, a lower share count contributed to our improved results. During the quarter, we acquired a net $194 million of stock and returned another $19 million to shareholders in the form of dividends. And presently, the majority of our free cash flow is expected to be returned to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends.","For the full year, no big changes to our previous financial metrics. Free cash flow is still expected to be in the range of $550 million; share buybacks around $500 million; CapEx around $375 million, with it being more back-end loaded; interest expense at about $163 million; effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 29%; and full year corporate undistributed is now expected to be closer to $80 million.","Net balance sheet debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $3.6 billion. Credit quality and liquidity of the company remain solid, with comparable EBIT-to-interest coverage at 5.2x and net debt-to-comparable EBITDA at 2.9x. Committed credit and available liquidity at quarter end was in excess of $1 billion. For a complete summary of first quarter results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, please refer to the notes section of today's earnings release.","Moving to operations. Our metal beverage Americas and Asia segment comparable earnings were up roughly $20 million in the first quarter. Year-over-year benefits from cost-out programs, excellent operating performance at the plant level and continued specialty can growth in the Americas all contributed to better segment results.","In the quarter, North America volumes continued to be sluggish for standard cans in the carbonated soft drink category. However, cans for beer were up and Brazil volumes were up strong double-digits. Our China volumes were off slightly due to capacity constraints and some regional supply demand issues, though excellent plant performance and efficiencies ensure that our China business continues to generate positive EVA dollars.","European segment profit was up roughly $25 million in the first quarter due to mid-single digit volume growth and the benefits of reduced costs. Food and household comparable segment earnings were up slightly in the quarter as mid-single digit volume declines for tinplate containers in North America were offset by mid-single digit volume increases in Europe for extruded aluminum containers.","More recently, we have seen some modest price cost compression in the U.S. food and household segment, which will impact us as we move through the balance of 2014.","We also were impacted by incremental manufacturing efficiencies due to weather, inventory adjustments and plant performance.","In summary, our beverage operating team is doing an excellent job meeting outsized demand in Brazil and favorable demand in Europe, while at the same time, we are preparing for continued manufacturing projects in North America and Europe to further improve our packaging businesses.","With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.","John A. Hayes","Great. Thanks, Scott. Our aerospace business performed very well in the quarter. Solid execution and higher award fees on existing programs, successful deliveries and launches and recognition of our aerospace team's performance not only with Boeing, but with other customers were some of the highlights. Contracted backlog at the end of the quarter was $868 million and, as I mentioned on our January call, we are pursuing several large programs that are expected to be awarded by year end.","During the quarter, the Ball-built GMI instrument was successfully launched from Japan and began collecting science data on the Earth's rain and snowfall. Also, the Ball-built Kepler satellite, NASA's first mission to find Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone, marked its fifth year anniversary of planet hunting. And so far, it has identified 715 new planets, quite an accomplishment in its own right.","Now looking out across our business today. We are not without our challenges. The pricing environment in China has yet to improve. Our North American tinplate business has a bit more headwinds than we have had in the past and volume comps will likely normalize as we head into the back half of the year as the World Cup concludes and we lap a strong second half of 2013.","However, and most of all, our business has stepped up and delivered. This quarter was one filled with personal loss and numerous business accomplishments. The term resilience comes to mind, and we are moving forward as a team. I am proud to be a Ball employee.","Given the strong start to the year, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our long term diluted EPS growth goal of 10% to 15% in 2014 and beyond, while growing our EVA dollars.","And with that, Jasmine, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi from Baird.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","First off on Brazil, what do you estimate market growth was during the quarter? How much do you think was the World Cup? And on an underlying basis, what do you see occurring in the region? It seems like there's another beer tax being implemented. I guess, what are your customers saying in terms of demand expectations for the year?","Scott C. Morrison","Market in the first quarter was really strong. It was up high-teens. We were up more than that because, if you remember, we put in that new line in the fourth quarter of last year, so we grew about -- a little more than 10 points higher than the market in the first quarter. We are seeing very strong volumes and good growth in specialty cans. I'm a little nervous as to what happens after the World Cup. There seems to be a lot of momentum going into the World Cup. But we'll have to wait and see. And we have tougher comps in the second half because of that line.","John A. Hayes","And then also, Ghansham, I might just add, I think it was even yesterday, the Brazil Finance Ministry raised taxes on beer and soft drink effective June 1. And it's our understanding it will increase the price at the retail about 4% or 5%. And while this could have an impact on volumes in the second half, obviously, how much, it's too early to tell at this point in time. But we are a bit cautious about that in the second half.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. Makes sense. And then on Europe, I know you had an easier comparison from a year ago, but was there anything unusual from an EBIT standpoint, if you kind of think about the year-over-year variance? And if you can isolate for us the cost savings impact year-over-year, that would be helpful.","Scott C. Morrison","It's really a combination. If you look at last year, in the first quarter, volumes were down a fair amount. This year, first quarter, our volumes were up nicely. That, combined with the cost-out programs, the combination of those 2 things, specialty can growth, stronger growth in Eastern Europe, all those things helped the first quarter. So it was a very strong quarter.","John A. Hayes","Yes, I might just add that in a fixed-cost business -- I think we talked about this before -- it's always difficult to separate the cost out from the volume impact, but we are on track relative to our cost-out programs that we've laid out in prior conference calls. And with the added benefit of some more constructive volume, I think that's what you saw.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Philip Ng with Jefferies.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Europe was off to a very strong start with the margins in that 12% ballpark already. I know it's a seasonally smaller quarter, but are you guys on track to hit that 12% margin target already for 2014 or should -- could you see some margin pressure with the metal premiums kicking in?","Scott C. Morrison","Yes, we do have some headwinds in the back half of the year from the metal premium that I talked about before to the tune of around EUR 6 million, if it stays where it is right now. I think what we said is, we expect to be kind of in that 11% to 12% range this year. But we're still working. The cost-out programs, as John mentioned, are on track and continue to progress and proceed, but we won't get the full benefit of that until we get into next year, frankly.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then, noncontrolling line was up more than 50%. I assume that's mostly Brazil, but can you comment on that? And were there any -- were customers building inventory for the World Cup a little sooner than normal?","Scott C. Morrison","That's a good question. Yes, the answer to the increase in that line is mostly Brazil. And building to the advance of World Cup -- remember, they had a very good summer, so weather was very warm throughout their summertime. Carnival was late, which kind of extended the summer. So we've gotten a couple of benefits, plus then as we start to get into the World Cup. So I think, the combination of all those plus having an additional line that we didn't have last year at this time, all of those helped drive the results.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just one last final one. Beer demand in North America was quite strong, particularly for bev cans. Are you seeing that momentum spillover in 2Q? And I just wanted to get a little more color on that front because beer, I don't think, was that strong overall for the category. So are you outpacing the market from share gains or are you seeing a pack mix shift?","John A. Hayes","No, I think it's mostly a pack share or pack mix shift. The overall beer market actually was strong in the first quarter despite some of the weather. And I'm not talking just cans. But cans also continued to grow its share of the package mix within the beer category. Just a little statistic, we've talked about the craft beer industry and how the growth of cans has been helpful there, that the can as a share of the package mix is now in double-digit percent, where just 5, 6 years ago, we weren't selling any cans into that. So there's various trends going on like that, which have been very constructive in the beer category.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","You referenced some price compression in food and household and some pressure in North American tinplate. And I'm wondering if you could quantify the pressure you saw in the first quarter and what you might expect for the remainder of the year and maybe give a little color on what's driving that?","John A. Hayes","Yes, well, what's driving it is, as most people know, I think to a degree, and we had anticipated this, that there's some new capacity coming onstream in North America. And I think it's certainly in the second half of the first quarter. As a result of some of this competitive activity, we've been nicked a bit going forward. We're going to be standing firm with respect to maintaining our customer base, but we've had to respond to some of the pricing extensions that others have done. But more importantly, I think, assets related to what we've already announced have been moving around. And that's been creating some disruption in our manufacturing footprint right now. And so as we look forward, I think we have some challenges, not only on the pricing side, but also on the manufacturing side that we need to get right. And then as you rightly pointed out, it's seasonally slow. And as we go into the pack, we had a pretty good pack last year, so it's unknown what the pack is going to look like this year. That those are the issues that weigh on our mind when we think about that segment.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then just switching to Americas bev. You referenced, I think, stable beverage volumes in North America. If I go back to last year, I think you had referenced double-digit volume declines in 12-ounce cans. So I was just wondering, if you look at your 12-ounce volumes, were they flat or up or down versus last year's comps? And generally, how did you feel about the demand for standard cans that you saw in the U.S. in 1Q given kind of an easier comp, but difficult weather. How do you [indiscernible].","John A. Hayes","Good question. Recall that last year, we had some higher declines in the industry due to a loss of some business a couple of years ago. And obviously, we don't have that now. I think the overall tone for standard cans in North America is a bit better today. Not wholesale better, but a bit better than it was this time last year. We did have some tough weather in the first quarter of this year. But having said that, the overall category was roughly flat, and I described it as specialty being up. And the standard cans, which make up the majority of it, being down slightly. But certainly not down the 4% to 6% as an industry that we had been seeing last year.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","My question was really on -- first a follow-up on the North American metal food business. I just want to make sure in conjunction with the price compression, have you been able to link them to contracts and lock those customers in for longer periods of time? And second on that, I think when we talked last, you didn't think you were going to see this type of compression just given where your customers are located. Can you talk about maybe something that changed that led to this decision?","John A. Hayes","Well, I think, as we said in the first quarter, that we have a variety of contracts, number one. And what we saw as we went through the quarter is that some other customers and some other competitors that were looking up to lock up volume a little bit more longer term. And as a result of that, our discussions with our customers shifted just a little bit. And so we had to respond to a couple of certain situations. Obviously, when you're in discussions like that, you want to get something, if you have to give something. And so that's what -- whether it's contract length or other things like that. And so that's what we certainly had been focused on. And so, as I've said -- I wouldn't read into it wholesale. It's hurt a little bit, but not -- certainly for our corporation, it's not material, but we did see a little bit more activity than we had expected. We had expected it later on this year, but it just happened a little bit sooner, I think.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then when we look to the underlying demand trends in North America with CSD falling and sounds like you're picking up incremental wins, maybe with some small craft beers and whatnot in the beer category. When you look at your overall footprint in North America, are there some changes that would need to be made going forward if that mix continues to shift? Meaning beer outperforms CSD or can you serve the existing customers off your existing footprint?","John A. Hayes","I think the current trends that we saw in first quarter, and recall, it's only a quarter. So a trend doesn't make that. But if those trend -- type of trends continue, as we said in January, we feel pretty good about where our footprint is. We, over the last few years, have taken out a fair amount of capacity, and we've converted existing 12-ounce capacity to specialty. Some of the growth in beer is not only on 12-ounce, but it is also on specialty containers. But I do think just overall, when you take a step back relative to a year ago, the overall tone of the soft drink is a little bit better. The tone of beer, we have beer growth right now and can share penetration growth in the beer segment, so that's good. And then specialty off a bigger base continues to grow nicely. So I just think overall, as an industry, the tone feels a touch better. But again, we're also very cognizant that it was a seasonally slow first quarter.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just one last one on the North American carbonated soft drink market. Have you seen any signs of promotional activity from your customers or are we still sort of in this period of -- where they're trying to improve their margins and maybe not promoting as much? Have you heard anything?","John A. Hayes","I think actually in the first quarter, you saw a little bit more promotional activity than you would have seen in a first quarter in prior year. And I do think, as we've talked in the past, that the CSD customers are trying to optimize this value versus volume equation. And they also recognize that, given the elasticity of CSD and some of the health and wellness issues, that you just can't keep pushing price and expect volumes not to decline. And so we have seen a little bit more promotional activity, but it's way premature to talk about what type of promotional activity we'll see in the summertime.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I want to pick up on the promotional activity. I mean, we've heard from some of the case producers that there is, in fact, a bit more promotion in the soft drink side. Do you think that, that can continue given what looks to have been a little bit more success and a little more volume through retail channel for soft drinks?","John A. Hayes","Again, yes is the short answer to your question. We think there can be some more promotional activity. A lot of it has to do with weather and is more regional. I think what you're seeing -- we used to talk in the years past about promotional activity, and that sounded like it was a national opportunity. You're seeing much more promotional activity done at the very local level, and it's much more on the execution side of that. We have seen more of that certainly in the first quarter. I think we would expect to see a bit more of that as we go into the summer, but time will tell.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Next question. From my take on your commentary regarding North American food, correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounded like you were somewhat disappointed in terms of your execution of your plans as far this year were perhaps being surprised by the activity being a little bit more front-loaded. Is that a fair assessment or is that off the mark? And realizing you can't comment too much on a forum like this, what could you tell us qualitatively about what you're doing to adjust going forward, both from a cost and from a contractual standpoint?","John A. Hayes","Well, first, with respect to some of the headwinds we're facing, we talked a little bit about the pricing side. But we are, as I mentioned, we do have a fair amount of assets related to a couple of plant closures, Elgin, Danville, we have announced in the past year. And candidly, getting the equipment installed and getting it running up to our specifications and expectations has gone a bit slower. And our manufacturing people are working extremely diligent to get that right. But that's just a fact as we sit here today. So that's created some disruption. I think as we go in a bit longer term, we expect that come late summer -- and we had mentioned on earlier calls that we expected to know what we would have to do from a capacity point of view by late spring or early summer, and that's probably been pushed out a month or 2 relative to our capacity adjustments in the second half of this year as a result of the loss of some customer business. But we full well know what we need to do, and it's really just a timing issue of when we begin to execute on that. And the competitor is raising the capacity in by the end of the year. And I think we want to make sure that our customer is being well served, and we want to do it in the right way in this transition. And so we'll probably have a much better view towards mid to late summer.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. John, one other on beverage and taking you back on one of the prior questions. Obviously, first quarter wasn't so bad in light of other quarters from an aggregate standpoint for the industry. Beer nearly bailed out soft drink, so to speak. But considering that traditionally there have been differences in end sizes between the 2, do you have -- if this trend continues, do you have to at least recapitalize on the end making side of your modules or you don't think that, that will be an issue that you can contend with or you have the flexibility on your end-making equipment to change end sizes?","John A. Hayes","Well, the short answer is, I don't think that is an issue we need to contend with. And we have enough flexibility that, that is not a thing that keeps us awake at night.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Last one, and I'll turn it over. The backlog on aerospace did decline. You had called out this year that you would be hoping to get some project wins. Obviously, that's coming later in the year. If you win your rightful share -- and I realize that's difficult to project, where do you see your backlog by the end of the year? What should we be marking to market in terms of good progress or not so good progress for Ball by the end of the year?","John A. Hayes","It's tough to say because, as I said, George, some of these contract wins are going to be in the end of the year. And we don't know if it's going to be December or January. So don't hold me to a number as of December 31. But if we win our fair share through this cycle of new wins, we should be up relative to where we had been 18 months ago.","Scott C. Morrison","But the booking of that -- George, the booking of that into the backlog, we can win something, but then it takes time to get everything back to where it would roll into our backlog. So that's what John is talking about. We may know we win it this year, but it may not show up in the backlog yet.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Would that be over $1 billion? I'm sorry Scott. Would that be over $1 billion if you get back to where you were 18 months ago?","Scott C. Morrison","Yes. If we win our fair share. And we're, as I've said, about $870 million right now. It would be back over $1 billion.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","If I could follow up from right where George was at, talking about the aerospace business a little bit. I mean, appreciating that for us dumb packaging guys, we don't always understand the aerospace business as well as we should. And also appreciating that it can be a little more complicated understanding when payments come in for performance things that you can't always talk about. You're off to a fabulous start for the year. You are winning some new business, but it sounds like it takes a while. Could this look more like a, from an EBIT perspective, you're off to a good enough start, can it look like a 2013 year? Or does it look more like a 2012 year as you kind of look at or think about how this year is shaping up?","John A. Hayes","Well, just a couple of observations before I try and hit that head on. Our folks performed tremendously well. And we had a very strong quarter and a lot of it had to do with award fees because we are performing. And as you move along in the life cycle of any contract, and, as you know, we have hundreds of them, you de-risk the program, but you also get award fees because of your performance. And that's exactly what happened. It's also the reason why there's been a slow burn in terms of our backlog because as we either complete or move towards the completion of many of those bigger projects, that's where a lot of those award wins would likely occur. To answer your question, does it look more like 2012 or 2013? It's probably a little bit closer to '13 than it is to '12. And the reason why I say that is we've had some great success on the award fees. That can't happen every quarter. And so -- and given that we have the new programs that we're bidding on, we won't hear on many of these until later on this year. I think we're going to see \"more normalized\" 3 quarters of the year this year. And then depending on how those wins look, 2014, we'll have to recalibrate at that point in time.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's actually very...","John A. Hayes","Oh, I'm sorry. 2015, we recalibrate. I'm sorry.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. If I could switch gears a second and talk about the bev business over in Asia. Please remind us the sizing of your business, what you have in China versus some of the other regions in Southeast Asia. I think you had some capacity in Vietnam, et cetera. And the pricing and the return characteristics, are they markedly different, I'm guessing yes, between what you're seeing in China and what you are in other pieces and has there been any pressures in the other piece of the business as well? Or how do you -- how should we think about potential for improvement within China?","Scott C. Morrison","Why don't I start, then I'll turn it over to John. In terms of where we're at, remember, our Vietnam is a joint venture, so it doesn't flow -- those volume numbers don't flow through our numbers. We're still seeing nice growth in the market, but there is a lot of capacity, and so pricing is not getting any better. And so what we're doing is doing things that we control on our cost side, to take cost out of our business. And our guys are doing a great job of doing that. So our returns look decent. And it's just not as good as it used to be, not quite as much fun as it used to be, but it's still good. And I think we should -- we just don't see the pricing environment improving materially for this year, definitely. But we're doing the things that we control, and the market continues to grow. So that's a good thing as well.","John A. Hayes","Scott said in his prepared remarks that we're generating positive EVA dollars, so that must mean we're generating returns in excess of 9%, as you all know. The other thing, as Scott said, the volume -- industry volume has been growing quite strong. And we've talked about this in the past with all the overcapacity. How long will it take to -- for the growth to chew into that and create a more balanced supply-demand. The positive is on the demand side, the volumes have been growing strongly as an industry. I do still believe that there's some of those smaller competitors that are putting some incremental capacity in, not nearly as great as it was a couple of years ago, but there is still a bit incremental. But I do think that overall excess capacity is slowly getting smaller. And it's a function of how long it will take to get there, and it would be premature to speculate. I just know it's slowly getting better, but we haven't yet seen it in the pricing.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Last question along those lines, then I'll turn it over. Is there a marked difference between margin levels, profitability levels, what have you, between what is in China and what is outside of China as you look across Southeast Asia?","John A. Hayes","Not materially -- again, for us, as Scott mentioned, we have a joint venture in Vietnam and then we have a small equity interest in Thailand. And so we have, to a degree, a limited purview, but no is the short answer. We don't see any wholesale changes in what the profile of each of the businesses are.","Scott C. Morrison","Yes. We have the advantage in China of having scale. That probably helps us more so than a place like Vietnam, but that would be the biggest difference.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Al Kabili with Macquarie.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","First question is, with the better-than-expected first quarter and maintaining the guidance for the full year, how much of a factor was the announced beer tax in Brazil factoring in, in your decision to maintain the outlook despite the very strong 1Q?","John A. Hayes","Well, we had always said that we -- in the second half of the year down in Brazil, that we expected it to be more muted just because of the 2 summer season we've talked about: the extended Carnival, the World Cup. And so the announced beer tax, obviously, has incremental headwinds on it. But I don't think it necessarily fundamentally changed our view as a corporation on what our 2014 would look like.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Okay. I appreciate that. I think I believe the headquarters in Germany recently closed and, Scott, I was wondering if, perhaps, you could help us maybe size up what the incremental cost savings in Europe beverage might be this year from that recent event? I know there's an indication that the full savings probably doesn't occur until next year, but I imagine you're probably going to get something incremental this year from that.","Scott C. Morrison","Yes, just to be clear, the headquarters didn't close. The headquarters moved to Z\u00fcrich a couple of years ago. We consolidated a couple of office locations that we had in Germany into one. And so with that, there is a reduction in the number of people that we'll have. We've never quantified the dollar amount. What we've talked about is margins getting back to that historical level that we had a few years ago in that business. And we're on track with that, and we're on track with all those plans. So as we move through the year, we'll continue to get the cost-out benefits. And again, in the first quarter, you see the leverage of cost out, but also volume growth. Volume is a wonderful thing in this business when it grows. So we expect to have a solid year in Europe, and it will continue to be decent as we move through the year in terms of achieving those cost-out programs.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Okay. So I guess maybe if I can ask it another way, from -- is there incremental cost savings that has occurred with some of those office closures? Is there some incremental cost savings that will have occurred this year that hadn't yet been seen in the first quarter?","Scott C. Morrison","Yes, we expect our cost structure at the end of this year to be lower than it is at the beginning of this year.","John A. Hayes","Yes, and just I think to Scott's point, Al, just part of it is the consolidation of these German administrative offices. As you know, we have a couple of other projects going on. And so as we move through the second half of last year and as we move through all of this year, we are taking the necessary plans. Just one of them happened to be in the first quarter, late first quarter, is when the 2 German facilities consolidated.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Okay. That's helpful. And then my final question is just on carbonated soft drinks in the U.S. And it looks as if the overall volume trend of carbonated soft drinks is declining a little bit less than the cans are. And I was wondering how you are thinking about the can share within carbonated soft drinks, if there's any additional share -- if there's any appreciable share shift that you're seeing within that as well?","John A. Hayes","The short answer is, I don't think we see any appreciable share difference. I do know that the 2-liter PET was promoted a decent amount in the first quarter. But again, the first quarter is the most seasonably slow. And so that question is better debated come the fall when you actually can see a full year of the summer months related to cans as a share of the package mix. But we don't expect any appreciable changes in the can mix.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Tyler Langton with JPMorgan.","Tyler J. Langton - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just had a question on the CapEx side. I think last quarter you talked about $175 million being directed to growth. So I just didn't know if you had any details at this point of where it might be spent, whether you would spend the entire amount? Just any color there would be great.","Scott C. Morrison","Sure. We just don't expect to spend around that $375 million number. I can tell you little bit more. We've got a couple of big projects. One is a new specialty addition to our portfolio, the new shape and size that will happen here in North America. And that will be spent -- really ramped up in the back half of this year to be producing next year. And then we're also adding -- due to the growth in Europe, we're going to add a specialty line in The Netherlands to keep up with the growing demand. And so that will get spent a decent amount again in the second half of this year to be able to be operating by the busy summer season next year. So those are -- we've got some other smaller things, but those are 2 larger ones that we can talk about now.","Tyler J. Langton - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And in terms of just switching back to China quickly in terms of cost out. Is there much more room for improvement with those programs or is it kind of largely in the numbers at this point?","Scott C. Morrison","I think they continue to take -- they're making progress, and I think they'll continue to make progress through this year and even into the next year. We've got some longer-term plans about the way the business is operated. But I think we'll make it leaner and more cost-effective going forward. So they've done a lot of work already, and they'll continue to work through this year and into next year, frankly. I think our -- we're not hoping or waiting for the pricing environment to get better. As John mentioned, we're still making good EVA dollar returns there. And we're going to continue to focus on our cost side so that we're able to participate in the growth in that market and continue to be profitable and get good returns.","Tyler J. Langton - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then if I -- in terms of that capacity that you're adding, can you share any details on sort of how much incremental capacity those lines in the U.S. and Europe would be?","Scott C. Morrison","Well, they're specialty lines, so it's a little bit different if you're talking about capacity. But not at this point, we're not going to share that.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","First question, just quickly on the aerospace business. I know you were talking about there's some contract potential later this year. But it looks like in a last 2 quarters, you've had some pretty darn good margins there. And is that a function of the type of work you're doing and could we see sort of this elevated level of margins continue?","John A. Hayes","No. I think it's a function of, as we get closer to the completion of some of these big programs, that's when you really get to recognize you've de-risked the project and you're getting your award fees. Obviously, you don't get award fees at the beginning of a contract. You get it when you're completing it. And I think over the last couple of quarters, that's why you've seen margins do what they do. And that's why you've seen our backlog come off a little bit as well.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Got you. And then changing gears a little bit, you all mentioned 2.5 years ago -- when we were out visiting -- some market data that suggested about 53% of U.S. beer cans were -- beer was -- was packaging cans. I think in Brazil it was like 39% and China was down around 10% or 15%. Could you update us on where you see those regions in terms of the beer share in cans?","John A. Hayes","Yes. You have a good memory. North America was about 53% and, I don't have the data in front of me, but it's in the mid- to upper-50s. It's actually moved up. I'd say, 55%, 56%, 57%, in that range. Down in Brazil, it was in the upper-30s, it's now in the lower-40s on the beer segment. And in China, really back a few years ago, it was really more like 4% or 5% -- excuse me, 5% or 6%. And that has moved up consistent with the other regions as well. So it's probably in the 7%, 8%, 9%.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Got you. Okay. And when you look at -- just one more question on the soft drink side. There's, for whatever reason, sort of a presumption that I sense from you and your competitors that there's no real reason or hope to see a material change -- and maybe this is my perception -- in the share in the CSD segment in places where returnable bottles continue to be the lion's share, and plastic as well. Anything changing there, whether it be in China or in Brazil, in terms of the share in -- of CSDs in cans?","John A. Hayes","No. I don't believe that we see any material changes in the regions you mentioned relative to package share mix. As you know, cans don't play a big part in CSD in those regions you talked about. And so we don't see any big change.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we have a follow-up coming from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A few questions there to clean up from our side. Can you comment at all about -- within North American beer, whether any of your larger customers are planning intensified new product introductions or promotional activities? Some of your customers in the last few years have had some difficulty in the marketplace. So to the extent that you can offer any color, that would be helpful.","John A. Hayes","I think as a general comment, George, every beer company out there, big or small, is looking at the proliferation of tastes and proliferation of new products. And it's not just limited to the big guys. And so I think you're seeing a lot of line extensions, a lot of new products, ciders new, for example, here in North America. And so I could go on and on. But as a general rule, I think you're seeing a fragmentation of taste. And therefore, a fragmentation and a differentiation of the products that our customers are making to respond to that.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Which in turn is one of the reason that you're seeing the proliferation in alternative can formats?","John A. Hayes","Bingo, you got it.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","All right. Within Brazil, back to the beer tax, I don't know if you have any color on this. But in the past, where there have been instances of these sorts of taxes, what has been the prior volume dropoff? And with the earnings season, I haven't had a chance to really study what the government announced yesterday, but would there be any differential or favoritism applied to beer in one pack form versus another or would it be across the board a comparable tax?","John A. Hayes","Yes. I believe it's our understanding, it's an across-the-board tax on both beer and soft drink. I think in many places, not just Brazil, when you see -- sometimes you see a short-term blip as the supply chain adjusts and price increases are ultimately passed through to the consumer. And so without going into great detail, we expect this to be no different. And so there might be a short-term blip. But again, this is not a wholesale change. Tax in Brazil is part of the everyday life. And so they did it as of June 1, which is kind of surprising, just a couple of weeks before the start of the World Cup. So who knows, maybe all the foreigners coming into Brazil will be paying for it.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Well, maybe that's a way to sneak it in with a better demand environment so it's less noticeable to whichever consumer, domestic or tourist. Question on sweeteners, do you have any color from your marketing folks in terms of your customers' views on the new sweeteners for diet soft drinks and whether they should be particularly helpful or not really this year in terms of volume?","John A. Hayes","Yes, the only thing I can say, George, is what our customers have said publicly. And they said they have been experimenting and trying. And they would expect in 2014 to be rolling out some trials on various sweetener alternatives. And so that's really all we can say at this time.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I understand. My last one, then I'll turn it over. Scott, you were saying before that in China, while it's not necessarily as much fun as it used to be, and we understand. You're still making relatively good margin. You're making positive EVA dollars. Do you think your peers are making positive EVA dollars? And the question behind the question is, if they still are, then how do you ultimately call where we sit? And then to the capacity cycle, if the industry broadly are still earning above cost of capital even at these relatively depressed prices?","Scott C. Morrison","I don't think many people in the industry are earning above their cost of capital is my guess. I mean, we've seen some of those companies as they file public documents to go public that weren't achieving their cost of capital. So I think given our scale, our cost structure, we're able to still be able to do that, even in these tougher pricing environments. But I don't think a lot of people -- my guess is, that they're not earning their cost of capital.","John A. Hayes","Yes, and I think it's our -- George, it's our view that particularly with some of the smaller ones there, liquidity has been so free and available with respect to debt financing in China that, that has created this. At some point in time, credit always gets a little bit tighter and as a result of that, when it does occur, we believe that there will be some level of shakeout. But it's premature to say, but that's how we think about it.","Operator","And we also have a follow-up coming up from the line of Chris Manuel from Wells Fargo.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I just had one kind of quick one, more along the lines of capital allocation. You mentioned within the press release -- something that jumped out of me was, looking in extruded aluminum with new products -- I don't know if you said new capacity, but new customers, some new things. Could you maybe talk to us there about recycled? I know you've made virgin slugs here, but it sounds like you're doing some recycled elements with those. What's the outlook or thoughts with respect to also making some containers here, maybe in North America? Could you -- and maybe give us a little color from that front.","John A. Hayes","A couple of things that you raised there. Number one, I think, in terms of the new products, not only -- that category, we're always coming out with new shapes, new sizes with our customers, but we're also, to your point on the slug side, we, this year, we have actually commercialized, and it's in the market over in Europe with our ReAl slugs, which is a much higher recycled content, which provides more rigidity to the container at a lighter weight container. And so we think it's a pretty neat innovation that our folks came up with. And so that, as I said, now commercial in the European marketplace. And as we look to expand it and roll that out, we will continue to do so. We also, as you know, have a facility down in Mexico, and that's been going recently nicely. The volumes have been growing. We always wish it could grow a little bit faster, but it's going okay. But it's also provided a dialogue with our customers, an incremental dialogue with our customers about what else we can be doing. And I wouldn't be completely shocked if you, at some point in time, saw us making those containers somewhere in a facility in North America. But that's probably all I can say at this time.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's very helpful, actually. The second element with capital allocation. I know you guys historically have done a great job of balancing 3 different ways that you've gone back and redistributed more through capital, whether it's dividends, repurchase, whether it's investing in your own businesses, whether it's acquisition. As you kind of look today, the acquisition market, there's still a lot of activity. How would you -- in a way that you're able to address it, sort of talk about the environment as it sits today, more active, less active, seeing better things coming to market, worst things coming to market? Again, appreciating that it's sometimes a difficult topic to broach.","John A. Hayes","No, I appreciate that. As you know, we're always looking at opportunities. And to be honest, we're pretty disciplined when it comes to capital allocation. So you never know when it will pop. We've talked about this in the past where the deal wheel or the sponsor world, private equity world, with the rates and availability of capital being where they are, it's always incrementally more challenging for us to find the right return type projects, but we continue to look at those. And as I said before, you just don't know when they're going to pop. But our pipeline, not only now, but in the past, has been reasonably robust. It's just a function of, is it the right opportunity and the right time?","Operator","And there appears to be no further questions over the phone lines at this time. Mr. Hayes, I will now turn the call back over to you for any closing remarks.","John A. Hayes","Okay, thank you very much, Jasmine, and we appreciate all your support. And we look forward to speaking to you in several months. Take care.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines."],"2733":["Ball (NYSE:BLL) Q3 2014 Earnings Call October 30, 2014 11:00 AM ET","Executives","John A.

Welcome to the Ball Corporation Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, October 30, 2014.","I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, CEO. Please proceed.","John A. Hayes","Thank you, Edison, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's third quarter 2014 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings as well as company news releases. If you don't already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website.","Joining me on the call today is Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'll provide a brief overview of our company's performance. Scott will discuss financial and global packaging metrics, and then I will finish up with comments on our Aerospace business and the outlook for the remainder of 2014.","In short, we had a solid third quarter with strong Beverage and Aerospace operating performance and a lower tax rate offsetting weaker can demand in Brazil and North American food.","During the third quarter, many of the second half themes that we referenced in our last earnings call came true. Volume comps were challenging year-over-year, aluminum headwinds remained and our food and household segment continued to work through operational challenges at our U.S. metals service center.","In spite of these challenges, there were a number of highlights as well. Lower operating costs in our European beverage can segment offset the LME premia headwinds we expected. Continued specialty can and beer container growth in North America nearly offset weaker demand for standard carbonated soft drink containers. Strong performance in our European impact-extruded aluminum and Aerospace businesses continued. Ball was again selected for the Dow Jones Sustainability World and North American Indices for the second time in a row. Our food and household products business received the Partner to Win supplier award from Unilever. And the Ball-built WorldView-3 satellite was successfully launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base.","As we close out 2014, we remain very focused on controlling the things we can control and managing through this low-growth environment. Given our year-to-date results and cash flow, very strong cash flow generation, 2014 is shaping up to be a very strong year for Ball Corporation.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott for a review of our third quarter numbers. Scott?","Scott C. Morrison","Thanks, John. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share were $1.10 versus last year's $1. In addition to John's comments around operating performance and a lower tax rate, a lower share count also contributed to our improved results. During the first 9 months, we acquired a net $308 million of stock and returned another $55 million to shareholders in the form of dividends. And for 2014, the majority of our free cash flow is expected to be returned to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends.","For the full year, there are a few minor tweaks to our 2014 financial metrics. Free cash flow is now expected to exceed $600 million. Share buybacks will continue to be in the range of $500 million. CapEx should end the year around $375 million if ongoing project dollars are spent on schedule. Interest expense will be closer to $160 million. The effective tax rate is now expected to be in the range of 25%, primarily due to the release of some uncertain tax positions due to lapses of the statute of limitations. And full year corporate undistributed is now expected to be closer to $85 million due to higher medical and incentive compensation costs.","Net balance sheet debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $3.1 billion. Credit quality and liquidity of the company remains quite solid, with comparable EBIT-to-interest coverage of 5.7x and net debt to comparable EBITDA of 2.5x. Committed credit and available liquidity at quarter end was in excess of $1 billion.","For a complete summary of third quarter results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, please refer to the Notes section of today's earnings release.","Also as a heads-up for the fourth quarter, Ball will record a noncash charge of approximately $40 million related to a settlement of pension obligations for certain former employees. The settlement should reduce the company's pension liabilities by approximately $80 million at year end and generate ongoing administrative and PBGC premium savings for the company's U.S. pension plans.","Now moving to operations. Our metal beverage Americas and Asia segment comparable earnings were roughly flat versus third quarter 2013. While operating performance was excellent at the plant level, and mid-single-digit volume growth in China and double-digit specialty can growth in North America contributed to segment results, mid-teens volume declines in Ball's Brazilian business post-World Cup muted the segment's third quarter performance. Ultimately, Ball's mix of customers underperformed the overall market post the World Cup, resulting in us underperforming the Brazilian can industry, which was up around 1% in the third quarter. More importantly, as we head into the fourth quarter in Brazil, the summer selling season is upon us, and we expect Ball's volumes to bounce back to seasonal fourth quarter norms.","European segment profit was up roughly $3 million in the third quarter on essentially flat volumes, and aluminum premium headwinds being more than offset by anticipated cost-out efforts. As John briefly touched on, the LME premium is meaningfully higher than it was in our last conference call, and we expect EUR 6 million of premium cost to flow through in the fourth quarter. Depending on the strength of fourth quarter volumes, our ongoing cost savings initiatives might be enough to offset the aluminum premium headwinds for the remainder of this year.","Food and household comparable segment earnings were down approximately $15 million in the quarter, as segment volume declines and manufacturing inefficiencies in our U.S. metals service center pressured the results. More specifically, North American food can volumes were down nearly 8%, with about half the decline due to a very poor salmon pack. On the flip side, our extruded -- European extruded aluminum business continues to perform at a high level. As the food and household segment enters 2015, improving operating efficiencies, pruning the manufacturing footprint and related administrative and plant headcounts are items within our control, and the team is executing on these initiatives to ensure a rightsized cost base after the January 1, 2015, customer shift.","In summary, our global beverage operating team continues to execute on near-term capital projects that will improve our business in North America, Europe and Asia in the second half of 2015 while also identifying additional cost-efficient, high-returning growth opportunities to benefit Ball in future years.","With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.","John A. Hayes","Great. Thanks, Scott. Our Aerospace business continues to exceed expectations. During the quarter, solid execution, a flawless on-orbit deployment of a Ball-built satellite, and niche product wins for antennas and sensors are some of the highlights. Contracted backlog ended the quarter at $846 million. And while we have secured some smaller contract awards in the third quarter, larger programs that we are in the process of bidding on are expected to be awarded either late this year or more likely in 2015. Overall government contracting continues to slide slightly to the right, and we're keeping a close eye on this during the election cycle.","Now looking out across our company today. We are pleased with our year-to-date results and the incredible employee effort it took to accomplish them. Though some challenges still exist, there are also many opportunities to improve our businesses going forward. With 9 months under our belt, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our long-term diluted EPS growth goal of 10% to 15% per year while growing both our EVA dollars, and as we've done for the prior 5 years, returning nearly all the free cash flow back to our fellow shareholders.","And with that, Edison, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","First off, for the volume declines in Brazil, is it a customer-specific issue that maybe impacted numbers during the third quarter? Any specific region within Brazil that stood out as particularly weak? And also, can you quantify what's actually happening in October there?","Scott C. Morrison","Ghansham, this is Scott. It really is customer-specific. We -- our customer base wasn't one of the official sponsors of the World Cup, and the other customers, I think, saw a bump in the second quarter. And I think that got carried into the third quarter. And so it really was customer-specific, I don't think anything to get too alarmed about. We're seeing -- we're only 1 month into the fourth quarter, but it appears like it's tracking back to normal and what we would have expected. So we expect the fourth quarter to be more normalized.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then just kind of thinking about 2015. Realizing it's a little bit early, but I was focusing on Americas, Asia, you do have an FX headwind there. The World Cup, obviously, benefited, at least part of 2014. And North American CSD seems to be sort of a sluggish category, and it seems like that's probably a good run rate for next year as well. Do you actually foresee operating income going up year-over-year in 2015 for that segment?","Scott C. Morrison","Yes. I think if you go piece by piece, North American beverage continues to perform very well. Cost-out activities being very efficient. Growth in specialty can is helping to grow earnings and grow EVA dollars in that business. Brazil, we talked about before, even in the second quarter, we thought 2015 would be flatter, but they're doing some things from a cost-out perspective that I think will help it from an efficiency standpoint. In Asia, the volumes continue to grow. It's really dependent on pricing, where pricing settles out when we get to the end of this year and into next year. But with volume growth, hopefully, we can offset any pricing pressures. So actually do expect it to grow next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","If I could take one second and focus on the metal food and household, you specifically cited some inefficiencies in service centers, and I was thinking that you were consolidating a few of those. Is there anything extra to that? Or could you give us some color there?","John A. Hayes","Yes, you're right, Chris. We have, over the last couple of years, consolidated those, and we've just -- we've had -- there's been a variety of issues. As I said on the second quarter, some of them have been self-inflicted, some of them have not. And what I mean by that, to give you a little bit more color around that, is we have actually put -- we took out some of the excess slack in our capacity. And when you do that, it puts a higher burden on you to perform, and we haven't been performing as well as we could. Having said that, we've had some quality issues from some of our metal suppliers and some on-time delivery that has exacerbated that a little bit. The way -- given that it's a service center and it's on the front end of the manufacturing part of our supply chain, if you will, we did see this coming, and that's why we said back at the end of the second quarter that for the second half of this year that we'd have to kind of flow this through, and that's exactly what we're doing. We are very much focused. We think we are on the right track, but it's just going to take a little bit of time. And as we go into 2015, we expect this to sequentially get much better.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And have you quantified what the headwind was for this, or could you?","John A. Hayes","No, we talked about -- I think in the second quarter, I did say roughly 1\/3 of our decline was related to volume and roughly 2\/3 manufacturing, and that held generally true in the third quarter.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Last question I had was on the Aerospace side. It looked like you had another really strong quarter there. And were there any elements that were unusual with performance payments? You mentioned a flawless execution. Bottom line, I guess what we're trying to get our arms around is how we should think about '15 as kind of a normalized rate there, given what you see in the backlog that you have today?","John A. Hayes","Yes. It's -- roughly speaking, I think year-to-date, we've made about $70 million of EBIT in that business. And so that averages about, what, $23-or-so million. And I do think that our business has been running well. I think -- the bigger issue, I think, Chris, is not so much that because we've talked about it being lumpy, and there wasn't anything out of the -- extraordinary in the quarter. I think it's really as much as to when the government and some of these commercial enterprises are going to start awarding contracts and getting money flowing. Because like everything with the government, seems like things just start to push out a little bit. A couple of quarters ago, we thought that we'd have a lot of these opportunities decided by the end of '14, and now it looks like they're kind of split between the end of '14 and the first quarter of '15. And so nothing to be alarmed about. It's just still sliding a little bit, and that's really going to be the driver as we go into 2015.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Tyler Langton with JPMorgan.","Tyler J. Langton - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just had a question on the European beverage, I guess volume's down a little bit. And do you think that's more of just tough comps? Or just -- are you generally seeing a slowdown going forward? I don't know if you have any sort of thoughts on what Q4 could look like.","Scott C. Morrison","No, it was really tough comps, Tyler. Last year, if you remember, volumes really started to ramp up in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter. So we knew we had tougher comps in the second half of the year, and that's how that works. We're seeing that.","John A. Hayes","Yes. It's interesting also, the weather in the third quarter was not all that good. And you just look at some of our customers' results, both on the soft drink and the beer side. And when you try and look geography, region by region, what was going on, you really kind of saw it in many different places, everywhere from the East to France, Netherlands, U.K. They were all softer than we had expected and flat to down slightly, actually.","Tyler J. Langton - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And are you seeing any sign that's getting a little bit better through October? Or is it too early to tell?","Scott C. Morrison","Fourth quarter is kind of a slower volume quarter. So I wouldn't expect big trends out of this quarter, but I think it's kind of normalized.","John A. Hayes","Yes. Exactly.","Tyler J. Langton - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just with China. I mean, I guess you -- how much more, I guess, with your existing capacity do you think you can kind of continue to grow? I guess you're up mid-single digits this quarter. I mean, can you -- outside of capacity, can you continue to kind of grow with the market, given your current footprint?","Scott C. Morrison","I think we can continue to speed things up, but those guys are doing a really good job of being able to eke out more and more out of those facilities. But we're still seeing solid growth, and so we'll be careful about how we deploy capital. But where we think we can get decent returns, we'll deploy capital and grow.","John A. Hayes","Yes. We've been -- as you know, we've been full all year, but we've been able to \"eke out\" mid- to upper-single digit volumes. So at some point in time, the low-hanging fruit will be over, but as Scott said, I think that our guys have been doing a very nice job of getting -- sweating the assets.","Tyler J. Langton - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And just last question on working capital. Now it looks like it's going to be a strong contributor this year and sort of in the past several years, the same thing. I mean, is there a lot much more -- I mean, I know you're always working to get more, but could it be as big of a contributor just going forward? Or should things slow down a little bit?","Scott C. Morrison","Every year, I keep thinking we're about done with what we can do. And our people across the business, in the businesses, in treasury, in IT, in sourcing, have all done a great job of continuing to have various types of programs to eke out more benefits, more dollars out of working capital. I think we're going to have another decent year this year of being a source of funds, and I think it will continue in '15. How much beyond that, I don't know, but I think we'll see another benefit next year.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays Capital.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just wanted to focus on the free cash flow for a minute in 2014. You did take it up by $50 million. I didn't hear on the CapEx part if you took CapEx down. But could you walk through the bridge between the $550 million and $600 million of free cash flow in 2014?","Scott C. Morrison","It's mostly better working -- we still think we're going to spend -- we got to spend at a pretty good clip in the fourth quarter to get to the $375 million, but we're still thinking we're going to get to the $375 million. But most of the change really had to do with working capital.","John A. Hayes","Yes, certainly relative to our prior expectations. I think, year-over-year, it's coming from all that. I think we have much stronger net income and earnings growth as well as working capital.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And is the better working capital coming from the facility closures? Or is there something you can point to that was really driving better working capital for the year?","John A. Hayes","I think when you go through our balance sheet, you can see it everywhere. I think we've done a very good job on the receivables side of it. We've done an excellent job on the inventory side of it. Our days outstanding have improved meaningfully. And then on the payables side, as Scott had mentioned, everywhere from IT to sourcing to manufacturing, our folks have been doing a very good job of not only measuring but managing those things.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And when I look at -- you mentioned still thinking $375 million of CapEx in 2014. Obviously, some of that slipped from, I think, 2013 to 2014 before. But assuming nothing slips into 2015, what sort of step-down should we assume in CapEx as we move into 2015?","Scott C. Morrison","Well, Scott, in my life at Ball, I've never seen capital not slip into the next year. So there'll be some that'll slip. We've got a number of good-sized projects we're working on that will go into '15. We're adding specialty capacity in Europe and in North America. We'll be building our Myanmar plant. We've got some growth in aluminum aerosol. We're still finding good opportunities to deploy capital and get above target returns. So right now, to call 2015 CapEx is probably too early, but we'll update you as we get in -- kind of get into next year on what that might look like.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Bank of Montr\u00e9al.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Canada","I wondered if we could get just a sense of what you see as kind of underlying beverage can growth outside of North America right now. What's Brazil doing? What's the underlying market in China? And what are you seeing in Europe?","John A. Hayes","I think one of the bigger trends that we continue to see in most places is that can continues to take share from other forms of packaging, particularly in the beer category. And so I do think -- and we've talked about this earlier on the call that there has been a -- in the third quarter, there was a bit of a slowdown in Brazil, for example. The overall market was much more muted after the World Cup. There was a mix issue relative to customer base there. But I don't think fundamentally, things have changed in a material way. In Europe, the weather wasn't all that great, and the overall economy is a bit softer than expected in Europe. But again, we don't see any trends that are different than what we saw. Over in Asia, China in particular, but also Southeast Asia, we continue to see beer growing faster than, perhaps, the herbal teas and the energy drinks and the soft drinks, and you're seeing cans continue to take share from competitive packages in those categories. And so nothing fundamentally has changed. I think there were some issues related to the third quarter that we saw, but we don't expect those to be a trend, so to speak.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Okay. And then you guys have talked about a new product for an undisclosed customer in North America in 2015. I just -- I wondered when we'll be able to get some sense of what the product might be and then the size of that opportunity for Ball.","John A. Hayes","I think in the -- certainly, as we go into 2015 and the first half of 2015, it's something that our customer has asked us not to talk about until they're ready to talk about it. So we're respecting their wishes.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Canada","And finally, can you just talk about the metal premium issue as we move toward 2015?","Scott C. Morrison","Yes. It continues to be a headwind. It was a bigger headwind in the third quarter. It grew a little bit, so it's even a little larger headwind in the fourth quarter. And if it doesn't come down, it would be a drag into '15. But it's been pretty volatile. But right now, we said, in the fourth quarter, it's probably EUR 6 million or EUR 7 million different year-over-year.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Canada","All right. And it sounds, Scott, from just listening to other players in the industry that we're not likely to see terms change contractually over the next year or so with regards to passing that premium on. Is that your view as well?","Scott C. Morrison","Well, you need to have contracts mature and roll off and then renegotiate new contracts. So you don't get that much of your contracts that roll off each year, maybe 1\/3 roughly. And so on new contracts, I think it's something where -- it hasn't been just a temporary spike. It's been pretty much a permanent rise or what appears to be a longer-term rise in the premium. And so that needs to come into play when we're looking at what the products should be priced at.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess my first question was just a piggyback on Mark's prior question. You talked about trends not changing relative to the third quarter's one-off issues, but I was hoping you might be able to actually talk specifically about fourth quarter. In Brazil, are you seeing a year-on-year increase at this juncture in beverage can shipments, recognizing that, seasonally, things should be picking up anyway? And for Europe and for China, can you talk to what the early growth rates are in the quarter? And then on the same topic of growth, if you mentioned it, I've missed it. What did you say your North American beverage can volumes grew at in 3Q?","John A. Hayes","George, this is John. Let me try and handle that. It's -- recognize that the month of October isn't even finished, so it's kind of tough to talk about that. But in Brazil, as Scott said, we had kind of expected kind of flattish volumes in the second half of this year and in the third quarter, they were a bit softer than that. But we are ramping up towards their summer selling season, and we're seeing much more -- volumes much more getting back to kind of flattish -- it depends as an industry, maybe up very, very slightly. But I think, for us -- and that's all I can comment on right now because I've seen no industry data for us down in Brazil, they have bounced back from what was a soft third quarter full stop. I think, in Asia, we're seeing the exact same thing. We're seeing decent growth there, and we're -- we are -- because we're tight from a capacity point of view, we are trying to sell as many as we can and get as many out the door as we can. And over in Europe, we have seen -- it really was -- when you go back and look at the quarter, it was really in the month of August that we saw some softness. And I think as you go into the October, November, December, the biggest time of the month -- of the quarter in the fourth quarter is really the month of late November and December because that's around the Christmas season. And so it's before that, but everything's kind of going according to what our expectations would be. Getting back to your question in North America bev, I think the overall market was down, call it, about 1-ish percent. We're about the same as well. I think that when you take a step back, Scott had mentioned our specialty was up double digit, our beer was up a couple of percent and our soft drink was off 3-ish percent, plus or minus. And so that's -- when you weighted average all of that, that's why we're off very slightly relative to being flat.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I want to go back to food and household. You said that the manufacturing issues were roughly comparable 2Q to 3Q in terms of their proportion of the year-on-year decline, if we look at 2Q '13 to 2Q '14 and similarly 3Q and 3Q. Yet if I did my math correctly, the dollar decline in 3Q versus 3Q was greater than what we saw in 2Q. So is that just the cumulative effect of seasonality and just you have that much more volume in the third quarter and, therefore, the inefficiencies were magnified by that? Or were there some other factors at work? And then specific to the manufacturing issues, are you having any kind of quality issues either with the sheet you're producing, the decoration you're doing, anything like that? Or is it more on the, if you will, the supplier side?","John A. Hayes","Well, getting to your question, you're absolutely right because the third quarter is the seasonally high selling point for it. I think it was magnified a bit by that. And as you know, when you -- the turns, from an inventory perspective, in that business are lower than they are in the beverage can business. And so it takes some time for it to snake through the system, if you will. And so that's why we're able -- we knew that was -- as we look forward into the third quarter, that would be forthcoming. With respect to the quality issues, I don't think -- it certainly is a combination of things, but when you're -- we're not running smoothly and then you have some quality issues from the metal perspective, I think it puts a little bit more stress on the system. But again, I think most of it, we believe, is to be behind us not completely, but as we go into 2015, we feel pretty confident where we sit right now that we've got our hands on the issue and that we're cycling through these issues.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And I guess my last question before I turn it over. Our rough math would suggest that pension, if we look at current discount rates, might be worth a $0.10 plus of headwind next year to the company. Do you have an official view or unofficial view that you care to share at this juncture?","Scott C. Morrison","A little too early to tell, George, because it's all set right at the end of the year. You're right, right now, if rates stayed where they're at, it's a bit of a headwind. But part of what I mentioned of this -- or paying out terms -- certain term-vested pension and reducing our liability will help net income next year. So that's a plus. So you kind of have to get through the end of the year to know what it will do, but I'd say, net-net, it's probably not a big mover one way or the other.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of George -- sorry, Anthony Pettinari with Citi.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just had a follow-up question on pack mix shifts. You talked about the shift to cans you're seeing outside of the U.S. And I was just wondering about if you could talk about what you've seen in the U.S. this year. It seems like cans have outperformed glass more than some of us had expected. And I was wondering, are your conversations with customers accelerating? Or would you expect this to continue into 2015, even if the consumer gets a little bit stronger? I was just wondering if you could provide some detail on what you're seeing in the U.S.","John A. Hayes","Yes. I think, largely where we've seen the growth, and you see it from an industry perspective as well as a Ball perspective, is on the beer side. And the can as a share of the package mix on the beer side has continued to grow, even through the first 3 quarters of 2014. So I think that's a trend that certainly we've been benefiting from. Some of it has to do with the craft beer that we've talked about in past conference calls. Some of it has to do with consumer preferences. I don't see any appreciable change as we go into 2015. Obviously, it's a bit premature. But at some point in time, the can will be well penetrated relative to that. So I wouldn't expect over the long term that we're going to infinitely continue to gain share as a percentage of the package mix, but we've certainly been a beneficiary of it right now. But we do also, at the same time, see on the craft side, continued good penetration growth into that area.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just shifting to food and household. Can you talk a little bit more about the India opportunity in extruded aluminum and what your investment there is?","John A. Hayes","Yes. I don't think we've disclosed the size of investment. But it's a decent size but not huge, to be honest. But it's a great opportunity as that business continues to -- the customer base continues to globalize. We had a great opportunity to make an investment in there. And we expect kind of by this time next year, we'll be up and running. We're focusing on not only the regional customers but some of the global customers as well. And well, as I said, we're only putting 1 line initially, so it's not that big of an investment. I think, over time, we will be happy that we've gotten into the business because in India, the market for those containers is several hundred million, and it's growing at 20-plus percent.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So the real earnings contribution there is in 2016, essentially?","John A. Hayes","Yes, I think so.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Al Kabili with Macquarie.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","John, I wanted to circle up with some of your earlier comments on expecting some growth in the Americas and Asia bev segment. How instrumental do you see North America earnings growth in that view next year? And I guess that's part one of that question.","John A. Hayes","I do think there is some earnings growth in North America, I think both from this mix issue as specialty continues to grow. But equally important, we've been spending a lot of time, and there's a fair amount of fruit we can go after in terms of the freight logistics and optimizing our footprint perspective. Over the past several years, we've put some systems in place that have been helpful in terms of providing a level of transparency around our costs on the freight and transportation at a far greater clip than we've had in the past. And so we have specific plans that we're going after some of those things. So I think for those 2 reasons, mix as well as the cost side of our business, I think there's some upside there.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Okay. And following on that, any -- at this juncture, can you give us a sense maybe what you think the cost-out opportunity is there? And in addition, is there anything specific that you have visibility on, some sort of contractual gains, specific share gain on cans for next year that belies some of the confidence as well?","John A. Hayes","No. I think on -- second part first. I just think we have a pretty good footprint in terms of specialty, and that has been growing. We're overweighted towards beer, and that's been growing. So I think qualitatively, we feel okay there. And then on the cost-out side, it's a bit premature to talk about that. But it's not insignificant dollars when you think about we've got a base, we've got a revenue base of well in excess of $3 billion there. And so I think there's real opportunity there.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","I appreciate that. And then just a second question is just based on -- assuming aluminum premiums look like they'll continue to be a headwind, what's the opportunity next year -- some of the -- you've been able with cost-outs this year, you've been quite successful at that, offsetting this. What's the opportunity to continue to maybe offset some of the headwinds next year with cost-outs? And just as some of the contracts roll off, maybe the opportunity to recover some of the loss margin as well.","Scott C. Morrison","Sure. Well, our guys continue to be very focused on taking cost out. I was just with the European guys recently, and they have a number of things that they're working on that will continue to make their business more efficient. On the contract side, you have to wait until those customer contracts expire and you're negotiating a new one before you can get any kind of a pass-through or change the pricing mechanism so that you're incorporating into your price. So that takes a little bit longer. But in all of our businesses, we're always very focused on costs and making ourselves more efficient and offsetting these kind of headwinds.","John A. Hayes","The only thing I would add is -- we don't -- let's not forget that we've -- making an investment to continue to grow our business in Oss in the Netherlands. In 2013, we have been running full out. And typically, when you run full out with the seasonality that business has, you leave some money on the table relative to some of the freight and other opportunities. I'd mentioned that we're doing a lot in North America, and we -- I think our European folks are trying to grab on to some of the ideas that our North American people have been doing. And there's a lot of opportunity. As we get a little bit more capacity to be able to run a little bit more smoothly, I think to optimizing the shipping lanes and the freight costs, there's going to be some opportunities over time there as well.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","John, I had a question about the -- I noticed the other day, or maybe it was yesterday, you all appointed a new director to the board. And I didn't know if that was a replacement director or an -- and it looks like he has quite a background in aerospace. And I didn't know if that was basically a sign that maybe you're going to make aerospace a bigger part of what Ball is all about.","John A. Hayes","Well, a couple of things I'd point out. Number one, we have -- we, like many companies, have mandatory retirements for our directors at 72 years old. And so without going into any details, over the next few years, we have directors retiring. And so this was -- Mike's a wonderful person, has a great reputation, has a lot of great experience, not only in the aerospace side but just in general management. He's a finance person by background. He ran Boeing Capital for a while. So he has a lot of very good finance expertise. And as we started talking with him, it just made a lot of sense to get him on board and help with the transition over time as by natural forces, some of our board members retire.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay, got you. And then going back to India, that's been obviously -- not only does it have great opportunity with being the second most populous country, but it's been a challenge for other folks in the packaging business there. And I was just wondering, as you look to India, could we see what looks like to be a food can initiative eventually become a beverage can initiative? And if it did, does it make sense that -- can you do something like that in baby steps? Or as we've seen in most other places, the scale of investment required make that less likely?","John A. Hayes","Well, yes. First, in India, just so we're clear, it's actually an aluminum impact-extruded opportunity. And as you know, the scale of that relative to putting a beverage can line is very, very different. And so this is an opportunity for us to start small and grow as that market continues to grow. Whether or not we then think about using the experience learned in doing business in India and gravitate it over the beverage can side, that remains to be seen. But you are right, the scale of beverage can investments, at least historically, have been much greater and very different than impact-extruded. We have -- particularly in Asia, our guys have done a very good job of really focusing on how to make smaller-scale investments on the beverage can side, and it's probably premature to talk about that a little bit. But we have no specific plans as we sit here today to be announcing and building beverage can capacity in India. But certainly, you never know.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","And then last quick one. I know Brazil has seen a major move in the last 5, 10 years in displacing other substrates for aluminum. And I think in the beer category, we must be pushing the mid-40s in terms of the percent that are in a can. And I think North America is around 55%. If you could correct those numbers and tell us how many more years do you think we get until we hit sort of a saturation point in Brazil?","John A. Hayes","Well, it's a good question. I think your numbers are generally in line with what reality is. In North -- excuse me, in the United States, it's actually a little bit higher, it's probably 57%, 58%. It's interesting when you go around the world and you look at it, you look at the can penetration rates. In the U.K., it's north of 60%. We mentioned the United States. In other places, it's lower. It really depends. And there's 2 factors that go into it. Number one, it's consumer preference. But number two, it's also on-trade versus off-trade. I think down in Brazil, you have seen a shift over time as people have more disposable income that they have been moving a little bit more to the off-trade, and as they move to the off-trade, they've gone to one-way packaging. And as they go to one-way packaging, they've gone to the can. That is a trend that we see time and time again, and I think even you're seeing it a bit in China, for example, as the can as a share of the package mix continues to grow there. So I think you're directionally correct. Will it get to 55%? Will it get to 60%? When will it get to that? It's a bit premature to speculate. But you're absolutely right, probably 6, 7, 8 years ago, it was in the 20%, now it's in the mid-40s.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Deborah Jones with Deutsche Bank.","Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I was hoping you could talk about -- well, there have been a few large M&A moves in the space lately. And I'm just wondering about Ball's appetite for M&A right now. And if you could maybe contrast those opportunities with internal projects or share repurchases?","John A. Hayes","Yes. Well, Debbie, as you know, we are all about EVA discipline. And we've made a tremendous amount of money over time by being very disciplined around that. And nothing has changed on that front. Right now, as we sit here, we see more opportunities, actually, over the past couple of years, in terms of internal greenfield investments where we've been able to generate returns relative to the prices one has to pay in the M&A world. Sometimes, the M&A world comes and goes, depending on financing markets and depending on other things like that. And so we're going to continue to deploy capital per our EVA discipline, whether internal or external. And in the meantime, we've created a tremendous amount of value for our shareholders by being disciplined and if we don't see opportunities by buying back our stock and returning it to our shareholders that way. And so the key point of all that is nothing's changing.","Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And I guess as a follow-up, if I could just ask a question on China. Should we expect Ball to grow in line with the industry at this point without adding new capacity? And then are you more or less optimistic about China than you were maybe 6 months to a year ago?","Scott C. Morrison","Well, I think we're going to -- if it grows at 20%, we're not able to add capacity to that level. So I think we could get a little bit smaller from a market share standpoint. We want to make sure that we're deploying capital where we can make money. Am I feeling better or worse about it? It still continues to grow, but there's still a ton of competition. So pricing environment is not as disciplined. I'm hoping that what we've seen in the last year is the floor of pricing, but you just kind of never know. We're trying to focus on all the things that we can control, from a cost-out standpoint, to make our business more efficient and more profitable without relying upon price recovery. And if price recovery happens, we'll get a nice leverage on that, but kind of control what you can control.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Alex Hutter with Jefferies.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Guys, it's actually Phil. Hopped on a little late. A question for you, Scott. Free cash flow for 2014 coming in really strong. I understand that working capital is quite advantageous this year. But thinking about '15, is $600 million a good base to work on going forward?","Scott C. Morrison","I'm sorry. What was the number you threw out?","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","$600 million free cash flow.","Scott C. Morrison","For '15?","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Yes.","Scott C. Morrison","Yes. It kind of depends on what the CapEx is and what working capital is. So I wouldn't -- I'm not -- what I said was that we could continue to generate money out of working capital next year as we did this year. And I don't think there'll be a meaningful difference in CapEx, so I think it should stay relatively high. I think free cash flow should stay relatively high. Whether it starts from $600 million or not, I don't know","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then your food can business, from a margin standpoint, it's a bit lighter than we expected. Part of that is, obviously, the operational setbacks. But how much of that was pricing too? I understand you guys ceded some price in the quarter. And how should we be thinking about margin next year with one of your lower-margin customers exiting your portfolio?","John A. Hayes","Yes. From a pricing perspective, it's nothing appreciable. It really had to do with volumes and operating performance that -- Phil, I know you weren't on, but we talked about earlier. So if you want to talk offline or if you want to read the transcript, that's fine. As we go into next year, margins, actually, on a pure margin basis, it probably should be better because when you look at the mix issues of that, I think it's premature to say because we haven't quantified those things. But we already have begun to take actions to take additional costs out of our system. And so from a margin percentage perspective, it should be better next year.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And just my last question. On the extruded aluminum business, India is a new opportunity for you. I would have imagined Brazil being a larger opportunity set. Can you talk about what's available there? Or are you guys approaching it more from an M&A standpoint?","John A. Hayes","Well, I think I'd rather not go into any specific details about what our strategic plans are. But what I would say is, on a global basis, there continues to be opportunities. That package grows, is growing in many places. The growth is a bit more muted here in the United States, although it is growing here. A lot of filling is going from the United States down into Mexico, and there is some growth down in South America generally, whether it's Brazil, whether it's Argentina. In fact, Argentina is quite a large user of those containers. So we keep our eyes on that. And it's really a function of where we can generate the most EVA dollars, whether it's greenfield investments or M&A opportunities.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson from KeyBanc.","Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Forgive me if my questions were asked. I just got on a bit late. Just one about 2015, and I know it's early, but can you talk about -- in broad terms, about which segments you think you can grow next year and profit-wise. I mean, Brazil is obviously facing tough comparisons. North America, both in bev and food, are flattish, modestly down. Europe is, obviously, a tough economy at the moment. And aerospace has had a really terrific year this year. So I would think the year-ago comparisons next year would be fairly challenging. So any thoughts you have along those lines would be appreciated.","John A. Hayes","Why doesn't Scott -- why don't you jump on beverage, and I'll go through the other one.","Scott C. Morrison","Okay. Yes, we did cover that, but I'll give you quick color on that. North American beverage, we feel pretty good about. It's all dependent on volume, what happens with 12 ounce in soft drink business. But our specialty business continues to grow, and so we've been able to grow earnings and EVA dollars in that business, and we'd expect that to continue to occur next year. China, the volumes continue to grow. And while the pricing environment remains tough, we've been able to grow volumes and offset some of that price pressure. We haven't got into the real season of setting the price for next year. So we don't have that good of visibility into what '15 looks like, but our guys are doing a nice job on the cost side. In Brazil, we've had -- our business probably didn't get as much of a pop from the World Cup as we thought it would. And so next year does look slower, but I think we can continue to improve the profitability. We're probably not at the pace that we've had, a couple of jumps we've had in the last few years. And in Europe, there's a lot of cost-out still going on. There's volume growth, specialty volume growth. And it depends on business -- aluminum premium come off a lot or not. If it stays high, it is a pretty significant headwind. So we'll see. But we feel pretty good about where all the businesses are at, and then more importantly, the investments that we're making today that will make our business better later in '15 and then -- and definitely in '16.","John A. Hayes","Yes. And then from a food and household products as well as an aerospace perspective, I think food's going to be challenged and make the profitability just because of this customer shift that's happening 1\/1\/15. Although having said that, we fully expect to get back on track, relative to the operational improvements or issues we've been having in 2014, so that will provide a positive bridge. It's premature to say, can we get back to the full year '14 because '14 hasn't even finished. I think it's a bit of a stretch, but our guys are pushing real hard. Our men and women pushing really hard on that. And then on the aerospace side, you are right, we have been growing very nicely. We have a number of proposals outstanding as we go into 2015. So it's dependent upon that. But I think, overall, when you take a step back and you think about how we feel, not only going into '15 but longer term, I think we feel pretty good. We're making investments in Myanmar. We're making specialty investments in North America. We're building -- expanding our footprint in Europe through the Oss. From a cost-out perspective, we've spent a lot of money on the systems side of our business, and we see a lot of low-hanging fruit from a freight and warehouse logistics in addition to just continuous improvement there. And we continue to see opportunities to capture our share of the growth, whether it be in the Americas, Europe or certain parts of Asia. And so I think we feel okay as we sit here today, looking out, saying we can continue to grow our business and make it a stronger, healthier business while, at the same time, as I've said before, maintaining a very strict discipline around the EVA dollar generation that we always talk about.","Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And just one on -- John, on North American beverage cans. How would you characterize the market at the moment? Obviously, CSD remains fairly weak. One of your competitors yesterday talked about weakness among the mega-beer brands in the U.S. But you've got specialty growing for you, obviously, to some extent. So to what extent is the growth in specialty offsetting these other factors? And how do you see that playing out beyond this year?","John A. Hayes","Well, I think earlier, maybe you weren't on, but we talked about we had growth in specialty and we had growth in beer this year. And soft drink has been down. I think year-to-date, we're up slightly. We're up probably about 1% or so for the full year. Forget about the third quarter for a minute. It's driven by growth in specialty, growth in beer, offset by declines in CSD. We all know that CSD is under a lot of pressure, but let's broaden the definition, and what I'm talking about is not just sodas. It's sparkling beverages. And I think we've seen some good growth in sparkling waters and some other things like that. I do know that the soda companies are acutely focused on trying to make sure that they're as relevant in today's environment, where health and wellness plays a more important part. Will they be able to turn that tide at a rate better than they have in the past? It's premature to see. But I do think, as we go into 2015, what I just described, even though some of these \"mega-beer brands\" are having a little bit of volume issues, the can has been winning relative to other substrates, and we still have only upper single digit, if not very low teens, penetration on the craft side.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Andrew Feinman with Iridian Asset Management.","Andrew Feinman","Given your EVA discipline and the fact that you have been patient, I've been thinking that this was -- this is probably a good opportunity for you to at least consider deploying some capital in the aerospace and technologies business, given the uncertainties in that industry and the prices of those companies have come down. And so then today, you announced this really great new board member, Michael Cave, who you would -- I would think could really help you a lot in that process. So the question is, do you think we might see some opportunities for increases in the value of Ball Corporation through its hidden gem, the aerospace and technologies business sometime in the investable future?","John A. Hayes","Yes, Andy, this is John. Two observations. Number one is I think in each and every one of our businesses, we're going to continue to be very disciplined on the EVA dollar side of it. Having said that, I do think that as we look into the aerospace side of the business, there are opportunities, as you point out. As a wise, old colleague once said, you need motive and opportunity at the same time. And so you have to be patient about these things. But when you're patient and you're digging hard, opportunities over time come your way. And so we have been looking in that area. Obviously, we haven't announced anything. We made a small acquisition in January of last year that's doing very well, and it got us into a whole new customer segment, which is great. So we continue to look at things like that. So I wouldn't disagree with your thesis that you're laying out. But obviously, we're continuing to focus, but we're going to be disciplined.","Operator","And we do have some follow-up questions. The next follow-up question is from Scott Gaffner with Barclays.","We will proceed with the next question from -- it's a follow-up as well from Mark Wilde with Bank of Montr\u00e9al.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Just a couple of emerging markets issues. One, John, I wonder if you guys can just explain to us how you think about that Indian market for beverage cans, because it's just kind of amazing to me that we're seeing so much expansion in Myanmar, Cambodia, Vietnam, elsewhere, and yet that beverage can market in India relative to the size of the market seems so, so small at this point. What will it take for that to grow? And then the other question I have for you is, is there a way to kind of tap into some of these smaller but faster growing markets in places like Southern Africa? Can you build a facility that's less than 800 million cans or 1 billion cans?","John A. Hayes","Well, as you know, scale is important in beverage cans. We often talk about India being India. Well, there's, I believe, 26 different states there. Some ban the consumption of alcohol, some do not. And so you really have to get much more prescriptive in looking at it. You also have the urban versus rural areas where you have so many people. But the number of people that can actually consume packaged goods is a very small number, particularly when you look at the price points of what they earn versus what it costs to do that type of thing. And so it's always been the dream that it's going to continue to grow. But at the end of the day, beverage business remains a scale business, and that even gets to your question about Africa. There's only a couple of countries to date that have shown any ability to have enough scale where it makes sense, whether it's South Africa or whether it's Angola, Nigeria. Those are really the 3 only places other than the far north of Africa that have any kind of beverage can manufacturing facilities. As that continues to grow and the middle class starts to develop, it's no different than India. I think that's the most important thing. The middle class has to grow before you see opportunities there.","Operator","The next one is also a follow-up from George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I will try to ask these in sequence, just given it's late in terms of timing. First of all, John or Scott, would it be possible to parse in your CapEx this year and perhaps next year what you're spending on some of the newer initiatives? I'm not asking to identify each one, but if maybe there's a way to aggregate the total that you're spending on the cost-out programs, the new line in North America, Oss and so on. Would that be possible, at least on a public forum?","Scott C. Morrison","Yes. I think, George, if you think about it, just take $375 million of capital and think -- maintenance capital is probably between $150 million and $200 million. So you've got a couple of hundred million dollars of growth, if you will, growth capital. From a -- when you say cost-out, it really hasn't been that much spending on cost-out. Most of the spending that we're doing is on adding, really, a lot of specialty capacity, whether it's in Europe or North America or in the past, Brazil, or even in Asia. So a lot of it is growth capital with better than typical returns over time. Now you got to mature into those returns. But they're investments that we're likely to make. And also in the aluminum aerosol business, we've added some capacity there. So most of that $200 million of growth is really focused on better returning type projects and not really -- we haven't had to spend a lot of capital on cost-out. I would say, it's a small minority of what we're spending in total.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","All right. So the freight and logistical and all the other points that you made in terms of potential cost-out for 2015 and beyond, that will require relatively little incremental investment either in terms of capital or, for that matter, other cash cost. Would that be a fair point?","Scott C. Morrison","Yes. I think in the total scheme of things, if you think we're spending $375 million, way less than 10% of it is on cost-out stuff.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of looking back at third quarter, just from the standpoint of trying to establish a base for the future, would it be fair to say that your profits, if we actually had visibility into this, Brazilian profits were clearly down because of your volume decline, but your North American and Chinese -- or Asian, excuse me, profitability was up year-on-year?","Scott C. Morrison","Yes. Looks -- both those businesses have performed well. Really, the quarter was all about -- the miss was all about what happened in Brazil and the volumes.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. The last one, and I'll turn it over. China, can you comment at all in terms of whether you are closer than you were, say, 3 months ago to a new investment there, recognizing it'll be driven by EVA, contracts, et cetera? And totally switching gears on free cash flow, I recognize you raised free cash flow guidance. A lot of it is from working capital. But interestingly, the third quarter versus third quarter free cash performance was actually down. So was there anything else -- or how do you raise free cash flow guidance despite free cash being down year-on-year in third quarter?","Scott C. Morrison","Okay. Well, I guess, by the factor of every day that goes on, we're closer technically to when we spend capital in China. So I guess we're closer from that standpoint. But on a serious note, we're continuing to do a good job of getting our cost structure in a place where we can make investments and get the returns. That's really the magic of future capital spending in China. We've got to be able to make the returns, not just to grow with the market. The second part of your question had to do with free cash flow guidance and the change?","John A. Hayes","In third quarter.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's correct.","Scott C. Morrison","Third quarter this year versus third quarter last year?","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It was down, yet you raised your numbers. You mentioned working capital. We get it. But was there anything else that drove that increase in free cash flow guidance despite what was a year-on-year worsening in free cash flow?","Scott C. Morrison","I see what you're saying. No. It's got to do with all the other things, non-earnings things that we're doing on inventories, payables, receivables, all of those other factors.","John A. Hayes","And Edison, thank you. We appreciate everyone's participation on our conference call, and we look forward to finishing up 2014 strong. And we'll talk to you all in January. Thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines."],"2900":["Ball Corporation (NYSE:BLL) Q1 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call May  2, 2019 11:00 AM ET","Company Participants","John Hayes - Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer","Dan Fisher - Senior Vice President, Chief Operating Officer of Global Beverage Packaging","Scott Morrison - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Conference Call Participants","Anthony Pettinari - Citi","Edlain Rodriguez - UBS","Matt Krueger - Baird","Tyler Langton - JPMorgan","George Staphos - Merrill Lynch","Neel Kumar - Morgan Stanley","Scott Gaffner - Barclays","Connor Robbins - Goldman Sachs","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets","Mark Wilde - Bank of Montreal","Debbie Jones - Deutsche Bank","Adam Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","Operator","Greetings. Welcome to the Ball Corporation first quarter earnings conference call. During the presentation, participants are in a listen-only mode and afterwards we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is recorded on Thursday, May 2, 2019.","It's my pleasure to turn the conference over to John Hayes, CEO. Please go ahead, sir","John Hayes","Great. Thank you Emma and good morning everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's first quarter 2019 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings as well as company news releases.","If you don't already have our first quarter earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the notes section of today's earnings release. The release also includes a table summarizing business consolidation and other activities as well as a reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations.","Joining me on the call today are Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and CFO and Dan Fisher, Senior Vice President and COO of Global Beverage. I will provide some introductory remarks. Dan will discuss the global beverage packaging performance. Scott will discuss key financial metrics. And then we will finish up with comments on our aerosol and aerospace businesses as well as our outlook for the company.","Overall, we were pleased but not satisfied with our quarterly results, with overall global beverage can demand up over 8%, which is the highest it's been in a very long time and our aerospace business continues to deliver on its growth ambitions. Offsetting this growth was the previously mentioned conclusion of the end sales agreement as part of the Rexam acquisition in South America and some short-term incremental costs that weighed on results in North America. Dan will address these transitory costs related to efficiency headwinds for two of our new lines in our Goodyear, Arizona facility and the impact of aluminum scrap costs in his comments later. We expect volume growth to continue while our costs become more in line as we move through the year.","Now key highlights for the quarter include, as mentioned previously, overall global beverage can growth of approximately 8% with specialty can growth of approximately 20% and standard cans flat, further highlighting that our focus on specialty cans is paying off. In fact, specialty cans now represent over 43% of our mix on a global basis, which is up from 30% in 2016.","The growth was across the board with North and Central America up approximately 6% year-over-year, South America up a bit more than that and Europe and EMEA up in the low to upper teens, respectively. Our customer discussions about shifting products into cans from glass, plastic and multilayer paper-based containers have only accelerated and Dan will go into more detail about what we see going forward.","In addition, we received the antitrust approval of the sale of our China beverage can business and we are on track for second half 2019 closing. Aerospace revenues were up over 20% and while we don't expect this level of growth to continue, we do expect revenues to be up over 15% for the full year. Finally, aluminum aerosol was up low to mid single digits as the sustainability discussions migrate to this segment as well.","Now speaking of sustainability, Ball has focused on a variety of efforts over the past number of months to raise awareness on sustainability, educate consumers on the benefits of aluminum packaging, aid customer shift to cans and proactively improve our own environmental footprint. Key initiatives that we have focused on year-to-date include engaging with customers, governments, NGOs and others on the sustainability advantages of aluminum packaging, including presenting at the World Ocean Summit in Abu Dhabi, supporting employee-led recycling and community cleanup events around the world and launched new events in Argentina and the Persian Gulf, just to name a few, launching a campaign to educate youth about recycling, if you can, choose a can, facilitating various sports and cultural venues to shift to aluminum packaging, including utilizing Ball's reclosable aluminum bottles for still water, developing new infinitely recyclable brandable aluminum cups for use in stadiums, venues, colleges and other channels where plastic cups are used and to make Ball and our products even more sustainable, announcing agreements to transition 100% of our North American energy usage to renewable sources by the end of 2021, making Ball one of the largest corporate buyers of renewable energy in the U.S.","As we go forward, we see the momentum growing in each of our businesses throughout this year. We will continue to execute our long-term strategy of growing EVA dollars and earnings over time through increasing revenues above our cost growth, by focusing on our value over volume strategy, driving more mix shift to specialty containers, further developing innovative aluminum packaging products and expanding aerospace, all with the return of value to our shareholders' mindset.","And with that, I will turn it over to Dan.","Dan Fisher","Thanks John. And as John has already highlighted, we had some pluses and minuses to start the year. On the plus side and without a doubt, sustainability is having a favorable impact on customer demand and given customer conversations, it will in the future as well. On the minus side, certain inflationary costs to respond to the surge in volume growth cannot be fully offset in the U.S. given the aluminum scrap market spreads and a couple of new lines not quite hitting our targets.","Turning to growth. Our first quarter global beverage can volumes were up 8%, though comparable operating earnings were down 6.5% year-over-year due to the $33 million impact of the previously disclosed completion of the South America end manufacturing agreement, which will anniversary in mid-2019 and the late year 2018 U.S. line inefficiencies continuing in the first quarter. We can and we will do better going forward.","Across the globe, our teams kept pace with tremendous growth in Europe, Brazil and North America, which in some regions created some operational and logistical inefficiencies given the tight U.S. industry and higher than anticipated growth in Brazil. The impact of widening aluminum scrap spreads in the U.S. has highlighted an area of exposure in certain customer contracts, which will be or has already been addressed for agreements renewing in 2020.","Moving to the individual segments. Ball's North America segment volumes were up 6% in the quarter. New categories led the way with wine, spiked seltzers, energy, crafts and water experiencing double digit growth and lower calorie light beer being stronger than year-over-year. Given the strong growth, we experienced higher than anticipated line conversions in our new Goodyear, Arizona facility which, in a start-up environment, created higher cost than anticipated. This combined with the aluminum scrap issues described earlier, dampened our results and while headwinds related to scrap will continue until we can fully pass these on, we expect our operating performance to improve as the year goes on.","Turning to our South American segment. Volumes were up 11% in the first quarter, led by incredible strength in Brazil. As mentioned earlier, the completion of the end's manufacturing contract, required as part of the Rexam transaction, led to lower first quarter earnings and higher than anticipated Brazilian volume growth, led to pockets of suboptimal logistics patterns to honor customer demand. Comps will improve as we move forward with second quarter segment earnings down just slightly to reflect the mid-year anniversary of the end's agreement completion.","Our expansion in Paraguay is on track for late 2019 start-up and the 2018 expansions of Argentina and Chile are contributing to results. Overall, the South American industry trends remained strong with cans being the favorite package in the beer, tea, energy and hard alcohol categories. Looking forward, we see additional customer conversions from returnable glass to cans, aiding growth in 2020 and beyond.","European beverage earnings were up nearly 7% in the first quarter on difficult year-over-year comps, given the timing and location of the 2018 World Cup, a $5 million unfavorable operating earnings translation impact and start-up costs associated with two new lines and multiple specialty line conversions in the quarter. Volumes increased 10% in the first quarter, continuing the momentum from 2018. Cans are winning as customers shift their package mix into cans. As a result of new can filling lines being installed across our customer's operations, we look forward to continued good market growth. For 2019, contributions from our new lines, the year-over-year impact of our 2018 G&A improvement and plant cost initiatives will provide further year-over-year earnings growth and margin expansion as we progress through 2019.","Turning to EMEA and Asia. The demand environments in Turkey and India improved and operating performance in our Saudi joint venture stabilized. And in China, Ball has secured antitrust approval for the Chinese manufacturing plant sale to ORG.","In summary, global beverage can demand remains robust in our three key regions of North and Central America, Brazil and Europe. Supply\/demand globally for cans is tight and commercial and sustainability initiatives will benefit Ball going forward. Thank you again to all of our teams around the globe.","With that, I will turn it over to Scott.","Scott Morrison","Thanks Dan. Comparable first quarter 2019 diluted earnings per share were $0.49 versus $0.50 in the first quarter of 2018. First quarter 2019 results reflect $0.03 dilutive impact of the July 2018 sale of our U.S. steel food and steel aerosol business. Details are provided in the notes section of today's earnings release and additional information will also be provided in our 10-Q.","First quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflects strong global can volumes and solid aerospace contract growth, a lower effective tax rate than expected offset by the sale of the U.S. steel food and aerosol business and lower year-over-year end sales performance in South America and U.S. cost inflation, as Dan just outlined.","Net debt ended the quarter at $6.5 billion and reflects our typical seasonal working capital build and ongoing share buyback. We continue to anticipate year-end 2019 net debt to remain around $6 billion as we continue to actively buyback stock and pay dividends throughout 2019. Close to 90% of Ball's balance sheet debt is at fixed rates and we have reached our post-Rexam target levels. We have an additional $850 million of stock to buyback by the end of 2019. And in 2019, we will pay roughly $185 million in annual dividends, which reflects last week's dividend increase.","Looking forward, the company remains committed to repurchasing the shares issued to execute the Brazilian JV and Rexam acquisitions and we will closely monitor growth trends and growth CapEx returns to determine how much additional growth CapEx will be spent beyond 2019. Ball's balance sheet is healthy and our recent amend and extend of our credit agreement provides ample opportunity and flexibility to service growth and shareholder value return needs.","As we think about 2019, we continue to strive for full year comparable EBITDA of $2 billion, free cash flow in excess of $1 billion after CapEx in the range of $600 million, full year interest expense a little north of $300 million, with full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings will be in the range of 22% and corporate undistributed should be just under $100 million, which is roughly flat with 2018. By investing in our businesses, pursuing bolt-on M&A, repurchasing stock and paying quarterly dividends, we continue to put the cash machine to work for the long term benefit of our fellow shareholders.","With that, I will turn it back to you, John.","John Hayes","Great. Thanks Scott. In our aluminum aerosol business, now reflected in other non-reportable results and as I mentioned earlier, global volumes grew 4% in the quarter. We continue to see opportunities to broaden our global footprint. Sustainability is also a driver in this business as some consumer product companies pursue aluminum alternatives to plastic. We are proud of the progress our team is making on innovation, operational improvements and employee engagement to further improve this high-returning business.","Our aerospace business, as I mentioned earlier, reported 24% revenue growth and 20% operating earnings growth on solid contract performance, partially offset by incremental labor costs and the start-up of many of these new contracts. In addition, we welcomed 300 new aerospace employees in the quarter and we anticipate adding another 600 employees over the next 12 months. Our total aerospace headcount recently surpassed 4,000 people. Our focus remains on onboarding these new employees, readying the facilities for further expansion and most importantly, executing on our strong backlog.","Now as we look forward for the company, we are one quarter of the way through the year and while we still have much to do to achieve our 2019 financial goals originally laid out in mid-2016, our longer term prospects continue to be bright. Ball is uniquely positioned to lead sustainable growth in global aluminum packaging and aerospace while also continuing to return significant capital to shareholders, following the Board's announcement to raise the quarterly cash dividend by 50% last week as well as our recent $50 million share repurchase authorization. We still expect to acquire $1 billion of stock in 2019 and we look forward to exceeding our long term 10% to 15% diluted earnings per share growth goal. All of this is possible because of our people and our culture. We will continue to do what's best for Ball and our shareholders' long term success.","And with that, Emma, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please proceed.","Anthony Pettinari","Good morning.","John Hayes","Good morning Anthony.","Anthony Pettinari","John, you got a couple of quarters where it seems like you have had some growing pains in terms of meeting a stepped up pace of demand and I am wondering just from a big picture perspective if we are moving to a world where bev can vols are maybe closer to mid single digit growth and low single digit. How confident are you that, not only Ball but really the entire supply chain, whether it's the aluminum producers or your freight providers, are going to be able to kind of meet that higher level of demand?","John Hayes","Yes. It's a good question. Two things. First as it relates to Ball, recall, the acceleration of this growth has happened really right as we were in the midst of optimizing our footprint. So we had a number of plants that we were taking down over the last year or so in a number of lines. In fact, 11 lines, I believe, across the world over the last 18 months or so. And so any time you have this growth much higher than you are anticipating, when you are going through change, it adds risk to it. That's a little bit of what's happened. We are largely out of it as we look forward. We probably will have a little bit more in the second quarter. But as we move to second half of this year, we really expect to see all the benefits that we said.","On a broader basis, from a supply chain perspective, you raised an excellent point because I am confident in our ability to make the cans, but what we are increasingly focused on is on the filling side of our business, making sure there's enough filling capacity to fill the cans and more importantly on the metal side, making sure there's sufficient metal globally but even regionally, particularly here in North America.","The tariffs that were implemented about nine months ago haven't helped the situation. And we have gone from a situation where we had four or five metal suppliers that we relied on increasingly, we have doubled or tripled that, if not quadrupled that, given the shortage of aluminum, rolled aluminum here in North America. So that's added complexity into the whole system. And we have been working very diligently with all of our key suppliers to make sure that they have sufficient capacity to realize that the growth is endurable, it's sustainable and it's here right now.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay. That's very helpful. And then is it possible to size the earnings drag from the scrap spread issue that we could see in 2Q or maybe the remainder of 2019? And then I think Dan indicated the issue will be addressed or has been addressed in customer contracts. Is it possible to say how far along you are in that? And you have some contracts that are three to five years. Is it something that's going to take multiple years? Or just any thoughts on that one?","Scott Morrison","Yes. Anthony, this is Scott. On the drag on the first quarter, the scrap issue was probably about $10 million in the U.S. and it's really only a U.S. issue. That will continue in the second quarter, but it gets better in the second half as some of our supply gets switched to different suppliers and becomes a little more competitive.","And I will let Dan talk about the customer side.","Dan Fisher","Yes. Anthony, I would say on the customer side, I would say about 25% to a third of our North America business has this exposure in 2019. Two-thirds of that has already been contracted. The other are basically annual contracts that get renewed at the beginning of 2020. So it's within our control to re-up those contracts with a very different pass-through mechanism.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay. That's very helpful. I will turn it over.","Operator","Thank you sir. Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Edlain Rodriguez with UBS. Please proceed.","Edlain Rodriguez","Okay. Thank you. Good morning guys. A quick one on sustainability. As you look ahead over the next couple of years and if we believe you, as the can gains market share, like how do you take advantage of that, given that you practically sold out? Are you contemplating capacity expansion projects in all the regions? Like how do you take advantage of the higher growth?","John Hayes","Yes. Well, we actually have seen this coming for the last 18 months. We have been talking about it for a couple of years and we truly believe the acceleration of it is actually going faster than we had thought. But recall, as I mentioned a couple of minutes ago, we have invested meaningfully in our business to prepare for it. And so as we sit here in the short term, we are very confident that we have the capacity. What we are more focused on is actually the whole supply chain, as I said earlier, the filling side as well as the metal side. I think longer term, meaning beyond 2020 going into 2021 to 2023, we see a variety of opportunities, but we are only going to be investing in that capital if we can get the appropriate returns.","So maybe I will let Dan talk a little bit about the granularity there.","Dan Fisher","Yes. And I think, just to piggyback on that and maybe it's a more nuanced view, John has talked multiple times even at the Investor Day about needing to move our customers in PET that need to move, they also need to make sure that they get profit pools reestablished. And so when you look at our specialty growth just on the first quarter year-over-year, that's where a lot of that movement is happening. And we were up 20% in the globe on our specialty volume growth. Remember, over the last two years in the footprint reestablishment, we have taken out 12-ounce capacity and we have added back in specialty in anticipation of selling this through to our customers and it's starting to come to fruition. Now it's happening, candidly at a faster rate than we anticipated. And to John's point, we are constantly looking at our footprint for investment opportunities with customers and the returns have to be there in order for us to step into those.","John Hayes","And just to give you one last context. As part of our planning process, Dan and his team has really looked out not only two, three years but looked out 10 years and really looked into every one of our facilities and said where are those areas of low-hanging fruit, if you like to call it, we can speed up lines? What are those facilities that we can add lines into the existing bricks-and-mortar? And then where are those areas that we need to look outside? So we have a very good idea of short term and long term incremental capital and big capital, where we could invest if we get the appropriate returns.","Edlain Rodriguez","Okay. And one quick one on Brazil. Like are you gaining market share at the expense of glass? Because it seems like there is some dispute between what you say and what the biggest glass competitor is saying over there?","Dan Fisher","Yes. The answer is yes, from returnable glass. And what is happening in that market is, that market is transitioning to premiumization. There's been a couple of new market entrants over the last couple of years that have moved to pure malt, that have upgraded their ingredients profile and they have exclusively gone into cans. So the predominant player in that marketplace that overwhelmingly has a majority of returnable glass share, is having to change their ingredient profile on their beer composition and they are having to address from a competitive response standpoint, they are having to move to cans. And that is going to be an appreciable movement over the next three to five years. And so in the comments, when we said demand was ahead of what we thought, it's all playing into the response from the incumbent there and moving more into cans.","John Hayes","Yes. One other data point just on the first quarter and this is Nielsen data, but overall beer consumption increased a little over 1% in Brazil while can demand increased 20%-plus. That's just on the beer side. On the soft drinks side, consumption declined a couple of percentage points and can demand actually increased 1%. So that, by definition, means the can is taking share from other packaging substrates.","Edlain Rodriguez","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird.","Matt Krueger","Hi. Good morning. This is Matt Krueger, on for Ghansham. How are you?","John Hayes","Good. How are you, Matt?","Matt Krueger","Good. So first, I was just hoping that we could take a drag around the globe and just take a look at what your budgeted volume growth outlook looks like by region for 2019? And if there's any notable factors that we should consider as we move just in terms of the quarterly cadence of layering in that growth.","Dan Fisher","Yes. I think where we were this time 100 days ago was, we thought kind of mid single digits in Europe, South America and maybe a little north of that in North America. I think North America is more or less in line with what we thought. Of course, we are in April here heading into peak season or May, sorry, beginning in May. South America has moved a little bit ahead of that and so has Europe: South America, based on the comments I made on the last question as it relates to beer and the premiumization and the shift to cans in the Brazilian market. And then in Europe, it was really an energy movement and continued shift, I think, in sustainability and all that. I don't have a lot of data points to suggest that. But the growth rate certainly was ahead of what we anticipated. As long as weather holds in the northern part of Europe, we feel like we are poised for some decent growth ahead of that 4% or mid single digit growth.","John Hayes","Yes. Matt, your question is also, I think, is a more important one longer term because I think the megatrends around sustainability. This is not just a 2019 event. I say that because we have had more conversations with existing customers who are talking about converting from other substrates into cans. But more importantly, we have had the most number of conversations with new customers that have never been in cans that want to convert. And whether it's the spiked seltzers, whether it's some of the categories Dan mentioned or even still water, which we are seeing very strong interest in as this whole sustainability issue rises to the top. And so I think this is a multiyear, if not decade, type of conversion that will play out.","Matt Krueger","Great. And then understanding that you are entering this higher growth phase in the business, can you talk about what your targeted operating leverage is across these new sales volumes that you are seeing? And then how do you think you are performing currently with all the start-up costs, et cetera, versus your ultimate kind of operating leverage goal on that new business?","Dan Fisher","Yes. Well, I think in North America, as we said, I think we can do better. I would think we should be at historical levels, if not a little better, if we can extract kind of the commercial benefits that you should see with the supply\/demand market that's as tight as we have. The challenge, fundamentally in North America, just to take a step back and walk through what we have done in the last two years, we have closed multiple facilities and we have started up seven new lines here in the last 18 months and that's not an insignificant challenge. You throw on top of the fact that what John just indicated, where we probably moved from a half dozen metal supply programs into roughly 20, that's coming from all parts of the world. So I think managing that, focusing more on the supply chain, getting that stabilized and as you said, moving into this kind of growth paradigm, not only with our supply base but our internal employees and our processes, I think we should be performing at historical leverage fall-through.","Matt Krueger","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Continuing on, we now have a question from the line of Tyler Langton with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tyler Langton","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just on, I guess, Europe and South America. I mean if the growth is kind of mid single digit plus this year, with your current capacity, can you support that for the full year? Or would you need to either speed up lines? And sort of would you expect, if you had to do that, I mean are there any sort of cost headwinds associated with that?","Dan Fisher","No. Great question. We fundamentally have gotten through it from a capacity standpoint because keep in mind, we are just leaving peak season. So as we head into the fourth quarter next year, that will really be kind of pre-build, et cetera. And so we will be fine for the next six to seven months. I am actually heading down there in the next two weeks to go through a pretty extensive footprint analysis on that very question. But as John already indicated, if we are not going to get the returns, we are not going to add capacity. But yes, we will certainly, heading into next year, if we see growth rates at this particular juncture, we are going to have to look at incremental speedups, et cetera, potentially on the backs of this movement or the substrate mix that continues to kind of candidly surprises us a little to the upside.","John Hayes","Yes. Don't forget also that, Dan's comments were directed largely towards Brazil, but don't forget that we invested in a new line in Argentina as well as Chile last year. And we will, in Paraguay, are having a new facility start-up late this year. So that's actually helping us to bridge some of that gap.","Tyler Langton","Okay. No, that's helpful. And then just with Goodyear. I know sort of like two of the lines are taking a little bit longer to ramp up. Can you, I guess, give a rough estimate of how much that's costing you in sort of executions for the balance of the year? And then does that, I know it was always the goal was to get $50 million of benefits from Goodyear this year. I mean is that something you can still achieve for the year? Or with these pressures, does it get pushed out a little bit?","Scott Morrison","Yes. I think the cost drag in the first quarter is $5 million and that should decline as we move through the second quarter and hopefully will run in well as we get to the back half of the year. Full year, the $50 million, we are a little bit behind in where we wanted to be. But we have every intention and every expectation that we will be able to realize the net benefit when we get up and running. And remember, the two lines were overcomplicated by having to switch sizes on those large two. So that's difficult when you are starting out and you have got a new workforce. So as we smooth out that production capability, I think all of that gets better and gets to our original expectations.","Tyler Langton","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you sir. Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, sir.","George Staphos","Hi everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the details.","Dan Fisher","Good morning.","George Staphos","Good morning Dan. So I guess the first thing I wanted to do is come back to the comment and it's been touched on a few of the other questions and answers, on I think, Scott, you said monitoring CapEx relative to returns. So I think in some ways that's self-evident what you are seeing. But can you talk about how that might play into the other cap allocation goals that you have for the next couple of years, including the buyback that you have talked about? And when would we see from you that you have enough visibility, one way or another, in terms of monitoring that CapEx and what it means for 2020 and 2021?","Scott Morrison","Yes. I don't see that our CapEx needs are going to change our return of capital to shareholders. We had a nice bump in earnings this year. We are going to get a nice bump in earnings next year. Our leverage is down at three times by the end of the year. So we could definitely spend more capital and still buy $1 billion of stock. I am not overly concerned about that.","We have the good fortune, George, you have been around a long time, where we have been able to invest in our business, do M&A and return a lot of value to shareholders. And I think now we just have a bigger cash engine to be able to do that with. So we are not and in terms of incremental capital, Dan talked about his trip to Brazil. We have got another meeting here in the next week to talk about all that, to John's comments about incremental capacity, where we could speed up lines.","So it's too early to tell where that might be and what that might result in. But rest assured, we will be putting capital in the ground where we are going to get sufficient returns. And I think it's going to add to that earnings machine that allows us to continue to buy back and return a lot of value to shareholders.","John Hayes","Yes. And let's not forget, George, also just our goals for 2019 is $1 billion of free cash flow and that includes $600 million of CapEx. And that $600 million, our maintenance, state-of-the-art maintenance CapEx is probably in the range of $350 million. So embedded in even the $1 billion of free cash flows is $250 million of growth. And so if you just extrapolate that out with a growing cash flow from the earnings, you can see it may be plus or minus a little bit, but it's not a big mover.","George Staphos","Okay. Thank you. That's very clear. The second question I had and again, it's been touched on a little bit in some of the other Q&A, very helpful. On the one hand, we hear from the other substrates about how they are finding they need to educate the consumer. And this has been of our premise. It's kind of a battle for the hearts and minds of the consumer here that's important in terms of plastics versus paper versus glass versus aluminum. If you buy the premise of this, how do you maintain aluminum's advantage when everyone else is now ramping up their \"education process\"? What makes you comfortable that you don't lose what's been an advantage to-date? And relatedly, Anthony touched on this in his question, how do you maintain the security on the supply chain? And specifically, what are the aluminum companies telling you right now about their willingness to invest in more can sheet capacity when the last few years they have talked a lot about auto and other things that they claim to make more money on but obviously are a little bit more cyclical?","John Hayes","Yes. George, let me take the first part and then I will turn it over to Dan on the aluminum supplier side. Let's remember this, to the consumer this is not about cans versus glass versus plastic versus paper. This is about sustainability and doing right for the world. The aluminum beverage can, far and away, is the most sustainable, from a recycling point of view, both in terms of its ability to be recycled and the economics about recycling. The consumer gets that. So unless something fundamentally changes there and we keep our ears to the ground and eyes to the ground quite often on this, unless fundamentally something changes there, I think the aluminum can is always going to win out and I believe the consumer is seeing that.","Now as it relates to the aluminum supply and aluminum suppliers, Dan, why don't you take that?","Dan Fisher","Yes. George, good question. As you can imagine, we are having a number of conversations with our supply base. And I think the comment that you introduced in there is something that they are very well aware of. Maybe they weren't aware over the last two to three years. But the movement in the automotive, it's massively cyclical. There is a slowdown afoot. And I think there is a growing desire to find another diversification outlet to put capital to work. Some have, it's a more difficult discussion than others because they are so wed, to save time, publicly with some of the automotive statements. But it's clear that there are a number of folks that are absolutely willing. And keep in mind the return thresholds on that in a tighter supply\/demand market. We are having very different conversations with them, longer term conversations. And I think they are seeing a very different tone and tenor out of us. They see the upside of the sustainability message. And I think folks are going to be willing to put some capital to work.","George Staphos","My last question and I will turn it over. When we look at some of the incremental costs that you have incurred this quarter and expecting until the second quarter because of the growth in the can, thank you for parsing the details on the aluminum credit and the like, is there any embedded cost that is non-variable and for which you could not get out of easily? In other words, have you needed to hire more people? Is there more fixed costs that you have built into the beverage can business because of the growth outlook that doesn't necessarily step down quickly 3Q and 4Q? Thank you very much. Good luck in the quarter.","John Hayes","Yes. George, the short answer to that is no. There's nothing structurally that has changed related to that. As you rightly pointed out, these have been just short term growing pains.","George Staphos","All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Neel Kumar with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, sir.","Neel Kumar","Hi. Good morning.","Dan Fisher","Good morning.","Neel Kumar","In terms of your customer conversations, has there been any changes in terms of the customer order patterns this year versus last year, where it seems some money was left on the table because the industry was placing more adjustment time inventory orders?","Dan Fisher","Yes. There's definitely been. And I think there's a couple of beer companies and alcohol companies that have substantially outperformed expectations. They have changed their buying pattern in North America. We have had a number of really good conversations. You can even see it on the balance sheet, we are carrying kind of record levels of inventory right now in anticipation of peak season. So we are in a much better position. Now whether or not we have placed the right bets with our customers on which products they are going to sell through from Memorial Day through Labor Day, well, that's kind of always the gamble, right, in terms of peak season in North America. But I think we are in a lot better position heading into peak season than we were on previous years.","Neel Kumar","That's helpful. And then related to the beer market. We saw a pretty strong pickup in alcohol can shipments in North America the past couple of quarters. Has there been any improvement in the underlying beer market that you have seen? Or has that really just been driven by substrate switching?","Dan Fisher","Not a lot of improvement in the beer market. There was one of our customers that probably did a little bit better branding and pass-through and had some easier comps year-over-year. And they have also changed their, you can see it in their advertising, they have changed to multiple can sizes in specialty and sleek formats. So I think that's all helping. But what we are seeing is and we have talked about it probably for the last couple of years, the big beer houses, they have woken up to the fact that they need to sell what the end consumer wants. And they have done a really nice job of pushing out new innovative products, alcohol related. But whether it's the seltzers or different kombuchas or different types of spiked cocktails or mocktails, all of those are continuing to win in the marketplace. And I see more innovation, not less innovation, as John indicated, more into cans. And so we are excited about all of that going forward.","Neel Kumar","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you sir. Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays. Please go ahead, sir.","Scott Gaffner","Thanks and good morning.","Dan Fisher","Good morning.","John Hayes","Good morning.","Scott Gaffner","Dan, as we look at the volume growth in North America first quarter and sort of fourth quarter of last year, obviously accelerated. Because it is coming, a lot of it, from new product launches, how much of that is really based on underlying end market demand versus your customers filling the channels based on these new product offerings? Just trying to get an understanding of the sustainability of the growth at that particular level.","Dan Fisher","Yes. I think it's definitely selling through. Good question. It's not channel stuffing. And the other thing and I think John indicated with this is, as it relates to sustainability, a couple of years ago, new product launches in North America, the can would take roughly 30% to 35% of the share of all new products from a package mix standpoint. It's now moved closer to 70%. And so it's not just the new products. It's that the new products are overwhelmingly going into cans. They are selling through. Now some will sell through and some won't, right? And we will have to deal with that added complexity. But the reality is, it's like where we see the most appreciable sign of the sustainability movement. It's not necessarily a shift from existing products that have been regulated out. It's all the new products that are coming out. They are innovative. They are new. They work well with various can portfolios and different applications from that standpoint. And that's where we are benefiting from. But right now, it's overwhelmingly the spiked seltzers and things that have gained a lot of traction last summer. It has distribution space and it's selling through. I would continue to see that through the summer.","Scott Gaffner","Okay. And then when you look at the manufacturing footprint, I mean, going back to one of the previous questions on operating leverage on new volume. I mean, clearly or not clearly, but maybe you can just tell us, I mean, Goodyear, I would assume, is one of your largest if not the largest facility that you have. Is there opportunity on a go-forward basis, as you continue to invest capital in some of these regions to have more centralized production such that you could maybe leverage some of the volume growth a little bit better than you have historically?","Dan Fisher","There is definitely an opportunity to do that. It's all going to be about, it all relates to what is the product and what's the end market price point of that product and how much freight can that product absorb. So if it's $3 a unit on a shelf and it's an energy drink, they can absorb a heck of a lot more than a $0.99 still water product. And so that comes into the equation on that. But leveraging fixed cost, multiple lines, multiple conversions, leveraging your staff, leveraging your overhead structure and candidly leveraging your supply chain and your inventory levels, all of those things will become more and more embedded in how we think about expansion moving forward.","John Hayes","Yes. And Scott, this is John. The other thing that we like where we are and we have talked about this, in all the three major regions: North America, Europe and South America, our network of footprint is by far larger than anyone else. And so we have the ability to look at incremental speed-ups in those 20 or so facilities in North America versus a new line and where to put that. So you have network effects of all those things. It gives us more options and more levers to pull as we are thinking about where to make product and where to ship product.","Scott Gaffner","Thanks for the color. Just lastly, John, I think in your prepared remarks you mentioned lack of filling capacity or filling capacity coming online slower than maybe demand for cans is coming up from the consumer. Intra-quarter, there was an announcement about you co-investing with one of your customers around filling capacity. I mean, should we start to see that more and more co-investing on filling capacity so that you could ramp up your customer's capacity at the same rate that the end the market is ramping? Thanks.","John Hayes","Yes. Well, a couple of thoughts. Number one is what you are specifically referring to, recall that Ball is not really putting any real capital in. What we are doing is creating enablement. Enablement for our customer to be filling and enablement for us to actually have the cans to be filled. And so I would expect that, much like we talked about the whole supply chain, I would expect that you should think that we are thinking about the whole supply chain on the filling side and on the metal side as well. Whether or not the investment, we make investments into that is all about our core businesses making and selling and marketing cans. So it's an enabler and can, on a standalone basis, generate good economic returns, we would certainly consider that.","Scott Gaffner","Perfect. Thank you.","John Hayes","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you sir. Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, sir.","Connor Robbins","Hi. Good morning. This is actually Connor Robbins, sitting in for Brian Maguire. I just wanted to back to the 2019 reiterated guidance there. Obviously you mentioned some of the headwinds with Goodyear as well as some of the aluminum scrap stuff and then maybe tracking a little bit less than that $50 million benefit that you expected from Goodyear. Just wondering if there was any other offsets that you guys expect in maybe another segment to bridge to that?","Scott Morrison","Yes. For the full year, I think aerospace continue to do extremely well and probably has upside from what we originally thought. I think the European market is doing really well. We are getting hurt a little bit from a currency standpoint as it translates back into dollars in Europe, but I think that will do well. We are seeing very strong demand we saw in South America. And EMEA and Asia are doing okay. So I think across the board, our businesses are probably in better shape now, absent the softness that we had in North and Central America. But all the other businesses, including aerosol, are probably better across the board than where we were coming into the year.","John Hayes","Yes. And I will just make one final comment on it. Obviously, we put out our 2019 goals way back in 2016. We are not running the company only for 2019. We are running it for 2022, 2024, 2030. This is a long term sustainability play. While we wish some of these short term headwinds related to the aluminum as well as the Goodyear start-up, we wish they had not hit us. They did and it's reality. But we are focusing on maximizing the opportunity both short and long term for our stockholders.","Connor Robbins","Okay. Great. That's very helpful. And then just one other on some of the specialty can growth. It seems like you guys mentioned there's some pretty strong growth there. But you did mention in the press release, mix metal costs to serve some of the double digit specialty can growth in that North and Central America segment. Just wondering if this is more related to operational items? Or is there maybe not enough capacity that you guys have that's outpacing some of the demand expectations you have? Or just kind of a little more color there.","Dan Fisher","No, the two lines in Goodyear have multiple can sizes on them. And yes, we are not running as we anticipated and that certainly contributed to some challenges in terms of needing to get those cans from other locations, out-of-pattern footprint, running more over time in locations. So a collective drag by not having those two specialty can lines running where we thought they would entering the year.","Connor Robbins","Okay. Great. Thanks for the details. I will turn it over.","Operator","Thank you. And now we have a question from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Arun Viswanathan","Great. Thanks. Good morning. I guess I just wanted to get your thoughts on where we are in the sustainability adoption period. I guess it appears that growth has been a little bit quicker than expected. I guess what are your expectations for volume growth across different regions, I guess, going forward? Do you see that moderating? And has there been, say, a pull-forward on the sustainability front? Thanks.","John Hayes","Well, I think we covered this a couple of times earlier on this call. We think we are in the early stages of a long term secular change because of sustainability. And I do think that as we look forward over the next period of time, then we can debate whether it's three years, seven years, 10 years. You are going to see a lot more of the sustainability debate in front of us. And it's our job to try and capture with the most sustainable package in the world, capture as much of the incremental growth from new products Dan was talking about as well as conversions, whether on still water or other things that have a very, very low exposure to cans currently. There's a huge long term opportunity for us in every region.","Arun Viswanathan","Yes. So it's fair to assume that, I guess, global bev can growth should kind of remain in the 3% to 4% range for a little while. Is that fair?","John Hayes","No. I think we have said over the past year, we think over the long term, without sustainability, depending on region, it's anywhere from 2% to 4% growth. So what we are saying is, at a minimum, that's just the upper end of that growth and it could be a little bit more depending on how things break.","Arun Viswanathan","Okay. Great. And then just a quick question on capacity. I guess this aluminum can sheet has been tight for a while and it looks like it will be again just given this growth and I guess same with can capacity as well in North America. Where do you guys come out on investments there? Do you think more investments on the can sheet side will be coming? And similarly on the can side itself, how do you kind of view supply\/demand right now or the supply in North America? Thanks.","Dan Fisher","Well, I mean, supply from a rolling metal standpoint, we are importing metal right now. So yes, there needs to be capacity increases. There's plenty of metal capacity, but managing boats and different supply chain levers all around the world is not the most efficient and the most agile way to do that. So we are in a number of conversations to help our metal supply base, figure this out along with us. We will continue to invest in this. We have seen it for a couple of years. The reason, again, that we are up 20% in specialty growth is we have made significant investments over the last 36 months on specialty line investments. So we are able to step in at some of these opportunities. As John has indicated and as Scott's reiterated and I am telling you again, we are looking at EVA-accretive opportunities and investments and there are a number of conversations going on with the customers right now. We will continue those. We are not going to put any money in the ground unless we get an appropriate level of return.","Arun Viswanathan","Understood. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Bank of Montreal. Please proceed.","Mark Wilde","Hi. John, I wondered, first of all, if you could just put a little more color on exactly how that three-way joint venture in Arizona is working? I think I heard you say you weren't actually putting any capital into that business.","John Hayes","Yes. Let me tell you what I can in a public forum. There's been a great relationship between this customer, their filling partner and us as a can partner. And so we have entered into a filling operation. And you know any time you make a manufacturing facility, the best way to optimize the economics is think about the throughput and maximize the throughput of that. I think there's going to be third-party filling capability in this as the customer ramps up and that third-party filling capability. We know those customers that need to fill cans that may not be the customer that's investing and they are allowing us and the joint venture to pursue those. So we are in charge of the third-party filling of the demand from that filling location.","Mark Wilde","Okay. That's fair. And when I think about just Red Bull and juices, which I think are kind of the two products that have been announced, is it fair to say that that plant is probably going to be running a very high proportion of specialty cans?","John Hayes","Yes.","Dan Fisher","Although exclusively.","Mark Wilde","Okay. And then when we were out in Boulder in early November, I think you made a real point of talking about how the can manufacturers need to help replace the kind of the profitability that a beverage company might have in other packaging formats like PET bottles right now, which are very profitable for the soft drink companies. Where are you in that process, you think, of convincing them that these alternative formats that you have got can replace those profit pools so that they end up being made whole?","John Hayes","Well, I think the greatest proof point we can talk about is the 20% global growth in specialty and the flat standard 12-ounce volumes. And so your question is really better answered by our customers that are actually putting it on the retail shelf. But we have given them, there's a reason why we make over 40 different sizes and it's giving our customers variety so they can look at whether the package is right in a 7.5-ounce container, a 10-ounce container, a 12-ounce, a 14-ounce, a 16-ounce and everything in between. And so we are going to continue to do that. And that's going to mean, as Dan has mentioned earlier, that's going to mean more complexity. And we need to get paid for that complexity. But if it's helping the customers improve the profit pool of aluminum as the consumer is demanding more aluminum, good things typically should happen.","Mark Wilde","Okay. And last thing along this line. It just seems like the craft beer market has moved pretty rapidly into cans and it seems like they have held their pricing. So I am just curious, do you think this is having an effect, let's say, on these Mexican beer companies that are still shipping to the U.S. predominantly in glass that they look at what's going on with craft? Craft has gone into cans and its held premium pricing such that maybe we will see more of the Mexican beer moving into cans?","Dan Fisher","Yes. I think the one particular customer that you are probably talking about, we have a really strong relationship with them. Keep in mind, there's a ton of, there's an iconic image associated with that particular bottle. And I think there's some real, they believe there's some real market value associated with that. That being said, almost all of their new products that they are introducing are all in cans. And so it may not move appreciably the one core product that's in glass, but everything else that they are launching from an innovation standpoint is coming in cans. And we are in constant contact with them on an innovation standpoint. So your point is valid. I just think some of these iconic shapes are very difficult for a marketing organization to move from appreciably.","Mark Wilde","Yes. Understood. I know what that image is.","Dan Fisher","Yes. We are drinking more of those. I am sure it's the same when the weather warms up here.","Mark Wilde","Yes. All right.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Wilde, for your question. Continuing on, we now have a question from the line of Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Ms. Jones, it appears your line is muted. Please proceed. Your line is open.","Debbie Jones","Hi. Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to switch gears a bit and ask about aerosol, a couple things on that. You mentioned kind of a low to mid single digit growth. I am assuming that's in line with kind of industry trends. We haven't talked about it a lot in a while here. So I wanted to get an update on that. And then what do you think the opportunities are from the sustainability perspective in terms of categories where you could see growth from that? And then lastly, just as this fits into your portfolio, is it something where you would expect it to become a bigger part of Ball over the next two or three years. Or the opportunities in beverage cans are really dominating the capital allocation from an EVA approach?","John Hayes","Yes. Let me try and tackle those quickly. Number one, yes, it's in line with, overall, the industry growth that we are seeing as best as we can tell. Number two, I do think the whole category that aluminum aerosol plays in is probably further behind the sustainability journey than the beverage world. And I say that for a couple of reasons. There still is a tremendous amount of plastic in the personal care markets. That plastic is even more difficult to recycle because it's often different resins and multiple resins. And so I do think that the opportunity for the aluminum aerosol category to grow relative to the other substrates, is even perhaps greater in that but it hasn't caught on yet as much as beverage. And last but not least, it's difficult to answer your question about will it become a bigger part of our company or not. From a pure organic point of view, if this was a couple of years ago, I would have said yes, probably. But when you have 8% global beverage can growth, we look at it as a bottoms-up issue, not a top-down issue. So we don't target things to get bigger or smaller. I would have said aluminum aerosol has relative growth profile that was better than beverage cans. But if I had said that several years ago, I would have been proven wrong.","Debbie Jones","Okay. Then the next one is -- go ahead.","Dan Fisher","And Debbie, building on John's comment there, you go into a grocery store within North America, you have two aisles that are beverages. You have got 15 aisles of cosmetics. They are all in plastic. We have a number of conversations with retailers on it. They see the issue. They see it coming and they need help. And so I think there will be more and more opportunities in spaces that are tangential, that we can bend metal and we can handle different apertures, et cetera, that we can step into. Those are, to John's point, it's not moving as fast as the beverage side of things, but stay tuned.","Debbie Jones","Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And I guess I wanted to ask about the comment you made about the aluminum cup. I guess that it's pretty early stages, but you did mention it on this conference call. So I was wondering if there's any encouraging signs that you are seeing? And also just to get a sense of what type of capital is involved with something like this.","Dan Fisher","Aluminum cup.","John Hayes","The aluminum cup. Dan, do you want to take that?","Dan Fisher","Yes. We are making really good progress from a development standpoint. We have made investments from a pilot standpoint, Debbie. We will be launching it into a -- we will be commercializing it this fall on some college campuses and some entertainment venues. Moving forward, there is a ton of conversations and commercial appetite for it. We have hired a dedicated general manager for that business and we are building a team in and around that. It's full speed ahead. It's similar in terms of the economics to a can line, maybe a bit more and almost very similar to the output of a can line just in terms of the economics. This is very early stages. We haven't solidified that. But in the engineering, drawings and things that I am seeing to really step up the capital investment, the good news is we will have an opportunity to leverage some of our existing infrastructure and overhead structure to pilot that.","I will let John fill in more on some of the other things that are happening on that.","John Hayes","Yes. Strategically, we are very excited because on its own merit, there's a huge opportunity. But there's also a lot of leverage because many of those venues, whether it's college campuses or sports stadiums or museums or other things, as they talk about trying to go plastic-free, cups are a big part of it and beverage containers are a big part of it. And they don't want to just do one or the other. They want to go plastic-free. This provides us a portfolio where they can completely dedicate their beverages to going plastic-free and that's what's exciting about this.","Debbie Jones","Okay. Thanks for the update. I will turn it over.","Operator","Thank you. And now we have a question from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Adam Josephson","Thanks everyone. Good morning. Just one more on sustainability, Dan or John. Do you know what the recycled content of the aluminum you are buying is? And consequently, what the recycled content of the cans you are selling is? I have seen some data on Can Central and the like, but I am just wondering if your suppliers actually give you that information.","John Hayes","Yes. It's not the right way to be looking it, to be quite honest because aluminum is fungible. So you can take an aluminum can, melt it down and it can go into a bicycle frame or it can go into a window frame. And so I do know that, to answer your question directly, well over 50%. It depends upon the supplier. But well over 50% is recycled content. But I would strongly encourage everyone not to be thinking of that because 100% of aluminum is recyclable and can go into a wide variety of products. And that's why there's such a great benefits, recycling benefits of aluminum.","Adam Josephson","Thanks. And John, I think you said on the last call, your customer negotiations for next year were nearly complete. Could you give us an update on the status of those negotiations? And consequently, what type of commercial benefit you are expecting next year and beyond, if possible?","John Hayes","Yes. There really is no update relative to what we said 90 days ago. And I said we are still in the documentation. So when we have something to tell you that's more than what we have, we will tell you.","Adam Josephson","Thanks for that. And Scott, I think you mentioned earlier, you are expecting earnings to be up nicely this year as well as next year. Can you just give us a little more context for that comment? Is that just based on volume expectations or otherwise. Just I think you talked about next year as well and I just wanted to flesh that out a little bit.","Scott Morrison","Yes. I think we will be able to fix the issue that we are having around scrap in next year, with the contracts that we are entering into. I think we will get out beyond the learning curve of some of these start-up lines and plants that we are experiencing this year. I think we will see more volume and more growth across the business and weighted more towards specialty. And some of those new commercial contracts kick in next year. So I think all of those things lead to improved results, nicely improved results as we get into 2020 and 2021 and 2022. And so we are in a pretty good spot and we are pretty excited about the future.","Adam Josephson","Thanks Scott.","John Hayes","Emma, this is John. If there is one more question, we will take that, but we are over our allotted time.","Operator","Thank you so much, sir. We actually do have one final question. This comes from line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead, sir.","Chip Dillon","Hi John and Scott. Good afternoon now for us. Thanks again for all these great details. No one, I don't think, unless I missed it, asked about aerospace. And you talked about such a huge potential backlog. And it looks like this year, a reasonable place to be, last year, you did $1.2 billion in revenues, maybe this year is over $1.3 billion. What kind of years could we see in 2020, 2021, when you talk about especially that shadow of $4.9 billion? I know it's lumpy and it gets spread out. But can you give us some parameters around that?","John Hayes","Yes. Thanks, Chip. You are a good wingman for us because aerospace is very, it's an exciting time. And you know that's a long-cycle business. And what I mean by that is the visibility is much further out because of the won not booked and because of the contracted backlog. What I would tell you is the growth profile we see this year, we see continuing for the next couple of years at a minimum. And that's kind of over the next three to four years. So you should expect kind of a 15%, 20% growth and with comparable margins as we go forward on it. So it's really exciting. We continue to bid on things at a rate faster than we ever have before. We continue to grow the people and the facility side at a rate faster than we have ever done before because we see the opportunity set as we moved from components and sensors to full satellite, become a full mission partner for our customers. Those trends are only continuing. So as far out as we can see, these trends will continue.","Chip Dillon","And will the mix, either in terms of type of customer and I know mostly that's U.S. government, will that change? And will the character of the contracts be materially different, that is the mix of fixed price versus cost plus?","John Hayes","No, I don't think so. I don't think so. You always have nuances. But from a strategic point of view, they should not.","Chip Dillon","Okay. All right. Thanks for the help.","John Hayes","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you sir. And Mr. Hayes, I will turn it back to you to continue your presentation or for your concluding remarks. Thank you, sir.","John Hayes","Great. Thank you Emma. Thank you for everyone participating. We look forward to accelerating our momentum as we move to the second half of this year and we appreciate your continued interest.","Operator","Thank you so much. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you all for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Thank you. Have a great day."],"2892":["Ball Corp. (NYSE:BLL) Q1 2017 Earnings Call May  4, 2017 11:00 AM ET","Executives","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Scott C.

Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Clyde Alvin Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Ball Corporation First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, May 4, 2017.","I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, CEO. Please go ahead, sir.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Great. Thank you, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's first quarter 2017 results.","The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings as well as the company news releases. If you don't already have our first quarter earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com.","Information regarding descriptions of our segment reporting and the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the notes section of today's earnings release. The release also includes a table summarizing business consolidation and other activities, as well as a reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations.","Joining me on the call today is Scott Morrison, our Senior Vice President and our Chief Financial Officer. I'll provide a brief overview of our company's performance, Scott will discuss financial and global packaging metrics, and then I'll finish up with comments on our aerospace business and the outlook for 2017 and beyond.","We had a strong first quarter operationally with all of our reporting segments experiencing year-over-year improvement and we're well positioned as we move into the seasonally strong quarters. 2017 is right on track. Momentum is picking up in our businesses and the beverage can is winning versus other substrates around the globe. We are confident in our ability to capture planned cost savings and grow earnings cash flow and EVA dollars in all of our businesses.","In addition to all of the great work being done, during the first quarter, our first quarter global beverage can volumes were up 51% driven by the Rexam transaction and related divestitures which closed at the end of June 2016. On a pro forma basis and after taking into account the impact of such transactions, global beverage can volumes were up approximately 2%, led by low to mid-single digit growth in North and Central America, South America and Europe that were offset by declines in EMEA and China.","Scott will get into more details in his comments. We further improved operating efficiencies from our recently deployed growth CapEx projects in our Monterrey, Mexico beverage can and end facility. Our Canton, Ohio tin plate cutting and coating facility, our new Chestnut Hill, Tennessee aerosol line, and our devices UK and Velim, Czech Republic impact extruded aerosol expansions.","We began preparations for the Reidsville, North Carolina beverage can plant closure, which is still expected to close in mid-summer. We completed the complex IT system integration work in the North American beverage operations and embarked up on additional transformational cost-out projects. We completed the closure of our food and aerosol metal service center in Weirton, West Virginia at the end of March. We sold our former Hubbard, Ohio, paint and general line container plant and an EVA positive transaction, and our aerospace business won additional contracts allowing our quarter-end contracted backlog to stand firm at $1.4 billion. Our multi-year value capture plants are on course and we will recognize the majority of the $150 million of expected 2017 synergies in the second half of the year.","Before I turn it over to Scott, our board acknowledged the step-change we expect in terms of a higher level of free cash flow in 2017 and beyond by increasing the quarterly dividend by 54% to $0.80 per share annually on a pre-split basis and declared a 2-for-1 stock split effective this quarter. These announcements represent the confidence in our expectations, and it is the initial step in returning value to shareholders.","Later in 2017, as we have line of sight towards a 3.5 times net debt to comparable EBITDA leverage, we will look towards returning additional value through share repurchases with over $20 million post-split shares currently available for repurchase under existing authorization.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott. Scott?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Thanks, John. As John said, we're pleased with our first quarter results. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2017 were $0.76 versus last year's $0.59, a 29% improvement. First quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflect the benefit of last year's beverage can acquisition, solid operational performance in all of our businesses, increased global demand for both beverage and aerosol containers and the lower tax rate. These benefits were partially offset by higher compensation and project costs, as well as higher interest expense and a higher share count. Details are provided in note 2 of today's earnings release and additional information will be provided in our 10-Q.","Our Beverage Packaging North & Central America segment comparable operating earnings for the first quarter 2017 were up year-over-year due to the contribution of the recently acquired plants in the U.S. and Mexico, plant efficiencies and continued specialty can growth. Industry demand in the U.S. and Canada as measured by the Can Manufacturers Institute dipped just slightly in the first quarter likely due to Easter slipping into the second quarter of this year and no leap year, while volumes in Mexico continued to grow in the beer sector. Overall volumes in our North and Central America segment were up 5% on a pro forma basis. Drivers for Ball's growth were craft beer, super premium beer and imported Mexican beer brands, coupled with robust demand for certain specialty cans in the CSD category. As a reminder, the acquired JVs in Guatemala, Panama and South Korea, as well as our legacy Rocky Mountain Metal Container JV are not consolidated and are reflected in equity earnings of affiliates along with our other equity investment in Vietnam. As you can see, these operations performed well in the quarter, largely due to strong can demand in these regions.","Our Beverage Packaging South America segment saw improving volumes as we went through the quarter after a lower-than-expected January and February from a volume perspective, the industry saw strong March volumes and overall demand was up nearly 4% in the quarter and we were up roughly in line with the industry. For the full year, the South American team feels much more constructive about the market and economy. Our customers are using specialty cans to grow their business and deliver what the consumer is looking for. It may be too early to call, but the Brazilian government appears to be taking action to stimulate their economy, and while there are many challenges for the economy to overcome, it appears that the economic situation in Brazil is starting to improve.","Results for the Beverage Packaging Europe segment reflect the typical seasonality and performed in line with our expectations. As we mentioned in January, our European beverage segment has work to do on its margins and certain initiatives to support multi-year plans have been initiated to improve revenue and cost management via repositioning into sleek, slim cans, as well as previously announced intention to close the Recklinghausen, Germany facilities.","In the near-term, cost savings benefits in the region, including better operational performance will bolster second half performance. Industry supply demand is healthy, specialty demand remains favorable and construction of our new Spain plant is progressing as planned.","Our other includes Ball's legacy Asia-Pacific business, the acquired EMEA business and corporate undistributed cost. Note 2 of the press release references approximately $45 million of corporate undistributed costs in the quarter, which is higher than the fourth quarter run rate, largely due to three equal items including the relocation of certain pension costs that formerly resided in the legacy Europe segment, higher stock based compensation in the quarter and incremental project costs that will benefit the corporation in the long-term. After netting off the corporate costs, you could see that the operations in Asia and the Middle East performed well.","Moving to food and aerosol, comparable segment earnings were up year-over-year due to continued growth in global aerosol up 6% in the quarter, largely due to strong aluminum aerosol growth offset by U.S. food can demand declining 6% in the quarter. Starting in the second quarter, the segment will benefit from this cost savings associated with the West Virginia metal service center closure and anticipated growth for aluminum aerosol products. In summary, our global packaging businesses posted strong results and everyone is extremely focused on keeping this momentum going, meeting demand and effectively managing their invested capital base to drive EVA dollars from the combined business.","Thank you again to all our operations teams around the globe. You will notice that our first quarter net debt came in around $7.5 billion. This is right on top of our plan and the debt will begin to come down as we move to the back half of the year. As we think about 2017, our previously communicated goals remain intact. We expect full year 2017 comparable operating earnings in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, excluding the amortization associated with acquired customer intangibles. After spending in the range of $500 million of CapEx, 2017 free cash flow is expected to be in the range of $750 million to $850 million. The full year weighted average diluted shares outstanding for 2017 will be closer to a 179 million shares, given the dilutive effects of recently adopted accounting guidance for stock-based compensation plans and the absent \u2013 and absent the impact of timing of share repurchases.","Full year 2017 interest expense will be in the range of $280 million. The full year effective tax rate for 2017 on comparable earnings is now expected to be in the range of 26% due to a more favorable foreign rate differential. Corporate undistributed will now run about a $140 million for the full year 2017. The difference from our previous estimate of $115 million is divided pretty equally across three buckets. The first bucket is the inclusion of both the one-time true-up and stock-based compensation as well as accruing for higher incentive compensation this year. The second bucket has to do with some project costs related to more transformational projects now underway since the first stage of integration is behind us, and the third bucket is the inclusion of inactive retiree pension expenses moving to corporate from the legacy European beverage can business no longer owned by Ball. With that said, the operational performance is certainly enough to offset this full year increase.","At current FX rates, we continue to expect year-end net debt to be in the range of $6.2 billion to $6.3 billion. As you begin to think about the progression from the first quarter to the second quarter, there will be a nice step-up in profitability due to the normal seasonal ramp-up and moving in the third quarter, we need to phase in the closure of Reidsville as well as the phase-in of synergies.","With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Great. Thanks, Scott. Our aerospace business reported improved first quarter results driven by solid contract performance and the initial ramp-up related to our growing backlog. Congratulations again to the entire aerospace team for winning even more work since our last call, despite continued government contracting issues. Our aerospace business will see a nice step-up quarter-on-quarter as we roll in the new contracts.","Now, across the company, and as we look forward, our team continues to be focused on achieving the financial benefits from the acquisition, optimizing our packaging, manufacturing network and beverage, food and aerosol, and managing the growth and investment in our aerospace business.","Scott mentioned our 2017 goals, and nothing has changed since our January call that would warrant any changes to our targets. By 2019, we continue to aspire to generate $2 billion of comparable EBITDA, and generate in excess of $1 billion of comparable free cash flow.","For those of you who have known Ball over the years, we lever up to get a deal done, rapidly de-lever, spend any necessary growth capital on high returning projects, and then return our free cash flow to our fellow shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. And that time-tested financial strategy is exactly what we plan to do.","And with that, Kathy, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly, thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning. In North and Central America bev, you talked about overall volumes up 5%. I was wondering if it's possible to parse that out between U.S. and Mexico, and maybe other markets. And you talked about some of the reasons why the CMI data might have been a little bit weaker this quarter for the U.S. I was just wondering if you could talk about the U.S. market in terms of the tightness of the market and maybe how your CSD and beer customers seem to be doing early in the year?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yeah, Anthony, this is John. I'll try and tackle that. It's \u2013 we run it as a system. So sometimes, it's difficult to parse it out. But I'll give you a couple of observations. Recall that this time last year, we're really just getting our Monterrey, Mexico facility up and running. So we are actually shipping cans from the United States into Mexico to backfill that ramp-up. With Monterrey up and running right now, that's not happening. And so, when you look at CMI data, that excludes Mexico, it doesn't include shifts like that, that you would see. The second thing I would say here in North America you \u2013 excuse me, here in the United States, what you're seeing is, as we talked about, we're having very strong \u2013 continued strong growth in the craft segment, we're up 26% or so in the first quarter. A lot of the mainstream brands by the domestic producers continue to be off a couple of percent. It's a soft drink despite 12-ounce continue to be declining overall as a segment and for us, it was up driven by the specialty containers, which is good. And so, Mexico has been growing relatively strong for us just because we're on the back of many of our customers down there that are doing quite well. So hopefully, that gives a little flavor of it all.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah. That's very helpful. And then just one more, at the Analyst Day, I think you talked about footprint opportunities as being separate from the core $300 million plus synergy number. And the closures of Reidsville and Recklinghausen, I guess, on our math could be over $50 million in cost savings. I'm wondering as you think about going forward in \u2013 should we think about kind of a $350 million plus number as opposed to a $300 million plus number or there are offsets or is that the right way to think about it?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Well, recall from the very beginning, we said, we're not going to get into this parsing out, because we're not going to have a bunch of accountants running around, trying to track down everything. I think the best way to say it is we standby what we talked about in terms of our targets around 2017 and 2019, and we did talk about that we're going to be chasing, we're economically incentivized for all of us to be chasing as many of the cost and revenue synergies that we can get at and you should expect that's exactly what we're going to do.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. I'll turn it over.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi. This is actually Matt Krueger sitting in for Ghansham. How are you doing today?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Good. Thanks. How are you?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Good, Matt.","Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Good, good. So, given the comment in the release that the 1Q results exceeded your expectations, can you provide some additional color on what this refers to specifically? Was it regional volumes, integration efforts or was it something entirely different?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","I would say yes. Yes to all that. As we were \u2013 as we kind of came into the year, obviously, it's a seasonally slow quarter and from a volume perspective, we were having \u2013 we finished the year in Brazil a little bit softer. It really started to come back in the second half of the quarter, which is quite strong. I mentioned some of the trends in North and Central America. A very strong beer volume particularly down in Mexico, even CSD volumes on the specialty side offsetting many of the declines (17:12) and even in Europe, while there was nothing overly exciting in Europe, it was kind of as an industry and as Ball, we were growing a couple percent, which is right in line. And so, I think that was part of it.","And then our integration efforts continue to go well. We've got \u2013 still have a lot of work in front of us. Maybe I'll turn it over to Scott in a minute from a G&A and the integration and talking about some of the investments we're making that will help us pull out some of the G&A as we go forward, but I think overall from a cost perspective, from a best practice sharing perspective, from a sourcing perspective, from G&A, I think we're making progress, though.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Yes. And even the aerospace backlog, I mean it continues to be incredibly strong, and we chase more work. I think on the some of the projects that we're going after as it relates to corporate costs, I think we're finding a lot of opportunities to streamline, centralize, standardize things. And those types of things will take a little bit more time to have a benefit, but we're feeling really good about those opportunities. And on the working capital front, our sourcing teams, treasury, the operations, I think we're finding a lot of opportunities, to get after it, it's just a question of when those things will show up, will we get benefit in 2017, or how much benefit will we get in 2017, and how much will we get beyond.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yes. And just to amplify a little bit on what Scott said on the G&A side and centralizing some of this, when you go to centralize and take things out of the various facilities would have been done much more locally and\/or regionally, sometimes you have redundant costs, because you first have to set up a centralized capability before you can look at taking some of the cost out at the plant level, and that's the process we're in right now.","Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then, piggybacking on that question, given the first quarter outperformance, do you feel better about how you're tracking within your 20% to 30% earnings growth target for 2017? And would you maybe comment on if you feel yourself drifting towards the higher end of that range at this point?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","No. Yes, I think, to be honest, it's too early to tell. We are right where we expected, and as I said in my prepared remarks, relative to what we told the world in January, nothing has changed at all. I do think that as you all know that we make a fair amount of our money in the second and the third quarter and so the next couple of quarters will largely determine where we'll be in the range, but I think it's premature to speculate about what part of that range we're going to be in.","Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. That's it from me. Thank you.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Thanks.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Unknown Speaker","Good morning.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Scott, I was hoping you could just help out for a minute just on the European margin. You said you took some of the pension expense. It sounded like stranded pension expense from assets you sold and moved it into the corporate line. Was that in the fourth quarter number and maybe just trying to figure out what that was so we could see the sequential improvement in Europe versus just moving the pension out?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","No. And you are comparing \u2013 it's not helpful to compare Europe year-over-year because we have two different businesses.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Oh, I just meant sequentially 4Q to 1Q, was trying to figure that out.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Got it. There was just a \u2013 there's a difference in interest rate assumptions that will impact 2017 going forward. Our pension cost in total, if you think about the company in total, it's not at all different than what we thought, it's just in different buckets.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And if I look at the \u2013 in South America, two questions on South America. One, is 2Q the seasonally weakest quarter of the year, and how should we think about the progression there into the second half mostly from a volume and earnings perspective? And then just the other part would be on substrate substitution, are you seeing anything that would lead you to believe that cans or glasses, one or the other is gaining or losing market share there? Thanks.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yes, Scott, I'll take this. With respect to your first question, yes, the second quarter and even the third quarter are the two seasonally slow quarters and it depends year-to-year, which one is a little bit slower, so it's too premature to tell. But as Scott had mentioned in his remarks, are we at the bottom in terms of overall economic growth in Brazil? Perhaps too early to tell, but the tone and tenor feels a bit better now than it did three months ago.","In terms of your question about package mix, I can tell you the can continues to take share in there. Again just to give you some facts here; the beer consumption in the first quarter in Brazil, like happened in last year, it decreased 2.1%, but despite that the aluminum can was up almost 4% in there. So by definition, we are taking share. You know, soft drink, it declined 9%, the can was off about that much as well, so I don't think there's a lot of movements, but we do continue to see the can taking share relative to other substrates in Brazil, particularly on the beer side.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Tyler Langton with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes, good morning. Thank you. Just with Europe, I think you know that in the past you've talked about your efforts there to sort of improve the margin via sort of like mix and cost and that I think you expected some progress in 2017 and more in 2018. Could you just, I guess, give any more details on how you're doing with that, and if your expectations have changed at all?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","No, I think what you just described is exactly what we're doing; we're focusing on mix, and we're focusing on the cost side. And on the mix side that we've got a great network of specialty that we believe is under-levered. And so as we go to really push and take the strategy that we've done in North America, and move it over to Europe, to really creating greater profit pools for our customers by using our specialty network, that's one area of value that we're focused on. The other one is on the cost side, and whether it's on everything from operating cost to SG&A cost to plant efficiencies to sourcing, we're focusing on all those things. And we said it's going to take \u2013 it'd be a multiyear program, we're right in the midst of it, we see nothing that changes what our aspirations and goals are around that.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. And then just for South America, I think on last Chorus Call, you kind of talked about how maybe in Brazil, the hope was for (23:57) to be flat, maybe up a little bit, I guess, I know Q3, so this quarter is a smaller quarter, but I mean, do you have any sense as whether you kind of beat those expectations and whether lines could be up a little bit better than sort of flat to up 1%.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yes. I honestly think, it's all of us are looking into a crystal ball. Economically, it's volatile there, I know the middle class continues to struggle, employment's around \u2013 unemployment, excuse me, is around 13% and it really hasn't moved all that much. I know retail sales are flat to down a little bit. That really needs to change in the second half of the year. And I'm no economist, but speaking to people there, most people think that the worst is behind us. The question is, will there be a rebound or will it just be stagnant, and that's a $24,000 question.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Okay. Thanks so much.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, good morning. Just sticking with Brazil for a minute, I think you said in the release, the volumes were up mid-single digits, wasn't sure if that was for the quarter or that was the run rate as you exited the quarter and sounded like the trends definitely accelerated through the quarter. So, I was hoping you could maybe provide your view on kind of how you exited the quarter? I know, there was some shift with Carnival and Easter, but just trying to think of it on an apples-to-apples basis.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Yes. The number I gave was a full quarter number, it was actually down in January, February and then it bounced back in March. So, it actually \u2013 coming out the of quarter was at a much higher run rate than that.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yes. The volumes continue to be reasonably strong, but don't read into too much, anytime you have \u2013 given the supply chain months and months, particularly in environments like Brazil can shift relatively quickly there. So I know you're trying to look at the acceleration of momentum. I would temper you a little bit there because we are entering into a seasonally slow period of time.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That helps. Thanks. And, Scott, just on the corporate change, it sounds like we're thinking it's a little \u2013 maybe $25 million higher than before, but the full year guide, sounds like nothing has really changed. Just wondering what the offsets are? Is it maybe Latin America being a little bit better or progress on Europe margins?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","The tax rate \u2013 yes, maybe, if you think about it, I gave a little bit lower tax rate by a couple of 100 basis points versus the original tax base or the tax rate would offset it.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","But also...","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","(26:35) too.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yes. And with the volume trends that we see not only now, but obviously we need to have the right weather this summer. But in all the various regions that we laid out before, we continue to see good volume trends in that and that will be a big determinant. But as we sit here right now from both an operating earnings perspective, and Scott said it from an EPS perspective, we don't think the added undistributed cost really impact anything we said.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","But you think you can end the year kind of at the same run rate you are at or some of these costs seem like they're maybe frontloaded in the year?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Yes. I think they were higher in the first quarter. They'll come down as we move through the back half of the year.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","It's not going to run at the same pace as the first quarter.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yes. And remember, the first quarter relative, Scott mentioned that there was kind of three buckets. Two of the three arguably were one-time items and \u2013 certainly the higher stock-based incentive was a one-time kind of catch-up. And then as I said we're kind of pre-investing at a centralized G&A level to take things out of the regions. And then, the third thing in terms of legacy pension, that will continue to grow.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That helps a lot. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital. Please proceed with your question.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, John. Good morning, Scott.","Unknown Speaker","Good morning.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","John, I wondered just, you are working your way through Rexam, you've had a lot of new projects come online over the last year. If we look out two or three years, what are the opportunities for kind of further expansion look like to you?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Well, as...","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Just, in terms of perhaps new plants or whatever?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yes, I think we talked a lot about this at our Investor Day back in December. Nothing has really changed. I think there is great opportunity in all three of our product lines, the beverage can, the food and aerosol and the aerospace. On the beverage can side, a lot of the trends over the first couple of years we said, we're really going to be focusing on going after the value capture that we identify, but there is still growth. We talked about Spain as a good example and this continued move in the specialty, where we've got a footprint that we think we can leverage to the benefit of our customers and that is exactly what we're going to be doing.","Beyond that, that we talked earlier on the call about the can is winning relative to other substrates. We see that as a secular movement and we're going to try to do as best we can to take full advantage of that in every region in we operate and continue to look at other emerging regions that we think the can could perform well there. On the aerosol side, as we mentioned, aerosol volumes in the quarter I think, were a good representation. We were up very strongly in that. The only place we were a bit down was down in Argentina and that largely had to do with the Zika virus a year ago, when we weren't selling as many disinfectant cans.","And then on the aerospace side, we continue to do some great things and win some great work and as we talk about, as the program started up, some of the margins started to go down a little bit only because the way the accounting works. But we are very well-positioned to have a multiyear run in that business. So all those things, you never know, what happens in the global environment and global economy. But as we look out three years, four years, five years, we continue to see all those trends developing in a way that we're going to try and take full advantage of.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And I know it's not a huge part of the portfolio, but can you talk about what you saw in the first quarter both in China and in EMEA?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yes, those are both volatile types of places. We've had our own challenges in China as you know over the past couple of years. The volumes were down in that segment, low double digits kind of 10% or 11%. But that was again seasonally slow and had to do a little bit with Chinese New Year and some other things like that. We see no fundamental changes going on in that. I know, the overall market was a little flat, but we chose not to make cans, that we would be losing money on.","And then on EMEA, it's so many different regions everywhere from Turkey to Egypt to Saudi and other places, that was down as well, but again that was, I think, that was more a one-time related, in terms of some of the political issues we've seen. So I don't read into that too much. And we still think that area shows some promise.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","And despite softer volumes, the financial performance was right in line with what we expected there. Both those regions are going to do a good job of cost out. So the financial performance will be fine.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And then finally just on aerospace, your backlog was steady quarter-to-quarter. Wondered if you could talk about just sort of what the pipeline of bids and potential wins looks like right now?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Well, that's great that our government was able to get through a budget resolution at least for the next five months, which is good. And because stability in terms of predictability around those things help, through any transition we've gone the \u2013 the government's gone through a pause because there is a lot of turnover on the people side of it and we're a little bit behind the curve and having new people and seats, but as we look out, like we said over the last couple of quarters, we see the most amount of opportunities I've ever seen in my time here at Ball Corporation, for aerospace and we're going to continue to bid on those types of things, but it's all predicated on us executing very well and we have been doing that and great execution creates great opportunities and that's where we sit right now.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Very good. Good luck in the rest of the year.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Thank you.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Victoria Madsen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. This is actually Victoria Madsen sitting in for George. Hi, John, Scott, how are you?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Good. How are you?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Well, thanks.","Victoria Madsen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Doing well. Thank you. So, first of all, can you just discuss volume trends in key businesses so far in the second quarter?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yes, I think, we've discussed almost all of them and so I'd just ask you maybe when the transcript comes out, you can review it again and see if you have any questions you can give us a buzz, because we did largely cover them, but overall, I think, we're relatively pleased with the volume trends we've seen to start off the beginning of the year.","Victoria Madsen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you. And well, it maybe a little bit too early, can you comment thus far on your efforts to pursue commercial benefits, particularly as contracts come up for renewal?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Well, I think, the acquisition \u2013 nothing has changed relative to the acquisition of what we've always tried to do and we'll try and do. We've discussed in the past that we always try and give value for our products and services and everything that we do and that could include price, it could include tighter order call-offs, it could include helping our customers becoming more efficient using cans on their lines, it could include mix that I talked about earlier on the call.","As we all know, 12 oz is a very competitive package and where we compete with others. We're trying to be the leaders, but you got to be realistic in terms of our customers' alternatives. But what we try to do over the past number of years, particularly here in North America and we're spreading it out, South America is doing well and Europe we still have more work to do, is trying to help our customers expand the profit pools of the products, so that we can all win. Whether better graphics in the craft beer segment, different can sizes in CSD, for example that are going well, so far this year, new can formats, penetration like sparkling water, energy drink markets, or even bottles for both beer and non-alcoholic areas. So, if we can help our customers grow their profit pools, it's going to be helpful to us as well.","Victoria Madsen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, okay. Great. Thank you. And, just one last quick one and apologies if I missed it, but can you go over, how much of your synergy target was achieved in the first quarter? Given that assuming, it'll be a relatively comparatively low amount, given that work, early in the year and integration. But if you could, have any commentary around that?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yes. What we said, we said earlier in the call, but what we also said nine months ago that we're not going to get into parsing out of synergies, because you have to get more accounts to track that down, what we standby is, what our targets are in terms of 2017, 2019 and beyond, related to our comparable EBITDA, as well as our free cash flow. And, we did say that in 2017, the majority of the synergies would be coming in the back-half of the year, and we standby what we said.","Victoria Madsen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Philip Ng from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Hey, good morning, guys.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Good morning.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Can you give us \u2013 I guess a question for Scott, can you give us a refresher on how to think about the cadence in the synergy capture this year, and the big bucket as you layered in there? I know it's a little bit more back-half loaded versus front-half. Is it like a 30:70 split, 40:60, any color would be helpful.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","We'll get more on the back-half than they will in the front-half. We're going to get \u2013 the 150 run rate is still going to \u2013 is still good. We haven't seen much of that other than the closure of Millbank in the first part of the year and then a lot of the other things that we've been working on start to run through our P&L in the second quarter, but you're not going to see the benefit of those things until we get to the third quarter and fourth quarter.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yeah. And just amplifying, Scott, remember that we announced the closure of the Charlotte facility and it kind of happens mid-year, so that's really the third quarter and fourth quarter.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Reedsville.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yeah. We talked a lot about the \u2013 in prior calls about the sourcing side of it where we really didn't get any benefit in the first quarter. We're going to get some, but not a full run rate benefit in the second quarter, and as we move to the third quarter and fourth quarter, that's when it'll really start to show up.","I think a lot of the operational improvements in terms of best practice sharing at the plants, those take time to mobilize and rally the people and it really gets down to the manufacturing side, and as you know, our high season in the second quarter and third quarter, so as we go through the year, we're going to get more and more of that.","So, qualitatively, those are the types of things why we continue to say it's going to be in the second half. But we don't want to get pinned down as a 30:70 or 40:60 because the reality is we're driving real hard to show up with a comparable EBITDA and free cash flow we set for 2017 and 2019 and beyond.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And it's becoming less, I mean a smaller segment for you, but North America food seems like volumes for you, lagged the market a little bit. Was there any share shift in there, thoughts on just the vegetable pack? And I guess lastly in that segment, you talked about how there are some cost savings that's going to start rolling to a little more fully in 2Q. Can you help us \u2013 can you remind us what the opportunity could be in terms of the magnitude of the savings?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Yeah. First with \u2013 we said we were down more than the overall market, but there was no share loss. All of our customers, every customer is a bit different, but it's a very seasonally slow quarter, in some of our quarter our customers just weren't pulling as much as we had expected. So, I wouldn't read into that too much.","As for the pack, as we go to summer, it's too early to tell. It's beginning of May and plantings are just starting to go in many of our customers and so, we'll be able to update you as we go through the summer on that.","And then your last question about cost savings, remember we had a very big cost saving, a big project about the closure of our Weirton, West Virginia facility and investment on the cutting and coating side in the Canton, Ohio. Weirton, West Virginia didn't officially close until the end of March, but we've gotten no benefits of that. So, as we go forward, that's where we see a lot of the improvement to come from.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Just one last one from me on aerospace, backlog is obviously, they have been pretty strong. How should we think about the ramp up phase in terms of these new wins from a revenue and a margin standpoint in next few quarter? And then big picture, what's been the big catalyst for some of these recent wins, I mean obviously you guys are taking share? Thanks.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Yeah. In terms of the ramp up, it's really no different than historically what we've seen. And remember, we really do three businesses in that, we've got a \u2013 I'll call it as the traditional satellite business, we've got a components business which is the tactical products, things that go in the Joint Strike Fighter for example and then we have a services businesses.","The first two, the satellites and the tactical products is really where we've been winning the preponderance of the work and majority of those types of things, it spread out, but majority of them are cost plus in nature. And so, as you get started on these new programs, the margins that show up are a little bit less because as you de-risk the programs, that's when the margins start to increase.","And so, I think our margins in the first quarter were slightly down relative to last year. It was wholly expected because of these new startups and as we go through over the next couple of years, you should see an improvement in those margins as we de-risk these programs that are just starting now.","In terms of the opportunity set, we've talked about this in the past, some of our capabilities are exactly what the U.S. government needs right now. A lot of it's in the classified world, so we can't talk about it, but when you think about the needs for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and you also see in terms of the budgets being relatively restricted, they need more for less and the exquisite maybe important, but sometimes we can do something at a cost basis that's a little bit less than what other people can do. And I think the government in this environment is looking for new ways of doing business with them, and that's where it falls into our sweet spot.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Good morning.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","John or Scott, is there a way to help us with how much Rexam contributed to EBIT in the quarter?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","We're running it out of the system, so I mean, the obvious would be to look at Brazil where we acquired a much bigger business than what we had before, so the vast majority of that would be what we acquired in Europe, we exchanged a large degree \u2013 a new business and sold our old business, so it's an apple and a pear there.","And then North America, we're running it from an integrated standpoint, we're now looking at it as these are Rexam earnings and these are Ball earnings, they're all Ball earnings. So, we don't really look at it that way.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Right. Okay. Why the decision to split your stock?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","It was really \u2013 we've done this historically a number of times, when we get to this range and splitting the stock without a nice juice of the dividend doesn't really do much. So it was really about confidence in our cash flow going forward and liquidity in the shares. We will continue to be \u2013 once we de-lever to the point we've talked about, we will be an aggressive acquirer of our shares. So creating more liquidity in the stock helps, so splitting the stock and bumping the dividend is a sign that we feel pretty good about where we're at and where we're going.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks, Scott. And on working cap, I know you said last call you expected it to be a source of $100 million this year, is that still the case? And where...","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Yeah. I think it will be better than that. I think our teams, treasury, sourcing, the operations are all working great together. And we're an EVA company, we acquired pretty big businesses that didn't focus on EVA, and didn't focus on their capital base. And when you get people focused on working capital and what we can do and people get paid off of EVA, I think we're finding no shortage of opportunities, it's really a question of the execution \u2013 the timing of the execution of those opportunities and how much will show up in 2017 and then how much will show up beyond 2017.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks. And just, of that $100 million-plus, how much roughly is coming from which bucket if you can go into that level of detail?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","There is all kinds of buckets, I mean, every component of working capital we're looking at, so.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Yeah.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","You know, receivables, payables, inventory, I mean every \u2013 I'm not going to get by region, by segment.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Right.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","We run it in total.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yeah. But let me give you an example, I think as someone asked earlier about the amount of Rexam earnings. In North America here, we're running it as a \u2013 North and Central America, we're running it as a system. And so, we've moved volumes around into the various plants to optimize that from a freight and logistics perspective. And as we do that, we realize that there is inventory opportunities both on the raw materials side as well as the finished goods side. And so, that's just one area, in addition to focusing on the receivables and focusing on the payables.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks. And just one last one on working cap. If you get the $100 million-ish this year, is there more where that came \u2013 would you expect a comparable level of benefits next year?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","I think the benefit over the next few years will be well in excess of the $100 million.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks a lot, Scott.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Yeah.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. I have just two questions on South America and one on Russia. Just kind of broadly speaking, if we look at South America, I think the long-term expectations for growth is probably one of the reasons you've seen another player move into that market. Can you talk about your customer mix and whether that allows you to kind of grow in line with the market, and does that matter? And then two, kind of the impact of any potential new capacity that would be coming on in the region?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Yeah. Well, first, we've got a relatively \u2013 not relative, we have a large position down in South America, and we do business with every major customer down there. And so, I think it's safe to say as the mark goes, so do we. So I wouldn't really focus on over-weighted one customer relative to the other because we're big with many of the customers down there.","With respect to the new competitor coming in, as I said, the overall, the market was down a little bit last year. It's actually come back strongly particularly as we move through the first quarter and it's obviously going into a seasonally slow, but we see some tightness in there and I don't want to comment on what the customer activities, we're focusing on what we can do.","The other thing we really haven't talked about is we always focused just on Brazil. We also acquired a business in other regions as well including Argentina and Chile and have the ability to serve multiple of markets in that and the can continues to gain share in those markets as well and so that's one of the areas we're also focused on.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then Russia, I just \u2013 I don't think you talked about trends there, forgive me, if you have, but can you just kind of give us an update on how things are going in Russia where you see that the market is heading this year in utilization if possible?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Yeah. We'll \u2013 again Russia is \u2013 the first quarter is seasonally slow, Russia is going okay right now. There is nothing magical about it, it's a slow quarter, but then it was up a little bit in the first quarter. We expect for the full-year it to be up modestly as a lot of the trends we've talked about earlier and our capacity I think it's in reasonably good shape right now.","And so as we look to it \u2013 it is different than the business in Europe that we used to have, because it is more weighted to the second quarter and third quarters and it was the first quarter and the fourth quarters, and we're just about to enter into the that seasonally strong period, but nothing \u2013 no big deviations from expectations. That's the way to say it.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you. Thank you for all the updates.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical. Please proceed with your question.","Clyde Alvin Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yes. Good morning.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Good morning.","Clyde Alvin Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","John as you look at the volumes in the first quarter, which seem to be pretty strong. Do you expect to see that kind of progress and I know it's tricky with the pro forma computations, but do you think we will see certainly as we get into the second half and your footprint is similar year-to-year, does some mid-single digits number in most of these regions look sustainable?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Well, mid-single digit sounds a touch higher to me, but let's take a step back and think about all the trends that we've talked about, because there is \u2013 it's really in line with some of the long-term trends we talked about. We talked about in North America is relatively flat, you've got 12 lines declining, but you have specialty increasing. We talked about Mexico doing quite well in part, because of the domestic consumption and in part because of the exports in the United States that continues to grow. We talked about long-term South America being in kind of the 3% to 5% range just kind of right where the first quarter was, we talked about Europe, kind of in the 2% to 4% range, 1% to 3% depending on what location in Europe, that's exactly where it's coming in.","I think what was little bit soft was EMEA and China, but again, those are volatile markets, so you never really look quarter-to-quarter and structurally what we see is nothing fundamentally different there. So, I don't think anything was way out of line and as we go forward and laugh, if you will, the closing date of the acquisition, I think some of those trends longer-term are remain intact now. Will any given quarter be a deviation from one of those things for some reason or another, I'm sure, it will, but I think as a system around the world, we continue to believe that the can is going to take share from other substrates.","Clyde Alvin Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Got you. And by the way, when you were going at the beginning of the call, I think you mentioned some volume numbers and I might have just missed them, but that seem to be different from the press release, for example, I think the press release said, Europe was up low single digits, and I think you mentioned it may have been down, maybe you were talking about a different comparison? And also, I think you refer to low to single \u2013 sorry, low-to-mid digit increases in North and South America and Central America when at the press release, sort of implied or said mid single digits. I don't mean to split hairs, but could you just put some light on that?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yeah. For the avoidance of doubt, our European business was up 2.5%; 2.8% or so. Our South American business was around 3% increase and our North and Central America was up about 5%. And I think Scott mentioned that, so...","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","EMEA and Asia.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","And then EMEA and Asia were down as I mentioned Asia \u2013 excuse me, China was down about 10%, 11% and EMEA was down as well.","Clyde Alvin Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Got you. Okay. And the last thing is, it's interesting that you all are or actually quite \u2013 I think terrific that you gave us this forecast or guidance back in I think late July, early August last year for 2017 and you're holding to it, for example, the $750 million to $850 million in EBITDA. And if you think about it, you all are, and I don't mean to do a math lesson here, but it looks like you said at the low end of your guidance that you would have like $651 million in net earnings attributable to Ball, but that when we do your adjusted earnings like you did this quarter, we should add back the after tax impact of the amortization of customer payables.","So, given that that's somewhere in the zone of $128 million a year and you \u2013 tax effect this at the new tax rate of 26%. Basically, what I'm seeing is something like $746 million at the low end and that seems to be exactly where the consensus is $4.17 and I just didn't know if you had a comment that you believe that's because the Street and aggregate definitely thinks you're only going to maybe get to the low end or do you think there might be some people treating your amortization of intangibles differently and that might be affecting the computation?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Well, I'm still trying to go through your math, but I got to be honest. I don't think my computer could work that fast. But in all seriousness, what we standby everything we said, which is 20 \u2013 what we said, it was $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, it's too early to say, where we're going to end up in that. We've got our most strongest quarter is coming in front us over the next two quarters. So it's premature to really talk about that. But we laid out what we thought for interest expense, what we laid out for the tax rate, what we laid out for the share count. And when you do all \u2013 and then we also talked about 20% to 30%, when you kind of do all that math, I don't disagree with exactly what you said.","Clyde Alvin Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","I mean, it's pretty simple, it's $651 million plus the $95 million, which is tax effective $130 million \u2013 $128 million and you divided that by $179 million, which by the way means no buybacks and you get to $4.17 just for those listening. But I appreciate the clarification.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","All right. Thanks, Chip.","Operator","And Mr. Hayes, there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to you.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Great. Thank you, Kathy. Well, thank you all for your interest.

During the presentation all participants will be in a listen only mode, afterwards we will have a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this call is being recorded today Thursday, February 6, 2020. ","It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to John Hayes, CEO. Please go ahead.","John Hayes","Thank you Mladin and good morning everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's full year and fourth quarter 2019 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the company it could cause results or outcomes that differ in the company's latest 10 K and another company SEC filings as well as company news releases. If you don't already have our fourth quarter earnings release. It's available on our website at ball.com, information regarding the use of non GAAP financial measures may also be found in the note section of today's earnings release. The release also includes a table summarizing business consolidation and other activities as well as the reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations.","Now joining me on the call today are Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Dan Fisher, Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Global Beverage. I'll provide some introductory remarks. Dan will discuss the Global Beverage packaging performance. Scott will discuss key financial metrics, and then we'll finish up with some comments on our aerosol and aerospace business as well as our outlook for the company. 2019 finished on a strong note with fourth quarter comparable operating earnings up 14%, diluted earnings per share up 29% and stronger-than-expected free cash flow. In contrast, EVA dollars generated on average invested capital were down slightly year-over-year as the significant growth capital recently deployed has not yet generated expected returns due to its infancy. We fully expect to generate meaningfully higher EVA dollars in '20 and beyond as multiple growth projects come online and we respond to significant multiyear growth in global beverage cans and as aerospace executes on their sizable backlog.","Over the past year, global beverage volumes were up 5%. Our aerospace contracted backlog increased 14%. We completed the sale of two underperforming businesses. We launched our new aluminum cups business. Our full year comparable diluted earnings per share increased 15% and we returned over $1.1 billion to shareholders. As we reflect on 2019 and the 42-month integration plan and financial goals laid out following our mid-2016 acquisition of Rexam, I'm proud of our team, their ability to achieve more than $300 million in synergies and how well they've positioned our business to return significant value to all of our stakeholders over the near and long term. Back in 2016, when we completed the transaction, we laid out a 42-month target to achieve $2 billion in comparable EBITDA and $1 billion in free cash flow by year-end 2019. After taking into account the sale of our steel food can and steel aerosol businesses and the sale of our China beverage can assets, which combined represented approximately $110 million in anticipated 2019 EBITDA, and spending $100 million more in CapEx versus the original plan, our actual 2019 results were within $50 million of each financial goals. In addition to these strong results, we received $800 million in cash for the underperforming businesses we sold, which was used to further strengthen the balance sheet and return value to shareholders.","The 42-month journey didn't happen exactly as envisioned in 2016. Our team learned where we needed to improve operationally and organizationally; how to leverage our strengths to ensure aluminum packaging is the most sustainable in the supply chain and create opportunity for us; that return-focused decisions to exit underperforming businesses, though difficult, are always the right thing to do. And most impressively, our team navigated a vast sea of external global, political and market changers to deliver for our shareholders. As we embark upon our 140 years in business and celebrate the 10th anniversary of our Drive for 10 vision, where we have already achieved our goals of doubling earnings per share, doubling free cash flow and doubling EVA dollars over the decade, our company has never been stronger. We know who we are. We know where we're going and we know what's important. In global aluminum beverage cans, we are leveraging the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity from a sustainability market leadership perspective and remain focused on operational excellence and an improved customer experience. In aerospace, we continue to grow without losing sight of the successful execution of our existing and future contracted backlog.","In global aluminum aerosol, we continue to focus on innovation, sustainability, operational excellence and geographic expansion. And as a corporation, we are excited. We're excited to expand our newly launched aluminum cups business, guided by a defined go-to-market strategy as our new commercial production capacity comes on stream. We're excited to maintain our culture, EVA and ownership mindset and sustainability leadership while fostering an inclusive work environment and developing our next-generation of leaders and skilled trade professionals. We're excited to invest in growth opportunities across all of our businesses, more of which you'll hear from today. And we're excited to continue to onboard a cadre of new Ball people across our entire organization, ensuring that we preserve the old with the new, the values of our past with the ideas for tomorrow and the can-do spirit that has elevated Ball over 140 years. The year 2020 is shaping up to be quite strong with each business growing operating earnings. As customers, consumers, retailers and venues seek out our aluminum beverage packaging portfolio, our focus will be on amplifying our product sustainability benefits, operational excellence, improving customer service and executing on the various projects and commercial opportunities we have in front of us.","Across the globe, we are actively investing in new aluminum packaging production to serve increasing demand for aluminum cans, bottles and cups. Dan and Scott will discuss these opportunities and the size of capital spending. Now key highlights for the fourth quarter include 9% specialty can growth. Today, specialty cans represent over 43% of our mix on a global basis. As anticipated, our overall global volume growth in the quarter was up low single digits given very tight supply conditions in North America, particularly for specialty cans, and tough year-over-year comps in Europe, where fourth quarter 2008 volumes were up over 10%. We closed on the remaining parts of the sale of our China business -- beverage can business and received the cash proceeds from the sale. We closed on the sale of our Argentina steel aerosol business. Our aluminum -- our new aluminum cup recently appeared in iconic venues such as the NFL Super Bowl as well as the Waste Management Phoenix Open. It will continue to expand into many major league and collegiate sports as well as music venues, followed by online and retail channels in 2021. In summary, while we had some short-term operational challenges and scrap headwinds in our North American business during 2019, we believe the scrap headwinds are behind us and our planned efficiencies are improving every day.","Dan will go into that more. We will continue to execute our long-term strategy of increasing EVA dollars and earnings over time through higher revenues above our cost growth, driving more mix shift to specialty containers, growing new innovative aluminum packaging products like the cup, and expanding aerospace, all with the return of value to our shareholders mindset. Thank you to all the people who work here at Ball for your passion, your great dedication and hard work.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan.","Dan Fisher","Thanks, John. Let me start with a few key points to set the stage for 2020 and beyond. Our market thesis of 4% to 6% volume growth over at least the next five years continues to hold true. The still water shift to cans is accelerating as conversations intensify in each of our major regions and will push demand growth to the higher end of the range if the overall supply chain can move at the rate the end consumer is demanding. In North America, the new customer contracts took effect on January one and additional contracts will renew in the coming years, and we will focus on getting paid for complexity while also improving our own operational efficiencies and ability to manage growth. In the first half of 2020, North American volume growth will be muted until new capacity comes online during the second half of the year. Global capacity expansions are on track and our team is focused on hiring and training to ensure successful ramp-ups. Given the expectation of high multiyear growth, discussions on securing additional aluminum supply are progressing.","The ball aluminum cup is generating significant opportunities with a new customer base, and we are investing approximately 20 million in P&L costs in 2020. To enable the go to market strategy, we're looking forward to commercial cups coming out of our new Rome Georgia cups facility in the fourth quarter of 2020. We will initiate even more efforts to tell the aluminum sustainability story, not only as it relates to the infinitely recyclable nature of the package, but the superior CO2 footprint as well. This will further position bball as the partner of choice and inform the regulatory landscape going forward. Across our global operations, our team continues to manage tremendous growth, complexity, and incredibly tight supply demand conditions. As we prepare for the acceleration of products converting from PT to Cannes, we're well positioned and agile in our Europe and South American businesses and extremely focused on improving operational efficiencies, customer satisfaction and managing growth across our North American plant network.","As our North American operations gain some breathing room, we'll be able to return to historical operational leverage on incremental sales. Moving to the individual segments. Ball's North American segment volumes were up 2% in the fourth quarter and 4% for the full year with specialty cans growing 5% in the fourth quarter and 9% for the full year. During 2019, the North American business underperformed relative to our expectations operationally. The underperformance largely emanated from Goodyear and their reliance on the other supply points nearby. The domino effect of operational pressures across our system was compounded by the tremendous demand in the Southwest supply orbit. In response to our underperformance in our U.S. operations, we made significant changes to the management team. We have confidence as we transition into 2020 based on the seasoned leaders and growth mindset being brought to our day-to-day focus.","When the line additions at existing facilities in Georgia and Texas start up in the second half of 2020, and our Goodyear facility, which is now running at 75% efficiency gains even more momentum, this will certainly alleviate stress on the rest of the plant network. As previously announced, we will also construct two new specialty beverage can plants in Glendale, Arizona and in the Northeast U.S., both of which will initially have two can lines. Glendale is anticipated to come online in the first quarter of 2021 and the Northeast facility after that. Combined, the previously mentioned line and plant additions will produce six billion incremental units. With the aluminum scrap headwinds behind us, the progress being made at Goodyear and surrounding plants, previously negotiated contracts favorably resetting, I fully expect strong earnings momentum across North America in 2020 and beyond. Turning to our South American segment. Our volumes were up 3% in the fourth quarter and 8% for the full year. Year-over-year, quarterly earnings were up due to volume growth offset somewhat by customer mix.","Our new plant in Paraguay started up on track and we are poised to add additional capacity in Brazil as growth warrants. Operating earnings are expected to improve year-over-year as Paraguay gains efficiencies, customers pursue more specialty cans and more favorable approach to customer mix enhances results. European beverage earnings were up 9% in 2019 due to volume growth and improved operational performance despite $16 million of unfavorable operating earnings translation impact during the year. Volumes were flat in the fourth quarter, largely due to tough comps and year-end positioning between customers and retailers. For the year, volumes were up 5% in Europe. We are leveraging our continental Europe network to add lines to existing facilities in preparation for our customers' growth following the installation of additional can filling lines and to support normal market growth across Continental Europe and Russia. More to come as we move through the year.","As we mentioned in today's earnings release and following the recent decision to close our Dubai office, the company's existing facilities in Cairo, Egypt and Manisa, Turkey will be consolidated into the existing beverage packaging Europe segment starting in first quarter 2020. Given that the vast majority of the legacy EMEA business is associated with these two plants, it should be relatively easy to understand the changes in this segment going forward. As I mentioned last quarter, we will be prioritizing capital and resources for the best long-term outcomes. Following the Dubai office closure and the slowdown of our business in Saudi Arabia, we are shifting the management responsibilities of our Egyptian and Turkish plants to our European team in the U.K., and the remaining Indian and Saudi facilities will continue to be reported in other nonreportable going forward along with cups. In summary, global beverage can demand momentum continues in the regions where we operate.","Going forward, I see North and Central America's three- to five-year forward volume growth CAGR in the range of 4% to 6%; South America's three- to five-year forward volume growth CAGR in the range of 5% to 8%; and Europe's three- to five-year forward growth CAGR in the range of 3% to 6%. Our teams are actively hiring to support our anticipated growth. Thank you again to all of our teams around the globe. Our time is now.","With that, I'll turn it over to Scott.","Scott Morrison","Thanks, Dan. Comparable fourth quarter 2019 diluted earnings per share were $0.71. In the full year, it was $2.53 versus $0.55 and $2.20, respectively, in 2018. Details are provided in the Notes section of today's earnings release, and additional information will also be provided in our 10-K. Fourth quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflects solid global beverage can shipments, strong aerospace performance, a lower share count, lower effective tax rate and lower corporate costs offset by the sale of our U.S. steel food and steel aerosol businesses, sale of our Chinese assets, euro earnings translation headwinds and higher interest expense. In addition, global beverage revenues for the fourth quarter were down 4% from the pass-through of lower cost aluminum and roughly an $80 million year-over-year impact from the fourth quarter sale of our Chinese beverage can assets. Net debt ended the year right on target at $6 billion. The company completed a successful Eurobond issuance in November of 2019, which resulted in favorable rates and a larger-than-typical cash balance at year-end.","In January 2020, we redeemed the 3.5% and 4.375% 2020 senior notes. Ball's balance sheet is healthy. Debt has been termed out at low rates, and we maintain ample opportunity and flexibility to service growth and shareholder value return needs. In 2019, we generated $950 million of free cash flow after spending $250 million of maintenance capex and an additional $350 million in growth capex. We also funded $216 million into our pension plans, which was $125 million higher than our original plan and generated more than $200 million in working capital. We completed net share repurchases of $945 million and paid $182 million of dividends, returning an excess of $1.1 billion to shareholders. In the quarter, interest expense was a little higher due to the carrying cost of the Eurobond placement at year-end, and corporate undistributed finished the year slightly lower than expected at $54 million. As we look to 2020, here are some key metrics to keep in mind. Our full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings will be in the range of 20%.","Full year interest expense will be in the range of $280 million and full year corporate undistributed will be in the range of $70 million as we provide for higher benefits and incentives in 2020. Our 2020 cash from operations will continue to be this strong. We will be investing in working capital to support our growing businesses and $550 million of growth capex during the year. We anticipate full year 2020 capex in the range of $800 million resulting in free cash flow of approximately $600 million. Given the growth in operating earnings and our strong cash flow, we also plan to return nearly $1 billion to shareholders in 2020. Like always, we will invest capital with an eye on EVA returns, manage our balance sheet effectively and consistently repurchase stock and pay dividends for the benefit of our long-term shareholders.","With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.","John Hayes","Great. Thanks, Scott. In our aluminum aerosol business, global volumes were down in the quarter and were up slightly in 2019. European volume softness and operational performance dampened full year segment earnings. We have initiated action plans to improve operational performance in our facilities and believe the volume shortfall at the end of the year will not carry over into 2020. We recently launched our new Infinity bottle. This refillable, reclosable and infinitely recyclable aluminum bottle can provide a sustainable solution for shampoos, lotions and other personal care products as they shift from small- to medium-sized plastic containers at hotels and on store shelves. In addition, we continue to see operations to broaden our global footprint through bolt-on M&A. We look forward to improving the business performance in 2020 and beyond. In 2019, our aerospace business reported 24% revenue and operating earnings growth on very solid contract performance. Our year-end backlog increased 14% and our head count in 2019 increased by over 1,000 employees.","Executing on our backlog and providing our employees exciting work and enhance infrastructure for office space testing and manufacturing are the areas of focus in 2020. Looking forward, the program's recently won are vital to the intelligence reconnaissance and surveillance, as well as the climate change in weather predictive prediction needs of our country. With the recent budget agreement between Congress and the White House. Some of the ambiguity around contract start-up has been de risked. The business should be able to grow operating earnings in excess of 15% per year over the next several years, given the scale and type of contracted backlog recently one. In addition, there are even greater future program opportunities that we're pursuing that would position us even further into the future. Our long term prospects have never been brighter. wallets uniquely positioned to lead and invest in sustainable growth in global aluminum, packaging, and aerospace while delivering significant value to our shareholders. We look forward to driving our business to deliver long term diluted earnings-per-share growth of at least 10 to 15% per year, and achieve or even $1 growth goals of four to 8% per year and larger invested capital base, we will continue to responsibly invest both internally and externally. enable new products improve our existing businesses, position and train talent effectively while maintaining our culture and EPA discipline.","And always, we will do what is best for Ball, our employees, our communities and our shareholders' long-term success. And with that, Mladin, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead","Anthony Pettinari","Good morning. You indicated last year that in North American bev, you could get, I think, $30 million in inefficiencies rolling off and then $40 million in scrap recovery this year. Is that still accurate with the sold-out conditions in specialty cans kind of continuing into the second half of the year? And then in terms of the cadence, in terms of quarters for inefficiencies to roll off, and then for scrap, do all those contracts just reset on Jan 1? Or any kind of color you could give there on the timing?","Scott Morrison","Sure. Yes. The numbers you started with are still -- you're actually correct in terms of the scrap. We've largely offset that. That starts in, really, January 1. So that about -- that's already started to benefit us. So you see a nice improvement in the first quarter. The manufacturing efficiencies, we continue -- as Dan mentioned, we continue to get better and those will get better as we move through the year. And the start-up costs, really, we had very little start-up costs in the fourth quarter in North America. Now as we start to get closer to the start-up of the new plants that we're talking about and some of the new lines in the second half of the year, we'll have some start-up costs related to that. But all of that in total, if you put all that together, earnings in that business should be up kind of low to mid-teens.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay. That's very helpful. And then just shifting to Europe.","Scott Morrison","Sorry. Yes. I meant low to mid-teens on a percentage basis, just to be clear.","Anthony Pettinari","Got it. Got it. And then just shifting to Europe. I mean, there's a lot of moving pieces with the retail positioning you called out and Egypt and Turkey being added to the segment, and you've had some start-up costs. Is it possible to kind of size the sort of run rate earnings power of Europe right now or how we should think about the segment in 2020? Just if you can give any more detail on those kind of moving pieces.","Scott Morrison","Sure. So Europe should be up low teens without the benefit of the EMEA businesses. And if you look at the EMEA businesses and the profitability there, the vast majority of the profitability came from the two plants that we're moving from the EMEA business into Europe, so Turkey and Egypt. There was very little profitability from the other business that will go to the other segment. And so if you think of moving the EMEA profitability into Europe on top of those low teens improvement that we expect in operating earnings, that should give you your numbers.","Dan Fisher","Just a little more color on that. Very similar operating margins on a percent-of-sales basis that's been included in the business. So we'll still be thinking of kind of the normal flow-through. There shouldn't be regional mix implications, in other words, going forward. If we get the growth, you should see traditional or historical flow-through.","Anthony Pettinari","Got it? That's, that's perfect. I'll turn it over.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Neel Kumar with Morgan Stanley, please go ahead.","Neel Kumar","Great. Thanks for taking my question. In terms of the 4% to 6% volume growth, is that a Ball-specific figure or for the overall market? And then can you just give us some more insight on what you would need to see in the supply chain to get to the high end? And then you also mentioned a comment about still water conversions. What kind of impact do you specifically think that can have on growth? And can you just update us on some of those conversations you've been having?","Dan Fisher","Yes. The first question relative to the 4% to 6%, that is relative to the markets that we operate in today, and that's what we believe when we're looking at the next five to seven years. I think I indicated in the script, five years, we're doing a seven-year plan. So anything outside of five years would be really difficult for us to comment right now in terms of contracts and some of the conversations we're having with retailers and customers. And then your second question is the most difficult to answer in and around still water. I will tell you the conversations that we're having, certainly, the growth is nice up from the low base in both Europe and in North America, but we're also having much different conversations even in South America as we speak, and we're talking to some of the larger brands.","I expect to see some of this showing up on retail shelves in all of the regions we're at. But in terms of what price point that's at, the velocity of the turnovers and what it means in terms of aggregation of volume within the next three to five years, that's a difficult one for us to answer. The conversations are certainly far more robust today than they were this time a year ago. I look forward to giving you more updates through the quarters as we see more of these products show up on retail shelves, and we have a little bit more data at our disposal.","Neel Kumar","Yes. Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then you talked about a focus on improving operational excellence in 2020. In terms of your new capacity expansions in North America, can you just talk about what you're planning to do differently to ensure a smoother ramp-up and maybe avoid some of those issues you had recently with the two last lines at Goodyear, particularly as it relates to workforce training?","Dan Fisher","Sure. I mean, we're definitely spending a lot -- we're spending a lot more time. We're hiring earlier for the new start-ups, and we're training in a lot more detail. We're also combining the mix of folks that are going into these new facilities and\/or the new lines are going to be a combination of external hires and then repositioning folks from other plants. So I think that's going to give us a little bit more security as to the ability for folks to run the way we need to run with the amount of complexity we have in our businesses. And fundamentally, I think the leadership team that we have now in place is -- it's best-in-class, and they're doing a lot of really solid fundamental things to get us basically focused on kind of what we need to do in delivering to our customers.","I do think getting Goodyear running and securing that orbit of seven to eight plants being impacted will -- that will certainly help us. And then the last thing that I know John has talked about in previous calls that you can't undervalue is we're not only stepping into better economics and derisking some of these scrap issues and these new contracts. We have much tighter order fences, and that's going to allow us to operate with a much clearer path one week out, two weeks out, and all of that is going to have as much of an impact, candidly, as some of the training and some of the focused efforts are going to be.","Operator","Our next question is from Ghansham Panjabi, Baird, please go ahead.","Ghansham Panjabi","Hey guys, good morning. Can we just go back to Europe for a minute? Just give us some more color as to why volumes were flat for you. I mean, you mentioned a tough comp from a year ago but I think the industry was still up at a healthy rate. Was there a specific customer mix that impacted you? And then second, it looks like Carlsberg is looking at -- potentially looking at seltzers in the European market given that it's very small relative to the boom we're seeing here in the U.S. Can you just touch on capacity utilization in the industry in Europe, just broadly speaking?","Dan Fisher","Yes. So I think the first comment relative to our growth compared to the region, yes, the region was up. We did make some conscious decisions in terms of our customer portfolio, walk from some business in the Southeast Europe region. So that did contribute to that but we really like the short- and medium-term opportunities that will be stepping in to replenish that volume. So we should see growth trajectory kind of second, third, fourth quarter, getting closer to probably market trends in Europe for us. The utilization in the entire European market, I know for us, we're in the 95% to 97% utilization range. We're making some incremental investments, debottlenecking where we can, but we're certainly running incredibly tight right now. I would think that the market in general is in that 93% to 95% range. There is still -- there are still pockets of volume. It's not near as tight as we're seeing in Brazil and\/or North America, but certainly, 93% to 95%. We would historically have said that is a tight market in a full market. We're just operating in a much tighter supply demand intensity level right now in most of our regions because of the growth profile.","John Hayes","Carlsberg?","Dan Fisher","Seltzer market will -- it's probably not just Carlsberg. I would express -- expect the seltzer market to transition into Europe. Of course, I was over in Europe two weeks ago and nobody knows what the heck a seltzer is. So it will be interesting to see how that transition manifests, but I would expect after some of the key players in North America get their installed base and their supply chain built out to take advantage of what they think the real longer-term opportunity is for seltzers, they will all focus their attention on that marketplace.","Ghansham Panjabi","Okay. That's really helpful. And then last quarter, Dan, I apologize if I -- if you talked about this, but you said that you would leverage Q4 to basically rebuild inventory levels in North America for 2020 just to give your operations a bit of breathing room. Can you just update us on how successful you are with that initiative? And also, can you just comment on backlogs occurring specific to North America? And how are you kind of managing production for next year just given the surge in demand?","Dan Fisher","Sure. I think we largely accomplished what we wanted to in terms of inventory build. Of course, whether or not we built the right things, that will be dependent on the end consumer and what they draw. I think for North America, next year, we've got a number of projects, a couple of them pretty significant, that are going to show up and give us more capacity in Q2 and Q3. Those are really what we need to come off in order to kind of maintain the requisite delivery levels we need to our customers and kind of eliminate some of the disruption we saw in the previous years from a tight market.","John Hayes","Yes. Ghansham, this is John. I'll just put an exclamation point on what just Dan said because we have these lines starting up in the second half of this year. So over the first half of this year, we're going to get some incremental capacity but it's in the range of $0.5 billion or so. It's really in the third and fourth quarter each, that's when we're going to get another $0.5 billion additional each quarter. And so it is going to continue to be tight. We've said that, but it's going to be tight for the first half of this year. But then as we move through, I think, this new investment as well as getting more efficient on that orbit that Dan talked about, that's when you'll really start to see it.","Operator","And next question comes from George Staphos, Bank of America, please go ahead.","George Staphos","Everyone. Good morning. Thanks for the details and congratulations on 2019's progress. Hey, I wanted to maybe piggyback on Ghansham's question on Europe. So given what looks to be -- and ultimately, an improving supply demand balance as the market should continue to grow, are there reasons why you wouldn't see Europe over time evolving into what you see in North America and South America from a supply demand standpoint and some of the ancillary benefits you'd get from a commercial standpoint and innovation standpoint?","John Hayes","Yes. Let me take that. The short answer is yes. And just, again, to provide more color about what Dan said is we are operating -- we, at least, are operating in a tight investment. I can't comment on anyone else, but we are faced with a decision whether we would contract under a longer-term basis some business or choose to walk away from it. We chose to walk away from it because we have belief in the growth of the market, and we are -- given that we're already tight that we think we can fill up that capacity in the very short term. So I wouldn't read into the fourth quarter volume much at all. And what we're trying to do on a global basis, the same things you have heard us talk about for the last three years or so, which is leveraging the footprint we have, focusing on specialty and be able to deliver to our customers on the right economic terms anything they need, wherever, whenever.","That's our goal. And we believe, although we now need to execute and show up, but we believe we're in a good place in North America. And we believe, with a little bit of time, we've now gotten our footprint in a place in Europe that we feel pretty good about it, and now we're deploying that strategy that we believe we've been successful in North America into the European marketplace.","George Staphos","I wanted to try to, to the extent possible, parse some of the capacity and growth figures that you put out either in the formal comments today or in the press release. So on the one hand, you talked about, I think, eight billion units of capacity going in through 2021. And then I think I heard earlier on the call something around six billion units in terms of cans, in terms of cans -- plants, excuse me, and lines going in. Did I hear that and connect that correctly? And would that suggest that much of the majority in that gap where that delta would be aluminum cups? And if that's true, how is that tracking relative to what your expectation would have been, say, three and six months ago?","Dan Fisher","A good question. The six billion was North America specific. And so the delta between eight billion and six billion is not cups. Less -- more of the capacity is going into South America and some incremental in Europe. So I'd say almost all of the eight billion, close to all of the eight billion is can capacity.","John Hayes","Yes. And further, George, that's what we've announced as well, and we've told the world as we go forward, we're monitoring this very closely. So we could continue to -- that eight billion could become larger as opportunities present themselves.","Dan Fisher","Yes.","George Staphos","Relatedly, within that $800 million of capex, I would assume your projects that you haven't announced yet, that possibly could come to fruition. Would that be fair?","Scott Morrison","Most -- really, that $800 million is everything that we've announced publicly so far.","George Staphos","Okay. My last couple, and I'll turn it over quickly. One, on free cash flow, the performance was very strong, at least by your standards even. What went so well for you on working capital where there was a real nice swing? What was so negative in other free cash flow? There was a fairly large -- I think it was over $100 million swing there year-on-year. What was behind that? And then back to the growth, and I'll leave it here, in that eight billion, is there a way to parse what you think is related to plastic conversion?","Scott Morrison","So on the working capital, really, our operations and our GBS operations that are -- just a tremendous job of collecting everything. We have probably the lowest past dues we've ever had in our history at the end of the year. So really just great work on that front. Great work on the aerospace receivables as well. So it's really across the businesses, how well we perform. And the big negative in the other would be the incremental pension funding that we did in excess of the expense. That's the vast majority of that number, George.","Dan Fisher","And your question on parsing out the incremental investment in the capacity installation as it relates to sustainability, I'm not a rocket scientist, but how we're looking at it is, historically, we've grown at 2% to 3% and we think we're doubling that. So probably 50%, maybe even a smidge more is probably related directly to what we believe is sustainability.","John Hayes","Yes. George, it's a great question. As you know, we try and track this as best we can. And the best data point we can give you is in North America. Three years ago, 1\/3 of all new products coming out were in cans. Today, it's 70%. That's a meaningful jump. And so I think new brands, as they think about launching their beverages, they think about -- the difficulty is starting a brand, number one. The difficulty of getting product placement, number 2, and then do they want to go into the headwind called this anti-plastic regime. And so I do think, although that's the best anecdotal facts we can give you, anything else is speculative.","Operator","Next question is from Tyler Langton with JP Morgan, please go ahead.","Tyler Langton","Morgan. Thank you, Scott, I think, could you just help us bridge, I guess, the -- or understand the components a little bit better of the 2020 free cash flow guidance? I think you said free cash flow of $600 million and then maybe capex of $800 million. Just if you have any more details on sort of pension funding or cash taxes, interest expense, just sort of how to think about the components of that number?","Scott Morrison","Sure. So pension funding, we had a -- we'll have a pretty big swing year-over-year, which will be a benefit of about $125 million from '19 to '20, less funding into our plans in '20. Working capital, with our growing businesses, we need to invest some into working capital. So a good starting point for that number, probably $150 million use of investment in working capital. Taxes, cash taxes really won't change a heck of a lot. Those are kind of the big -- those are the big components, really.","Tyler Langton","And then I don't know, I mean, I know it's looking out to 2021, so a whiles away. But I guess, just with the sort of the capacity that you've planned, I mean do you have a sense in terms of how capex and working capital could then look just sort of relative to 2020?","Scott Morrison","Yes. I think, as opposed to a couple of years ago, we had said $500 million to $600 million was a good longer-term bogey. I think it's going to definitely be higher than that and it could be on the range of what we're going to spend in '20, also in '21. We're seeing a lot of growth opportunities. I think we're at the early stages of a lot of the sustainability growth that we're seeing and things that are going into cans. So I think it will be at an elevated level. We're really in a growth mode. This business for a long time wasn't in a growth mode. And so I think we have to get used to both internally and externally of looking at our company differently than we have in the past. And we've got great opportunities in front of us. So I'm really excited about the growth and the investments that we're going to make.","John Hayes","Yes. And that's -- what Scott just described is based on conversations and detailed discussions with our customers. Dan had mentioned a lot on the still water side, but it's in every single category I can think of right now. We're having pro can discussions with our customers and what that means in terms of contractual commitments, etc.","Tyler Langton","Great. And then just, I guess, just a final question. In terms of the volume growth, I guess it seems like in a lot of the regions, sort of first half of this year is going to be a little bit weaker. Can you just kind of, I guess, I think, direction on sort of how the cadence of volume growth should look as sort of the capacity comes online throughout the year?","Dan Fisher","In North America and Europe, your comment is correct. You should see kind of more of a second half lift when capacity comes online. And in South America, it should be pretty steady growth throughout the year because we did an awful lot last year, got Paraguay up and running, did some investments in Chile and Argentina. So we're doing some of those efforts now in North and Central America and in Europe. And so ongoing, you'll see greater growth rates in the second half of the year in Europe and North America and then building on that in 2021.","Tyler Langton","Great, thanks so much.","Operator","Next question is from Adam Josephson with KeyBanc, please go ahead.","Adam Josephson","Morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I appreciate it. Scott, just a couple more on the free cash flow. If I heard you right, you're expecting a working capital swing of about $400 million because it was a source of $236 million and a drag in '19 and a drag of $150 million this year. Just to be clear on the $236 million, was there any increase in factoring in that number? Are you anticipating any particular change in factoring? And then by the end of '20 in terms of the working capital drive that you're expecting, do you think your working capital will be at a stable level thereafter?","Scott Morrison","In terms of factoring, nothing different than what we had originally built into our plan. So really, the outperformance in the working capital had to do with way better collections at the end of the year and some things we did in aerospace even in collections. So it wasn't -- it was less about factoring than it was about other real performance improvements. In terms of going forward, if our business continues to grow like it is, and the cups -- and remember, we're going to ramp the cups business. They will start producing at the end of '20, but really start really ramping in '21. So I could see more growth and more investment needed in the working capital to support the growth in our businesses.","Adam Josephson","Just on the pension, Scott, so it will be a source of $125 million. How funded are your plans at this point? And do you expect to have to make contributions post 2020?","Scott Morrison","Well, we'll have to make -- yes, we have active plans. So we'll continue to make contributions, but we had extra cash flow, very strong cash flow in '19. That's why we funded an incremental amount of the plans in '19. We'll fund about $90 million into the plans in 2020. But we're in pretty good shape from a funding standpoint.","Adam Josephson","Okay. And just one on -- back to the European conversion situation for a second. Can you just kind of elaborate on how many customers -- and forgive me if I missed this, how many still water customers in Europe you're talking about, Dan, in terms of adding capacity for -- and roughly kind of how many cans those conversions represent based on what you're talking about for '20 and beyond?","Dan Fisher","Yes, I don't have the numbers off the top of my head. I would say that still water will be a bigger impact in North America moving forward than Europe.","John Hayes","Yes. It's too difficult to quantify because we're talking with the biggest brands and start-up brands and everything in between. And I think just when you look at the overall absolute amount of still water, the consumption trends in a year in the United States are probably greater than they are in Europe.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Maguire, Goldman Sachs, Please go ahead.","Brian Maguire","Hey, good morning, guys. Dan, thanks for the comments on the three- to five-year growth CAGRs by region. Just this has kind of been asked a little bit already, but just to be clear on that, you're not expecting or you don't need to see a material pickup in this trend toward plastic substitution to hit those. Do you think that's just relying on kind of continuing existing markets and existing trends you're seeing and anything you got from still water would be gravy to those numbers?","Dan Fisher","Exactly. Yes. And when we're talking about still water, I mean, even in our 4% to 6%, we're talking about the premiumization end of it. We're not talking about the full 500 billion single-serve plastic water bottles around the world. It's the very high end of that. Yes. We are not seeing significant conversions on the base brands. We don't need that. Just referencing John's KPI that we're looking at, it's just the new product launches are disproportionately going into cans, and that is accelerating our growth trends. So we look forward to the base brand shifting, but that's not incorporated in kind of our growth assumptions at this point.","Brian Maguire","Okay, great. I just wanted to come back to the aluminum cup a little bit. I think you said you're spending -- it sounded like $20 million of opex investments in 2020 to support it? Is that -- did I hear that right?","Dan Fisher","That's right.","Brian Maguire","And is that mostly marketing and promotional spending, R&D? Or can you kind of just give a little bit more color or details on where those costs are kind of are?","Dan Fisher","Sure. Yes. But I'd say 30% of it is what you just characterized, and then even in that, we've got to hire somewhere in the neighborhood of 100 and 120 folks to run our facilities. So you've got some of the investment cost, pre-spend and training that's also in that number.","John Hayes","But just to give you a sense, as we sit here right now, we've already hired marketing and new business folks for not only the arena side of the business but also the go-to-market in terms of retail. So those are the types of carrying cost, opex that we're talking about.","Brian Maguire","Okay. And just last one for me. Just the reclassification of the facilities in Turkey and Egypt, if it makes sense, given the size and scale of what's going on in the Middle East. But do you think there will be some opex or cost-cutting opportunities from that and\/or opportunities to maybe move that volume, mix it up by moving it into other regions from there?","John Hayes","This is John. There -- on one hand, yes. On the other hand, no. What -- we've actually closed the Dubai office, but remember, over the last three years, we significantly downsized that. So there's nothing material. The Saudi market, as we sit here right now, is not a very healthy market and that's probably a little -- not necessarily a headwind relative to 2019 but there really isn't -- we don't see any upside to that, whereas you compare to what we've seen over the last couple of years in Turkey and Egypt, there's probably some operational upside to that. But in the grand scheme of things, this was not a cost-cutting play. This is an ability to focus on what's important.","Operator","Next question is from Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets, please go ahead.","Mark Wilde","Good morning. Dan, I wondered if you could start off. I had always understood the South American beverage can market to be almost completely a beer market, and it sounds like you're seeing other beverages move into cans down there. Could you just give us a sense of sort of how big that non-beer segment is right now and what you think the trajectory is?","Dan Fisher","That's a great question. I mean, it's overwhelmingly a beer market. We anticipate it to be overwhelmingly a beer market going forward, at least in the next three to five years. There are pockets of opportunity, but a lot of our -- a lot of our growth opportunity even in South America is -- it's actually more beer more than anything, and that's because it's transitioning out of returnable glass or one-way glass. The other side of the business, I do think still water will be an opportunity. I mean, we're seeing pockets. Energy drinks are probably going to be a bigger growth area and an area of focus for all of the large global players. It's a big juice market.","We've got some filling challenges there but we're working on some technologies that may open up those markets. But I think going forward, 80% of that market is beer and there's still a lot of can penetration and can growth available to us. If something really opens up like still water, I think we're poised with our system to take advantage of that. But how we're looking at that market is continued strong growth in beer, continued substrate penetration by cans into returnable glass, and that trajectory looks pretty healthy for the next three to five years.","Mark Wilde","Okay. And then you made some comments about kind of additional can sheet capacity in North America. Can you just put a little more color around that?","Dan Fisher","Yes, I think we've commented on this off and on probably over the last 18 months. And one of the things that we've spent a lot of time, the folks on this call, are stimulating a base, a supply base in North America not only to derisk us from the ongoing -- the volatility in tariffs, etc, with all the excess capacity of can sheet being in China but stepping into growth and making sure we have a much more agile and nimble supply chain in North America. Those conversations are starting to really take a very positive form. And I would say that whereas a lot of the rolling mills and the can sheet providers were seeing a lot of benefits on the automotive side, that's still there for them. But suddenly, can sheet's looking a heck of a lot more attractive at a nice growth rate, and I think there's more profitability in this when they really look at it intentionally. And so I feel comfortable that over the next 18 to 24 months, we'll start to see some investments, maybe not significant, but enough to kind of manage the -- assure the supply for more cans and more PET substrate shift into cans.","Mark Wilde","Okay. And then last one for me. You just -- you mentioned being more proactive on the sort of carbon footprint argument. And one of the big beverage company's CEOs did an interview in the fourth quarter and he was really making the case for plastics again on a carbon footprint basis. So I wondered if you could just provide us with your perspective on that whole issue.","John Hayes","Yes, this is John. Let me kind of jump into that. I know over the next coming weeks and months, you're going to be reading about some independent third-party LCAs that actually show the exact opposite. It is true that if -- on an LCA basis, if you're using 100% virgin aluminum in it, that the carbon footprint is higher. But the reality is over 70% of all aluminum cans produced in the world today, 70% of that aluminum is recycled content. When you look at the facts and you put that in, it is lower than PET, lower than glass and lower than cartons, full stop, because of the infinitely recyclable nature of it. We, as an industry over the last 20 years, have not done a good job of articulating this as clearly as we should. And I think over the coming weeks, months and years, you're going to hear a lot more because I think the world is inundated with facts that aren't based in reality. And when you base the facts on reality, the can will stand up and will be better than any other beverage package on a CO2 perspective.","Operator","And the next question is from Mike Leithead with Barclays, Please go ahead.","Mike Leithead","Morning, I guess, to start, first, the industry question, kind of similar to one of George's questions. But I was just wondering if you had any sense of how much of the industry volume growth you think is being driven by new categories or offerings by the beverage companies versus just purely like-for-like packaging substrate shift. I know it's an inexact science, but any color you think you have would be great.","Dan Fisher","So I think we probably parsed this out among the regions because they're all a little different. I'd say the growth rates in Europe of 5% versus, historically, 3%, that lift is almost 100% sustainability-driven, at least we believe. We can't point to any specific KPI. But when we look at still water growth and some of the other products moving out of their existing substrate into cans, that feels like real inertia and sustainability. In North America, the doubling of our growth rate is probably comprised of two things: one, its sustainability and has a lot to do with what John's indicated and what we've said here, which 1\/3 of all new product introductions three years ago were in cans, and today, it's running at a 70% clip. The other thing that's happened in North America is spiked seltzers went into cans, and so that was a big help for us over the last couple of years. I would expect that growth to continue at similar rates for the next couple of years. But at some point, that will meter off, and then we'll be left with new products being introduced, and hopefully, those are going to win.","Chances are we're going to get the winners in cans. And then sustainability, especially in the still water area, that will be almost 100%. That category, we can look at that and say that is substrate shift. In South America then, we haven't seen sustainability as strongly as we've seen it in North, Central America and in Europe. But what we are seeing is returnable glass and one-way glass in the beer space, in particular, shifting into cans. Some of that is new product introductions. They're using 100% malt, and the transition out of corn-based beers, we've seen that. The premiumization in there is one-way packaging and one-way can packaging. So that is -- that's new product introductions and returnable glass shift continues in a big way in Brazil, Chile and in Argentina.","Mike Leithead","Got it. That color is really helpful. And then just second one, a question on the aerospace business, an area that's seen tremendous growth the past couple of years for you guys and you expect it to continue growing double digits going forward. So I guess, are you seeing any bandwidth constraints on that business's growth? I mean, I know you're mostly cost plus on your contract base. But I just mean logistically being able to handle a business that's grown this fast, is that impeding the growth rate at all?","John Hayes","No. I don't think so. Our management team has done a terrific job. I mean, when you think about bandwidth issues, I think of people and facilities. And we've been spending a fair amount. If you come out here to Colorado, you will see the growth that you've seen in our various three campuses, aerospace campuses from a facilities point of view. And the amount of new manufacturing capability, engineering capability and just, quite frankly, office space, that's one of the reasons why our corporate headquarters is a temporary office right now because we moved out to the aerospace, could accommodate the growth there. I think on the people side, we've been growing -- we've been hiring 1,000 people a year for the last couple of years, and we've done a tremendous job of making sure that we're hiring the right people, that we're bringing them on from day one, six months in, two years and making sure that they have the appropriate training.","And as we go forward, this is critical because we're still expecting to hire another 1,000 this year. After that, it's probably premature to describe anything, but we've been able to create a very well-oiled machine in the aerospace business for on-boarding our people. And quite frankly, some of the conversations Dan was talking about in terms of beverage can, we've had our HR folks talking with our aerospace folks to make sure that there's lessons learned going across the organization. So when I think of bandwidth issues, I think of facilities and people, and we've been doing a very good job. Our management team has been doing a very good job on both of those.","Operator","Our next question is from Arun Viswanathan, RBC Capital Markets, Please go ahead.","Arun Viswanathan","Good morning. Just a couple of questions to tie up some loose ends. The other segment, how are you guys looking at that both on a quarterly basis and for the full year post the moving of the EMEA business and maybe that situation with aerosol? How should we think about the P&L contribution from that segment?","Scott Morrison","Yes. It's going to be pretty small. If you take out and move to Turkey and Egypt plants and their profitability into Europe, there's not much profitability left in the other segment. And then when you think about what we're going to be spending money on, cups will show up there as well. I'm sorry, cups is going to show up in -- yes, in the other segment. So it's going to be relatively consistent throughout the year but at a lower level.","Arun Viswanathan","Okay, great. And then, I guess, I'm just curious, food, obviously, it's been sold and you don't really mention it anymore, but anything that would track off, I guess, as we go through the year?","John Hayes","No. This is John. We have a minority interest in that. And so as we go forward, we think we've partnered with the right folks. We think that industry is in need of consolidation, rationalization. That was our thesis all along, and we brought a partner in to help us think through that. It's premature to talk about anything that could happen in that business. But -- so it's playing out as we expected it to, and there's not any real news to report.","Arun Viswanathan","And then just lastly, there's been a number of projects in beverage can in North America that's been announced. There's probably a couple more that are coming in the next couple of months. I guess, I'll just bring up the question again around capacity. Are you guys at all worried about returns here and potential oversupply? Or do you think that's not really a concern at this point?","John Hayes","It's not a concern at this point. In fact, the concern is making sure we have enough cans to supply the overall market, and the reality is there is going to be new capacity. We don't know anything other than what we're doing. We're aware of that announcement by that independent down in Florida that actually -- most of it's going into the Caribbean market, but the market is growing at a rate very fast. And so we're just trying to keep our proportional share and grow with that market and try and win in the places that we can win relative to our skill sets. But there's going to be more capacity coming on, and that's actually a good thing because that means the can is growing. And as Dan said, our viewpoint isn't a two or three-year viewpoint. This is a long-term point of view.","Operator","Thanks. And our next question is from Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank, please go ahead.","Debbie Jones","Hi, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask, are there any broader themes that you're seeing when you talk to your customers about the type of can that they want, whether it be in kind of the new category growth or shifts due to sustainability? And what does that mean for the way you ramp up capacity? And is there any technology that you are working on that you think would be additive to this?","Dan Fisher","Good question, Debbie. I'd say on the -- in the area of still water, in particular, that is going to -- I could see a big play for 12-ounce standard cans, depending on what retail channel and what price point and where these sit. I would say the predominant can right now, our can conversations everywhere in the world, are your 12 sleek and your 16-ounce can, different variants to those. We are looking at a number of different innovations in different markets. This is one, though, I don't see a uniform exchange through all of the regions. But as John said this, and I think we believe this too, if we're making 40 can sizes in North America today, in the next five years, we'd love to be making 80. And we think we can do that better than anybody else and it will give the customers choice. It will give the retailers and our customers an opportunity to improve their margins. And so those are the conversations we're having across the board.","There will be more opportunities to give you a little bit more color. But some of the bigger customers, we're talking to marketeers and brand managers for categories and flavor profiles. We haven't had conversations for decades, and those are going to open up all sorts of innovative conversations and different can sizes and formats, etc. So 12 standard is still going to have a place. It's still a growing pack size because of the sustainability mix, but I think overwhelmingly, specialty will continue to take the new product introductions, the new category expansions and the new launches. Those will all come in specialty containers.","Debbie Jones","Okay. And then my second question, is there a point at which, with the 4% to 6% growth I think you pointed to for the next couple of years, is there a point at which you can kind of shift into just adding lines at these various facilities to kind of fulfill that growth? Is that what you're modeling toward? Or do you expect that it's just going to be a continuation based on your current footprint of needing to build the new greenfield facility?","Dan Fisher","Great question. I think depending on the size of the market and where the orbit is that we're building, we are absolutely trying to create more modular incremental thinking off of an anchor investment. So we would like to be able to take 2-line can plants to three and four. Well, that's a heck of a lot easier to do than to stand up 2-line can plants. But it'll depend on where the region is, the customer or the category, all of that will dictate probably size and scale to some extent.","John Hayes","Yes. And Debbie, if you go back by region, what we've tried to do is fill out the -- as best we can, the existing bricks and mortar. And I think about when we acquired the South American business, it was a series of 1-line facilities and we rationalized and consolidated that to a point and invested in that with very little new bricks and mortar. Same thing we've done in Europe and even here in the U.S. We are reaching a point where we are having to invest more greenfield because there's no space in those facilities. But to Dan's point, we are designing those greenfields so they're much more modularized and we can scale them at a rate much faster going forward. But I think our existing historical footprint is, at the end of the day, largely filled out from a bricks -- within the bricks-and-mortar that exists.","Operator","And our next question -- and I do apologize in advance if I mispronounce the last name, Gabrial Hajde from Wells Fargo Securities, please go ahead.","Gabrial Hajde","Thanks for squeezing me here at the end, guys appreciate it. Dan and John, you guys have mentioned still water a couple of times. So I'm going to focus on that a little bit. Can you share with us some of the conversations that you're having from customers? And are they starting from a point of differentiation and premiumization? Or is it starting from an ESG angle? And I'm sort of thinking about the comments that Mark made about what we're seeing in terms of other organizations supporting recycling technology and infrastructure to continue to have a multi-format approach or go-to-market strategy. So just trying to understand that.","Dan Fisher","So I would say, start with the retailer and back into the customer, and that will dictate whether it's a premium discussion or it's an ESG type of discussion. So -- and we're involved in those conversations at present. For us, the easiest transition is into the premium side of the water. I mean, it opens up the doors to innovation. There's a higher profit pool there, and that's where the customers are starting, now what they're getting pushed by, green pieces and target these days and there's an awful lot of focus by the two big retailers, at least in North America and even in Europe on how quickly they can address some of the plastic that's in their aisles. But what -- the conversations we're having right now, we're starting with premium. And if it transitions into other, you're going to have to address supply chain cost and filling and all of that in a big way. And I think the pressure will come from the retailers on to our customers, and we're certainly in a position where we can help them with those.","John Hayes","Yes. And the only thing I'd add is that from a customer perspective, what we're seeing is a wide variety of new start-ups that are taking advantage of the gap that exists right now. So they're starting in water and they're going only can so...","Gabrial Hajde","That's helpful. And then, I don't know, John or Scott, can you put into context for us the comment about getting back to 10% to 15% earnings growth over a long-term basis? Is that something that can be -- is in your sights for 2020, specifically? Or is that more -- should we think about it over the next couple of years?","John Hayes","Well, I won't say getting back to because we never had to get back to. We've always been -- in fact, we were 15% last year. What we're saying is, historically, we've had two measurable focuses that much of our incentive compensation is tied to. The first is EVA dollar growth, and you can look at our long-term incentive plans and see that the target is 4%, the upside is 8%. We try and drive to that. The second that we have long term, as long as I've been at Ball Corporation, we have talked about our growth goals of at least 10% to 15% per year. And we think if we execute in 2020, we could be at the high end or beyond of that range, but it's time to execute right now. Mladin, we'll take one more question and then wrap it up.","Operator","We do have a follow-up from Adam Josephson with KeyBanc, please go ahead.","Adam Josephson","It thanks so much for taking my follow up system. Just Dan, forgive me if I missed this, when you talked about Europe being up low double digits percentage-wise before the inclusion of the plants that you're moving, can you just repeat what you said about what that you expect the total impact to be growth-wise?","Dan Fisher","Are you -- the double digit, I don't know, think came from Scott on the earnings.","Adam Josephson","Oh, I'm sorry, just about moving the Egypt and Turkey plants into Europe from...","Scott Morrison","So I said Europe would be up low teens on a percentage basis, and then you'd have to add in the profitability from Turkey and Egypt, which was largely what showed up in EMEA before into those numbers.","Adam Josephson","Okay. I'll go look and just remind myself what that was. And then South America, Scott, you commented would be up as well. Forgive me if I missed this, did you quantify that as you did the other segments?","Scott Morrison","No. South America will be up kind of mid to upper single digits percentage-wise on an operating earnings basis.

Welcome to the Ball Corporation Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, January 31, 2013. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, President and Chief Executive Officer. You may begin, sir.","John A. Hayes","Good morning, everyone, and thank you, France. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's fourth quarter and full year 2012 results.","The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-Q and in other company SEC filings, as well as company news releases. If you do not already have our earnings release, it is available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website.","Joining me on the call today is Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. You will recall that in November, the company announced Ray Seabrook, our Chief Operating Officer of Global Packaging, would retire at the end of 2012. Ray had a very long and very successful career at Ball, and we wish him all the best going forward. I'll provide a brief overview of our company's performance and then, Scott will discuss financial and Global Packaging metrics.  We'll finish up with comments on our aerospace business and the outlook for 2013.","Ball reported very good 2012 results in a challenging economic environment. This performance is a tribute to our employees and their dedication to controlling our own future and embracing our Drive for 10 vision. Drive for 10 progress in 2012 included: Maximizing value on our North American packaging, the beverage container business, by increasing our manufacturing flexibility through the expansion of specialty can production and reduction of standard 12-ounce capacity; broadening our geographic reach and growing with the right customers in markets in Brazil by installing a second line capable of making multiple sizes in our new Alagoinhas facility. The line will service multiple customers under long-term contracts and will be operational in the second half of 2013.","We also completed the startup of our new facilities in Qingdao, China, and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. We completed our new aerospace clean room facility expansion in Colorado, which leverages our technology expertise and will help service more than $1 billion of contracted backlog.","And we completed the acquisition in mid-December of an extruded aluminum manufacturing facility in Mexico, which broadens our geographic reach and brings new capabilities to our global metal food and household segment.","2012 was a busy yet rewarding year. Our disciplined market leadership, focus on profitable growth and system upgrades in our existing businesses has strengthened Ball for the long term. Yesterday, in recognition of the company's strong performance, our Board of Directors approved a 30% increase in the dividend. That action is aligned with our focus of returning value to our shareholders.","We do face some headwinds going into 2013, like we do in most years, but at this time, I'm comfortable that we have the right mix of experience and conviction to ensure another successful year going forward.","Before I talk about aerospace and what we see going into 2013, I'll turn it over to Scott for a review of our 2012 numbers. Scott?","Scott C. Morrison","Thanks, John. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for 2012 were $3.06 versus last year's $2.73, an increase of 12%. And in the fourth quarter, comparable diluted earnings per share were $0.64 versus last year's $0.48, a 33% increase.","Also in the quarter, the company recorded after-tax charges totaling approximately $38 million related mainly to the previously announced closeout of a Canadian pension plan and costs associated with plant closures and a voluntary separation program tied to optimal staffing in our North American businesses and shared services.","For the full year, the following factors contributed to improved results: Global metal beverage packaging volume growth of 3%; higher comparable operating earnings; solid program performance in our aerospace business; lower corporate undistributed costs and a lower share count. FX translation negatively impacted full year 2012 earnings per share by $0.09, and in the fourth quarter, by $0.01.","Turning to free cash flow, Ball generated $548 million in 2012. Again, we returned every free cash flow dollar to shareholders via a net share buyback program of $494 million and dividends of $62 million.","Net balance sheet debt at the end of the year was approximately $3.1 billion, only $153 million increase over 2011 despite our acquisitions in Mexico and  [indiscernible], and acquiring nearly $500 million of stock. Credit quality and liquidity of the company remain solid, with the 2012 comparable EBIT-to-interest coverage at 5x and net debt to comparable EBITDA at 2.7x.","Committed credit and available liquidity at the end of the year was in excess of $1 billion.","For a complete summary of the fourth quarter results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, please refer to the Notes section of today's earnings release.","Recapping segment performance. Metal beverage Americas and Asia segment comparable earnings were up both in the quarter and full year due to slightly better volumes in North America for both the quarter and full year, as well as mix shifting to specialty cans. Our specialty cans volume grew nearly 25% in 2012.","Volumes in Brazil were up over 30% in the quarter and 20% in 2012. China volumes were down mid-single digits in the quarter on difficult comps and up 11% for the year.","European segment profit declined both in the quarter and full year due mainly to unfavorable foreign exchange translation. Beverage can volumes in the quarter were down low-single digits and full year volumes up mid-single digits. Extruded aluminum aerosol volumes grew over 10% in the quarter and full year.","In food and household, segment earnings were up nicely in the quarter and almost flat on a full year basis. Segment volumes were down approximately 2% in the quarter and nearly 7% for the full year. Truly excellent performance given 2012's difficult harvest and lack of inventory holding gains last year.","Finally, a few financial metrics and housekeeping items for 2013. Full year interest expense, retirement benefit costs and the effective tax rate on comparable earnings will be roughly flat with 2012. Given $100-million-plus of carry-in capital, full year 2013 CapEx is expected to be in the range of $400 million. Therefore, we expect 2013 free cash flow to be in the range of $450 million.","We will continue to return the majority of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends versus debt paydown in 2013. Effective in 2013, Ball will close its quarters on a calendar month basis. This means the first quarter of 2013 will have 2 fewer days, and as we alluded to in our management succession release in November, the global metal food and household segment will also include the results of our European extruded aluminum packaging business, as well as the recently acquired facility in Mexico.","With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.","John A. Hayes","Thanks, Scott. Our aerospace business continued to perform well, with solid execution on existing programs and contracted backlog still above $1 billion. Being cost competitive has allowed Ball to win our fair share of government, aerospace and defense projects.","Despite the ongoing lingering ambiguity about the U.S. government's finances and the threat of defense cuts, we remain bullish on this segment.","As we transition to 2013 and looking out across the operations today, keeping in mind it is only January, a few observations to share. First, we expect the Americas, Asia segment earnings to be relatively flat in 2013. Due to the overcapacity situation that exists in China, we face pricing pressures there. And as you know, the loss of 12-ounce business in North America creates a trough from which to build.","However, current specialty can demand trends in Brazil and North America have warranted additional capital investments and provide good growth opportunities in 2013 and beyond.","In Europe, given lackluster economic conditions, we do not anticipate any near-term capital investments for beverage can's expansion. Instead, we have a strong focus on cost optimization initiatives across the region. Our global food and household product segment is busy integrating our new plant in Mexico, investing capital to meet the increased demand for aluminum aerosol containers. And we anticipate a more normal seasonal vegetable harvest here in the United States.","In our aerospace business, while uncertainty still remains around the U.S. government plans on sequestration, Ball's strong track record should keep us well positioned for the long term, although depending on the outcome of sequestration, it could be a bit more lumpy than usual.","All across Ball, we have a management team that understands how to generate incremental EVA dollars. Our company's cash flow is strong, and we are actively managing our businesses to align assets and cost structures to respond to dynamic market -- global markets. All in all, 2013 will be a year where we have many levers to improve our financial results, and more importantly, sets us up even better for 2014 and beyond.","We have our hands on what we need to do to execute upon, and barring further deterioration in global markets or economic conditions, we continue to strive to reach our long-term 10% to 15% diluted earnings per share growth goal. And with that, France, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question, from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citibank.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","You referenced the pricing pressure in Asia, and I'm just wondering, is that -- did that pressure accelerate over the 3 months of the quarter? And then as we've moved into January, have you seen it -- have you seen that pressure abate or how is the beginning of the year?","John A. Hayes","Well, as we said, I think on the third quarter, that we anticipated pricing pressures in China, and that's exactly what's happened. The negotiation season was the fourth quarter and we did see pricing pressure there. Most of those negotiations are over now, and so as we go into '13, it's about execution.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And a couple of years ago, I think you disclosed that your market share in China was 31%. And I'm wondering given that you've been a little bit more disciplined regarding capacity than some of your competitors and maybe have walked away from some business, has your market share meaningfully changed from that 31%? Or can you provide any kind of quantification around that?","John A. Hayes","Well, I'll tell you, in 2012, we grew roughly in line with what the market grew. So our market share was relatively the same. We have delayed capital and have chosen not to add any significant capital in China going into '13, so we see our volume growth in '13 to be at or slightly below what the market is doing, so we could lose a little bit of market share. But what we're trying to do is make sure our business is as healthy as possible from a pricing perspective.","Operator","Our next question, from the line of George Staphos, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wanted to go back to the Americas, Asia beverage can segment. As you look out to '13 now versus where you were, say, 3 months ago, has anything changed markedly? Would it be pricing in China or is the aggregate of profit performance and the complexion that drives that more or less as you anticipated back in September -- or October?","Scott C. Morrison","It really hasn't changed markedly, George. There's definitely some headwinds that we -- that John talked about, the pricing pressure, the loss of volume in North America. But our guys have done a great job responding to those issues and growth in specialty capacity, we're still seeing; growth in Brazil, we're still seeing. So it hasn't changed markedly. Some of the levers may have changed a little bit, but in general, we're still with the same kind of outlook.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Scott, considering that last quarter, you were talking about how, apparently anyway, good the growth in specialty can demand and opportunities was for you. And that seems like it's the case again this quarter. If I more or less hold that constant, maybe that's not the right assumption, it seems like the -- if there has been anything that's changed, it sounds like it's changed for the negative, it would be again the pricing in China. Would that be a fair statement?","Scott C. Morrison","Yes, I think that's a fair statement.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Now the -- in terms of guidance, in terms of striving for the long-term goal of 10% to 15%, does that suggest something more aspirational longer term? Or is that something you think is within your sights for 2013, remembering the company's old phrase, you'd rather be heroes in December than in January?","John A. Hayes","Yes. Well, I remember on the third quarter, I said that the -- our long-term range is 10% to 15%, and it's going to be quite challenging to get to the upper end of the range, but we're going to strive to get to the lower end of the range. And that's where we are right now. It is only January. Various things have to happen, but as we sit here right now, that we have some challenges on our hands, but we think that we can push -- if we push and are successful in many initiatives we have, we might be able to get to that 10% -- to the lower end of the 10% to 15% in earnings per share growth.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Last question, I'll turn it over. Can you provide a bit more color, commentary on the consolidation activities that you have ongoing in metal packaging in the Americas? You obviously have some charges in the fourth quarter in beverage, which have been well discussed and telegraphed, but also in food, you have some things going on. Is that mostly the integration of Mexico? What else is in there?","Scott C. Morrison","Yes, on the beverage side, everything is on schedule. We closed the Columbus facility at the end of the year, Gainesville will close in the first half of this year. All of that's on track to what we expected. On the food side, that was the closeout of a Canadian pension plan, so where we had annuitized it. And we talked about that in the third quarter call. And then we're really excited about the acquisition that we made down in Mexico and the opportunities there going forward in 2013.","Operator","Our next question, from the line of Scott Gaffner with Buckingham Research (sic) [Barclays].","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Still at Barclays. On the Asia business, can you just sort of parse that for us? I know you've got a large position in China, but what are the other regions there? And what are you seeing as far as price pressure outside of China?","John A. Hayes","Well, the only other places we really operate outside of China is our joint venture in Vietnam and we have a small interest in Thailand. I think generally speaking, we are seeing some pricing pressures, but it's not terrible. But I -- if I commented on any other region, I don't think it'd be fair because we don't sell into those regions.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then are you seeing any bifurcation between alcoholic versus non-alcoholic cans? Is that anything that you're seeing in the market? And then also, just the impact of the Chinese New Year, how much is that impacting the -- both the fourth quarter and the first quarter?","John A. Hayes","Yes, I think your question is from a volume perspective, and you're right, the Chinese New Year is a bit later this year. And so as we sit here towards the end of January, we've seen some reasonably strong growth in the month of January in our business over in China. And I think it has to do with the Chinese New Year. It's been extremely cold in China, and so I know beer has been soft. I think the overall market was a bit soft in the fourth quarter. But I think it's more weather-related. If you followed the weather, Northern China in particular was extremely cold and extremely snowy. And so that had some impact in the fourth quarter.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, on North American specialty can mix, where do we end the year on mix of specialty as far as the total can mix in North America? And what's the outlook for 2013 as you bring more specialty cans into the mix?","John A. Hayes","Yes, I think our percent was in the 17%, 18% range for 2012. And as we look to 2013, we have some exciting things going on, on our specialty business, so we expect to see some continued growth in that. Whether it's on the smaller sizes, 7.5-ounce, whether it's on the sleek, which is a 12-ounce but a different shaped container, or on some of the larger sizes, we see good growth there. And I think part of it has to do with new housing starts are beginning, and that's good middle-class jobs that are the big consumers of those types of packages, as well as unemployment in the 21- to 34-year-old range, year-over-year went from over 9% to about 7.7%, 7.8%. So we've seen a pickup in the core beer consumer as well.","Operator","Our next question is from Ghansham Panjabi from Robert W. Baird.","Matthew R. Wooten - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","It's Matt Wooten sitting in for Ghansham today. I was hoping that -- on a longer term basis, what do you anticipate as a sustainable number for growth CapEx? As I recall, maintenance CapEx is about $200 million a year.","Scott C. Morrison","Yes, that's a good number to use for maintenance CapEx. Growth CapEx depends on the opportunities that are there. We really look to deploy capital wherever we think we can make attractive returns, and how fast that comes changes over time. If you look back, last year our capital spend declined throughout the year, that's why we had so much pushed into 2013. And so we're always adjusting our capital plans based on what the world looks like. So it's hard to predict long term, 3, 4 years from now, what that might look like because it really depends on global growth.","Matthew R. Wooten - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then from your customer base, 2012 seemed like a year that was a little light in terms of promotional activity. Have you received any indications that promotional activity will pick up in 2013, either from soda producers or beer producers?","John A. Hayes","I think it's too early for them to have a strong view of what they're going to be doing in the summer of 2013. That's probably better asked at the end of the first quarter just because it's January and they still have 4 to 6 months to when their big selling season really begins.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chris Manuel from Wells Fargo.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions for you. First, if we could talk a little bit about where you feel your utilization rates are in beverage. If you were to kind of walk around the globe and talk about China, Vietnam, Brazil, Europe, North America, et cetera, I know you talked about maybe seeing a little bit of growth in some of those regions, but you're not putting a lot of capacity in. So just trying to get a sense of where your utilization rates are.","John A. Hayes","Yes, you often hear us talk about trying to make sure that our supply matches our demand, and that's exactly what we do. In North America, I think we even said this on the third quarter, in 2013, we're real tight with the closure of the Columbus facility. And so I think we're -- our utilization rates are, are very high there. In China, they also are very high, and that's the reason why I said in 2013, while the market's probably going to grow a little bit stronger than we are because where the pricing is, we want to make sure the pricing is right relative to the cans that we sell. And so we do have a little bit of line speedups here and there that's part of that carry-in capital Scott was mentioning. But nothing significant and we're keeping a very close eye because there is a fair amount of overcapacity from an industry perspective, but you don't see it in the Ball system. Brazil, obviously, we're adding a new line there, and so we're running full out there. And then in Europe, I said on the third quarter that longer term, we would expect to look at some capacity there. But in the short term, we're focusing on costs, and that's exactly where we are going into 2013. The market grew mid-single digits in 2012. We expect about the same in 2013. That's going to make us very tight in Europe as well.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And I guess my follow-up with this is, you're going to be spending --  [indiscernible] the math question -- you're going to be spending about $200 million in return-oriented, growth-oriented capital this year. Can you maybe -- I know it's going to be a long list of projects, but could you kind of bucket maybe a few categories or maybe by segments where a lot of that capital is going? Is most of it targeted to beverage? Is most of it targeted to speedups or is it aerosol capacity or other different pieces like that?","Scott C. Morrison","Well, it's where the growth is, Chris. It is specialty cans in North America and in Brazil -- John mentioned an additional line down in Brazil. We're finishing up some things from last year, some speedups that we were doing in different places. We're seeing nice growth in aluminum aerosol. We think there's opportunities with the Mexico acquisition, to add capacity there. So it's in a variety of places.","John A. Hayes","Yes, the only thing I'd add on to that, in North America, we are adding specialty capability in some of our standout -- standard 12-ounce facilities, and that's one of the reasons why that carry-in capital's large, but most -- actually all that volume is contracted already. And so it's good return projects.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question, just getting to the guidance around Americas, Asia being flat for this year. Could you give us a sense, just between North America, China, Brazil, how to think about that? I mean, is it fair to say North America down, China flat, Brazil up? Or just give us a rough sense of how you're thinking about it.","John A. Hayes","We normally don't break that out, but I think your intuition is generally correct.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And the reason I'm driving at this question is it kind of comes back towards this long-term guidance goal of the 10% to 15%. Clearly, there's some transitional elements to 2013 related to the business lost in North America. So I'm just trying to get a sense of hypothetically, if we have 8% EPS growth this year. There's a certain element to that, that should come back just as we lap that. I'm trying to just kind of calibrate how to think about that.","John A. Hayes","Maybe from a contextual perspective, we can help create some sort of bridge here. We talked about Americas and Asia being relatively flat. Europe, depending on what happens there, there ought to be a little bit of upside in Europe. But obviously, with the economic conditions there, it's premature to bank on that. Our food and household products business ought to be up. We had a very difficult 2012, and our folks performed very well there. How much up is a question of what the harvest looks like. And then we have the new Mexican facility, the impact extruded business that contributes to that. And the European impact extruded business, we continue to do reasonably well there. And then on the aerospace, we don't expect much upside at all in that business, particularly in light of the uncertainty around sequestration. And then the corporate, I don't -- Scott said it was going to be relatively flat. So that provides coordinate income of up in the low single-digit range. And through the use of our cash flow, it gets up to the -- that's where we think we have a shot towards the lower end of our long-term goals.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got you. Okay, that's very helpful. And then just on China, I mean, you did make the comment, I believe, Ray did on the last call, that volume would be up, and you'd be kind of clawing back to negative price in 2013. So I mean, do you think China, specifically, will grow earnings this year? Or how do you think about that?","John A. Hayes","I think it's going to be challenging, too. As we said, we've retarded any meaningful growth cap on that area, and so we expect our volumes to be at or slightly below what the market's going to be doing. And I think given the pricing challenges, it is going to be a bit difficult. Now having said that, let's put this in context. There's overcapacity of 20% to 25% in Asia. It is growing in the mid-teens. And so that's 18, maybe 24 months of excess capacity. And so as we're looking into 2014, it's about getting our pricing in a position as we go into 2014 where we have a lot of operational leverage.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. I guess the last question is just around the volume growth outlook for China. I think at some point this year, the growth rate had been slowing to something below mid-teens. So could you give us a sense of where that reacceleration may be occurring, what end markets specifically?","John A. Hayes","Yes, I do think it's across most of the end markets in China. I think the slowdown was largely weather-related. As I mentioned, it was extremely cold. But we have a pretty good handle on where can filling capacity is going in on the beer side, on the CSD side, on the tea side, on the energy side. And as a result of that, we continue to see the overall market being -- growing in the double-digit range.","Operator","Our next question, from the line of Philip Ng from Jefferies & Co.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Europe, at least actually on a bev can side, actually grew at a mid-single-digit rate, which is pretty healthy. But your comments for 2013 sound like you're generally a little more cautious. So you're expecting a little slower growth on the bev can side with tougher comps or just the macro?","John A. Hayes","No, not particularly. I think you're parsing our words a little bit more than we intended. We -- as we said, we grew mid-single digits for the year in that. Now remember, it was an even-numbered year, and so there are some special summer things going on in terms of European Cup, the Olympics, that we're not going to have in 2013. But where we see the -- we still see low- to mid-single-digit growth in the European market.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So from a pricing standpoint, things were -- you've seen some erosion, but sounds like the market's tightened up a bit. So how should we be thinking about pricing in Europe for 2013?","Scott C. Morrison","I don't think -- I think we've hit the trough. We talked about price, some of the price pressure, but that's why we're focused on internally on things we can control on the cost side and not adding capacity until we get the price equation a little bit better.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. But you guys haven't settled out your contracts on pricing, because I thought you guys typically settled out year end of 2012.","John A. Hayes","Yes, we've largely settled out, and what I would say is relative to 3 months ago when we were on the call, the pricing environment is a touch more healthy in Europe than it was.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I know it's early in the year, but you guys were commenting on the pack, you're expecting a more normalized pack. What about demand for aerosol?","John A. Hayes","Go ahead, Scott.","Scott C. Morrison","Yes, demand for aluminum aerosol is very strong. For tinplate aerosol last year, it was -- kind of bounced around. The fourth [ph] quarter [ph] was very good. But overall, we feel pretty good about the aerosol business.","John A. Hayes","Yes, I think long term, the steel, the tinplate aerosol business here in North America at least, is probably 0% to 2% growth type of market, GDP type growth, and we don't expect any meaningful changes in that.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the steel tinplate side, anything to think about for 2013 with holding gains and all that stuff?","Scott C. Morrison","No, it should be relatively flat. There's not much going around on either way.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Adam Josephson from KeyBanc.","Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Are there any regulatory developments that particularly concern you, for instance, the potential for minimum pricing in Britain, the tax increase on beer in France or otherwise?","John A. Hayes","We're always facing regulatory issues and not only in -- for Ball Corporation, but I think business at large. I think on a global scale, regulation is only increasing, not decreasing. And so as we sit there, the things that you mentioned, those things don't concern us of anything in materiality -- from a materiality point of view. And so I would say, based on the things that you mentioned, no.","Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just, John, the acquisition pipeline. How would you compare it to what it's looked like in previous quarters? And what areas might you be looking at most closely?","John A. Hayes","Yes, I don't think it's all that different than over the past, certainly past 6, 12 months. We continue to see opportunities in metal packaging, whether it's on the aluminum impact extruded business, the beverage can business. Just think last year, we did something in the beverage can business, we did something in the aluminum impact extruded business as well. And I think those types of things, whether they're small or a bit larger are still out there, and we keep our nose to the grindstone in making sure that we have a good understanding of what's going on and what, well, candidly, we're willing to pay for some of those assets.","Operator","Our next question, from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","First question has to do with the specialty can business, which obviously is really carrying the day in terms of growth in North America. And yet, it seems like from just what I've heard that in Europe, the specialty can business where it's been more of a presence for a longer period of time doesn't really share the same margin and growth spreads to standard cans like we see here. And so I just want to know if that's what you all see. And secondly, do you see a time where the specialty segment here in North America might slow down or we might see some margin compression versus the 12-ounce?","John A. Hayes","Yes, I think in Europe, you are right, it's been around longer, but we still had good growth in 2012. I don't have the number off the top of my head, but I know at the end of the third quarter, it was around 8% or so. So it's above the market growth and certainly not what we've seen in North America. I do think that when you have line changeovers and other things, that it adds a bit of complexity into the system. And we need to get paid for that complexity. And so I don't think that necessarily changes. To your point, North America around the slowdown of specialty growth, yes, it's obviously, at some point in time, the base gets bigger and the growth slows down. But many of the fast-moving consumer goods companies, whether it's on the beer side, whether it's on the CSD side or even some other categories, energy, those types of things, they're continuing to look for ways to add value into the products that they sell. And they're finding good value in terms of the specialty cans that we produce, and that's why we've been seeing the growth.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Got you. And then sort of as a follow-on, sort of looking beyond the very near term in China -- that's sort of been discussed quite a bit already. But if we go back to, say, 15 months ago when we were out in Colorado and we were talking about the long-term for Ball and for the business, one thing that really struck -- jumped out was, at least to me, was how beer, only about 5% is -- was at that time in cans in China, whereas it was 38% in Brazil and I think over 50% here in North America. And it would seem -- do you think that there is a, if you will, a slower adoption rate than you thought? Or do you think -- do you continue to see a reason why you wouldn't see the can in beer adopted in China in increasing measure like we've seen in all these other places?","John A. Hayes","Yes, nothing fundamentally has changed there. It really gets into as new capacity is brought on are they putting bottle capacity or can capacity? And we see a fair amount of can capacity coming on. Remember, it's -- the China beer market is such a large market that I know even now, as we sit here a year ago -- a year later, it's up to 6%, 6.5%, which isn't a huge number percentage terms, but in terms of volume, that's where a lot of the growth is coming from. And so will it ever get to the 50% that we see in North America? That's a stretch, obviously. But I do think based on the conversations we have with our customers and seeing where they're putting their capital, that we expect to see over the long term, a continued increase in the penetrations of cans into the beer market.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay. And then lastly, it's -- your CapEx number is a bit elevated for '13. Where do you think that would trend in '14 and '15? Let's say if you do get the kind of year you're planning for right now, and of course, we know things can change. But if it turns out to be net income up in the low single digits and EPS up close to 10%, do you think that CapEx number would likely rise? Or I mean, if -- still trail off or could it stay where it is or rise?","Scott C. Morrison","Well, we always think that it will get closer back towards depreciation because you don't have as good a visibility on some of the growth opportunities. So it's really dependent on how fast those growth opportunities materialize and how many there are. The world's slowing down, and frankly, if you asked us that same question last year, we thought it would come down this year. But we had so much carry-in capital that you really got to look at the 2 years in total versus just 1 year. So over time, we think it would come down a bit because when you're going through bigger growth spurts when we're building plants, that takes a lot more capital. When you could add new lines like we're doing in Alagoinhas, the incremental capital isn't as much.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","The planned cost reductions that you have for North America from the capacity closures, how do you see that flowing through the business through the year?","Scott C. Morrison","Well, we said the Columbus facility was closed at the end of the year, and the Gainesville facility is going to continue to operate for a little bit into this -- into 2013. So you'll start to get those benefits as we move later into the year.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And so some of the cost reduction is going to flow into '14?","Scott C. Morrison","No, the cost -- all this will be -- you're going to start seeing all the benefit here as we move into the year.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just on the pension, did you guys update us on where the pension plan ended up and what you see your pension expense contribution to be for '13?","Scott C. Morrison","Yes, we ended up funding quite a bit more than expense in '12, about $60 million more than expense in '12, just because the cash flow was so strong. In 2013, we think we'll fund about $20 million more in funding versus expense.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of George Staphos, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wondered if -- peer in a little bit more to the extent possible on the Americas profitability and the progression you expect there. If you consider the cost reductions that should help you this year and also the additional volume in specialty cans, is there a way to ballpark how much that might help you this year relative to the ultimate volume loss that you suffered going into 2013?","John A. Hayes","George, you're getting to a level of granularity that I wish we could be as specific as possible. But the reality is when you think about it, let's take a step back. For that segment going into 2013, we've closed the Columbus facility. As Scott just said, we expect to get the fixed cost benefits from that, that offset a lot of the variable margin that we had from the lost business. As we go into the second quarter and with the final closedown of Gainesville, we'll start to reap all of that. And then the second half the year, we're going to have the second line in Alagoinhas come up. And so when you think about all those things, I think we're going to have -- as the year goes on, we're going to have more momentum going into that segment, all things being equal.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Is it possible that within North America, if there's a way to parse that, that your EBIT might actually be flat considering the incremental margin from specialty and the cost reductions, which you said are more or less offsetting the variable margin on the volume loss? Or is that a heroic expectation at this juncture given where you sit?","John A. Hayes","Well, that's the trough that we're faced, and in my prepared remarks, that's why I said, well, it's a trough, but we're clawing out of it. And it's only January, George. So let's talk later in the year to see how specialty goes. But we have a reasonable shot, and that's what we said on the third quarter. And as Scott said, our outlook on that really hasn't changed materially.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Understand, guys. Just wanted to get a little bit more color -- or granularity, as you said. The last question I had is if we are having this conference call 3 years from now and we can project forward the aerosol business for Ball Corporation, do you see it being as meaningful a business as -- or it's not going to ever be as large as your beverage can business, but will we be talking with it -- about it in almost the same tone as a significant driver of your growth and future profitability? Is it that strategic to you and how do you see that evolving? Sorry for the broad question there, but I think it's an interesting element to your story longer term.","John A. Hayes","Yes, it's obviously from -- let's talk about from an overall market size perspective. It is significantly smaller than the 270-odd-billion beverage cans around the world. We're talking in the range of upper-single-digit billions of units. So obviously, it's not going to have that. But the business model is quite different because the capital and output ratios are quite different than the beverage can business. I would not expect 3 years from now to be talking it in the same size and tone of the beverage can business for Ball Corporation. But I will tell you this, we continue to have good growth opportunities. Some of that carry-in capital Scott was mentioning is in the impact extruded business. And so as that market continues to grow, we're going to be focused on it.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Last one on this -- John, do you see that business broadly offering different types of metal packages than what it's doing right now, which is aluminum extruded aerosol cans? Are there opportunities to take that technology as it's used to some degree already in beverage into food applications and to other end markets? How would you have us consider that?","John A. Hayes","Well, I do think over the next several years, George, the greater opportunity is not so much in food, but probably beverage. Just think about what we've done with Alumi-Tek. It's been a year [ph] in North America and it's been quite successful. And we have a whole suite of bottles now, ranging from a DWI bottle, the Alumi-Tek all the way to the impact extruded and everything in between. Impact extruded is more relevant when you have smaller runs, and you have more differentiation, you can shape it. And the sizes of it, you can make a bit different than you can on something like the Alumi-Tek. But there are continued opportunities on the Alumi-Tek side as well. So does that answer your question?","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, that was great. I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question is another follow-up from Chris Manuel from Wells Fargo.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to focus on the aerospace business, if I could for a second. As you look at the mix of business there, and I know you've told us this or disclosed this in the past and I just don't remember, the mix of business between, let's call it department -- or DOD or different elements in there, can you remind us of that?","John A. Hayes","Yes, more than 50% of it is in the DOD business. And when you partial that out, the preponderance of it are in the big, I would call it, strategic programs, satellites and things like that. And we do have a couple of other businesses in terms of the tactical products, antennas and other things for everything from the Joint Strike Fighter to other applications like that. And then we also have a services business that takes all that information and turns it into usable data. But like I said, 50% -- probably 50%, 60% of our aerospace business is directly DOD.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And as you think about full year 2013 versus 2012, and I appreciate there's some -- a little issue that might come up in midyear here that could impact things. How would you anticipate '13 might look versus '12? I mean you had some -- it looked some pretty good payments come in in 4Q that may or may not repeat next year. But could you maybe give us a sense of can it be a flat year for EBIT? Or do you think you could still have a little improvement? Or is it just too difficult to look at right now?","John A. Hayes","It really is really difficult to look at right out just because with the potential for sequestration out there. I will point out that at this time last year, our backlog was -- upper 800s, $890 million or so, and we're well over $1 billion right now. And so that just goes to show why we keep saying long term, we feel pretty good about this business. But as I said in my prepared remarks, because of the sequestration, it could be a bit more lumpy than we're used to. But we just don't have visibility into that yet.","Operator","We have another follow-up question from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just on the working capital front. You guys have done a really solid job here for 2 years in a row, and I'm just curious, Scott, how you're planning for that in that guidance for 2013 free cash flow.","Scott C. Morrison","Yes, really, all the guys have done a great job on the working capital front, whether it's managing inventories better, collecting receivables better, extending payable terms. It's been a really broad effort that a lot of people have been involved in and it's worked very well. We think there's still a little more to go on the working capital front in '13. We're still not where we think we need to be longer term, so we think there's still a little bit more upside in that. It should be a source in '13. How big I don't know.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. Okay, okay. And then just on the pension, you said it's $20 million contribution in excess of the expense. Is that just for the U.S. plan or is that the total? Like what's the absolute dollar there?","Scott C. Morrison","That's total, that's total.","Operator","Mr. Hayes, we have no further questions at this time, sir. I'll be turning the call back to you.","John A. Hayes","Okay, great. Thank you, all, and thank you, all, for participating. And we look forward to what will hopefully be a challenging but productive 2013. And we'll talk to you all on the April call. Thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Have a great day, everyone."],"2735":["Ball Corporation (NYSE:BLL) Q1 2015 Earnings Conference Call April 30, 2015 11:00 AM ET","Executives","John Hayes - Chairman, President & CEO","Scott Morrison - SVP & CFO","Analysts","George Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Ghansham Panjabi - Baird","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","Philip Ng - Jefferies","Tyler Langton - JPMorgan","Adam Josephson - KeyBanc","Chris Manuel - Wells Fargo","Anthony Pettinari - Citibank","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets","Al Kabili - Macquarie","Debbie Jones - Deutsche Bank","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs","Operator","Welcome to the Ball Corporation First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hayes, CEO. Please go right ahead, sir.","John Hayes","Thank you, Tommy and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's first quarter 2015 results.","The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings as well as the company news releases. If you do not already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at Ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website.","With regard to Ball's proposed offer for Rexam and consistent with the requirements of the UK Takeover Code, we will limit our comments regarding the transaction to three areas. Number one, what has already been made public via the 2.7 release. Number two, where we're in the regulatory process. And number three, an update of ongoing economic hedging and debt activities related to the proposed transaction.","Also note that there may be certain limitations regarding the depth of our business commentary and certain other items we would normally discuss on a quarterly earnings conference call due to the nature of the proposed transaction and UK takeover rules.","Given the nature of our proposed offer, today's issued press release, webcast and conference call are advertisements and should not be considered a prospectus. Investors should not make any investment decisions in relation to the new Ball shares issued in connection with the Rexam transaction except on the basis of information in the prospectus and the scheme documents which are proposed to be published in due course.","This presentation and transcription of comments are not for release in whole or in part in, into or from any jurisdiction where to do so would constitute a violation of the relevant laws of such jurisdictions. For more information on Ball's proposed acquisition of Rexam, visit the quote offer for Rexam page on www.Ball.com.","Now, joining me on the call today is Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'll provide a brief overview of our company's performance, Scott will discuss financial and global packaging metrics and I will then finish up with comments on our aerospace business and the outlook for 2015.","We've had a pretty challenging start to the year as the headwinds we acknowledged in early February around earnings translation, aluminum premiums, project startup costs and tough volume comps in North American food and Brazil all played out in our first quarter results. While not unexpected, they were a bit more pronounced given the first quarter is traditionally a seasonally slow quarter. Scott will go into more detail in terms of quantifying what we believe are transitory costs and headwinds.","I will note, however, that our businesses are fundamentally sound with the majority of the headwinds coming from currency translation, metal premia in Europe and startup costs from our various projects. In total, these headwinds represent $0.16 per share in the quarter.","Overriding these challenges are the investments we're making to operationally and strategically position Ball for future growth. As everyone who follows us knows, on February 19 we announced a proposed offer for Rexam PLC that has been unanimously recommended by its Board of Directors.","While we continue to make progress on the process around the proposed acquisition of Rexam -- I'll provide a brief update later -- we're very focused on maximizing the value of what we currently do and have quite a number of opportunities that are at various levels of investment, whether it is the next-generation aluminum bottle shaping technology in North America for a customer under a long term contract which is coming online this quarter; the new Oss, Netherlands specialty beverage can line that is just coming on stream and the recently announced addition of our and manufacturing capacity in our existing Lublin, Poland facility.","The construction of the recently announced Monterrey, Mexico two-line aluminum beverage can facility with the majority of its capacity secured under a long term customer contract which will start up in the first half of 2016; the construction of a new beverage can plant in Myanmar that is scheduled to begin in early 2016; a new U.S. tinplate aerosol can manufacturing technology that will begin commercial production mid-year, expanding our aluminum impact extruded container business in the UK and the construction of a new aluminum impact extruded aerosol facility in India, both of which we expect to begin production later this year; or the chasing of several billion dollars of outstanding commercial and governmental opportunities in our aerospace business.","As we move through 2015, we remain focused on ramping up these capital projects and profitably growing our business. We're investing in our future, focused on continuous improvement, growing our cash flow and adhering to our historical disciplined, EVA-based capital allocation model, at the same time making investments which are largely tied to long term customer commitments.","Regarding the Rexam transaction, we're in the midst of the various regulatory reviews around the various jurisdictions and our conversations with the regulators are going as expected. We have received an anticipated second request from the FTC in the U.S. and discussions are ongoing with the European and Brazilian regulators. We will keep you updated as and when there are material facts to discuss.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott for a review of our first quarter numbers. Scott?","Scott Morrison","Thanks, John. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share for the first quarter 2015 were $0.69 versus last year's $0.81. As John alluded to, three main factors contributed to lower results in the quarter. $10 million after-tax or $0.07 of unfavorable currency effects largely due to a weaker euro. An aluminum premium headwind of $0.06 and $0.03 of start-up costs associated with over $200 million of growth capital projects coming online in the first half of 2015.","In addition, the previously disclosed loss of the major food can customer North America and anticipated lower year-over-year beverage can demand in Brazil following last year's World Cup were also factors. To sum up what will likely be a question during Q&A, we continue to anticipate significant free cash flow generation in 2015 in the range of $600 million excluding cash costs associated with the Rexam transaction.","It is expected that our dividend will remain unchanged during the proposed acquisition process and we're not precluded from acquiring Ball stock during this process; however, the allocation of capital towards share repurchases will be opportunity dependent.","For the full year 2015, here's an update on certain financial metrics. CapEx should be in the range of $400 million as project dollars are spent on schedule. Interest expense will be roughly $147 million excluding debt refinancing and other costs. The effective tax rate now is expected to be just over 27% and corporate undistributed will increase closer to $90 million due to deferred comp costs related primarily to the retirement from long-standing Board members and the deferral of their stock which will hit in the second quarter and then corporate undistributed should decline to less than $20 million quarterly run rate thereafter.","In February, the company entered into GBP3.3 billion sterling unsecured bridge loan agreement to provide financing necessary to pay the cash portion of the proposed offer for Rexam and we also entered into a new $3 billion revolving credit facility to replace the existing $1.1 billion bank credit facility we had, redeem the 2020 and 2021 senior notes and provide ongoing liquidity for the company.","The redemption of the 6.75% and 5.75% bonds totaling $1 billion resulted in a pretax charge of $57.5 million in the first quarter. Also in the first quarter, we entered into economic hedges to reduce currency exchange rate exposure associated with the British pound denominated cash portion of the announced acquisition for Rexam.","And also entered into derivative financial instruments to mitigate exposure to interest-rate changes associated with anticipated debt issuances also in connection with the cash portion of this proposed transaction. Details on these economic hedges are provided in note 2 of today's earnings release.","As a heads up and given the size of the proposed offer for Rexam, these economic hedges can and likely will cause disruption to quarterly GAAP earnings and could accumulate to a sizable figure given currency rate volatility and the projected timeline associated with the proposed transaction. We will continue to break out these items to provide as much transparency as possible.","As a result of all the debt-related activity in the quarter, net balance sheet debt at the end of the first quarter was approximately $3.3 billion. Credit quality and liquidity of the company remains quite strong with comparable EBITDA to interest coverage of 5.6 times and net debt to comparable EBITDA at 2.8 times. The company has enough committed credit and available liquidity at quarter end to consummate the proposed Rexam transaction and to provide ongoing liquidity for the company.","For a complete summary of first quarter 2015 results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis and details regarding the first quarter, please refer to the notes section of today's earnings release which includes the simplified table format summarizing business consolidation activities.","Now moving to operations. Our metal beverage Americas and Asia segment comparable earnings for the first quarter of 2015 were flat year over year with excellent North American performance offsetting difficult comps in Brazil following last year's World Cup where our volume was down mid to high single digits in the quarter. As we commented in the earnings release, China volumes were up in the period while profitability was relatively flat year over year due to lower pricing in the region.","Within the segment, we're orienting growth capital to serve the growing demand for specialty and beer packaging in northern Mexico. The majority of the new Monterrey plant's capacity is under a long term contract and the plant will ramp up in the first half of 2016.","European beverage comparable earnings were down just over $26 million in the first quarter as unfavorable earnings translation accounted for roughly half of the decline. $8 million of aluminum premium headwinds and $3 million of start-up costs associated with the Oss and Lublin capital projects outweighed relatively flat volumes in the quarter.","As I said in February, on a constant currency basis, we expect European beverage operating earnings to increase in 2015 as the aluminum premium headwinds and start-up costs ease second half of 2015.","Food and household comparable segment earnings were down in the quarter as segment volumes declined midteens following the well telegraphed customer shift in U.S. food cans. Excluding this customer shift, our volumes were flat versus industry volumes down mid-single digits through February. The segment was also impacted by a couple million dollars unfavorable earnings translation related to the European aluminum aerosol business.","Our global extruded aluminum product line continues to perform at a high level and global aerosol volumes have held up well year to date. We continue to focus on improving manufacturing performance, ramping up the next generation steel aerosol can manufacturing technology and further growing the extruded aluminum businesses in Europe and India. There will continue to be difficult quarter-over-quarter comps in the food and household segment throughout 2015 related to the customer shift.","In summary, our global packaging businesses are focused on executing on an extraordinary amount of capital and systems projects. It's an exciting time and an amazing amount of effort is being put into improve an already exceptional set of assets. Thank you to everyone at the plants and the folks that support them at the corporate level.","With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.","John Hayes","Great. Thanks, Scott. Our aerospace business reported a solid quarter given the difficult comps they were up against. Contracted backlog ended the quarter at $714 million and anticipated reduction year over year as we await word on program bids that are in process.","Our capabilities and products are well positioned as affordable solutions and there are a number of awards that we expect to take place throughout 2015. The employee base at aerospace continues to perform exceptionally well on existing programs and just this month was awarded its third consecutive Boeing supplier award for high performance avionics as well as a silver Supplier Excellence award and a business management award from Raytheon for our work in the tactical products area.","Now looking out across our company today, we have a lot of execution in front of us now and in the future to reap the rewards of the capital projects coming online in the second half of 2015 and early 2016 as well as reaching completion on the proposed offer for Rexam. In the near-term, our businesses are generating significant free cash flow. From a comparable net earnings perspective versus 2014, the best we can do is offset everything other than the currency affects that are expected to continue through the rest of 2015.","While metal premiums and startup costs will persist as headwinds in the in the second quarter and currency translation will remain a headwind for the balance of the year, our business remains solid. Everyone at the company is working hard day and night and day in and day out improve Ball for the long term benefit of our fellow shareholders.","And with that, Tommy, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We will have our first question with George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Go ahead.","George Staphos","I'll ask two questions and turn it over. John, to the extent that you can comment on the Monterrey facility, the startup seems to be quite quick relative to the announced date. Now certainly, you're not novices in building beverage can plants but can you comment as to what hurdles may exist at all in building the Monterrey facility? Why it seems to be coming out so quickly? Can you comment at all in terms of the length of contract with the majority customer there? And then I had one quick follow-on. Thank you.","John Hayes","The reason why we're moving expeditiously on this is because the customer is in strong need of cans for their business. We have been working with them for a while on this so this is nothing new. I do think that the startup that we have all hands on deck with respect to it. We're moving dirt, we're starting to put in -- build the facility as we speak right now.","So while it may look like it's a quick start up, we're pretty confident that will be able to achieve that. With respect to the customer contract, I'd rather not go into detail other than to say it is a long term contract for their beverage can needs.","George Staphos","And then related beverage packaging question. Can you comment all in terms of the next technology in aluminum bottles, a new shape and size initiative that you have. Anything you could share here would be great and will turn it over.","John Hayes","Yes, George, whereas I mentioned I think in my comments and even on the February 5 call, we expected it to be starting up late in the first quarter\/early second quarter and that's exactly where we're. It is new technology so it always has its ups and downs. But as I said before, we have all hands on deck getting product into the warehouses so that we can sell to the customer as we move forward.","We're excited about the technology as it is a version 2.0 relative to the Alumi-Tek bottle and I think from a capability point of view, it's going to show the world that we're doing some pretty neat things in terms of aluminum bottle cans.","Operator","We will proceed to our next question, it's from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Go ahead.","Ghansham Panjabi","Just in light of where the first quarter shook out, can you just sort of give us an updated view on the 2015 volume outlook for your various end markets and geographies?","John Hayes","Yes, sure, Ghansham, let's start in North America -- let's start in the beverage can businesses. In North America I don't think we see any appreciable changes. What we're seeing is strong specialty growth and that's largely offsetting the standard 12-ounce container declines. I think the market was off in the first quarter almost 1%. We were off a touch more but nothing appreciably and it just had to do with timing of certain things.","The same trends that we've seen historically we continue to see here which is softer 12-ounce, stronger specialty, continued penetration in the beer category. But the overall beverage category is to be relatively flat to down. So the can is generally winning relative to other substrates.","I think in Europe, the market was up a couple of percent. We were roughly flat, up very slightly. But again it was first quarter. Recall that 2015 doesn't have any special events related to World Cups or European championships and so we expect a couple of percent growth in the European market. I will say that we're hand to mouth right now relative to cans as we enter into the summer. So the capacity is quite tightened. It's important that our folks are working well on getting the Oss capacity up on stream.","Down in Brazil, we were impacted this first quarter largely by customer mix. We service a customer that wasn't doing so well and another customer that we don't service was doing much better. So, we were down a little bit more to the market. But we had anticipated the overall market to be to be relatively flat for 2015 and I think that's exactly what we see. And so, we think our volumes will normalize as we go through the balance of 2015.","And then in Asia, as Scott had mentioned on the February 5 call, we're seeing good volume growth but unfortunately the pricing environment is very challenging, so it's really not contributing any more profits to where we're. And we expect the volumes to continue probably not as much as in the first quarter.","We had a little bit later of a Chinese New Year and so I think that helped out. We saw strong growth. The industry was up about 17% and so we don't expect that but certainly double-digit growth as we go into 2015, we would continue to expect. And then on the food and household product side, you know on the aerosol side, we're doing well both on the aluminum and the tinplate.","We were up kind of low- to mid-single digits in both of those categories. Europe was a little bit slow only because we're so tight in capacity and that's why we're putting new capacity in UK. And in the food can business, we talked about the declines. When you really strip out the customer that we lost, we were flat year over year and actually up slightly in the first quarter while the overall market was down.","But again, let's not forget that first quarter is a seasonally slow quarter. So as we look out to the balance of the year, nothing has changed appreciably relative to our volume expectations for the industry or our own business.","Ghansham Panjabi","Okay. And just one more if I could on the pending merger with Rexam and the timeline uncertainty associated with that. Has that made any difference, John, as it relates to customer churn in any region geographically so far? Thanks so much.","John Hayes","No, Ghansham, no it has not. Our contracts are usually multiyear by nature. Most of them were concluded in the fall to early winter last year, so it was prior to the Rexam announcements. We see no changes.","Operator","We will proceed to our next question, it's from the line of Chip Dillon, Vertical Research Partners. Go ahead.","Chip Dillon","When you look at the free cash flow guide of the year, Scott, you mentioned it would be excluding cash costs of hedges, etc. or involved in the acquisition of Rexam. And I guess, if we assume it doesn't close this year can you give us a range of what those cash costs could be?","Scott Morrison","That's not related to the hedges. What I meant were the transaction costs, the cash transaction costs that we will have. And this year is kind of hard to handicap, but they could be upwards of $40 million this year.","John Hayes","And Chip, those have to do with legal fees, it has to do with commitment fees, accounting, financial advisor fees, things like that.","Scott Morrison","The bulk of the fees get paid on the closing of the transaction, so all of that kind of flushes through at once.","Chip Dillon","I see. But that $40 million could occur before closing and this year, if closing is next year.","Scott Morrison","That's correct.","Chip Dillon","Okay and then I might have missed this, but could you give us a breakdown of the volumes in the Americas beverage segment in the first quarter by North America, Latin America and Asia?","John Hayes","Yes, actually I think I just went through it, but I'm happy to do it real quickly again. In North America, overall market was down about 1%. We were down slightly more than that but it just had to do with geography and mix. There's nothing appreciably different there.","In Brazil, the overall market is down a couple of percent, we were down a touch more than that mid- to upper-single digits. It largely had to do with our customer mix. We had a customer that wasn't performing as well relative to some others that we don't do business with.","And then in the Asia business it was up nicely double digits decently and the overall market was up 17%. As I mentioned also, unfortunately, it didn't really contribute to much to the improved profitability because the pricing has been quite challenging there.","Chip Dillon","Got you. And then just as a last one, I know on the last call you mentioned expected tax rate around 26%. Now it's a little over 27%. Is that just related to currency and the impacts there or are there other factors going on?","Scott Morrison","No, it's more just kind of the mix of earnings where we're making the money. We're making little bit more money in higher tax rate jurisdictions.","Operator","We will take our next question from the line of Philip Ng from Jefferies. Go ahead.","Philip Ng","Can you help frame the sensitivities in the metal premium to your EBIT and what is the lag I guess associated with the P&L? I would imagine you have some hedges. And at this point, if it stays flat, what is your expectation for aluminum premiums being a drag for 2015?","Scott Morrison","Well, it cost us $8 million in the first quarter. There really isn't a -- there really aren't hedges for this -- this is really European premium and there's just starting to be a market to be able to hedge those premiums but historically there has not been. So most of that -- it flows through and so it flows through timing wise more higher inventory will flow through.","So there is about a quarter lag probably to seeing lower prices from the decline in the premium. So that's why we say in the first quarter we had a big it, it will moderate in the second quarter and then we should be able to -- we should offset that kind of the drag that we've had in the first half of the year in the second half if the premiums continue on the trend they've been on.","Philip Ng","And I understand Constellation is pushing can't aggressively for the Corona business. How much of that new Monterrey capacity you bring on is actually coming back in the U.S. rather than Mexico? And are you guys ultimately displacing glass or other beverage cans suppliers selling to other brewers? And how does that margin profile stack up relative to your other businesses?","John Hayes","I would rather not specifically comment on the customer names and other things, but we do expect a fair number of those cans, given what our customers do, will be an export from Mexico.","And they have been building a very large, perhaps the largest brewery in the world and they've been doing quite well. And so, I think that should be helpful to us. I'm not sure I understood your question about margins. Were you talking about relative to glass and for that customer or--?","Philip Ng","No, just relative to the rest of your portfolio on the bev can side because you don't have a footprint in Mexico, at least based on my understanding.","John Hayes","No, but we're going to be servicing a lot of the quality and customer service out of our existing North American business. So just think about this as being a new plant and there's not tremendous amount of exist -- additional overhead built other than what would be at the plant level.","Philip Ng","Got you. But the margin profile then I guess would be comparable to what you're generating in North America? Is that good way to think about it?","John Hayes","Yes, said another way, it generates the economics returns that we look for.","Philip Ng","Okay. And just one last one for me, I guess for Scott. You know you are off to a slower start to the year and part of that is FX and somewhat off issues. What are some of the levers you guys are pulling to be able to hit that $600 million free cash flow number. Thanks.","Scott Morrison","Yes, the earnings are little bit softer, but we said coming into this year, it's really not that different from where we sat in February we did the call. We expect working capital to be another source of cash flow this year and we continue to believe that. So that's where it's coming from.","John Hayes","And let's not forget some of the earnings -- the earnings shortfall related to currency translation, that is a noneconomic -- that is not necessarily cash, that's just translation of earnings from, in this case, euros to dollars. So that doesn't necessarily have an appreciable impact on cash flow.","Operator","Now we go to our next question from the line of Tyler Langton with JPMorgan. Go ahead.","Tyler Langton","Just with Oss, should the startup costs start to move a fair amount lower as we head through the year?","Scott Morrison","Yes, we expect that. Oss is up and running producing cans now and you know there's a learning curve to that. And then for Lublin we're putting in another end module there and hired the people for that. And so that will move. But as you get through this -- kind of into the second half of the year a lot of those costs should dissipate or should reduce.","Tyler Langton","And then just in terms of productivity, obviously, that was a big help for Europe in 2014. Just looking for 2015, can you just share some thoughts on sort of productivity cost-out gains that you think you could get both in Europe and North America?","Scott Morrison","On the Europe side, they continue to make good progress on cost-out. It's a little bit of a mixed bag right now because you are ramping up costs to deal with the new line and the new end module. But if you take a step back from that they're still doing a good job of taking cost out. And North America is always on that plan of always maximizing, reducing costs. The performance in North America has been very solid because of that.","Tyler Langton","And then just with Asia, I think you said it was up double digits. Is that a lot just from timing? And then can that rate -- what sort of rate are you looking for, for the rest of the year? And then just given your capacity, can you continue to grow with the market?","John Hayes","You know, we're going to get a point where we've been -- the first quarter was a lot stronger than we thought and we're not investing in China because we don't think it could be the pricing environment is such that we could make the returns that would we would require as part of that.","So I would expect the from an industry perspective we still see strong beverage can growth. I think it will moderate a little bit. As I said, we were helped by the Chinese New Year, the timing of Chinese New Year this year. The overall beer market is relatively flat China. But you are seeing very good can penetration growth rates and that's what's been driving it, particularly on the high-end of the beer category in China. But, as I said also, we're not going to be investing unless we can make economic returns.","So, we're going to start to hit capacity utilization issues probably later on this year. And I certainly hope, although we have not seen it yet, that the supply-demand situation will tighten up to a point where pricing gets more moderated.","Operator","And we will turn to our next question from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Go ahead.","Adam Josephson","Scott, one more on the premiums. At current prices, you said you might get back in the second half what you expect to lose in the first half. Would you expect a reasonable benefit in the first half of next year as well, again at current prices?","Scott Morrison","It's a lot of assumptions in that question. So, yes, if prices stay lower it would be helpful in 2016.","Adam Josephson","By roughly the same amount that it would be a drag on the first half of this year roughly?","Scott Morrison","Yes, that's fair estimation.","Adam Josephson","Okay, just a couple of others. John and Scott, you talked about the growth projects, $200 million or so that you are spending on them. Is there any way to give us a rough sense as to the eventual benefits that you expect from those projects once they are fully ramped up?","John Hayes","Well, you know they're all different. But if you just say Ball is in EVA company and it expects to make at least 9% after-tax -- obviously, at the weight average, the tax rate, but call it 15% pretax on $200 million of capital. So that's what? $30 million of EBIT and that's probably a minimum benchmark that we would look towards.","Adam Josephson","And just one on the proposed transaction with Rexam. Assuming it closes is with limited divestitures, can you give us a rough sense as to what your currency exposures would be, euro, ruble, etcetera, as a total company?","Scott Morrison","It would move this is a total company to probably 50% U.S. dollar, 50% rest of the world currencies with the rest of the world currencies a big chart -- the vast majority is euro. Rubles and things like that are really small. Right now, for Rexam, I think there about 5% of revenues so on a combined business it's 2% or 3%; sterling kind of the same thing, 2% or 3%. So the vast majority is euro and dollar.","Operator","And we will move to our next question from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo. Go ahead.","Chris Manuel","Just a couple of questions for you, first on some stuff on Monterrey and then the second on aluminum premium. But with respect to Monterrey, will both lines be on stream in 2016 or is that staggered one line 2016, one coming after? And are you shipping to that customer today from facilities in North America or is this all incremental volume to you?","John Hayes","First, both lines will not be coming up at the same time, but they will be -- we're putting them in at the same time. One will start up and then shortly thereafter, probably a quarter, maybe two quarters beyond that, the second line will start up. And then with your other question, yes, we currently are shipping certainly not near the level that we will be manufacturing. But as they start to ramp up, we're seeding volume for them.","Chris Manuel","And then with the aluminum premium question, Scott, can you maybe give us a sense of -- this it's kind of a follow-up to Adam's question. But absent -- it sounds like this year is going to end up being somewhat neutral without the first half benefit in the second half. Maybe if you think of it cumulative, the last two, three, four years, how much of a hit that you haven't recovered do you feel you've had to endure, specifically to aluminum premium?","Scott Morrison","Let's say even if we were recover what we gave up -- what we give up in the first half of the year in the second half of the year, that premium is still at an elevated level what it was back in 2013.","Chris Manuel","Yes.","Scott Morrison","And so the premium appears to be heading back to kind of that 2013 level or below. So I would say this more upside to that. How much, I'm not going to predict at this point.","Chris Manuel","No, that's not what I'm trying to get at. I guess what I'm trying to understand is if you -- how much of a hit did you have in 2014? How much was the hit in 2013, etcetera, that you're still technically or not technically but cumulatively behind?","Scott Morrison","It's still going to be north in 2014. I think we've said it's going to be \u20ac15 million.","Chris Manuel","Right.","Scott Morrison","In 2013, it was \u20ac8 million and that was off of the 2012 number, right? So I think there's more to go.","Operator","We will get to our next question from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citibank. Go ahead.","Anthony Pettinari","Just a follow-up on the last question. With premium last year, there was a lot of talk about the need to fix contracts in Europe past along the premium and now I guess those calls have died down. Regardless of where the premium is week to week, is it a long term priority to get contracts in Europe more in line with North America so that you can pass along premium or are you thinking that this as kind of a big issue that seems like it may be resolved or is not going to be a long term problem as you look out to the rest of the year in 2016 and 2017?","John Hayes","I was going to say I think strategically we're not in the business to be taking risks that are not in our control. And so this is something that for many, many years the European premium really didn't move at all. So it was never viewed as a risk.","I think starting in 2013, we started to identify it. We have been trying to take the necessary actions to derisk our business, but we work in a very competitive environment. And so, you can do certain things with certain customers if they agree to and if they have alternatives, you're not able to do those types of things.","So it is our strategic intent to reduce the risk of things we can't control in our business. That may be a bit cryptic but that's another way of saying we're trying to work with our customers on this.","Scott Morrison","I would say the one addition to that, the difference now versus where we sat a year ago or two years ago is there is a developing market to be able to hedge that premium. And so when you enter into contracts going forward, while it is still a relatively new market it appears that you'll have an ability to hedge that premium. So, I would agree with all of John's comments. The new fact is the ability to hedge it potentially which can also reduce that volatility.","Anthony Pettinari","And then just switching to Americas. In North America, on the specialties side you had a competitor that faced some margin compression in specialties last year. As you look at your specialty business in the Americas, understanding volumes appear to be fairly strong, would you describe your margins in specialties as stable? Are they up or down? And then you talked about an acquisition of a small easy-open end business, I think in Ohio. I was wondering if you could just give a little bit of color on that.","John Hayes","First with respect to specialty margins, we see no appreciable change to where our margins are. I think what you're referring to is from a competitor. That was on a specific size that while we participate in it, isn't a huge part of our portfolio and I think it was isolated to a competitive situation on that size.","With respect to the acquisition of the Sunoco Phoenix EZO end facilities, yes, we're quite excited about that. We didn't talk too much about it but it's a -- we brokered from EZO ends from the Sunoco Phoenix business for many, many years and, as the market continues to decide whether it's -- one year they're going strong in the EZO, the next year it is out. We thought it was a good value for us to get into that business.","At the end of the day the profitability of it isn't material to our Corporation and we didn't disclose it. It's nice but it's not material. So I don't think you'll see a huge change in that, but it does provide a capability that we were lacking in terms of our customer needs.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Go ahead.","Mark Wilde","On the Rexam call they mentioned that the German market seems to be picking up. Are you guys seeing much evidence of that?","John Hayes","Yes, we're. The overall German market in the first quarter was up, I think, around 15% or so largely driven by -- we've talked for years that the big breakthrough for Germany with likely be once the big discounters, all the [indiscernible] start to list cans and it was in the first quarter that both entities started listing it. So that's exciting.","I think as we look forward you should expect the German market to continue to grow. How quickly and whether or not it gets back to that 6 billion to 7 billion units it once was, it's premature to say that. But the key to it was getting distribution of cans throughout Germany and now that's in place.","Mark Wilde","And so John, right now, just to size, that market would be somewhere between 3.5 billion and 4 billion is that about right?","John Hayes","I think it's less than that. And again, you have to parse out what is consumed in Germany versus what is exported from Germany. And I think the consumed in Germany is much closer to about over between 1.5 billion and 2 billion units. Probably closer to 2 billion units. And then there's another billion or so, if not a little bit more, that are exported, filled and exported from Germany. What I was referring to really was the consumption in Germany.","Mark Wilde","Yes, okay. The other question I had is just going back to the third-quarter call. It sounded like you thought you would be getting some news on aerospace contracts somewhere around year-end. And it seems like out here at the end of April there's been some delay in some of those contracts being granted. Can you just update us?","John Hayes","Yes, you know there is really no update. We still have a tremendous amount of opportunities we're chasing. The backlog did go down a little bit, but nothing has changed in terms of the balance of 2015. I've long since abdicated the ability to predict when the timing of some of these things will happen, but I think the opportunities that longer term hasn't changed at all.","Operator","And we will get to our next question from the line of Al Kabili with Macquarie. Go ahead.","Al Kabili","Scott, I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of color on the hedges related to the proposed Rexam acquisition. Is there a specific sterling-U.S. dollar rate that you locked in with the hedges for the cash portion or maybe some sensitivities around exchange rate fluctuations there? Thanks.","Scott Morrison","There will be some color on it in the Q, but we really did most of this through various types of collar structures. So there's a range of rates. So there really isn't just one rate. And it was really to ensure that the economics on pretty close to the day we agreed to the deal that that's the economics that we'll end up with when we close the deal. So there really isn't just one rate that you can peg. But it will give a range in the Q as to what that range might be.","Al Kabili","Okay, all right, we'll look for that. And then also just on the bridging the decline in the Europe beverage earnings EBIT. Was there anything else besides the FX metal premiums and start-up costs that had weighed on first quarter results? Because by my math, excluding the cost you laid out, there was still may be of $5 million gap down year over year there.","John Hayes","A lot of it was timing is what I would say. Recall that on the February 5 call and maybe even the call back in October, we talked about pricing in Europe was a little bit more challenging than what we would've liked and so there was little bit of pricing, not huge, but a little bit.","So I wouldn't read too much into that. As Scott had said in his prepared remarks, we expect for the full-year 2015 on a constant currency basis that our profitability would be up in that segment.","Scott Morrison","Let me clarify on the math. It was down $26 million, $13 million of that was currency, $8 million of that was metal premium and $3 million was startup cost. So I get to $2 million. So the $2 million that John is talking about and maybe a little absorption is the $2 million.","John Hayes","Yes.","Al Kabili","And then related to that is just your share in Europe, did you see any appreciable change there? I know you had kind of underperformed the market a little bit. One of your peers outperformed significantly. I know there is some geographic differences and customer differences there. But how do you feel your share in Europe is tracking this year?","John Hayes","I think we expect to the full-year -- you really can't take the first quarter and extrapolate out because it's the seasonally slowest quarter. We lost a little bit of share in the first quarter, but it really just had to do with exactly what you said. It depends upon geography and where the weather is warm and where the weather is cold.","Our soft drink was a little bit stronger than we expected and our beer was little bit weaker than we expected and it had to do with the various geographies. We were a little bit softer in the UK than the overall market, but that just had to do with the customer mix we had there. We were, as we talked about, strong in Germany. In France, it was a little bit weaker but that had to do was soft drinks. So I wouldn't read too much into it.","Al Kabili","And then final question I guess, John, to the degree you can in this type of forum comment, but just in terms of the customer reaction to the proposed Rexam acquisition how you're feeling, if there's been any surprises there. Thanks.","John Hayes","Well, you know we did talk about this. On the February 19 call people had asked had we talked to customers at that time and the answer was no because we hadn't announced a transaction. We've been very actively engaged with our customers, not only as part of the regulatory approval process but it's an opportunity to really articulate what the benefits to the customer are to them in terms of broadening the geographic footprint, leveraging the innovation, ensuring the can is the most competitive from a cost point of view, sustainability, all those various things. ","And so when you ask is if there's surprises relative to the customer discussions we've been having, the short answer is no only because we had discussions with our customers about all those things in the past, broadening the footprint, sustainability, making sure we're as cost competitive as possible and leveraging our innovation.","Operator","And we will turn to our question which is from the line of Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank. Go ahead.","Debbie Jones","I wanted to talk a little bit about specialty cans. You mentioned this earlier. I'm just wondering how far do you think this trend can go maybe by region. I know Anthony asked about pricing, but this investment in general kind of generate the same return for you as it did maybe 3 to 5 years ago?","John Hayes","Well, you know people always try and categorize it as 12-ounce -- in North America, 12 ounce and specialty. And specialty is 20 plus different sizes. It's so we have to be careful when we describe it. And there's also maturity curves on each and every one size as time goes on.","What we're trying to do and have been successful in doing so far is to continue to be out front relative to different can sizes whether it's heights, whether it's diameters, whether it's the amount of product that goes in the container. So, let's be careful when we talk about specialty.","But specialty continues to grow. And just to get -- on the February 5 call, we said in 2014 it's reached about 28% of our portfolio. By my math in the first quarter it was 30% of our portfolio. We saw good growth in North America. We saw good growth in Europe. We saw very good growth off a very low base in Asia. We didn't have the growth in Brazil only because our volumes were down.","But what we've been seeing is here in North America, for example, we've been relatively flat over the last 18 if not a couple of years because the standard 12-ounce, largely in the soft drink segment, have been declining kind of mid-single digits and specialty has been growing double digits. And you combine those two on a weighted average basis and you get relatively flat.","Answering your question about the returns of new investments relative to 3 to 5 years ago, the biggest difference is that specialty is becoming of a size now that we're dedicating lines to specialty formats, where in the past our investments were much smaller because it was converting 12-ounce lines to specialty containers.","And any time you have a conversion the returns are probably a little bit better there because you're not putting in bricks and mortar and other things like that. But having said that, the investments we're making and specialty in terms of new capacity in bricks and mortar, we're still satisfied what the returns there.","Debbie Jones","And my final question, just could you just comment on pricing in China whether you're going to be more or less optimistic about the strategy going forward?","Scott Morrison","I'm not that optimistic in the near-term because I think there's still a lot of capacity. So I think the pressure is going to continue to be on. So, we're doing everything in our power to take out costs and become more efficient to be able to perform.","Operator","We will turn to next question from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead.","Alex Ovshey","Can you provide some color on the Mexico bev can market? What is the size of the market before you put in your capacity? What have the historical growth rates been? What's the mix between can and glass?","John Hayes","Well, why don't I take a first crack at that. It's important to point out that -- someone asked this question earlier, a fair amount the majority of the cans that we will be making in Mexico we expect to be exported to other markets outside of Mexico. And so while your question is relevant, it may be less relevant relative to this investment.","But the overall can market, I forget off the top of my head the exact size of it. I think it's about $11 billion or so. It's been growing 3% to 5% and the can mix, again beer versus soft drink, we're seeing the same thing down in Mexico terms of beer that we've been seeing around the world where there's been a trend towards cans relative to glass.","I think it's around 30% or so right now and that's been up from 20% probably a few years ago. On the soft drink side, it's still largely a PET business, although the can penetration is kind of probably in and around 10% which we see in many other parts of the world.","Alex Ovshey","And then just on the aluminum premium, a lot of people asked a number of questions around it, but maybe to sum up what I heard -- you said it was about an \u20ac8 million headwind in 2013 about a \u20ac15 million headwind in 2014 and then this year if all goes to plan, it's sort of a wash? So entering 2016, is it fair to say that sort of the unrecovered number in aluminum premium is about \u20ac23 million? Is that a reasonable way to think about it?","Scott Morrison","I'm not going to predict what's going to happen in 2016, but I don't -- you know, your math is correct.","John Hayes","It really has to do with at the end of the day what the metal premium level is. And it spiked to a record high in the first quarter. It's been coming down. Where it settles and where, as Scott said, with the ability going forward to be able to hedge how we do that and how we neutralize it, it's premature to speculate. But as Scott said, your math is correct.","Alex Ovshey","Okay. If I could just ask one more on working capital, would you be able to tell us a range that you expect the working capital number to benefit cash flow in 2015? And then maybe thinking beyond this year, what are the metrics on working capital that we as outsiders should be looking out to be able to say whether or not there is for the runway for working capital improvements beyond this year?","Scott Morrison","Sure, I think that getting to a number, I think the working capital benefit this year will be a little greater than it was last year. A lot of that has to do with improvements that we're making -- I am sorry, it would be a little less than it was last year. I apologize. But a lot of the improvements that we're making have to do with systems that allow us to manage inventories better. The businesses have done a fantastic job of reducing inventories.","There is also things that have gone on the receivable side and the payable side, but a lot of it has to do with inventory and the investments we've been making. And so, how much more of that we can get, I don't know. Each year we seem to be able to come up with sources over the last number of years. At some point, you kind of have to hold serve and that won't continue. But at least for '15, we see a good source from a working capital standpoint.","Operator","And we do have another question in queue, it's a follow-up question from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Go ahead.","George Staphos","Guys, the question I had for you is in terms of all the activity that you have going on, if you had to respond to a new customer request for facility, not sure that you actually want to in 2015 in 2016, but do you have the resources that if you did have an award that you could actually start working on it with everything else that you have going on? I had a related question.","John Hayes","That's a fair question, George, because we do have a wide variety of different projects going on. One of the benefits that we have right now, though, they are distributed. We have a couple of things -- in Conroe, Texas and in Mexico that the North American guys and girls are covering off.","In Europe, we've got Oss and we've got Lublin. In the food and household products side, we have on the tinplate in Chestnut Hill; we've got a couple over in Europe with respect to the UK and India and then over in Asia, we've got Myanmar.","So as you see the different management teams, local management teams are not individually overloaded with any of that. If we went forward and there were three new projects, had good return projects in Asia, it would be a stretch for us and I'm not sure -- we would have to prioritize that. We don't see that right now, though.","And so if that were to come, we would just have to evaluate it relative to the resources we have, but it's a fair question that we think about a lot. Are we making sure it's distributed enough that we're not taxing our people too much?","Scott Morrison","George, if you have some leads for us though, we're ready to pursue them.","George Staphos","I'll let you know. We'll talk off-line about the royalty. But all kidding aside, the related follow-ons would be if you had a need, hopefully there won't be -- but let's say there was a market dislocation, a weak summer, something of that ilk where you then needed to have another discrete cost-out program above and beyond your normal cost reduction program, do you have again the resources to attack something like that if need be?","Similar question, I'm assuming that as you were planning all of these projects and other strategic initiatives you were doing it with an understanding of what your various contract renewals would need to be or look like. Do you have any significant, specifically in beverage cans but anywhere you'd like to talk be helpful, contract renewals that we should be mindful 2016 and 2017? If you can update or remind us on that, that would be great. Thanks and good luck in the quarter.","John Hayes","George, this is John, I'll take the first question about, if we had to go cost out. We do this all the time. One of the things we don't talk a lot about is over the last 18, 15 months we've been moving towards a shared service model in terms of the back office efficiencies and we've had a little bit of upfront costs getting that up and running. But we expect as we look out the next 24, 36 months that we're going to see a tremendous amount of efficiencies.","Everything from how we pay payroll, for example, to how we administer our benefits, how we invoice our customers. There's a whole bunch of activities on a regional basis but even a global basis on standing various projects up and offices up. And then the next step is being able to take those costs out of the local plants or the local regions where they're inefficient. So, I think there's a lot of opportunity and we're actually chomping at the bit to get after some of that. So we're going to be accelerating.","That is what we do each and every day. We're well incentivized to try and take out as much costs as quickly as possible relative to servicing our customers and so that's what we're going to be doing.","If you talk about footprint, we have no plans on the table right now in terms of looking at our footprint because in most of the geographies, if not all the geographies we operate, we're very tight from a capacity point of view. And so I would not anticipate we would do that.","The last question I think was about customers and renewals. As I'm thinking and I look to Scott as well, I can't think of anything that is abnormal that we have a significant amounts of business up for renewal.","North America just by definition the size of our contracts are large but there's nothing that stands out. We've renewed customer contracts over the past couple of years. They are typically always multiyear contracts. In Europe, we might have a little here and there, but again it's much -- the size of those contracts are much more distributed and smaller.","And then in China, we do have a contract that's up for renewal at the end of this year that's probably one of our largest if not our largest over there. So we're very focused on that. Those are the only things that come into my mind.","Operator","Thank you very much. And Mr. Hayes, we have no further questions on the line. I'll turn it back to you.","John Hayes","Okay, great. Thank you, Tommy. We appreciate everyone's support and we'll be in touch in the second quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes the call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask you to disconnect your lines. Have a good day everyone."],"2898":["Ball Corp. (NYSE:BLL) Q3 2018 Earnings Call November  1, 2018 11:00 AM ET","Executives","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","Scott C.

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer-session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, November 1, 2018.","I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, CEO of Ball Corporation. Please go ahead, sir.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Great. Thank you, Melody, and good morning everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's third quarter 2018 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements, including estimates related to the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings as well as the company news releases.","If you don't already have our third quarter earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the Notes section of today's earnings release. The release also includes a table summarizing business consolidation and other activities, as well as a reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations.","Now joining me on the call today are Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and our CFO, and Dan Fisher, our Senior Vice President and our COO of Global Beverage. I'll provide some introductory remarks, Dan will discuss the Global Beverage packaging performance, Scott will discuss key financial metrics, and then we will finish up with some comments on our aerospace business as well as the outlook for our company.","Let me begin by thanking those of you who came to our Investor Field Trip earlier in October. It was great spending time with many of you and we appreciate you taking the time to listen to us articulate how and why Ball is uniquely positioned to lead and invest in sustainable growth in its global beverage can aluminum aerosol container and aerospace businesses, consistently return significant capital back to our shareholders and grow our diluted earnings per share 10% to 15% over time.","For those of you who were unable to attend the field trip, the slides and transcript of the webcast briefing are available on our Investor page at ball.com under the Presentations tab.","Now turning to third quarter results, momentum continues across our businesses. On an apples-to-apples basis, comparable operating earnings were up 14% year-over-year, excluding the sale of the U.S. steel food and steel aerosol businesses completed on July 31. This was despite a few headwinds that we'll get into in a moment. In addition, a higher-than-expected effective tax rate driven by currency movements, which Scott will go into in a few minutes, also impacted us.","We continue to execute our strategies of achieving better value for our standard products and higher growth for our specialty products, pursuing cost-out programs, completing growth capital projects to fuel future earnings growth, and commercializing on the inherent sustainability attributes of metal packaging to provide our customers solutions versus other substrates. In addition, we've put $600 million of proceeds from the food and aerosol sale to good work, acquiring stock and paying down debt, allowing us to reach our targeted leverage levels ahead of schedule.","Now moving on to segment results in the quarter, volumes in our North and Central American beverage can business were up year-over-year, driven by emerging beverage categories as well as double-digit specialty can growth, which Dan Fisher will elaborate on more.","In addition, we continued to execute on our long-stated need to secure more value for the supply of our standard products. Offsetting some of this tailwind, we continue to incur out-of-pattern freight and start-up costs related to the final two lines getting up to speed in the new Goodyear, Arizona facility. Our plant optimizations in Chatsworth, California and Longview, Texas are complete with both facilities closing this past quarter.","Our South American business delivered solid performance, despite the previously-disclosed transition away from ends contract and loss of certain can volumes in Brazil. This will be more pronounced during the seasonally-strong fourth quarter and normalize as we move into 2019.","Our European business continues to sequentially improve on its performance through cost-out and volume growth. We completed the start-up of our new plant in Cabanillas, Spain and we announced the intention to close a one-line facility in San Martino, Italy and expand our specialty capabilities in our Nogara, Italy beverage can plant in the North.","While we still have more work to do, we are seeing the margin expansion opportunity in this segment that we articulated upon the completion of the acquisition in mid-2016. In the aluminum aerosol side of our business, global volumes were up over 7% in the quarter and this business continues to operate quite well.","Our aerospace business continues to add to its record-high backlog, winning additional contracts throughout the quarter and even since our October Investor Field Trip. And lastly, we continue to focus on our G&A costs, which have continued to trend down as a percent of sales and now currently stand at 4% of revenues.","As we go forward, we will continue to execute our long-term strategy of growing earnings over time through increasing revenues above our cost growth, by focusing on our value-over-volume strategy, driving more mix shift to specialty containers, further developing innovative aluminum packaging products and expanding aerospace, all with an EVA and return of value to shareholders' mindset.","While we're dealing with a few short-term factors outside of our control, including higher freight rates and tight metal supply in the U.S. and a more volatile global economy and foreign exchange environment overall, Ball's businesses are uniquely positioned for consistent long-term growth and strong free cash flow in 2019 and beyond.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan.","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","Thanks, John. Our Global Beverage business operating earnings were up 11% year-to-date. As John mentioned, our global teams kept up with strong demand for beverage cans across Europe, Russia and North America, a welcome improvement but one that created incremental freight costs above plan, given Ball's support of an oversold U.S. industry, while we completed the planned closures of Chatsworth, California and Longview, Texas, and the ongoing ramp-up of the next two lines in our Goodyear, Arizona facility.","Moving to the individual segments. Ball's North America segment volumes rebounded, up just over 2% in the quarter and profits were up notably, given the lack of hurricane disruption versus third quarter 2017. New categories led the way with wine, sparkling water, craft and spiked seltzers experiencing double-digit growth.","Our North America team dealt with an incredible amount of capital projects, plant rationalizations, specialty can growth and freight cost growth through the first nine months of the year. Everyone is looking forward to having the planned operations network move out of project mode, and ultimately, benefit from fixed cost savings and reduced start-up costs in late 2018 and beyond.","Embracing complexity is what we signed up for. It is where the growth is and even more economic value. We also are experiencing some short-term supply dislocation from certain metal suppliers that we expect to manage through during the fourth quarter and which should alleviate by year-end.","Turning to our South American segment. As expected, our volumes were down 3% in the quarter due to Ball's 2017 decision to forgo some can business in Brazil. During the quarter, we also completed the ends manufacturing contract required as part of the Rexam transaction. Both of these actions have been discussed since mid-2017. So the business performing only $7 million lower in the quarter versus 2017 was an accomplishment. South American industry trends remained strong with cans being the favorite package in the beer, tea, energy and hard alcohol categories.","FX volatility across the region impacted the effective tax rate in the quarter, but did not impact the industry demand trends or segment profitability. Our expansions in Argentina, Paraguay and Chile are on track and we're excited about the can continuing to be embraced by customers and consumers across South America. In short, our business is being very effectively managed and is well positioned for 2019 and beyond.","European beverage earnings were up 14% year-over-year on double-digit volume growth. Europe is ground zero for the war on plastics and we are beginning to see customers alter their package mix away from plastics and into cans. The near-term capturable opportunity we discussed during our Investor Field Trip is happening. Tailwinds such as this, the second line ramping up in Spain and the completion of G&A transformation projects will provide additional earnings growth in 2019.","The demand environments in Turkey and India are stable, but were largely offset by anticipated demand volatility across the remainder of our Middle Eastern business. And in China, the business remains cash flow-positive and Ball continues to execute its disciplined approach in this country.","In summary, while we continue to deal with a couple of lingering headwinds, the heavy lifting on several of our large global projects is behind us. Supply-demand for U.S. standard containers and certain specialty sizes is quite tight, and we are experiencing progress on commercial initiatives and commercializing sustainability which will benefit 2020 and beyond.","Thank you, again, to all of our teams around the globe. With that, I'll turn it over to Scott.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Thanks, Dan. Comparable third quarter 2018 earnings were $0.56 versus $0.52 in 2017. Details are provided in the Notes section of today's earnings release and additional information will also be provided in our 10-Q.","Third quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflects solid operational performance across our businesses and lower corporate costs, offset by the sale of our steel food and aerosol business at a higher effective tax rate, the effect of which was $0.05 year-over-year.","The higher effective tax rate in the quarter was largely related to foreign exchange gains for tax purposes. This relates to managing our balance sheet in various regions. For 2018 key metrics, we expect CapEx in excess of 700 million, free cash flow in the range of $800 million, full-year 2018 interest expense around $300 million. The full-year effective tax rate will increase to 25% based on our current estimates of the impact of U.S. tax reform and currency movements. And corporate undistributed is now expected to be in the range of $100 million for the full-year 2018.","We put the July 31 cash proceeds from the food and aerosol sale to good work, acquiring stock and further reducing debt. Given the timing of the sale versus the timing of using the proceeds to repurchase shares, it will continue to be slightly dilutive to earnings in the fourth quarter. Prospectively, on a full-year basis, the transaction will be neutral to slightly positive related to diluted earnings per share, due to the incremental share repurchase, and positive to EVA dollar generation in 2019.","Net debt ended the quarter at $6.1 billion and we anticipate year-end net debt closer to $6 billion, as we continued to actively buy back stock during the fourth quarter. Roughly 86% of Ball's balance sheet debt is at fixed rates and we've reached our post-Rexam target leverage level ahead of schedule with net debt to comparable EBITDA at 3.2 times as of quarter-end, leaving us well-positioned in a rising interest rate environment.","The cash flow continues to be strong and year-to-date through yesterday we've repurchased a net $525 million worth of stock or 13.8 million shares. By year-end, we expect our stock buyback to exceed $700 million, in addition to paying approximately $140 million in dividends.","Looking forward, over the next three years, our plan is to buy back approximately 18% of our outstanding shares by 2021 or approximately $1 billion of stock annually in 2019, 2020 and 2021. Once completed, we'll have successfully repurchased the 75 million shares issued to execute the Brazilian JV and Rexam acquisitions. In addition to investing in our businesses, pursuing bolt-on M&A and paying quarterly dividends, that's truly putting the cash machine to work for the long-term benefit of our fellow shareholders.","With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Great. Thanks, Scott. Our aerospace business reported higher revenues and operating earnings, driven by solid contract performance, partially offset by incremental labor costs and the lower accruals related to the start-up of many of these new contracts. We continue to expect aerospace will produce material operating earnings improvement in the fourth quarter as new contracts ramp up.","Year-to-date, we have hired approximately 800 new aerospace employees and anticipate adding another 200 to 400 employees over the next 12 months following recent contract wins. The team has done an excellent job managing this rapid growth. With contracted backlog levels at a record $2 billion and our won-not-booked backlog now exceeding $5 billion, an increase of nearly $1 billion since our second quarter call, the future looks even brighter for aerospace over the next three to five years.","As a corporation, we truly are positioned for long-term sustainable growth. We continue to manage our asset base with an EVA mindset approach. We are leading more efforts on our sustainability initiatives to ensure aluminum packages for beverage and aerosol are properly positioned as the environmental solution for our customers' brand portfolios, and we're supporting the rapid growth of our aerospace business.","We're controlling the things we can control, managing headwinds and leveraging our strong free cash flow to invest for the long-term and consistently return value to shareholders via share buybacks and dividends. We continue to reaffirm our 2019 goals of $2 billion of comparable EBITDA and free cash flow in excess of $1 billion. And in 2019 and beyond, we are positioned to grow diluted earnings per share 10% to 15% over time.","And with that, let's move on to the Q&A. Melody, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Edlain Rodriguez with UBS. Your line is open. Please proceed.","Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning, guys.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Good morning.","Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC","A quick question on Europe. I mean, volume, nice pick up, 10%. Like, how sustainable is that? Like, where can growth be in 2019-2020 as you're seeing some shift into cans from other substrate?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","No, that's a great question. I think 10% had all of us very excited. That was unanticipated heading into the quarter. But mid-single digit growth, given our footprint in Russia and also the sustainability lift, we're having conversations with customers today and we think that that is a very real tailwind.","Relative to what we would expect on the PET shift specifically, it is still going to require investment both from our customers and our suppliers to make sure that we can capture all of it and with the speed. But I think this is a short-term, mid-term, and a 10-year journey that we will continue to benefit from.","Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And just one quick follow-up on Brazil, especially like on FX. Most of your competitors seem to be having FX issues over there in the P&L. Like, how come we're not seeing those headwinds hitting your P&L?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Our business is really a dollar-based business pass-through and then we hedge our net working capital position because we have our dollar functional entity down there. So, that's why the tax rate was actually higher because we hedged the balance sheet. And when you get a lot of volatility in a currency in a short period of time, we're going to have gains that are taxable and that's why our tax rate actually was a little bit higher. But actual transactional FX is not a big deal to us typically.","Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please proceed.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all of the commentary and detail. I wanted to dig a little bit into North and Central America and how the performance trended versus your expectations, particularly is there a way for you to parse for us what the start-up out-of-pattern freight, et cetera, inefficiencies were, given your footprint initiatives and given the volume trends that you saw?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yeah. George, this is John. Why don't I quickly start? I know freight. Let's just focus on that. On a net freight basis, net of what we passed through our customers, we had a $15 million headwind year-over-year in the quarter on that alone. So, just to give you a magnitude of that. The startup, as you know, we had started up the Goodyear facility in the second quarter. So we had a little bit of tailwind. Off the top of my head, I don't know exact, but it was a few million dollars. But I think the biggest part of it was the freight.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I'm sorry, you're saying that was a tailwind or that was a continued inefficiency in the third quarter on the start of it?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","No, continued inefficiency.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks. That's helpful.","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","And George, one data point on that, the market was flattish and we were up 3%. Some of that was the backstop of supply disruption from some of our competitors. And so those unanticipated volumes also built on that.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That makes sense. That makes sense. Second question I had, I know it's a little early to talk about 2019, but I was curious if you could help us a little bit with how the segments should ultimately build out into that $2 billion EBITDA goal and where we should see the most movement. As we sit here today, I think your LTM comparable EBITDA is about $1.890 billion. There's probably little bit of a tail-off when we get to the fourth quarter because last year you had such a strong performance in Latin America.","So, that $150 million or so, whatever the right number is, how should we see that fill out the various segments pro rata? And is Latin America down next year, based on some of the comments you're making? Or did I misread that?","Thank you, guys. I'll turn it over from that.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","George, this is John. Why don't I kind of start and let's first talk about aerospace. We have meaningful growth in aerospace. And so we've told the world we're going to make in excess of $105 million, $110 million, in that range kind of this year, and we expect 15% growth on that. So there's call it, round numbers, $15 million right there.","I think as you go into the aluminum aerosol side, we continue to see growth. Now that's not huge, but we're talking call it $10 million. So that's $25 million. And then when you get in the beverage can business, just the footprint in North America alone, all things being equal, we've said is $50 million...","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","...which Dan also mentioned. And we expect to get further growth in North America, particularly on the specialty sides, and margin up in that business. And so we're going to see some improvement in North America related to that. And, as we've talked about, we're actively managing the freight situation. So we should be able to eliminate any negativity there. And if we can get some tailwinds around that, that would be a plus.","Then you go over to Europe and we're closing our San Martino plant. We really haven't gotten any of the benefit from the Cabanillas, Spain start-up. We've got the sustainability that Dan talked about. And we also have the G&A that Dan talked about, in addition to the continued growth. So, that's a big chunk of it.","To answer your question specifically in South America, we expect year-over-year growth in South America. It's going to be a bit muted because of this ends contract that we're losing this year. So, remember, we had it for the first half of this year or even a little bit longer than that and we won't have it. But we do expect kind of flat to improved growth there. And then, in other places, corporate and the others, that's the bridge effectively.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you, guys. I'll turn it over.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please proceed.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks. Good morning.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Good morning.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. Congrats on the strong performance. I just wanted to go back to overall beverage can volumes tracking about 3% in the quarter, a very strong result in Europe. It looks like the industry is doing a good job of offsetting megabeer weakness with mix shift elsewhere and in growth elsewhere. I guess is that a fair characterization?","And as you look out over the next year or two, do you expect kind of overall global bev can growth to be in that low-single-digit range from here on and what are the differences between regions? Thanks.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yeah. I'd say, first things first, big beer in North America, we have that at kind of down 1% in the quarter. So, not all that significant. Obviously, Mexican import is kind of built into that number that helps to offset that. So, as long as that trend with folks like Constellation and Heineken shipping in products continue to grow, and we participate obviously heavily with those customers, then that helps to offset the declines.","And as we've said multiple times on the call, the big beer for one of our customers that's vertically integrated is largely contained into their system as opposed to ours and our competitors. We've kind of earmarked, as we're heading into kind of our strat plan season, 2% to 4% growth globally for the beverage can. The one area that's most exciting though to us and it's hard for us really to calculate is the potential share shift substrate penetration in Europe and in North America. So, over the medium- to long-term, we're bullish in those two regions in particular with the potential for can to PET shift.","And then, in South America, Brazil and Argentina and even Chile were incredibly strong here in the last 12 months to 18 months. I suspect that will modulate a bit and get back to kind of historical norms. Southeast Asia will continue to be strong. China will be flattish to slightly up but, obviously, we'll take a discretionary approach in terms of capital investment to pursue that.","But, overall, I think the tailwinds of plastic are going to be a benefit to us going forward and I think this 2% to 4% growth range is something that we're fairly confident in and we're certainly putting plans in and around that.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks. And just as a quick follow-up. Appreciate all the detail on George's question. So, I guess, just curious if your discussion around commercial opportunities in North America is built into those assumptions? You called out, say, $50 million from footprint and some growth above that. Is there a possibility for potential upside there due to the commercial opportunities or is that embedded in there?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","No. I think you should expect beyond 2019 is when you'd see any of the commercial activities in our North American business. And we talked about that in our October Investor Day.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes. Okay. Thanks, John.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please proceed. Your line is open.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Good morning.","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","Morning.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","A couple of questions on North America. Your volumes were up 2%. I was wondering if it's possible to parse that out between U.S. versus Mexico. And then, you specified metal supply dislocations that you expect to normalize. Just what's driving that and was there a real impact to earnings in 3Q?","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","No. And I'll take the metal question. This is one mill in North America and we've had our team meeting on a pretty regular basis since kind of third week of September with the team there to kind of work through the production issues that they've been facing. As it stands today based on everything I know, we'll be able to manage through this and have a clean slate heading into 2019. Right now, not a lot of disruption but it's certainly something that we're managing and we're keeping a close eye on.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","And then, on the North America volume side, I'll quickly take that. The U.S. volumes were flat to up very slightly and as we said there were some headwinds around big beer. CSD was relatively flat but we saw some good growth in energy and water and craft and wine, flavored alcoholic beverages. And then, Mexico was really added to get to that 2% growth. Remember, Mexico is very important to us, but as a percent of the total North America, it's about 10% of the volume.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's very helpful. And then, just switching gears, you indicated you're beginning to see customers in Europe alter the packaging mix from plastics to the can. And understanding it's very early days, is it possible to say what beverage categories or countries this is occurring in? And do you have a sense of is this shift really being driven by the beverage producer, or the retailer, or the customer? Any kind of thoughts you could give there would be helpful.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Sure. I would say customers and products that are heavily-weighted to plastic, those customers are concerned because they're getting pressure from end consumers, retailers and the threat of legislation. And all of those things are certainly being factored into some of the larger beverage customers that do have an overweight to plastic, and obviously they're trying to manage their risk profile going forward. And the conversations that we're having are about in the medium- to intermediate-term, helping to make sure that we have supply for them.","I don't know if I'd see a significant move in 2019, but I think it would be on 2019 I think things would start to show up. But specific things, even like water, and we mentioned this in our Investor Day, we've seen 100% growth in the UK, off of small numbers but it's still water's moving into cans. You can bet that every category is looking at whether the can is a viable alternative and if they can de-risk their plastic portfolio.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's very helpful. I'll turn it over.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed. Your line is open.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yes. Hey. Good morning, John and Scott. First question is on just the tax situation. It sounds to me this higher tax rate tied to working capital was one-time, but could you sort of give us an update on how we should model taxes both in the fourth quarter and next year?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Yeah. Well, I said the full year rate would be 25%. So the fourth quarter would be a little bit lower than that. This has happened before but it's unusual. We had 40% movement in a couple currencies and that's really what drove the impact in the quarter. So, to have a $0.05 impact in the quarter is a pretty big deal. That is unusual and I would say it's not something you should model going forward. It is a bit one-time.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then just to remind us on CapEx, north of $700 million this year and talking about the $1 billion in buybacks for three years plus the $700 million this year, that makes sense how you get that 76 million shares bought back. How much CapEx roughly should we assume is embedded in that for each of those three years?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Well, we've had a big build in the last couple of years and I think, when we acquired Rexam, we really had a three-and-a-half year game plan of things that we wanted to do. And I would say with the latest announcement of a closure, we're kind of getting close to the end of that three-and-a-half year game plan. But all that could change. So I would expect CapEx to normally fall a decent amount going into next year.","But the sustainability thing is a bit of the wild card. If that really takes hold and when it takes hold, that could require more capital going forward, but I think we're going to like the result of that capital. So it's a bit early to call that.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","I got you. I got you. But in other words, you're either going to have lower CapEx and get the $1 billion, or you might \u2013 maybe it'll slip a little bit because it's such a higher return to pursue some of these projects if you see the sustainability thing take off?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Yeah. Definitely. We're not going to walk away from good profitable opportunities where we can put capital to work and earn more EVA dollars.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And then, the last thing, just when we look at the aluminum aerosol business, you mentioned it grew 7% in volumes this last quarter, which I think it's been pacing at that rate for a while. Is that something that should stay in that range or is it sort of seeing an unusual pop right now and then maybe it normalizes, I don't know, low- to mid-single digits? What would you do as you look out a couple years?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","No, I think we can debate whether it's 5%, 6%, 7%. But in that range \u2013 and you have to break it down by geography. We're growing very strongly in India. As you know, that's a few-year-old plant. And as particularly on the deodorant side, that begins to take hold in India, we're seeing very strong growth. And just to give you context, our growth today really hasn't been with the big multinationals. And so, we're starting to see a lot more growth with the multinationals. So we think that's sustainable.","You go down into Mexico, which services not only Mexico but also here in North America, and again it's the same thing. We've been growing mid- to upper-single digits in that region off a big base because of the continued penetration on deodorant and other categories for all of North and Central America. And then you go into Europe and the growth is a little bit lower there because it's more mature and it's more penetrated, but we're still seeing good growth there.","So you add all those up and then, if we do anything else on the bolt-on acquisition in Greenfield, I think it's only going to accelerate from that 5% to 7%.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Langton with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Your line is open.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning. Thank you. Just had a question on South America. I know you mentioned volumes were down 3%. Do you know what your volumes would have been like if you excluded the conclusion of the end sales and then that loss of business, would you have seen growth?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Well, let me take that. That's two different issues. One, we were talking about can. Can demand for us was down 3%. You're talking about ends. And remember, because of this contract manufacturing situation, we were selling more ends than we were can. So, when we talk about volume, we're always talking about cans.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. So, that 3% drop excludes the ends.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Correct.","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","Correct.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. And then on Europe, I guess, EBIT \u2013 or comparable operating earnings were up $10 million. I think you also had the volume growth and I guess pricing benefits from sourcing and synergies. Were there any offsets I guess from either FX or pricing or start-up costs, just any detail there would be helpful?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yeah. Why don't I quickly take that? A couple of things. Number one, remember that we had the start-up of the Cabanillas plant. So, that was a headwind relative to the cost structure just in the near-term we're largely out of that.","Number two, remember even in 2018, we had some contracts that still have year-over-year price declines. So, that's a headwind as well.","And then, maybe I'll turn it over to Dan because then there was a lot of freight and other things because the volume was so high.","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","Yeah. Exactly. The last point is, certainly didn't anticipate 10% growth and we kept all our customers in cans, but it certainly cost us a little bit with ramping up Cabanillas and not having a full supply chain available to manage that.","So there's an element where you trigger to a higher growth rate and it becomes hard to kind of leverage and get the flow-through on some of that, those last cans. We are shipping cans a lot further than we typically do just to keep up with the demand.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Correct.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays. Your line is open. Please proceed.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Good morning.","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","Good morning.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","First was just a quick follow-up, Scott, on corporate expense, what was the commentary on 2018 corporate expense and how we should think about it going into 2019?","Scott C. Morrison - Ball Corp.","It should run about $100 million for the full year for 2018. So it'll bump up a little bit in the fourth quarter. We true-up a lot of benefit things in the fourth quarter, so expect it to bump up a little bit, but around $100 million for full-year 2018. And then 2019, too early to tell. But we're at a good trend and we would expect that trend to continue into 2019. We'll see how much.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. All right. And then, Dan, a little bit of a question on sort of the secondary packaging, I mean, we've obviously focused a lot on the primary package being cans versus plastic PET bottles. But when you look at it, there's also a big push on secondary packaging and maybe in some places getting away from paper-based packaging options and moving more towards plastic wrapper, glued all the cans together.","How do you think about that in relationship to your offering? And does that cause any additional complexity in the system that you think about as you move towards 2019 and beyond?","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","Yeah. Good question. I mean, short answer, no. I mean, we typically work with our customers on their filling operations, and whether it's packaging or exactly the pack mix and the size and the scale of that relative to their thought process. We're pretty dialed-in.","And I would say plastic is definitely something that's being contemplated about moving away from, because that's waste in terms of how the retailers view that. And so I think your comment on glue and even the cardboard, those would be more sustainable products that are being contemplated. And so, we're in those discussions with our customers and shouldn't see an impact on us.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And last one for me, when you look at it, some of your major customers have run decent size promotions in 2018. I mean, how do you think about channel inventories and sell-through on some of those newer products? Is it still going strong or should we expect any sort of inventory adjustments as we move into 2019 on those programs?","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","North America specific I think is what you're talking about.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Correct.","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","I'm pretty bullish on \u2013 the reality is we could have sold through a heck of a lot more spiked seltzer, had the supply chain talked a little bit more. And I think so what we'll do is we've got a number of customers moving away from historical view on just-in-time inventory. So we can do some pre-builds and things of that nature. So we can get folks set up for success in peak season.","So, sometimes the shortness and the inefficiencies in the supply chain and the lost revenue for some of our customers allows us to have a much better dialogue and help them succeed, and that's the kind of conversation I'm seeing right now. So, pretty excited to see what happens in peak season next year.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed. Your line is open.","Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning. This is actually Matt Krueger sitting in for Ghansham. How are you doing?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Good. Thanks. How are you?","Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Good. Good. So I'm still trying to wrap my head around the metal supply issue. Is this more a supplier having trouble with production, or is this a contract issue that's specific to Ball? And then, what gives you confidence on being able to manage through this during the fourth quarter, and will there be any incremental costs specific to this supplier situation?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","It is with one supplier, and it was I think specifically their cast house. And so, like I said, we've got a number of folks that have a ton of depth and knowledge with rolling mills, and they've been in, and they've evaluated the situation. And at this point, we've been managing kind of hand-to-mouth. We haven't seen a lot of disruption in terms of line productions, but it's just the managing of the day-to-day, the lower daily coil inventory. And all of those things, again, we're managing through them, but they could be concerning if we don't continue to do that.","Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. So, no expectation for a cost impact, correct?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Not .","Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then, moving on to Brazil. So, one of the key soft drinks players in Brazil had mentioned a pull-forward to volumes ahead of the elections in 3Q. Did you feel any impact from any pull-forward in the region? And then how do you feel about 4Q volumes in South America just as we sit today?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","I'll take the first one. Actually, no is the answer, do we see any pull-through. In fact, in the third quarter, I know overall industry volumes were down in the soft drink side of the business. So we don't see any impact.","And as we go in the fourth quarter, Dan, do you want to take that one?","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","Yeah. At this point, I think Q4 and even Q1 peak season down in South America, the only thing we can tell right now is we're running and making every can we could make right now. So it's a little premature to really understand the sell-through. Kind of tail-end of December, beginning of January is when those year-over-year comps and growth rates will start to kick in. But right now we're seeing a really good production build and pull-through from our customers and now it'll just be what's the sell-through.","The one caveat in South America is Argentina. We're going to continue to see growth but we'll just see it at a slightly slower rate than we had seen over the last 12 months.","Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yes. That makes sense. That's very helpful. That's it for me. Thanks.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Your line is open.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Good morning.","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","Good morning.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","You had talked a little bit about the things you might need to do as you see this shift more aggressively into metal from plastic. But I'm curious how what's happening right now may differ from other shifts to metal that you've seen in the past. Do you get the impression that this is something that would be more immediate or is it kind of similar to past things where there'd be test runs on shifting into the new substrate? And then just trying to understand how flexible your system is to manage this?","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","Debbie, this is Dan. This would be more pronounced because the level of investment that would be required from our customers to convert plastic lines into can lines, there wouldn't really be an availability to move back and they'd have to set up the retail channels in a way that it would be pretty meaningful kind of that one fell swoop, if you will. We would probably see that in Europe first is the reality.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then just a follow-up on Europe, you addressed the volume improvement which was pretty nice. I'm just curious, is the 12% margin, is that the right margin? Are you happy with that? I mean, if I look historically, that's a big improvement. I'm just trying to get a sense of what else there is to do in that region going forward if anything?","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","No. I think at the outset of the planning phase and where we embarked after the Rexam acquisition, we knew we had a three-year to five-year journey to kind of get back to where the Ball business was prior to the Rexam acquisition, and we still have some opportunities and some growth from a margin expansion standpoint.","Stepping more into specialty, becoming more efficient in our manufacturing footprint, making sure we have the right capabilities in the right locations to kind of further diminish the freight disruption, G&A opportunities that we've touch on on the call. So there's still I think a couple years of margin expansion just by kind of getting back in line with what we would have seen historically in our previous European business.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yeah. And Debbie, this is John. If you kind of take a step back and recall that, and don't hold me to this number in 2016, but the margins in Europe were well below what we expected and they were in the 9-is%, if I remember correctly. And we said we think we have a line of sight to get to the kind of 12%, 12%-plus margins that we had.","I mention that because if 2016 was about 9%, 2017 was about 10%, 2018 is about 11%, and then 2019, we still have all these cost opportunities that Dan just mentioned. So there is the runway that we always talked about.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. I'll turn it over.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed. Your line is open.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Good morning.","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","Morning.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Dan, just one on the North American bev can industry. I may have misheard you, but I think you said the industry is oversold right now. If so, what are industry operating rates compared to historical averages? And why would the industry be oversold if demand is flat to slightly down and when I don't think you've reduced any net capacity?","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","Well, we have reduced net capacity, and we mentioned that in the Investor Field Trip. I think we took out eight lines and put back in five lines. Secondarily, you're talking about more conversion lines. So you lose efficiencies when you're building or you're putting out into the market more specialty products. So, multiple products off of one line, you're making less can. So, all of that is having an impact on supply-demand.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Operating rates?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","You know what, let me take this because, Adam, the operating rates, when you ran standard 12-ounce and ran them forever, it was a metric that even we use. We don't use that anymore because to Dan's point, if you have, I'm just picking this as an example. If you have one line and you're making six conversions in a year, and then you have increased demand on the spiked seltzer, and all of a sudden you go to nine conversions, you're making a heck of a lot more money than you were on standard 12-ounce, but your operating rates as defined historically are lower than that. So, what I would tell you is, given all that complexity, we are operating as good as we have in the past, but by definition, the \"operating rates\" are lower.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it, John. Just a couple others. On the plastic issue, what are the brand owners, the Cokes and Pepsis of the world, telling you in terms of their preference for cans versus PET? I think at your Analyst Day you talked about the fact that they're actually making more money on PET than can. So, what are they telling you in terms of what their preferences are and what their intentions are in terms of shifting among substrates in the future?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Well, I think it's largely what we talked about at the Investor Day that historically their profit pools were much bigger on the PET side relative to cans, and through the use of specialty cans, we've been able to meaningfully close that. You layer on top of that with what's happening with the consumer and retailer about pushing more of a sustainable product, and that's exactly what we said at the Investor Day is what our customers are telling us.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. And just one last one. Just in terms of your customers, again, some of your large beverage can customers are struggling pretty significantly to the point that the largest brewer in the world just had to cut its dividend in half last week because of weakness in the global beer market. And to what extent do you think your future growth and success is tied to that of your largest customers?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Well, again, we talked about that at length. Our biggest growth right now is happening in all these other categories and that's what's fueling our growth, not only in the United States but globally, and whether it's energy, whether it's water, whether it's craft, whether it's wine, whether it's spiked seltzers and other FABs, that's where all the incremental growth.","And so, what we're seeing is if you think just as a big picture that, call it, 40% of our portfolio in North America is bigger beer, 40% is soft drink, and then 20% is the other categories I just mentioned, yes, the big beer is declining, but remember the can is winning relative to overall volumes.","So the can, this quarter, good example, overall volumes for big beer were down 3%-plus, but yet the can was only down 1% because it continues to take share. On the soft drink side, through the use of specialty, it used to be declining, it's relatively flat, and then we're seeing double-digit if not higher growth on that 20% of the portfolio.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks, John.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Your line is open.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Good morning.","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","Morning.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Just wanted to come back to the really strong volumes in both Europe and North America on a relative basis. And the spirit of the question is really just trying to figure out if there are some difficult comps that you would have a year from now. But in Europe specifically, was there a meaningful impact from the World Cup? I know it's been a couple of months since it happened, but just wondering if you saw a deceleration in trends sort of as the quarter went on that would sort of make for a tough comp next year?","And then, in North America, you mentioned this year some of the others in the industry probably didn't build inventory to anticipate some growth in some of these sparkling water markets you're talking about. Do you anticipate them to build inventory a little bit differently for next year and such that you might not have some of this spillover business next year?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yeah. Good question. I'll start with Europe first. I would say Q3 was less impacted by the World Cup, I mean very little impact. I think what surprised us to the good was the replenishment and the sell-through that was happening in Russia. The can continues to win there and we're continuing to sell through at a pretty brisk clip.","How effective that will be next year, and the very good weather that we had through all of Northern Europe and Central Europe, that will be the wild card for comps I would say, less so than is the can winning, are we securing additional substrate penetration, new category launches. All of those things we're seeing really nice tailwinds on. I would say weather will be the wild card for us if we're going to have something similar there in the Northern Europe for an extended period of time.","And then, on U.S., I actually feel pretty bullish about next year because I think we and our customers, and if you're following any of the CPG companies in North America, they'll tell you they probably left a little bit on the table this year by trying to manage the just-in-time inventories as opposed to pre-building stock. And so we're having those discussions to set up our customers for success in a more meaningful way next summer.","And by all indications, they're feeling pretty bullish about things like spiked seltzers and sparkling water and some of the other new categories that you saw but probably didn't see the extent to which they could have sold through because, candidly, the supply chain wasn't set up to deliver those products at the amount that the end markets would have pulled.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. That's really helpful. Just a follow-up on costs in North America. I think you talked about next year getting $50 million of year-over-year improvement from Goodyear and the consolidation that you'd be doing on the manufacturing side. Just wondering does that $50 million include the sort of duplicative cost you have by still having those plants up and running this year? Is that sort of an all-in year-over-year benefit you'd expect?","And then, on the freight side, some of the spot rates have started to tick down a little bit. That could just be seasonality. But just wondering if you're seeing or expecting any flattening out or even maybe potentially lower freight rates going forward?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","I think the $50 million is more or less net once we got full ramp in Goodyear. And there are a number of things that we're working on relative to freight rates both contractually. And to your point, yes, 3% growth during a ramp up period of Goodyear and qualifications and additional conversions, we hope that that normalizes and we pick up some efficiencies just by running our system more effectively next year, absent start-ups.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Appreciate it. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gabe Hajde with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed. Your line is open.","Gabe S. Hajde - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks, guys. One last question on Europe. Obviously, you're sort of expecting at least in the near-term growth to sort of moderate there. And I appreciate it depends on where some of the growth materializes. But when you look at your footprint and assuming growth continues even at, call it, a 3% to 5% rate, would this translate into more line additions as it sits right now looking at the footprint or would you be talking about more brick-and-mortar?","And sort of asking in the context of, looking back to CapEx over the past few years, it was a little bit elevated, call it, $500 million to $550 million. What type of return capital is embedded in that sort of a CapEx figure versus sort of your maintenance and safety environmental spend?","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yeah. It's a great question. In the near-term, it's more lines within existing bricks and mortar. That's the short answer. And our folks have gone through every one of our facilities, and knows whether it's a full line, whether it's just a couple extra pieces of equipment, how much output can we get within the existing bricks and mortar. That's our near-term focus.","I think to both what Scott and Dan were talking about earlier, if longer-term there is a much more pronounced growth that's sustainable, we will look at bricks and mortar. But as we sit here today, that is not on our near-term horizon.","Gabe S. Hajde - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. Helpful, John. And then one last one. It seems like you guys tweaked the language a little bit in terms of M&A pipeline or at least allocating capital that direction, appreciating that those things are more opportunistic or episodic in nature. But are there parts of the portfolio \u2013 I mean you talked about aluminum aerosol where you look to I guess allocate that capital. I mean I know the beverage business is pretty well filled out in a couple different geographies.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yeah. Perhaps, I think, you may be reading a little bit too much in the parsing words because nothing fundamentally has changed.","Gabe S. Hajde - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Okay. Melody, why don't we go? It's getting near top the hour. Why don't we just go with one more question if there is \u2013 are anymore?","Operator","Yes. We do have a follow-up question from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please proceed.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks for taking the follow-up. Guys, just a point of clarification, the specialty growth that you saw in the quarter that you said was double-digit, was that for North America or was that for the platform globally? That's question number one.","Question number two, especially with your beverage customers, how many roughly would you say as a percentage-basis have already established sustainability goals by 2021 or 2025 or what have you? And how many have yet to establish such goals? Just curious about that. Thank you and good luck in the quarter.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yeah. George, this is John. To answer your question on specialty, it's both.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","We're double-digits both in North America as well as globally across the system. With respect to sustainability, the vast majority of our customers have either put out specific goals by 2025 or 2030, or they have established an intent over the next years to finalize such goals.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Yeah. And George, there's nothing fundamentally specific about substrate mix shift in there. And so, that's the difficulty of trying to parse through some of the data relative to when you can anticipate this.","That's why with some of our partners, we're getting indications because they're starting to plan and they're doing mindful planning about how many lines, how many can lines, and where? And so those conversations, like we mentioned in the Investor Day, are happening. They were not happening a year ago, they're happening today.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. I mean our sense is a lot of those initial goals, as they were set out, the customers were beginning to be concerned whether they can actually hit them or not. And so, that may be one of the reasons that you're seeing the intensified discussion. But anyway, thank you and good luck in the quarter, guys.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Thanks.","Daniel W. Fisher - Ball Corp.","Thanks.","John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.","Thank you, George. And thank you, everyone. Melody, I think we're concluded.","Operator","Thank you.

Welcome to the Ball Corporation First Quarter 2013 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, April 25, 2013. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hayes, President and COO with Ball Corporation. Please go ahead, sir.","John A. Hayes","Thank you, Daisy, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's first quarter 2013 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings, as well as company news releases.","If you don't already have our earnings release, it is available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website.","Joining me on this call today is Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'll provide a brief overview of our company's performance. Scott will discuss financial and global packaging metrics, then I'll finish up with comments on our aerospace business and the outlook for the remainder of 2013.","We've made a lot of progress towards our longer-term objectives in the majority of our businesses, including our ability to overcome the shortfall created from the previously announced 12-ounce customer shift in North America. However, disappointing results in our European beverage container segment overshadowed this good work and led to our first quarter results coming in below our expectations. We will discuss this more when I talk about the outlook later in the prepared remarks, but the overarching business fundamentals at Ball have not changed. And while we have dug ourselves a hole in the first quarter, we do expect the remainder of the year to be largely consistent with our expectations, although the year is probably more back-end weighted as volumes in the second quarter are getting off to a slow start and our cost out plans in Europe will take time.","Other events in the quarter included, we successfully integrated our recently acquired Mexican extruded aluminum aerosol business, which brings a new growth platform and a new region for Ball. We began installation of a second beverage can line capable of making multiple specialty can sizes in our new Alagoinhas, Brazil facility. Volumes for us in Brazil were up strong double digits for the quarter.","We're aggressively managing our manufacturing footprint by announcing that we will cease production at our Elgin, Illinois steel aerosol packaging plant later this year, as well as redeploying beverage and manufacturing equipment from our Gainesville facility to existing facilities in the U.S.","We are launching exciting new beverage can innovation, resulting in a leading U.S. craft brewer, offering their beer in cans for the very first time. And we continue to leverage Ball Aerospace's technology expertise by maintaining more than $1 billion of contracted backlog despite the ongoing effects of sequestration.","We are encouraged by the operating performance across the vast majority of our businesses. And as you can see, we have cost issues in Europe. The consolidation of the Ratingen and Bonn locations is the first step of many activities over the balance of the year to ensure we're as cost competitive as we can be.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott for a review our first quarter numbers.","Scott C. Morrison","Thanks, John. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the first quarter were $0.58 versus last year's $0.63, an 8% decrease. Also in the quarter, the company recorded after-tax charges totaling approximately $16 million, related mainly to costs associated with plant closures and the European headquarters relocation to Switzerland.","Our metal beverage Americas and Asia segment comparable earnings were roughly flat year-over-year due to shifting mix to specialty cans and excellent cost control at the plant level, offsetting double-digit declines in 12-ounce can demand in North America.","Brazil volumes were up 40-plus percent in the quarter. China volumes were up mid-teens, but pricing in the region remains difficult. European segment profit declined $0.06 in the quarter due to weaker volumes brought about by challenging economic and weather conditions in Northern and Western Europe, higher costs related to our regional headquarters move and higher input costs.","In food and household, year-over-year segment earnings declined slightly due to higher cost inventory carried into the year, and segment volumes declined 5% in the seasonally weak quarter with food cans down a bit more, which we expect to end up flat by year end and steel aerosol up mid-single-digits in the quarter. Extruded aluminum containers continue to grow globally. Also in the quarter, we were notified by a food can customer of their decision to shift buying from Ball to a new supplier beginning no earlier than 2015. While this is a ways away, we do not expect this shift to be material to the company's results in 2015.","We have new things in the pipeline to deliver value-added packaging to other customers. And as always, we will actively manage our manufacturing footprint to enhance returns on invested capital.","In the first quarter, we had 2 fewer accounting days as a result of moving to a quarterly calendar closing schedule, and our effective tax rate was lower than expected due to lower taxes on foreign earnings and benefits of the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit.","Net balance sheet debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $3.4 billion due to normal seasonal working capital build and nearly $90 million of pension plan contributions during the quarter. Credit quality and liquidity of the company remains solid with comparable EBIT to interest coverage at 4.9x and net debt to comparable EBITDA at 3.1x.  Given our seasonality and strong full year free cash flow, we anticipate year-end net debt levels to be in the range of $3.1 billion.","For a complete summary of the first quarter results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, please refer to the Notes section of today's earnings release.","Moving onto the financial metrics for full year 2013, hardly any changes here. Interest expense is expected to remain flat with last year. The effective tax rate on comparable earnings is expected to be approximately 28%. We believe full year corporate expense to be in the range of $70 million due to onetime costs related to the impact of retiree and other deferred comp elections, primarily in the first quarter.","CapEx is still expected to be in the range of $400 million, and the free cash flow will be in the range of $450 million. Our disciplined capital allocation remains with the majority of our free cash flow being returned to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. On balance, absent the disappointment in Europe, the remainder of the business is on track with our expectations.","With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.","John A. Hayes","Thanks, Scott. Our aerospace business continued to perform well with solid execution on existing programs and contracted backlog running slightly to $1.70 billion. As in the past, being cost competitive has allowed Ball to win our fair share of government contracts. And despite some minor slippage in some of our more tactical products related to sequestration, we remain well positioned. After a long and very successful career at Ball Aerospace, Dave Taylor retired at the end of the first quarter. We thank him for his significant contributions to our company and wish him well in retirement. Dave hands the reins over to Rob Strain, who joined aerospace as Chief Operating Officer in early 2012, and is doing a great job in what has been a very smooth transition.","Now looking out across the operations today, a few observations to share. First, we continue to expect the Americas Asia segment earnings to be relatively flat in 2013. Specialty can growth in North America and Brazil is strong, and cost out initiatives are on plan, which are expected to offset anticipated lower volumes for 12-ounce containers in North America and difficult pricing in China.","In Europe beverage, given existing challenges and the time required to achieve cost optimization across the region, we are unlikely to fill the first quarter performance hole in 2013. We anticipate seeing the benefits of ongoing cost-out initiatives later in the year end and into 2014. And as such, margins are expected to remain challenging in the second quarter.","Going forward, our global food and household segment will benefit from increased demand for aluminum aerosol containers and the typical customer pull-through ahead for a normal seasonal vegetable harvest here in the United States. In our aerospace business, while some uncertainty still exists around future ramifications of sequestrations, Ball's strong performance and track record should keep us well positioned for the long term. With the exception of our European beverage business, remaining segments operating performance are expected and anticipated to be solid and should improve over the back half of the year. However, given our first quarter results and volumes in the second quarter are off to a slow start, it is unlikely we can reach our long-term 10% to 15% diluted earnings per share growth goal in 2013.","Our company's cash flow is strong, and we are actively managing our businesses to align assets and cost structures to respond to current market conditions. This is a year where our attention to detail and focus on operational excellence are required to position us well for the long term. And with that, Daisy, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wanted to start on Europe. These things happen obviously from time to time, and ultimately, you've had good performance in Europe over the years. It sounds like from listening and also reading through the press release that the issues in Europe, to some degrees, perhaps caught you by surprise. And so I was wondering if you could provide a bit more details in terms of what varied, if anything, from your expectations in the quarter. And then, again, if possible, on a forum like this, can you comment to the degree to which you ultimately see cost outs benefiting results? Obviously, it's not going to happen in second quarter, but in aggregate, say, by 2014.","John A. Hayes","Yes, George, this is John. There are several things that surprised us a little bit. The greatest of which, candidly, was probably volume. Recall in January, I had said that Europe, we were facing some issues in Europe, but we were coming off a year that we grew mid-single-digits. And in Western and Northern Europe, in particular, not only the economic climate, but they had a very long cold winter and beer was very soft, and we're weighted towards beer. And so we were down in the quarter, and that was a big issue, particularly when you're in a fixed-cost business. Having said that though, no excuses. We've got to be laser focused on improving our cost out. The shortfall was approximately 1\/3 of volume and mix, 1\/3 of labor efficiencies related to the move as Scott said, and then 1\/3 related to higher costs, whether it was metal premiums, higher energy costs. And we are laser focused on getting those costs out of our system.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. The labor I'm assuming was related to what you needed to do once operating trends vary from what you were expecting. But the metal premiums, I'm not sure why that would have been any different than what you would have expected going into the year?","John A. Hayes","Well, we did. We did expect some higher energy and labor premiums that we're -- excuse me, metal premiums that we're having some challenges trying to push through into the marketplace. The labor efficiencies where we had redundant costs related to several opening up a new headquarters, and we hadn't yet closed the new headquarters, and those things just take some time and we had a little bit higher labor cost than we expected in that business. And so as I said, we're getting after that right now because we have to.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. John, I'd ask the question. I'm not sure you're in a position to answer it, so I respect that, but can you size what the cost outs might look like? If you mentioned already, I apologize for missing it.","John A. Hayes","No, I -- George, I do think it is premature to review that. Our folks are taking a full scrub, and we're going to be talking with them in the next couple of weeks about that. But we need to get the cost out. And look, this was a short-term blip and it had to do with -- it was the first time in a long time we actually had volumes decline in the quarter over in Europe. And so we need to make sure that our costs are as aggressively controlled and possible because you can't anticipate, given the economies of Europe, that we're going to see mid-double -- or mid-single-digit growth. And so we're planning for the worst, and then the rest is upside, if we can get after it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question is just the earnings outlook, not going to hit the 10% to 15%, understood. Should we be expecting EPS to be up year-over-year this year at this stage? And that's a question for the year, but also for the second quarter given what you're saying about trends and some of these cost variables, any color would be helpful.","Scott C. Morrison","Sure. Moving into the second quarter, it is starting off slower in terms of volumes. So I think the second quarter has got some challenges. Full year though, we're still expecting earnings per share to be up. We just said we're not going to hit our 10% to 15% long-term goal, but we expect it to be up.","John A. Hayes","Recall, Phil, that at the first quarter, we said we're going to be striving to reach the lower end of that range. And so if we made the $3 plus at the end of '12, you can do the math there. We've dug ourselves a $0.06 hole or so relative to that. And so -- but it's still -- we still are going to be striving to get as much as we can, it's just going to be difficult given the shortfall in the first quarter.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. And then on the free cash flow guidance, it sounds like you're keeping CapEx the same. So if earnings are expected to be lower, Scott, are there other levers you're pulling here to keep that free cash flow? Or did you have cushion in that original guidance? Or how should we be thinking about that?","Scott C. Morrison","We're finding some things on the working capital front that we can go after to make up for the shortfall in the earnings side. And right now, the CapEx plans that we have, the growth capital that we're spending on are projects that we like. It's a lot of specialty capacity in both North America and Brazil. And those projects have proven to be well worth investing in, and so we're going to be continue disciplined in deploying capital where we can find growth. It's probably the maintenance side where we can maybe shave a little bit out, but right now, we're keeping the number the same.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it, okay. Last question, just on the Europe mix issue, could you just elaborate on what that is? I assume it's specialty cans, but just kind of more detail in what you're seeing? And is that just seasonal or what is going on there?","John A. Hayes","Well, as I said, we're -- number one, we're more weighted to beer and beer is more weighted to $0.50 a liter. And so with the softness, overall -- I'll just give you context, overall, beer, industry beer cans in the first quarter in France was down about 8.5%; in Germany down about 7%; and Belgium down about 2.5 %, all largely related to the economy and weather. I mean, even in Germany, they were having snow in April, which is -- they haven't had in a long, long time. And so the mix issue is related to we were selling less beer, which is $0.50 a liter predominantly, and we're selling on a relative base, more $0.33 a liter, which is the standard container in Europe.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on the metal premium issue in Europe. Is that -- because first I thought the contract's pretty much adjusted for any changes in metal prices. And the second is, is it related to steel versus aluminum?","Scott C. Morrison","It's not really related to steel versus aluminum, this is aluminum premium. And every contract is different. There are some contracts where it's a straight pass. There's other contracts that get negotiated on a shorter-term basis where all that has to get negotiated. And I would say we need to do -- we need to push more of getting that premium passed through. That's where we're getting squeezed a bit.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Is there -- are you going back to these customers and trying to get that contractually passed through on a go forward basis?","Scott C. Morrison","No, you have to honor the contracts that you have. But obviously going forward, you try to fix anything that's new that's coming up. Or if contracts need to change for whatever reason, that's high on our priority list of things to go after.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just on the -- you made a lot of management changes over the last year. A lot of people retired, so it's not as if the changes were made due to performance. But is there anything in the last quarter where maybe just because of management changes, the data wasn't flowing back as quickly as you would've expected? And so therefore, Europe surprised a little bit just from an information flow perspective?","Scott C. Morrison","I don't think it has anything to do with any management changes. I would say, if you're -- the one comment I made on undistributed cost being up a little bit, that has to do with a little bit with retirements, because of the way the deferred comp plans work and certain retiree elections. So it was a little bit higher in the first quarter, but I don't think there's any issue with -- we had a lot of changes last year in terms of going to the principal structure, moving our headquarters to Zurich. And when that -- and when something like that happens, I think you have a tendency potentially to lose focus a little bit. But I don't think it has to do with any personnel changes.","John A. Hayes","Yes. And the other thing I'd point out is when you looked at our volumes sequentially through the quarter, that actually in January, they were okay. And then it really started to get soft in February and even more so in March, and I think largely, it had to do with the prolonged winter.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right. And just lastly, it's -- the facility that you're consolidating, is that -- that's just an administrative facility?","John A. Hayes","That's correct. It was our former regional headquarters and just outside of D\u00fcsseldorf.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","John, just judging by what your customers are also reporting, Heineken was out yesterday saying volumes were down 8% in Western Europe for the quarter. So obviously, they're seeing it and it's flown through the supply chain. Are you seeing any sort of -- are you sensing any sort of, re-think, in terms of promotional activity at their end as they sort of adjust to this new reality of what's happening in Europe?","John A. Hayes","Not yet, but what I will tell you, as a general rule, in the United States and in Europe, it's not lost on their customers that the volumes have been quite soft. Obviously, for different reasons, we've been focused in Europe on the weather; even here in the United States, not only weather, but the payroll tax. I think it's -- the impact on the consumer, it surprised people a bit more. So as we sit here thinking about promotional activity, it's very high on the minds of trying to get their volumes back. But I do think that we're just coming out of the winter time, and so it's really late in the second quarter is when you'll start to see those promotions. And the cycle of promotions is very different than it was, say, 5 years ago. They happen much more quickly, decisions are made much more quickly. And so I think it's going to be more of a tactical approach to promotions and advertising as well. I think you'll see a lot of marketing and advertising this summer in the beer category as well as the CSD category, both here in the United States and over in Europe.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then just switching to Brazil, your 2 primary competitors down there seem to be focused on adding capacity in Northern Brazil. Can you just remind us on your Northern Brazilian strategy and how that sort of fits in with your plan for the region as a whole?","John A. Hayes","Well, we have. As you know, we started up a plant in the Northeast in Alagoinhas last year, and everything is going very well. And we, even in January, announced that we would, by later on this year, have a second line installed, and it was tied up under a long-term agreement and we have halfway through the execution there, and we expect probably late third quarter is when will -- that will get up and running. And so when you talk about North, I don't -- I wouldn't describe it as a Northern Brazil strategy, it's our Brazil strategy and a customer focused strategy. Right next to our Alagoinhas plants, 2 of our big customers have built brand-new breweries there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Philip Ng with Jefferies.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","You guys are mentioning that your office slow start in 2Q. Can you provide a little color which businesses you're seeing a little more weakness from?","John A. Hayes","Well, relative to last year, I would say, here in North America, the beverage can volumes are a bit soft. I think if you look at IRI-type data, you can see just, again, the overall market is soft on the soft drink and beer side. I know that some of the soft drink companies over the last couple of weeks have talked about that. And then over in Europe, it's -- the winter was prolonged. I mentioned snow in Germany in mid-April. That's, in some ways, that's unprecedented, and so it's just a bit slow. But as we start to cycle into the summertime, it is weather dependent, but it was really those 2 things that I was referring to.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Got you. And then on the food can business, I'm surprised to see some inventory holding drag from template. I would've thought template prices were pretty flat. Did you see a drop-off? Is that why there was a drag on the quarter?","Scott C. Morrison","There was just a little bit of that. It had to do with some higher cost inventory from how we ran from the fourth quarter into the first quarter. So I wouldn't read too much into that.","John A. Hayes","Yes. Remember, we took a lot of downtime in the food can business in the fourth quarter last year and to manage inventories, and that helped generate some very good cash flows for us. But then -- so you're spreading a fixed-cost nut, if you will, over smaller volume, and that's where the higher cost of inventory flows through, and it's just -- it's a timing issue.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Got you. And then just one last question on China. Demand's still pretty strong. One of your competitors mentioned that some of the regional players are having some execution issues, they're having some setbacks. So perhaps the excess capacity is not as bad as people have feared. Are you seeing that dynamic? And has that opened a door for you to win some new business? And what are your thoughts on pricing, I guess, potentially turning to the positive, going forward?","John A. Hayes","Well, I think all that you suggest is we would be at the same way. Meaning, volumes are -- continue to go strong. As we said, we're relatively sold out. We haven't added a lot of capacity in the market. And so as we go into the summer, it'll be interesting to see if there are indeed how tight the market gets. And we are going to take a very pragmatic approach to prioritizing our customer demand and how we supply that relative to where the economic returns are. And so we are going to make sure that our customers that want to be with us for the long term and aren't just tactical price buyers, we're going to focus on those relationships over the tactical price buyers.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Got you. So it sounds like there is potentially some opportunity to get a little better pricing if things do firm up into the year, during the peak summer months then?","John A. Hayes","Yes, there could be. But again, it is a bit early and there are some operational problems. But the local competitors over in China, they're -- they have a capability of getting their act together. And so we'll see how the summer unfolds.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","I was on a few minutes late, so I apologize if you addressed this. In light of the slightly softer guidance on the EPS line to get to the free cash flow number, are you planning to reduce CapEx a little bit? Or do you think you'll have a little bit better working capital managed? How do you think you will get there?","Scott C. Morrison","Well, it's still real early in year. But right now, we think we've got a little more upside in working capital than what we had. We didn't change our CapEx guidance for the year.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Got you. And then secondly on the aerospace division, if there were an impact or is going to be an impact from the sequester, when do you think that would both show up in the backlog and possibly in the actual results?","John A. Hayes","Well, I think there's 2 ways you got to think about this. The backlog we have is contracted backlog, and that's been increasing, and I think that's relatively solid. And so you wouldn't see anything, and that's a lot of the -- what I have described as the space hardware of what we do there. That's pretty firm, pretty solid, because these are satellites that need to be replenished, and we're not seeing any impact with respect to sequestration, at least right now, on that. On the more tactical products, the antennas for, say, the Joint Strike Fighter and other more tactical programs like that, we have seen a slippage to the right, not cancellations but a slippage to the right. That part of our businesses is certainly a much smaller part of the business than our space hardware. And so I think if you're going to see softness, you'll see it in that area.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay, that's very helpful. And then -- and again, I apologize if you addressed this, it seems like your experience in Europe, and I know that segments by company aren't apples-to-apples, but it seems like it's been a little bit tougher in the first part of the year than your other competitors. And could that be because of who your specific customers are or the mix of business with, say, soft drinks versus beer. Can you give us a little help with that?","John A. Hayes","Yes, I did address that earlier. So I'd ask you to go back when the transcripts comes out. But it really gets into the geographic location. Western Europe, France, Benelux region, Germany, that's a sweet spot for us, and where a lot of our production capacity and customers are. And it's -- we are focused on beer there. Given the weather and given the economic conditions, it was quite soft in those regions relative to some other regions.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","And then last -- real quickly, more for Scott, is there any obvious or are there obvious things you're looking at to even further lower your debt cost, given this incredible environment? Or do you feel you've pretty much done all you can do?","Scott C. Morrison","No, we're always looking at the debt markets, and they've been very attractive lately. So we're always looking and we'll be opportunistic.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc.","Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","On Brazil, what were your like-for-like volumes in the quarter excluding the new plant? And what do you expect the market growth to be in subsequent quarters?","Scott C. Morrison","I don't have the like -- I mean, the year-over-year volumes were up 44%. Taking out the new capacity, I don't...","John A. Hayes","Yes, we were -- absent the new facility, we were sold out. And so we've been getting some productivity improvements there. But when you don't have anything else to sell, it's tough to sell more. And so -- hopefully, that addresses the first question. On the second question, we continue to see, I think, in the first quarter, industry volumes were up around 9% in Brazil. We're starting to enter their \"winter\" months. But I think all the prospects based on conversations with our customers and based upon the economic activity related to infrastructure builds for the World Cup next year, I think as we go through the back half of 2013 and into 2014, we're going to continue to see a nice volume improvements in Brazil.","Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And just one more on the food can contract, can you go into any more detail about what happened with that contract? Obviously, you said you're not going to lose it before 2015, but any additional insight into that situation?","Scott C. Morrison","Other than we're talking a couple of years out into the future, when you have something like that, usually it comes under price, is my guess. So price plays a big part of it. But nothing more to offer. We -- I think we know how to -- we've got other things in the pipeline from a new product perspective, and we'll manage our footprint as necessary. And we've done this before in other businesses, so we know how to do it. So we're just letting people know.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Can you talk a little bit about how much of that double-digit drop in 12-ounce North American bev you've been able to offset with specialty cans?","Scott C. Morrison","Quite a bit. I mean, if you look at the profitability, you can't see the profitability [ph] of North America, but they've done a heck of a job of both -- of taking out costs, growing specialty can. I mean, even some of the business, some of the same customers that we reduced 12-ounce volume with, we're growing specialty business. So it's been a great offset to that business to offset the declines in 12-ounce.","John A. Hayes","Yes. I would just add that from a volume perspective, we grew mid-teens in the specialty size. It's all obviously off a smaller base, but then -- so our overall volumes are down. But the double-digit improvement of specialty, it now represents 22%, 23% of our overall mix. Now part of it has to do with lower 12-ounce, obviously, but the other part has to do with increasing specialty. And it's -- we've been very focused on that. There's a variety of new products coming out this year related to that, and we continue to focus on that segment.","Scott C. Morrison","I think that and managing the cost base aggressively, has really done a great job.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. And am I correct that the kind of the throughput, just the unit throughput, on specialty cans tends to be a bit lower than on the 12-ounce?","Scott C. Morrison","That is correct.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And are you likely, given this growth in specialty, are you likely to have to make any more capacity changes over the next 12 months as you see it right now?","John A. Hayes","Well, I think in the growth capital that Scott has mentioned and anticipated in that is some of these changes. And it's not adding new capacity, it's converting 12-ounce capacity to other sizes and capabilities.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, all right. And then could you also just address kind of the timing on pure repurchase activity? The stock's down about 4.5% today. I wondered whether you're likely to do kind of more at a point like this, or whether you'll wait till the second half of the year when your cash flow tends to be stronger?","Scott C. Morrison","No. I think it sounds like it's on sale today. So it sounds probably a good day to buy. We've got to get out of a blackout period. But we're still on track to use most of our free cash flow to buy back our stock, and we'll anticipate we'll get there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Al Kabili with Macquarie Group.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Just a question on Europe on the higher labor cost you cited. Is that a big sequential step-up that you saw fourth quarter to one quarter that helped catch you by surprise?","John A. Hayes","I think the costs were -- kind of came into the business in the second half of last year. This move to Zurich is more than just a move of headquarters. So we went to what's called a principle structure, where the plants essentially instead of become -- being kind of their own of profit and loss center, become a tolling manufacturing operation and a distributing operation. And I think we've got some added people cost because of that. So it added complexity to the business. And I think we added people because of that, and now we're going through a process. I've been over to Europe twice in the past couple of weeks as we look into how do we streamline some of those processes and make it more efficient.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Okay, all right. And along those lines, I know you mentioned higher metal premiums in Europe. But I think I understand there was some opportunity in some contracts for higher prices. So can you just talk about -- are you saying that you didn't get enough pricing to offset all of the increase in metal premiums? Or was there any extra pricing in this year in Europe has [ph] ?","Scott C. Morrison","No, I think that's fair. I mean, we didn't get enough price to offset some of the cost structures. There's also -- energy costs are up dramatically in Europe. Tax, they're raising energy taxes dramatically in places like Germany and France, and so those kinds of things are impacting you, too.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Okay. Now on the energy, it's a little bit surprising to me on the energy front, just given historically, there's not a lot of energy usage for a can plant. And traditionally, we haven't seen a big sensitivity to energy prices in terms of your earnings. So is there anything unusual going on this year in terms of that? And is there opportunity on your contract structures, is that a year lag? Or what's the structural like to pass some of that through?","Scott C. Morrison","Well, I mean, there's a fair amount of energy use -- electricity used in making -- in a can plant, if you walk through a can plant. Typically, the energy prices don't change as dramatically, but energy prices in Germany, for instance, they've raised. They're moving away from all their nuclear plants, they're going to renewable energy, which is a good green thing to do, but it's going to drive the costs much higher. And so we're seeing the impact of that. In terms of -- I'm trying to remember the second part of your question...","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","The structure for pass-through right now -- yes, because some of them have pass-throughs for that kind of stuff. I think it might be a year lag, but...","Scott C. Morrison","Yes, there are lags, and it would depend on the contract again. But there is a lag, so you know you're going to feel the pain for a period of time until you get to reopen those contracts.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Okay, all right. And then follow-up just on aerospace, I mean, I know it's lumpy quarter-to-quarter. So in this quarter, you were, I think, $18 million or so of EBIT, and I know it's lumpy. So is that just kind of unusual versus the recent sort of experience we saw last year? Or how should we be thinking about the run rate of the aerospace business?","John A. Hayes","Remember, last year, we had a number of close out of contracts, and the lumpiness has to do with when you're starting up new contracts, usually the profitability is a bit lower on the front end of it relative to back end, just because the risk's higher. And as you execute on those contracts and reduce the risk, the profitability goes up. And so we had a number of close outs in 2012, and we have a number of ramp ups, which is good for the long term in 2013. That's the vast majority, if not all of, exactly what we are talking about.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Okay, so we should -- so should we expect then as we get to the back half of this year that, that starts to tick back up as these projects move forward in time? Or is this kind of a good run rate for the rest of the year?","John A. Hayes","It's probably closer to a good run rate for the rest of the year. And remember, these contracts often are 3, 4, 5 year contracts. And so when you're sitting, we -- as I said, we had a -- you look at our margins last year, they were record high margins. And they were -- because there are so many close outs, and I think we're having so many startups here. And so the fundamentals of that business are quite good. But really, where that profitability will really, assuming we're executing, really starts to fall in 2014 and '15.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of housekeeping or miscellaneous questions. But first, let me start with aerospace. If I heard earlier, and to follow-up on Al's question, if I heard earlier, I thought you said for the balance for the year with the exception of Europe, that would be down on a year-over-year basis in North America or Americas bev where you intended to be flat, but you'd indicate all the businesses would likely be up for the year. So kind of marry that with your previous comments as we think of the run rate for the balance of the year, should we still be thinking about aerospace year-over-year being up or being flat or being modestly lower?","John A. Hayes","No, I don't think it's up. Remember, in January what I said is, there's not upside relative to aerospace. And so if we miscommunicated that, apologies there. I think -- I'm sorry?","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","No problem. That was in earlier comments, I might have picked it up incorrectly. Second question I had was with respect to, as we look at some of the specialty can and trying to delineate between what we're seeing in sort of your 12-ounce business versus your specialty business, were all pieces up or down in Europe? In North America, obviously, we knew you lost a lot of regular business. But when we're looking around different regions, how should we think about which pieces are doing well, which pieces aren't, specifically trying to weigh [ph] some of that?","John A. Hayes","Well, in Europe, as I said, with -- we had mix issues related to -- we had lower specialty sales relative to standard sales. And a lot of it had to do with we're selling less beer, which is $0.50 a liter and selling relatively more CSD, which is $0.33 a liter. I think that's the biggest change in Europe.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then one other question with respect to Europe is, what's your mix as it sits today, steel versus aluminum?","John A. Hayes","Well, as this is public knowledge, but we're in the process of converting one of our German plants from steel to aluminum. And that's in some of the CapEx that Scott had mentioned, and that should be largely completed within the next month or so. And so pro forma that after we go through that, it's less than 1\/3 steel and then the balance of it, aluminum.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Last question was, was the -- your anticipation as the year rolls on with some of the beer customers in Europe, is it that -- I know you talked about some of the promotional activity that could help buoy things a bit, but is it your anticipation that, that business will get a little bit better absent many cost-cutting pieces, number one. And then number two, do you worry about other capacity adjustments over there? I recognize you are going to do some work, structurally, more on back-office headquarters that, type of stuff, but do you feel you would want any other capacity realignment or adjustments over there as well?","John A. Hayes","No, we don't see any capacity realignments in Europe at this time. The market fundamentally is still growing. We're just coming off of one quarter, a seasonally slow quarter that had bad weather and was soft. And so as we go into the year, you have to assume that weather will be normalized in there, and we expect volumes to come back. And we have said this in the prior couple of conference calls that we don't have any plans on adding capacity until we get our cost structure right there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","On the food can contract that is going to be lost in 2015. Is that going to go to -- is that a new entrant in the marketplace or another player that's not the other 2 big players that we know in the market?","John A. Hayes","It's a -- we're not 100% sure. So anything we'd say is speculating, so it could be either one of what you're saying. And we believe it could be a new entrant, but we're not 100% sure.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, John. And then on the specialty can side here in the U.S., you talked about your mix being 22% to 23% of your can production in the U.S. is specialty. Do you have an estimate of what that number is for the market?","John A. Hayes","Much less, much less. We'd lead the market relative to specialty container. So I don't know the number off the top of my head, but I'm going to guess it's probably half that.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And then how much more room do you see on your end to continue to improve the mix towards specialty? I mean, is there an upper bound that you see?","John A. Hayes","Well, yes, there is always an upper bound and one of the reasons why we improved is because we had less 12-ounce, as you know. We've been over the past number of years spending a lot of time on looking at new customers and new markets. The craft beer market is a good one with -- that I mentioned in my prepared remarks. Yes, it's a 12-ounce container, but it's a non-standard 12-ounce container that we'll be rolling out with that one customer. So there's a variety of opportunities there. You think about even on the CSD side and several years ago, there were none of these 7.5-ounce cans. And now they have really started to taken off, and even some of our big customers have publicly talked about double-digit growth there and their focus on it. So I think there's just a lot of opportunity in mainstream and in some of the more-unique categories where, historically, cans did not play a part of.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Interesting. My last question is on Brazil. Can you talk about how your customer base down there is beginning to prepare for the World Cup next year? And whether there's any preliminary implications of what that would mean for demand of the metal can relative to the glass bottle?","John A. Hayes","Yes, what I can tell you is there is a variety of beer customers. Virtually every beer company down there, a major one that we're aware of, are putting significant capital dollars towards canned filling. And we pay a very close attention to that. and I'm sure other people in the industry do. And so there's a good sense that there's going to be a focus on cans as we go into the World Cup.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citibank.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a follow-up on specialties. Granted volumes have been strong. When you look at the supply-demand balance in North America, given some of your competitors are adding specialty capacity as well and experiencing some of the same pressures in 12-ounce, is the margin premium or the return premium you get from specialties over commodity cans, has it been a fairly stable over the last year or is it, in some cases, expanding or contracting? Or is there any way that you can help us think about that?","John A. Hayes","No, it's reasonably stable. And it's important to   point out though, when we talk about specialty, it's not just one specialty size. We make everything from 5.8-ounce all the way up to 32-ounce, and we make approximately 20 different sizes. And so when you think about from a manufacturing perspective, when someone's putting in new specialty capacity, they may be putting in one particular size, and that has no effect on other sizes. So you just need to be conscious of that fact. But as, I think, we go forward, we are seeing a proliferation of sizes which creates complexity. And I think as a result of that, the supply and demand balance of that is relatively healthy right now.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just going back to North American beverage, is there any way that you can quantify the impact of the Gainesville shutdown? Or to -- what percentage of that capacity is going to be filled out of other existing facilities? Or is there any kind of way that you can quantify that?","Scott C. Morrison","Well, we moved some of that equipment into existing end facilities in North America. So we still needed to produce a decent number of those adds. So some of it is being redeployed in North America, and some of it is available to be deployed in other places.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","The majority of that capacity will be redeployed elsewhere?","John A. Hayes","Majority? About half.","Scott C. Morrison","Yes.","John A. Hayes","Yes, about half will be redeployed into existing facilities here in the U.S. which is actually already done. Remember, Gainesville is winding down right now. It's a very small staff and crew right now because the equipment has already been moved out and moved into other places here in North America. And the remaining equipment, as what Scott was saying, can be redeployed into other growth areas outside the United States.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I want to come back to the food can issue. And I think I know a little bit of what's behind it. But still food can contracts moving from one supplier to another on price in a market where there is no growth, smacks of the 1990s, and not in a good way. And so I recognize every year, there's probably a little bit of movement here and there, but do you sense that the food can market is taking a different turn in terms of competition from price standpoint than what we've seen here the last 10 years? And then the related question, I know it's early, could we assume that when that volume moves, that you'll be able to utilize the facilities to produce any number of products that you're making these days, that you weren't maybe making, say, 10, 15 years ago?","John A. Hayes","Yes. George, the first answer is no. We believe this to be an isolated event. Secondly, with our facilities, many of our facilities' tin plate, we have co-manufactured aerosol containers as well as food containers there. And Scott mentioned, we have some opportunities. We have some new technologies and new products that are coming down the pipe that we're going -- we are exploring. We haven't made any decision on that. And certainly in a fixed-cost business, a great way of leveraging your fixed cost is putting it into existing facilities.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And the last question, to the extent that you can comment, this new contract that you have in craft beer, is it a shaped can in any way? And is there any way to size the volume that's fully running?","John A. Hayes","Yes, it is. The can is a 12-ounce. It has a unique size on the end, which is different, and it will be in market shortly. I know there's pictures out there on the Internet. In terms of the growth opportunity, candidly, it's too early to tell. This is a new product that's getting out to the market. As you know, we have seen a lot of strong growth in the craft beer market. And when you go with a company the size of this one, starts to put their weight behind it, we just don't know what the opportunity is, but we think it's real important. If nothing else, because it's yet another further validation of the can has a place to play in a different market than it historically had.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Last time I seem to recall that you -- not last quarter, but just in the past, that when you buttoned-up some of your joint ventures in China that your share there was north of 30%. And we've been hearing about very strong growth in China. My question is, how much do you think the supply still exceeds the demand in the marketplace? In other words, what are operating rates? And if we continue to see recent growth rates, when do you think we get to a tighter condition there?","John A. Hayes","Yes. We talked about this on the first quarter call, I remember. And we said overcapacity and our estimation is in the range of 20% to 25%, and the overall market has been growing 10% to 15%. So it's probably about 2 years or so, maybe a little bit less, maybe a little bit more, depending on the growth of the market. We just had another quarter of reasonably strong growth in the industry, and which is generally consistent with what I talked about there. And so I don't think anything that we talked about on the first quarter has fundamentally changed.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Now, how about in terms of some of the smaller players? And maybe you can't be terribly specific, but do you sense that there is more a consolidation opportunity? Or do you think these guys are just going to wait it out?","John A. Hayes","I probably can't comment on that. But what I would tell you is, anytime there's overcapacity in a strong growth market, people -- the reason why there's overcapacity is people are investing ahead and then they realize that wasn't such a good idea. And if you're financially strong, you can probably weather it. If you're not financially strong, you probably have to think about alternatives.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a follow-up on the CapEx for the $400 million this year, how much of that is spoken for? Because I believe maintenance is like $200 million to $220 million, and then you have some carryover from last year. So -- I mean, how much wiggle room do you really have on that number?","Scott C. Morrison","Well, things can always slide to the right. I mean, if you recall last year, where we started CapEx estimation and then it came down through the year because a lot of things kind of slid to the right. And that's -- there's usually not much that gets canceled, it's probably more that gets shifted. And so it just slows -- we slow down the pace of it.","John A. Hayes","Yes, I would say, all things equal, relative to last year though, a little bit more of it is committed because it was the carryover from last year.","Scott C. Morrison","Yes, so we had a lot of things that -- we've announced the Alagoinhas line in January. So much of that capital will get spent this year as it comes up and running in hopefully by the end of the third quarter. Like some of the specialty things that we've done in the U.S., those things are going to happen. So it's probably less potential to have huge shifts in that capital, I would agree with that.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So as we think about the number last year around $300 million, as we look forward beyond this year and kind of ignore the carryover impacts, is that realistically kind of the real floor for how low CapEx would go?","Scott C. Morrison","No, it really is dependent on the opportunities. I mean, every one is a discrete decision that is determined by the customer contract . We talked about Europe, we need to do some things in Europe on the cost side before we commit to expanding capacity there. We're still seeing decent growth in markets like Brazil, and North American specialty, and even China continues to grow well while we're not adding any capacity, we get pricing better there. So we're still seeing growth opportunities, but I wouldn't say it's necessarily a floor or a ceiling, because it depends on the opportunities that are there.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then my other question on free cash flow is, this is the third straight year we're seeing guidance for significant working capital benefits. So is this -- at what point do we reach saturation on those opportunities versus -- is this still like a multiyear opportunity for you?","Scott C. Morrison","Well, we're not done yet. So I would say we're still expecting some benefits in '13, and then we'll see -- a lot of the guys kind of across the businesses and treasury and a lot of different sourcing, and then the businesses have been very creative as to how we go after this. And we're -- it's kind of like an ongoing treadmill, you're never really done.","John A. Hayes","Yes. As you know, we're evangelical on EVA dollars. And historically, we have focused on EBIT and CapEx. And what Scott is really talking about is we see opportunities on the working capital line, and we're going after them.","Operator","We do have a follow-up question from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","One last one, and piggybacking on Chip's question earlier and your comments as well early in the presentation. Perhaps you mentioned it, but how do we reconcile you using an ability perhaps to optimize your customer mix? That's my phrasing, not yours, but paraphrasing, in China with an intent towards perhaps repricing when you still have, from your vantage point, excess capacity in the market?","John A. Hayes","Well, it's -- I'm talking only on behalf of Ball, and we're sold out. And so if things get tight and customers need more cans, we're going to be looking at where it makes sense for Ball to be selling those cans that are scarce to us.","Operator","Mr. Hayes, there are no further questions at the time.","John A. Hayes","Okay, great. Well, thank you very much, Daisy, and thank you, everyone. I just have one reminder that we're going to be hosting an Investor Day and a management briefing in Midtown Manhattan on October 2 and 3. Analysts and institutional investors should contact Ann Scott for an invitation. And thank you for participating on today's call, and we look forward to talking to you in 3 months time.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line."]}}
