[Operator instructions.]","For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. David Baggs, vice president of capital markets and investor relations for CSX Corporation. Sir, you may begin.","David Baggs","Thank you, operator, and again, good morning everyone, and welcome again to CSX Corporation\u2019s fourth quarter 2013 earnings presentation. The presentation material that we\u2019ll review this morning, along with our quarterly financial report and our safety and service measurements, are available on our website at csx.com under the Investors section. In addition, following the presentation, a webcast and podcast replay will be available on that same website.","Here representing CSX this morning are Michael Ward, the company\u2019s chairman, president, and chief executive officer; Clarence Gooden, chief sales and marketing officer; Fredrik Eliasson, chief financial officer; and calling from another location is Oscar Munoz, chief operating officer.","Now, before we begin the formal part of our program, let me remind everyone that the presentation and other statements made by the company contain forward-looking statements. You are encouraged to review the company\u2019s disclosure on the accompanying presentation on slide two. The disclosure identifies forward-looking statements as well as risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance to differ materially from the results anticipated by these statements.","In addition, let me also remind everyone that at the end of the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session with the research analysts. That said, with approximately 30 analysts covering CSX, I would ask, as a courtesy for everyone, to please limit your inquiries to one primary and one follow-up question.","And with that, let me turn the presentation over to CSX Corporation\u2019s chairman, president, and chief executive officer, Michael Ward. Michael?","Michael Ward ","Well, thank you, David, and good morning everyone. Last evening, CSX reported fourth quarter earnings per share of $0.42, down $0.44 in the same period last year, which included $0.06 of favorable real estate gains. Revenue grew 5% in the quarter, where the ongoing headwinds in coal were more than offset by broad-based growth in our merchandise and intermodal markets, reflecting an economy that is expanding.","In addition, operations were resilient, even with the volume increase and the challenging winter weather at the end of the quarter as we activated additional resources to keep the network fluid and service levels high.","Finally, operating income was $813 million, essentially unchanged from last year, and the operating ratio was 73.2%, up 140 basis points. While we delivered a solid quarter from a top line and operational perspective, you can see that the revenue growth did not flow through to the bottom line as much as we would have liked.","That is because there were a number of moving parts on the expense side between 2013 to 2012 that reduced the normal flow-through we would have expected from the $137 million revenue gain. Fredrik will review this in more detail later in the presentation.","Turning to our full year results, on the next page, earnings per share were $1.83, up slightly from $1.79 in 2012. Revenue increased $263 million, or 2%, to a record $12 billion. This reflects the underlying strength of our merchandise and intermodal businesses, which more than offset the decline in coal of nearly $300 million.","Service levels remain strong, and the team exceeded its efficiency target, delivering $158 million of savings. For the year, we produced operating income of $3.5 billion, which was slightly up from last year, and an operating ratio of 71.1%.","As we go through today\u2019s presentation, you\u2019ll continue to see the results of a team that\u2019s managing through challenges and is well-positioned to create sustainable long term value for customers and shareholders.","Now I\u2019ll turn the presentation over to Clarence, who will take us through the top line results in more detail. Clarence? ","Clarence Gooden ","Thank you, Michael, and good morning. As you can see on the left side of the chart, total volume grew 6% and approached 1.7 million loads in the quarter, with mixed performance among the diverse markets we serve. Growth in the merchandise and intermodal markets was partially offset by a decline in coal volume. As a result, merchandise and intermodal now combine for 83% of CSX\u2019s volume.","Moving to the right, total revenue increased $137 million to over $3 billion in the quarter, reflecting overall volume growth and price increases across most markets. Looking at the bottom of this panel, merchandise and intermodal now combine for over three quarters of CSX\u2019s overall revenue.","Next, revenue per unit remained relatively flat. The impact of core pricing gains and liquidated damages was partially offset by the unfavorable mix impact related to the growth in intermodal versus the decline in coal.","Finally, core pricing on a same-store sales basis remained solid across nearly all markets. Recall that same-store sales are defined as shipments with the same customer, commodity, and car type, and the same margin and destination. These shipments represented nearly 80% of CSX\u2019s traffic base for the quarter.","On this basis, all-in core pricing was 1.6% in the quarter, consistent with what we saw in the fourth quarter of 2012, reflecting continued rate pressure in the export coal market and more modest increases in domestic coal pricing.","Since we continue to have greater variability in both our export and domestic coal business, reflecting global conditions and our fixed variable contract structure, and since our merchandise and intermodal markets are becoming a larger portion of our business, we have again provided you with the same-store sales pricing for these two markets on a combined basis.","At the bottom of this panel, you can see core pricing for these markets averaged 2.9% for the quarter. This is roughly flat with what we reported in the third quarter, despite lower rail inflation, which is embedded in many of our contract [escalators]. We remain confident that the value created by our service product for our customers provides a solid foundation for growth and pricing above rail inflation over the long term.","Now let\u2019s look at the individual markets in more detail, starting with coal. Coal revenue declined 9% in the quarter to $679 million. Domestic coal tonnage declined 9%, impacted by continued high stockpiles in our service territory. Export coal tonnage increased 6%, as shipments of metallurgical coal increased compared to a weak prior year quarter. Finally, total revenue per unit was down 4%, with lower export pricing more than offsetting domestic pricing gains.","Next, let\u2019s look at the merchandise business. Overall, merchandise revenue increased 10% to over $1.8 billion in the quarter. Volume in the agricultural sector was up 5%. Feed grain shipments, both domestic and export, increased sharply due to a strong 2013 harvest. In addition, ethanol shipments grew as lower corn prices resulted in higher ethanol productions.","The construction sector grew 4% overall, as the continued recovery of the residential housing market drove increased shipments of building products. In addition, industrial waste volumes were strong, due to an increase in shipments associated with large-scale remediation projects. Finally, the industrial sector was up 10% on the strength of energy-related commodities including crude oil, liquefied petroleum gas, and frac sand. ","Moving to the next page, let\u2019s review our intermodal business. Intermodal revenue increased 10% to $437 million. Domestic volume was up nearly 13%, setting a new quarterly CSX record, driven by growth with our existing customers and continued highway to rail conversions.","International volume was up 9% year over year on growth for the existing customers, new service offerings, and a favorable comparison to the fourth quarter of 2012, when shipments were disrupted by Hurricane Sandy.","Total intermodal revenue per unit declined 1% as continued solid core pricing gains were more than offset by the lower fuel recovery mix. Finally, 90% of our intermodal traffic is now moving in lanes that are double stack cleared. That number will continue to grow through strategic network investments, most significantly the Virginia Avenue tunnel clearance project in Washington, DC.","Now let\u2019s turn to the outlook for the first quarter. Looking forward, we expect stable to favorable conditions for over 90% of our markets, and the overall volume outlook for the first quarter is positive. ","Looking at some of the key markets, agriculture is favorable, with higher year over year crop yields supporting continued growth in grain shipments. The outlook for the automotive market is also favorable, as North American light vehicle production continues to grow. ","We expect growth in chemicals, as we continue to capture opportunities created by the expanding domestic oil and gas industry. We expect our domestic coal volume will grow in the first quarter, as we cycle our relatively weak first quarter in 2013. At the same time, our outlook for full year domestic coal volume is neutral, but the average length of haul will be shorter this year, and will contribute to a lower overall revenue per unit. ","The continued expansion in U.S. housing and construction markets will drive growth of forest products and in our mineral markets. Strong intermodal growth will continue as our strategic network investments and service reliability support highway to rail conversions. The outlook for our phosphate and fertilizer volumes is neutral due to high inventory levels and volatile commodity pricing, which produces uncertainty in the market.","Finally, export coal. Volume is expected to decline in the first quarter, and our best estimate for 2014 volume is in the mid 30 million ton range, reflecting soft global market conditions, particularly in the thermal market. At the same time, rail pricing will remain low in order to help keep U.S. coal competitive globally and optimize our bottom line.","Now I\u2019ll wrap up on the next slide. The expansion of the U.S. economy is expected to continue with projected GDP and IDP growth of 2.7% and 3% respectively. In addition, both the ISM purchasing managers and the customer inventory indices point to continued expansion in 2014.","Looking at the full year, our merchandise and intermodal volumes are expected to grow faster than the overall economy, with gains offsetting the continued headwinds in coal, particularly the export market. ","Our intermodal business is expected to be the major growth engine for CSX going forward as we look to further tap into an estimated 9 million truckload opportunity, which allies very well with our network by leveraging a strong service product, our highway to rail or H2R initiative, and strategic investments in both terminal and network capacity.","For example, in 2014 we will complete our new terminal in Montreal and expand the capacity of the northwest Ohio intermodal hub. Finally, the value of the service we provide continues to support both growth and pricing above rail inflation over the long term.","Thank you, and now I\u2019ll turn the presentation over to Oscar to review our operating results.","Oscar Munoz ","Thank you, Clarence, and good morning everyone. I\u2019m pleased to report that 2013 was a year highlighted by an industry leading safety record, consistent high levels of service for our customers, and continued efficiency gains.","As you know, safety is our first and foremost priority. In 2013 CSX continued to evolve its public and employee safety programs, leading the industry in both personal injury and training accident frequency rates. ","While we are pleased with those accomplishments, we are saddened by the loss of four employees last year, and are committed to avoid such tragedies, and to keep all of our employees and the communities in which we work safe.","Let me turn now turn to the company\u2019s operating performance. While overall performance remains strong, some of the measures were down slightly in the fourth quarter, both for CSX and the rest of the industry. This is in part due to more challenging weather conditions at the end of 2013, combined with strong volume levels driven by the record grain harvest, food oil shipments, and peak intermodal loads.","Looking at our network measures, velocity held fairly constant and [dwell] improved once again in the fourth quarter. This is evidence of our strong asset utilization and ability to keep the network fluid in the face of difficult operating conditions. ","Now, before I turn to my resource management discussion, on the next slide, let me just quickly express my gratitude to all the field personnel at CSX for their professionalism, drive, and extra efforts to serve our customers safely and efficiently during these last few challenging weeks. Thank you all.","Now, turning to slide 15, carloads were up 6% and gross ton miles were up 6.5% in the quarter, as we saw strong growth in customer shipments. Moving down the chart, you can see that resource counts were up significantly less than volume, driving continued efficiency gains.","Road crew starts were only up about 3.5%, primarily as a result of growth in unit [train] commodities such as grain and crude oil. The active locomotive count was up 3%, largely due to higher volume as overall efficiency improved once again. ","Looking sequentially, the active locomotive count rose by approximately 150 units from the third to the fourth quarter to handle the increased volume. In fact, we had anticipated even more savings from locomotive productivity as we had seen earlier in the year but made the conscious decision to keep these locomotives active to support more fluid operations.","Furthermore, we have retained these units and service in the early part of 2014 to provide extra recoverability during the especially harsh early winter. As the year progresses, we will continue to flex our resources as quickly as possible based on volume, service demands, and of course operating conditions.","Finally, total operations employment was essentially flat in the quarter, reflecting significant improvements in employee efficiency against the volume gains in the quarter.","Let\u2019s now look at full year efficiency savings on slide 16. As a result of the operating team\u2019s tremendous focus to deliver productivity while maintaining high service levels, CSX generated $158 million of efficiency savings in 2013, in line with our guidance. ","The most significant cost savings in the year came from fuel efficiency initiatives, crew productivity, and improved locomotive utilization. Further, I am pleased to tell you today that we once again have good line of sight to specific initiatives for further savings and expect to generate over $130 million of efficiency savings in 2014.","Now let me wrap up on the next slide. CSX\u2019s primary focus remains ensuring that all our employees and the communities we work in stay safe. Service remains at high levels, and customer satisfaction is at an all-time high. CSX recently received a record score in a third-party survey of our customers, eclipsing 2012\u2019s previous high. We will build on this success to continue providing flexible solutions for our customers to enable growth while improving our asset utilization.","Lastly, as I mentioned, I\u2019m very pleased with the operating team\u2019s delivery of over $150 million in savings in 2013 and feel very confident about our ability to generate another year of at least $130 million of savings in 2014.","So with that, let me turn the presentation over to Fredrik to review the financials. ","Fredrik Eliasson ","Thank you, Oscar, and good morning everyone. Looking at the top line, revenue increased 5% in the fourth quarter as gains in merchandise and intermodal continue to offset the decline in coal. Expenses increased 7% versus last year, as increased labor, MS&O, and depreciation costs more than offset favorability in fuel and rent.","Operating income was $813 million, down $2 million versus the prior year. Looking below the line, interest expense was down $6 million versus last year, driven by modestly lower debt levels and favorable interest rates on debt that was refinanced in 2013.","Other income declined $59 million, primarily driven by the cycling of a $57 million pretax gain on the sale of a nonoperating property in the fourth quarter of 2012. Income taxes were $248 million in the quarter, for an effective tax rate of approximately 37%.","Overall, net earnings were $426 million, and EPS was $0.42 per share, down from $449 million and $0.44, respectively, from the prior year period. The prior year period has been revised and includes a revenue adjustment which increased EPS of $0.01 a share, the details of which are disclosed in the quarterly financial report.","As we turn to the next slide, let\u2019s briefly discuss how fuel lag impacted the quarter. On a year over year basis, the effect of the lag in our fuel surcharge program was $2 million favorable. This reflects $7 million of positive in-quarter lag during the fourth quarter of 2013 versus $5 million of positive in-quarter lag for the same period in the prior year. Based on the current forward curve, we would expect the year over year fuel lag impact to be roughly flat in the first quarter. ","Turning to the next slide, let\u2019s review our expenses. Overall expenses increased 7% in the quarter. I will talk about the top three expense items in more detail on the next slide, but let me first briefly speak to the bottom two on this chart.","Depreciation was up 4% to $281 million, due to the increase in the net asset base. Looking at 2014, we anticipate depreciation to be up around $10 million on a year over year basis in each quarter.","Equipment rent was down 2% to $95 million as efficiency more than offset higher volume related costs.","Now let\u2019s discuss our other expenses, starting with labor and fringe on the left. Labor and fringe expense increased 7% or $51 million versus last year on higher incentive compensation, volume related costs associated with the 6.5% increase in gross ton miles, and inflation.","Looking at 2014, we currently expect employee levels to remain roughly flat. In addition, we expect labor inflation to increase around $15 million to $20 million on a year over year basis in each quarter. We also expect full year incentive compensation to no longer be a headwind.","Moving to the right of the slide, MS&O expense increased 17% or $93 million versus last year, driven by the cycling of $35 million of real estate gains recognized in 2012, as well as $31 million increase in expenses related to higher volume and resource levels.","Moving down the table, inflation was up $11 million, and lastly, lower derailment related expenses were more than offset by unfavorable year over year casualty adjustments, netting to a cost increase of $16 million.","Looking at the first half of 2014, MS&O expense will continue to be impacted by the cycling of real estate gains, which as a reminder total $49 million in the first quarter and $36 million in the second quarter of 2013. In addition, we expect higher year over year expenses related to inflation and volume growth.","Lastly, fuel expense decreased 3%, or $13 million, versus last year, as favorable price, driven by a 7% decline in our fuel price per gallon, and an improvement in efficiency more than offset higher volume related costs.","Looking back on the quarter as a whole, CSX delivered strong top line performance. However, the $137 million revenue increase did not flow through the bottom line as we would normally expect, reflecting difficult expense comparisons.","Most notably, headwinds in real estate gains, incentive compensation, and net casualty cost combined to lower operating income by $75 million year over year. As we look at 2014, and we finish cycling our real estate gains in the first half, we expect to once again be able to deliver earnings growth in the second half.","With that, let\u2019s turn to CSX\u2019s full year results on the next slide. On a full year basis, revenue was up 2% to just over $12 billion, as volume growth in merchandise and intermodal, pricing gains, and higher liquidated damages more than offset coal revenue declines. ","Total expense for the year was up 3%, as higher inflation, volume related costs, incentive compensation, and depreciation were partially offset by productivity savings. As a result, full year operating income was up slightly year over year while the operating ratio was 71.1% versus 70.6% in the prior year.","Finally, earnings per share increased 2%, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program. Here again, prior quarters have been revised for a revenue adjustment. As a result of the adjustment, there was no net impact for the full year 2012, while full year 2013 decreased by $0.02 per share, the details of which are disclosed in the quarterly financial report.","Now let\u2019s discuss some of the key drivers of CSX\u2019s full year performance. Challenges in our coal business resulted in 2013 being another transition year for CSX. The company lost $295 million of coal revenue in 2013 after losing over $500 million in 2012. We are pleased that we\u2019ve been able to deliver modest earnings per share growth in each of the last two years, despite facing such steep headwinds in our coal business.","2013 was made even more challenging by several other headwinds outside of coal, including higher incentive compensation and lower real estate gains, which totaled nearly $130 million relative to 2012. These higher costs were partially offset by higher liquidated damages due to customer contractual shortfalls. As a result, the net year over year impact of these other items was about $40 million unfavorable.","However, CSX continued to execute well on the things that are more within our control. We generated efficiency savings in excess of inflation, delivered industry leading safety results, and achieved notable improvements in customer satisfaction. ","Strong service allowed CSX to capitalize on key secular growth trends such as increasing demand for oil and gas related shipments and the condition highway to rail conversion east of the Mississippi. These trends combined with broader economic growth to drive nearly $485 million in incremental merchandise and intermodal revenue in 2013. ","Looking forward, we believe that maintaining superior service levels for our customers will enable merchandise and intermodal to collectively grow at a pace exceeding broader economic activity long term. As a result of this growth opportunity, we remain committed to reinvesting in our business, which we will discuss further on the next slide.","In 2014, CSX plans to invest $2.3 billion in our business, flat to 2013. In the chart on the left, you can see that over half the capital spending in 2014 will again be used to maintain core infrastructure to help ensure safe and fluid network. In addition, our equipment investment in locomotive and freight cars ensures CSX has the appropriate level of rolling stock to support commercial demand projections.","We will also continue to focus on strategic investments that support long term profitable growth and productivity initiatives that improve the returns on the business. Finally, positive train control, which in total is still expected to cost $1.7 billion, represents $300 million of spending in 2014, leaving approximately $500 million to be spent in the coming years to complete the project.","Profitable reinvestment in our business is just one part of a balanced approach to [cash] performance. Let\u2019s turn to slide 26 to discuss the other two, dividends and share buybacks. CSX paid dividends of $0.59 per share in 2013, up 9% versus the prior year and built on the 11 increases we had made over the last eight years. Going forward, CSX remains committed to a dividend payout range of 30% to 35% of trailing 12-month earnings, and this will be reviewed annually after the first quarter. ","Moving to the right, CSX repurchased $353 million over the course of the year and is on track to complete its current $1 billion authorization by the beginning of the second quarter of 2015. Collectively, CSX has now repurchased $4.1 billion of shares since the start of 2010 and $8.3 billion of shares since the beginning of 2006, the latter representing over one-third of total shares outstanding.","Now let me wrap up on the next slide. Despite a modest setback in the operating ratio in 2013, CSX remains on track to achieve a high 60s operating ratio by 2015. Moreover, our focus on efficiency improvements, profitable volume growth, and pricing above rail inflation will keep us on the right path to sustain a mid 60s operating ratio longer term.","However, achieving a 10-15% EPS CAGR over the next two years will clearly be more challenging than we envisioned in early 2013 for two key reasons. First, 2013 benefited from favorable items, most notably liquidated damages and real estate gains, which we do not expect to occur at the same rate over the next two years. ","As a result, we are starting with a higher 2013 base than was originally anticipated. In addition, as we have discussed on prior calls, our EPS guidance was based on the expectation that total coal revenue would be flat over the 2013-2015 time period. Unfortunately, coming into 2014 both domestic and export coal markets have not stabilized to the extent we had originally anticipated.","As such, we currently expect additional year over year coal revenue declines in 2014. As a result, coal revenues will now need to improve in 2015 for us to achieve the low end of our EPS guidance. ","Despite this challenge, we continue to believe that coal will stabilize as it settles into its new role within our nation\u2019s energy portfolio. When this happens, we are confident that CSX\u2019s ability to price above rail inflation, drive efficiency improvements, and grow profitably, will combine to once again drive sustainable double digit earnings per share growth.","With that, let me turn the presentation back to Michael for his closing remarks. ","Michael Ward ","Thank you, Fredrik. In 2013 our team once again demonstrated the ability to manage through the volatility of the marketplace by focusing on the things we control the most and delivering value for customers and shareholders. ","As we look to the year ahead, we see broad-based growth across most of our markets. While the headwinds in coal will persist in 2014, CSX\u2019s merchandise and intermodal markets, which now collectively represent 83% of our volume, are expected to grow at a rate higher than the overall economy. ","Over the past four years alone, these markets have collectively added $2.7 billion of revenue to our top line and allowed CSX to still produce earnings growth while going through the evolution in the energy markets. Continued growth in these markets, along with greater efficiency and inflation plus pricing that reflects the value of our service, will help us grow profitably long term.","Fredrik mentioned earlier that this is another transition year for CSX as we adjust to the new energy environment. But when I look to the future, I see a vibrant business with a diverse portfolio capable of sustaining double digit earnings growth long term. I\u2019m confident we can capitalize on the momentum before us as the economy continues to grow, and as the nation increasingly recognizes the economic and environmental benefits of rail transportation.","And now we\u2019ll be glad to take your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] And our first question comes from Mr. William Greene of Morgan Stanley.","William Greene - Morgan Stanley","Clarence, maybe I can start with you, just on some of the volume commentary. Very good volume trends in the fourth quarter. But how do we think about that sustaining? You went through a lot of positives in terms of the buckets that you discussed here. The strength so far this year, though, hasn\u2019t been there. So can you sort of scrape apart the weather from the underlying, and talk a little bit about how you feel the underlying freight environment looks for you? Does it feel like it\u2019s accelerating, or just kind of stable? Because we saw an acceleration in the first quarter. ","Michael Ward ","I would describe it as this: The first two weeks were essentially, from a freight standpoint, a non-event due to the weather impact that occurred as you\u2019re aware. We had severe weather across the north end of our railroad. A lot of freight was backed up. ","My view is that by the end of the quarter we will have recovered any of that revenue and freight that we would have lost. In fact, just this week, when we report our numbers for the week, you\u2019ll find that our volumes have picked up significantly. So on the first part of your question, I feel very positive as we move into the first part of this year.","And looking forward into this year, the economic indicators that I see show a moderately expanding U.S. economy. And so I feel good that we can continue both in our intermodal area and our agricultural area, and in our chemical areas, both traditional chemicals and those that are related to the oil and gas exploration industry. I feel very positive in those regards. So I think we\u2019re going to have a very good 2014.","William Greene - Morgan Stanley ","","So given that outlook, how soon is it before you can start to push a little bit harder on the pricing where things are strong? We understand the coal challenges, but when you look at the areas of strength, how long does it take before the market will start to allow you to price higher, so accelerating pricing in those segments?","Michael Ward ","Our pricing last quarter, as you know, at 2.9 on all commodities or merchandise and intermodal commodities excluding coal, could have been slightly higher, somewhere in the 3.2 area, had the impact of [RCAS] in the fourth quarter not have been negative. ","So we feel like we\u2019re pricing, except for that coal, near what we would view as what long term inflation is, which is 3% to 4%. Current inflation, last year, as you know, came in very low. And the current projection for inflation by Global Insights - it came out on January 14 - is at 1.5%. So with the pricing that we already have in place, you\u2019ll see our pricing start to firm up here in 2014. ","Now, where we have longer term contracts, that may take six months, nine months, until they come up for renewal before you\u2019ll see the impact on those. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Mr. Anthony Gallo with Wells Fargo.","Anthony Gallo - Wells Fargo ","I actually have a crew by rail question. It looks like there might be some regulatory changes coming, largely focused on the tank car itself. And I\u2019m curious if there\u2019s a grace period, so to speak, to retrofit some of these general purpose cars. Do you need to think differently about your pricing, or more specifically your liability exposure, on some of those older cars that may or may not meet the new regulations?","Oscar Munoz ","Clearly from a tank car standard perspective, there are many discussions and conversations going about that. As we move forward, clearly we will take all of that into account and working with our regulators and our customers try to ensure that we have the best sort of footstep going forward.","Anthony Gallo - Wells Fargo ","It might be a guess at this point, that the changes will not be material, so there will be some higher cost, but not material enough to really change the trajectory of that business? Is that a fair way to think about it at this point?","Oscar Munoz ","It\u2019s hard to say at this point in time. I think those standards are under review under the PHMSA organization, and I think as we get information from them, we\u2019ll get a better sense of that. ","Michael Ward ","You do know, these cars are largely owned by the customers or leasing companies. And at least there\u2019s some speculation out there that there may be some requirements for retrofits. There\u2019s been various discussions of how much those retrofits should be. So again, it will probably be a number of months if that evolves. But our guess is that the required expense, while large, won\u2019t impact our ability to move this [crude] by rail. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Mr. Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","Oscar, the on-time arrivals and delayed departures slipped a bit, it looks like, year over year. And just wondering, how, when you think about the $130 million of productivity costs, how that impacts, I guess, the goal of ultimately what Michael was talking about in terms of double digit earnings growth? So is the productivity and operation and performance part of that goal? Or is that outside of that cycle?","Oscar Munoz ","No, productivity has always been part of our overall goal. And as we discuss the fourth quarter, you just have to keep in mind that we experienced one of the first true fall peaks in recent memory with the strong growth across all the markets that Clarence discussed. ","And while we did have some modest impact to, as you mentioned, departures and arrivals when the harsh weather arrived, and we had a couple of derailments in critical spots, all the things that an outdoor [unintelligible] railroading eventually faces, I\u2019m very confident, incredibly confident, we can continue to improve our service and operate safely while we get the productivity. Those initiatives that we have for next year are very much aligned, and the objectives are being worked by the team. So it\u2019s part of the overall goal, and we have great lines of sight to them. ","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","And if I could just get a follow up, Clarence mentioned targeting flat domestic coal. After a 10% dip this quarter, I just wonder, is there something changing or comps or a lost contract or anything else that\u2019s in there that gives the confidence that we\u2019re going to see on the domestic [unintelligible] side move back to flat?","Michael Ward ","On the first quarter, we think it will actually be up on a year over year basis, because of our own weak comparables. Last year\u2019s first quarter was weak. On the full year basis, we think we\u2019ve seen coal start to bottom out is point number one. ","Point number two is, if this weather continues the way it is, the utility stockpiles will continue to draw down. Those in the south are not yet at normal levels, but they are continuing to drop. Those that are in the north are at normal levels, and with some business additions and all that we were able to pick up here in the first of the year, that was the whole point that I tried to make with you, that you could expect, particularly because of some moves we have in our northern region, shorter lengths of hauls, which in turn would produce a lower RPU. ","Operator","And our next question comes from Mr. Brandon Oglenski of Barclays.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays","Clarence, if I could follow up from Ken\u2019s question there. So you did mention the shorter length of haul impacting RPU, but can you also discuss, in the past you\u2019ve highlighted that you\u2019ve renegotiated a significant portion of your domestic contracts this year. And that, along with I think your commentary around export pricing was you\u2019re going to try to keep freight a little bit lower. So how should we think about how those new contracts, along with the lower export environment, is going to impact overall coal RPU heading forward? ","Clarence Gooden ","Well, without getting into the details of our contract discussions with our customers, because each one is different, what we\u2019ve done is try to focus on optimizing our bottom line. And I feel pretty good about where we\u2019ve ended up. I did mention to you that we will have, as a result of some of those negotiations, a shorter length of haul in our traffic this year. And you can expect the export rates will remain low until the market itself changes, particularly the thermal market in Europe. ","So we feel like we\u2019re coming out of here pretty good. About a year ago, we told you that about 25% of our utility contracts were under the fixed variable structure. Some of our customers have not chosen to go to the fixed variable, but now about 35% of our utility business is under the fixed variable. ","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays ","And Fredrik, on the MS&O line, I realize you\u2019re lacking the real estate sales gains, but it did seem a little bit higher on a sequential basis. Can you talk about some of the drivers of that increase, and how we should be thinking about MS&O in 2014?","Fredrik Eliasson ","Sequentially, from the third quarter, we did see a little bit of impact of higher train accidents in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. We also clearly saw the impact of volume. And it was also one of those quarters where we saw a fair amount of SG&A expenses all moving in the wrong direction, from bad debt and some other things. So a lot of things went the wrong way. And some impact from weather there as well, I would say. So sequentially it was a tough quarter. ","As I think about 2014, I would say in the first quarter, you know that overall, MS&O is the hardest one to forecast, but if you start with last year\u2019s performance, which I think was around 510 or so, you add the $50 million of real estate gains that we don\u2019t have here in the first quarter of 2014, add inflation, and look at headcount, which is roughly flat, maybe up 1% or so based on what we\u2019re seeing, and some weather impact, probably a good starting point. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be, at least not at this point, I don\u2019t expect it to be as high as it was here in the fourth quarter. But it\u2019s clearly going to be higher than what you saw last year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Chris Wetherbee of Citi.","Chris Wetherbee - Citi "," ","Oscar, just on the resource levels, as you turn the page into the first quarter, we\u2019ve still had some weather kind of persist for a while. Should we expect the same types of resource levels to address the volume growth that Clarence is expecting in the first quarter? Just want to get a rough sense of how we\u2019re thinking about the transition from 4Q into the first quarter.","Oscar Munoz ","I think the way to think about it, and the way we have thought about it, is we forecast most of this volume increase, and have been preparing for it. Our pipeline of engineers and conductors is well in line. We\u2019ve got roughly a thousand people coming out over here. And our peak period of [TTMs] is weeks 9 through 23. So we\u2019ve been planning for this for some time. So the resources that we\u2019ve raised, primarily locomotives and engineers and conductor work, I think will stay relatively static. We\u2019ve got all the people in place, and we\u2019re waiting and continuing to deliver on this great business that\u2019s coming our way. So no real change.","Chris Wetherbee - Citi ","And then just thinking bigger picture, for the first half of \u201914, when you have some real estate issues and some liquidated damages to overcome, do you have the ability, do you think, to grow earnings power, or grow earnings in the first half of the year? Is that something we should be thinking about more sort of back half once you eclipse some of these headwinds you have? I guess I just want to think about that from a bigger picture, when you think about the growth potential in contracts, that double digit small return, once coal stabilizes.","Fredrik Eliasson ","Let me just answer your question as far as earnings for 2014 first. And we laid out our longer term guidance in terms of the fact that we still have visibility into the low end of the guidance. We\u2019re going to need some help from coal. ","But in 2014 specifically, I would say that we do expect earnings growth in 2014, but it is going to be predominantly in the second half of the year. I would say the first half of the year, because of the headwinds, with real estate gains and also cycling the full effect of the lower prices we have in our export coal business, I would say the best place to think about the first half is probably earnings to be flat to slightly down. But for the full year, we do expect earnings to grow. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Ms. Allison Landry of Credit Suisse.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse ","Following up on that last question, I wanted to ask about your confidence level for full year domestic coal to be flat. And specifically, if the key embedded assumption is that stockpiles normalize at some point in the year, you know, end of summer or by the close of the year, and really what I\u2019m getting at is the stockpile situation a potential swing factor that could compromise your ability to grow earnings for the full year?","Clarence Gooden ","I don\u2019t think so at all. I think those stockpiles will be normalized here and coal will have bottomed out somewhere by the middle of the year. And I expect if anything, there\u2019s more positive to it than downside.","Michael Ward","And if you saw any of this, it would be in the export market, right?","Clarence Gooden ","That\u2019s right.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse ","So below normal summer, that shouldn\u2019t have any impact, if that was to occur?","Clarence Gooden ","Below normal summer? Meaning a cooler summer?","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse ","Yes.","Clarence Gooden ","It could, but I don\u2019t expect it to.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse ","And then just as a follow up question, on I believe it was slide 12, there\u2019s a comment that says \u201cpricing to remain above rail inflation for the long term.\u201d Is there any inference here that this may not be the case for 2014?","Clarence Gooden ","No, there is no inference that that is the case for 2014.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Justin Yagerman with Deutsche Bank.","Justin Yagerman - Deutsche Bank ","It feels like, to some extent, if I go back several years, we were talking about pricing above inflation, when you guys had legacy and you had the ability to kind of command that kind of pricing in the coal industry. And now we\u2019re talking about pricing above inflation ex coal. And I realize that coal has been lower as a percent of revenue, but in terms of just the absolute statement of we need to price above inflation, do you feel like you\u2019ve lost control of that because of the change in the coal market? And is there a way to get that back in your other markets, whereby you can make that statement independent of coal?","Clarence Gooden ","Coal\u2019s going to depend on a multiple series of events. The export side of coal is going to be dealing with what is the demand, both on the thermal side and the metallurgical side, and it\u2019s a globally traded commodity. So as it goes up, we\u2019re going to go up with it in terms of pricing. And as it goes down, we\u2019re going to go down to what we feel is a floor level that we\u2019ll go down to in our pricing on that.","And the other markets, I think our record has been that we have consistently priced in the 3% plus area over the last few quarters here, and I see no reason for that not to continue. In fact, if the economy does what some economists have been predicting, just as recently as yesterday, with the release of the Beige Book, saying that in most sectors of the United States the economy was growing modestly, then our pricing power comes back even stronger.","Michael Ward ","I\u2019d like to add a little bit to that. So if I think about the value creation we did over let\u2019s call it the 2004 to 2012 period, as you know, same-store sales was running at about 6.5% per year. Obviously in the last couple of years, it\u2019s been more in that 3% to 4% range. And the trees don\u2019t grow the sky. We were not going to get 6.5% forever, but we think that 3% to 4% is very sustainable over time. ","Because if I think about our business, we create a lot of value through pricing and through productivity. Going forward, we\u2019ve still got to have the above inflation pricing, which we\u2019re very confident of. We have to have the productivity, which we\u2019re very confident of, and we need to add that third element, which is growth. And if you look over the last four years, we\u2019ve grown in merchandise and intermodal $2.7 billion, and it\u2019s been somewhat masked that we\u2019ve been able to grow this because of that dramatic decline in coal. But as that coal stabilizes, I think those will be the three value creators, growth in intermodal and merchandise, continued productivity, and pricing above inflation.","Justin Yagerman - Deutsche Bank ","And I appreciate that. I\u2019m not looking to minimize what you guys have done in the past, or with the other pieces of the business. I guess what I\u2019m trying to get at is that 3% to 4% in the last couple of years, that\u2019s a 3% to 4% net of coal. If you look at it with coal in, it\u2019s significantly lower than that. So is there a way to talk about 3% to 4%, if that\u2019s kind of the inflation hurdle all in, even without coal changing?","Michael Ward ","I understand what you\u2019re asking. So if I look at the coal business, obviously it\u2019s been in a pretty dramatic transformation here, and we\u2019ve been adapting to that. And obviously the pricing has been a little weaker, especially on the export side. But as the coal stabilizes, the coal based utility plants that are there are going to be required to keep the lights on, and I think our normal pricing within coal will resume as we go forward. ","The export market is always going to be more volatile. We think it\u2019s volatile at a higher tonnage level, but clearly that\u2019s the part that\u2019s going to be the most variable. So we\u2019re going to be up some in up times and down some in down times in the export, but the domestic, once we get this reset, we\u2019ll have what I call normal pricing power. ","Justin Yagerman - Deutsche Bank ","And just a quick housekeeping question, Clarence, how much of the domestic utility book is up for negotiation this year? And how much do you think you\u2019ll be on fixed variable by the end of \u201914?","Clarence Gooden ","There\u2019s about 25% of our utility contracts that are up for renewal this year. It\u2019s a little difficult for me to speculate right now. We\u2019ve got a couple of utilities that are looking at going to the fixed variable that are not yet quite sold on the concept.","Michael Ward ","And those renewals are at the end of the year, right?","Clarence Gooden ","That\u2019s right.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs ","Just with regard to expectations for crew starts and active locomotives, can you give us a range or some guidance around those?","Oscar Munoz ","I think in the general same sort of trend that we\u2019ve had. Our crew starts will be less than our volume in TTMs, and that consistent pattern I think will continue. So no real change. ","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs ","And then just going back to some of the questions with regard to the crude by rail. Are you currently having discussions with shippers about tank car replacements, and what\u2019s their response been so far?","Clarence Gooden ","We have been having discussions with shippers about some of the proposed regulations at the various agencies that the Department of Transportation has, but sort of along the lines Michael and Oscar addressed earlier, it\u2019s much too early to speculate on what those regulations are going to be. So the shippers are in about the same mode the rest of us are, and that\u2019s to take a sit and be cautious, and let\u2019s see what the final outcome is.","Michael Ward ","There are active dialogs going on with the customers, with the various agencies within the DoT, and you know, it will take some time to work these things through. But there is active dialog to make sure we continue to build on the great safety record we have in moving these products. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan.","Tom Wadewitz - JPMorgan ","Fredrik, what\u2019s the base you\u2019re looking at for - I guess there a bunch of moving parts - but what\u2019s the 2013 base you\u2019re looking at for the earnings growth the next couple of years?","Fredrik Eliasson ","It\u2019s $1.83.","Tom Wadewitz - JPMorgan ","Okay, so you\u2019ve got $1.83, and if I understand your comments, you seem to imply that it would be difficult to get to the low end, so the 10% CAGR over two years, given a little higher base and the coal headwind. Is that correct?","Fredrik Eliasson ","It\u2019s consistent with what we\u2019ve said now for I guess over a quarter, which is we\u2019re going to make some progress here in 2014 towards the long term guidance that we have in place. It\u2019s clearly going to be more back end loaded than we had originally estimated, and we\u2019re going to need some help from coal in 2015 in order to be able to get there. That\u2019s our best view at this point. ","Tom Wadewitz - JPMorgan ","And I think you\u2019re saying one of the big things that\u2019s different is we\u2019re a little more negative on coal and coal\u2019s more of a headwind in 2014. When I look at that compared to Clarence\u2019s comments on utility, he sounds actually reasonably, I don\u2019t know if constructive is an overstatement, but it doesn\u2019t sound like utility is a big headwind this year. So can you give me a little more color on how large the export headwind is that you\u2019re assuming, that kind of prevents you from getting to that 10% growth CAGR? And I don\u2019t know if you want to say, well, thermal tons are down a lot, and net tons are stable. Any kind of further perspective on how big that export headwind and what\u2019s within that would be helpful.","Fredrik Eliasson ","With the guidance that Clarence provided in his prepared remarks, that we think in the mid-30s range is what export coal is going to be for 2014, and we ended up 2013 with about 44 million tons, you have a pretty significant impact just on the volume alone. ","Then on top of that, you\u2019re going to be cycling the price adjustments that we did throughout 2013, and especially in the third quarter. So between the volume impact and the price decrease that we did last year, you have a pretty significant headwind. ","And then as Clarence said, while we think volume for the year on the domestic side will be flat, we do expect our revenue per unit on the domestic side to be down in that low single digit number. So there will be significant headwind in our coal business for 2014. ","Now, the good news is that, you know, if you ask me about our coal business today versus two months ago, because of what we\u2019re seeing on the weather side here over the last few weeks, we feel a little bit better about where things can end up. ","But right now, the best visibility is we\u2019re going to need some help in 2015 to get to that low end of that guidance. We\u2019re going to need some help on the coal side. ","Tom Wadewitz - JPMorgan ","Just one further piece within that, Clarence, is that move from 44 down to mid-30s, is that a sharp decline in the thermal tons? Or is that a decline in tonnage in both thermal and met?","Clarence Gooden ","Most of the decline is in the thermal. Some met, but most of it\u2019s in the thermal.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Matt Troy with Susquehanna. ","Matthew Troy - Susquehanna International "," ","I\u2019ve got two questions for Clarence. You indicated earlier, and it\u2019s consistent with your message previously, that you would adjust pricing on export coal to keep U.S. coal competitive in international markets, to a point. I\u2019m just curious, are we at that point, i.e. sequentially should rates per ton stabilize at this level and potentially go up with recovery in international coal? Or can we expect further downside if things remain weak in terms of per ton rates?","Clarence Gooden ","From our standpoint, we\u2019re at the bottom for our rate structure on export coal. And as the market adjusts upward, you can expect to see us move upward with it.","Matthew Troy - Susquehanna International ","And the second question would be simply, on the domestic piece, you talk about a more positive outlook. We can all certainly see the end market fundamentals that set the bed for that, but just want to hear from you guys a reaffirmation or a confirmation that you\u2019re not using price or your competition, you\u2019re not seeing change in behavior there to move coal in the international markets. You\u2019ve said in the past yes, you\u2019ll facilitate international moves with price. Just want to make sure domestically that you\u2019re not using price as a way to stoke volumes.","Clarence Gooden ","We are not.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Jeff Kauffman of Buckingham Research.","Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research ","Fredrik, have you had a chance to take a look at how the pension assumptions changed with the interest rates and the market returns? And give us an idea what pension expense looks like 2014 versus 2013.","Fredrik Eliasson ","I think we\u2019re going to see some help in our pension expense in 2014 versus 2013. It\u2019s been a headwind for the last couple of years as we amortized the loss of what we saw in 2008 and 2009. But I think as we get into 2014, it will be a modest help to us. So that\u2019s good news. ","Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research ","Could you quantify that at all, or give us an idea how much?","Fredrik Eliasson ","It will be somewhere around $20 million plus, but nothing significant.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Scott Group with Wolfe Research.","Scott Group - Wolfe Trahan ","I\u2019ve got one for Clarence on coal and one on intermodal. On the export thermal side, I think there\u2019s been some concern about some contracts that you signed a year or two years ago on a higher API2. And as that rolls over, the volumes would see some pressure. At this point, and based on your guidance for the 35 million tons, are we fully now cycled through that old API2 price structure where at least going forward in 2015 we shouldn\u2019t have additional headwinds for that, and we can think about potential growth in export coal?","Clarence Gooden ","Yes, we are fully cycled through that.","Scott Group - Wolfe Trahan ","And then on the intermodal side, it\u2019s been a couple of quarters now, some really nice growth. Want to get your perspective, Clarence, on what do you think is finally clicking in the network that\u2019s allowing it. And then maybe just what\u2019s your pricing strategy there, because the volumes are really good, but the yields were a little bit under pressure? And how should we think about intermodal pricing?","Clarence Gooden ","First, on our intermodal pricing, as you\u2019re aware, we\u2019re having price strictly to what the truck market is, and there\u2019s big competition there. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we did get price, but it was offset by the decline in the fuel surcharge during that period of time. In fact, our pricing was very solid in our intermodal this year.","I guess the second part of your question was what do we expect in terms of growth, and can we continue and sustain it? And my answer is yes. That\u2019s evident by the fact that, number one, we\u2019re expanding our northwest Ohio intermodal hub just a few years after it was opened. ","Number two, we\u2019re opening up and completing this year a new terminal in Montreal, which is a 7 million person market that we haven\u2019t effectively penetrated. In April of this year we\u2019ll open up our new Winterhaven intermodal facility in south Florida. We\u2019ve made an announcement for an expansion, a new intermodal terminal in Pittsburgh. We just doubled the size of our Louisville intermodal terminal, after only having been open two years. So we have positive views about our intermodal business. ","And finally, last year we started up a program that we called our Beneficial Owners program. We had a commercial name for it called Highway to Rail Conversions, H2R. And it has been highly successful this year in growing our business. And I just met with that group last week, and I think they\u2019re going to be very successful in being able to address that 9 million truckload opportunity that Michael has referred to in the near future.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Jason Seidl with Cowen & Company.","Jason Seidl - Cowen & Company ","Clarence, sticking on the intermodal side, we\u2019ve been hearing that the truckload market is tightening up a bit. As it tightens, how should we think about the progression for your ability to start ticking up some of the rates in the intermodal sector? In other words, what\u2019s the lag effect on your ability to take pricing up in the intermodal sector? ","Clarence Gooden ","As you see those truckload rates firm up more and more, you\u2019ll see our rates start to follow them. Lag time will be not as long as you think, actually, because a lot of the business is going to be on a transactional basis.","Jason Seidl - Cowen & Company ","And what percent is on transactional?","Clarence Gooden ","You know, I don\u2019t have a number off the top of my head, because we have three different ways that we address those domestic markets.","Jason Seidl - Cowen & Company ","Well, you guys can get back to me offline on that. I guess the next question, on the crude to rail side, obviously there\u2019s some changes coming on the car side, which does impact you guys a little bit. And there may be some increased safety regulations for you. I was just curious, on the insurance side have you guys seen any increased cost on the insurance side for you, or have insurance companies sort of changed the way they deal with you on not only crude but any of the hazmats that you might haul?","Fredrik Eliasson ","So far, no, we\u2019re going to go into a normal renewal cycle and we try to, as we always do, educate our partners on the insurance side about the excellent safety record that we have, and all the initiatives we have to make it even safer. So nothing at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Ben Hartford with Baird. ","Ben Hartford - Robert W. Baird ","I had a question on the crude by rail. It\u2019s more along the lines of the business growth side. Looking to next year, I believe you were looking to add potentially daily train starts. Is there any sort of quantifiable amount of new business in terms of new facilities at refiners that are opening up?","Clarence Gooden ","Well, we moved, as you probably know, about 46,000 loads of crude in 2013, primarily to the eastern U.S. refineries. And we\u2019ve told you on some of the previous calls we\u2019re averaging between one and two trains a day. And the second train a day tended to be more in the fourth quarter and throughout the year. So in 2014 we expect to increase that crude. So you can use a number of about 50%, and we will move to two trains a day on a continuous basis over time. And then we\u2019ll start to position ourselves as more and more of the unloading points along the East Coast are developed.","Ben Hartford - Robert W. Baird ","And then maybe as a follow up, you had mentioned that inflation was projected at like 1.5%. What would that number look like in terms of dollars relative to the $120 million you guys had in 2013?","Fredrik Eliasson ","Well, it\u2019s not a direct correlation. It is an estimate of what the industry is incurring, as to what that [unintelligible] is supposed to be. So we had about $120 million of inflation at CSX in 2013, and I would say we\u2019re probably going to see a similar amount in 2014. We\u2019ll continue to benefit from both lower than normal health and welfare costs, because of some of the cost sharing arrangements we have, and also the demographic changes. And we\u2019re also seeing some relatively muted materials inflation at this point. So I would say that inflation assumptions for 2014 should be pretty similar to what we saw in 2013.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ms. Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. ","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities","I wanted to ask a question on the domestic utility coal business. We\u2019ve talked many times on these calls about how cheap natural gas prices have in effect pulled forward some of the demand destruction that you were expecting due to regulation by 2015. I wonder if it\u2019s possible for you to comment on how your coal shipments to those plants that you expect to close by 2015 compare to your coal shipments to all other plants in 2013.","Clarence Gooden ","The plants that we and our customers have identified as closing in 2015, those shipments have been curtailed, in most cases fairly dramatically, although one of those plants in particular, and I unfortunately can\u2019t release the name of it, has actually taken some inbound coal during the last 30 days, because of this weather related activity that\u2019s been going on. But we haven\u2019t seen anything in regard to the other plants materially, as your question would imply.","Michael Ward ","So you\u2019re saying most of the decline we\u2019re going to see from these plants shutting down because of the environmental regs and gas prices has occurred.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities ","Yes, so I guess another way of asking it would be just to say, where do those volumes look like relative to 2008? I mean, are they almost down by 100%?","Michael Ward ","I think versus domestic coal at the utility companies versus 2008 we\u2019ll be down 45%, roughly.","Fredrik Eliasson ","And if we think about the plants that are about to close, between now and kind of 2016\/2017\/2018, our best estimate that we\u2019ve shared publicly before is that there\u2019s about 7 million tons or so that is left to come out over the next five years. And it\u2019s not that it\u2019s going to come out all in 2015. It\u2019s going to be spread out between \u201915 and \u201916 and \u201917. And so that\u2019s a little less than 10%, about 10%, of our overall utility portfolio, what they still expect to see. So it is down significantly, and there\u2019s a relatively small portion left to come out, that 10%, which can easily be overshadowed by some sort of just normal demand recovery and getting through this inventory overhang we have seen over the last few years.","Clarence Gooden ","And the last part is, and we just saw this in the weather related part, those plants that are not scheduled to be closed, that have already been scrubbed, are actually run harder and for longer periods of time. So the total burn of coal is virtually neutral.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. David Vernon of Bernstein.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein ","Fredrik, in your closing comments about coal, you mentioned the revenue headwind. Is there a good percentage number rather than getting in the nitty gritty on export [unintelligible] or whatever, a good percentage revenue decline that we should be expecting in the coal business in \u201914?","Fredrik Eliasson ","I think I gave you the components, similar to what we\u2019ve done in the past. And we always separate out domestic versus export, because it\u2019s just hard to predict the export business. The domestic side, we said flat volume. We have said on the export side, coming from 44 million tons down to about 35 million tons, continue cycling the impact of the price reductions we took in 2013. And so overall, we think that the RPU in 2014 for our coal business as a whole will be down in that low single digit area.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein ","","And then maybe just as a follow up, I think Clarence, as you guys look at growing the intermodal business, one of the things that you guys have been doing, at least from what I\u2019ve heard in the industry, is offering a number of new services out of the northwest Ohio terminal. Is there a way that you can frame that in terms of the number of new service offerings that you guys have brought to market, and then how many more lanes or blank squares in the service grid there are for you to continue to expand the product?","Clarence Gooden ","I don\u2019t know the exact number, but it\u2019s a double digit number of OD pairs that we\u2019ve created out of northwest Ohio. We\u2019ve also added services out of Atlanta into the northeast. So it\u2019s a significant number. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. John Larkin with Stifel Nicolaus.","John Larkin - Stifel Nicolaus ","I had a question, Clarence. I was wondering if you could clarify a little bit this push to convert the utility coal contracts over to the fixed and variable cost model. How does that benefit the utility, and how does that benefit CSX? It seems like that fixed component is really much like the guaranteed minimum that would trigger the liquidated damages.","Clarence Gooden ","It is. That\u2019s exactly what it is on the fixed component. In effect, it eliminates liquidated damages. But one of the other advantages that it has to the utilities is that the price of the coal itself, on the variable part, goes into the equation for the dispatch cycle of which type of generation will be dispatched.","John Larkin - Stifel Nicolaus ","So this is, in theory, a win-win proposition for both the utility and for CSX?","Clarence Gooden","I think so, yes.","John Larkin - Stifel Nicolaus ","And then just wanted to ask maybe a question of Oscar if he\u2019s still on the line, related to the very impressive annual productivity target that seems to be down a little bit in \u201914 relative to what was actually accomplished in \u201913. But is this the type of target that is going to be available in \u201915, \u201916, and \u201917? Or is the law of diminishing returns going to come into play here at some point?","Oscar Munoz ","You know, that\u2019s a constant question we\u2019ve asked ourselves for a while. And I think one of the reasons we exhibited the chart that we did is that there is a good staying power and a history to it. We have a very great cross-functional team that\u2019s focused on those outer years, and every time they get together and they come up with ideas for the near term as well as the long term, it appears to be a very positive outlook. So without giving too much guidance, I think for the very near future, over the next few years, I think we\u2019ll continue at that rate.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets","My question is going to come back to the guidance run rate. You mentioned that you needed some help from coal. When I look at your base assumption, when you provided the 10-15% earnings growth guidance, you had indicated that your base assumption would be for flat coal. When I look at what\u2019s evolved in \u201913 and now into \u201914, we\u2019re seeing that volume is down in \u201913 on the thermal side, flat in \u201914. Yield is down in both years, and export volume now trending down 20% for this year, with yields down as well. ","Tell me if this is a little simplistic, but when I plug in what I need to get in \u201915 just to make it go back to your flat revenue assumption, it\u2019s not a little bit of help from coal, it\u2019s quite a bit of help from coal. Am I looking at it a little bit too simplistically? And if not, how realistic should we be looking at that 10-15% guidance, even as a realistically achievable number up to 2015?","Fredrik Eliasson ","I think what we said is that we\u2019re going to need some help from coal. I think there\u2019s a lot of other things that are going on in our business, as Clarence outlined earlier, that is very positive right now. If you look at his outlook table, a significant portion, the vast majority of our businesses, are doing very well. And we frankly have probably picked up a little bit more than we would have thought from that perspective. We continue to do very well on the productivity side. ","But clearly, we\u2019re going to need some help. But I don\u2019t think we necessarily need to get back all the way where we were in the first quarter of last year, when we issued the guidance. Because the rest of the business continues to be very vibrant and we continue to drive great productivity savings through Oscar\u2019s teams. But we will need some help. ","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets ","So what I understand is that your other businesses are helping out, which is fantastic, obviously. It gives me a little bit of concern, though, that there\u2019s a couple of comments made where you indicated that the revenue growth from the improvement in those businesses didn\u2019t go to the bottom line to the extent that you would expect it. I think it was mentioned a couple of times to the extent that you expected it. ","I\u2019m just curious as to whether there were factors that did not allow it to go to the bottom line in Q4 that might have an impact on your longer term guidance to the extent that those factors play out over the next year or two. Using 2013 as your base, a little bit better than expected, I don\u2019t know if you would have had a good indication of your base at that point when you gave your guidance, and maybe that was where it was, but is there anything that didn\u2019t need you to get to your expected flow through that might impact your guidance for the 10-15% up to 2015?","Fredrik Eliasson ","Throughout the fourth quarter, including the third quarter earnings call, we issued essentially pretty clear guidance, I thought, about the fourth quarter was going to be a pretty challenging quarter, because we knew we were going to cycle both the incentive comp issue and the real estate. And you couple that with the casualty, another $16 million, you had $75 million of things that we don\u2019t expect long term to have to deal with. ","If you adjust $137 million of revenue growth and take out that $75 million, you\u2019ll see that our incremental margins for the quarter were right around 55% or something like that. And we know that we will have this headwind on the real estate side throughout the first half of next year, but once we get through that, we are pretty confident that we\u2019re going to get back to a more normal place where we\u2019ve been in the past, and where we would have been this quarter if it wasn\u2019t for this headwind. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Justin Long with Stephens.","Justin Long - Stephens ","You gave your best guess for export coal volumes this year to be around 35 million tons. I was wondering if you could talk about how much of that business is under contract for this year versus what you expect to get in the spot market.","Clarence Gooden ","Absolutely. Nearly three-quarters of the business is contracted for the year.","Justin Long - Stephens ","The other one I had, on the equipment purchase front, I was wondering if you could comment on what car types are factored into your 2014 capital budget. And also, specifically on coal, if you could comment on where you stand in terms of replacing that fleet?","Fredrik Eliasson ","We are doing a lot of rebuilds in 2014, especially on a portion of our coal fleet. That is a big driver. We\u2019re also purchasing some jumbo hoppers and some auto racks as well. And in terms of our coal fleet, I think you might know this, but on the utility side, over 90% of our fleet is really owned by the utilities and not CSX. And that has obviously been a great impact and helped us significantly, the fact that that market has declined, we haven\u2019t sat on a significant portion of excess capacity. So it\u2019s going to be between rebuilds on the coal cars, it\u2019s going to be automotive racks, and then also jumbo covered hoppers that we\u2019re going to spend most of the capital in 2014.","Operator","Our final question comes from Mr. Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar ","Oscar, within your targeted efficiency gains, do you expect the main leverage to be the same as in 2013, mainly fuel, TTM per crew start, and locomotive efficiency? And do these basically distill down to just building longer trains? Or is that too simplistic?","Oscar Munoz ","As you can imagine, it is a very complicated business sometimes, but it boils down to those basic same factors. And there\u2019s a lot of technology involved, and a lot of process change, and of course a lot of great and hard work by people. But yeah, pretty much in the same lines.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar ","And one other quick one. I believe it was Clarence who mentioned a mix richer in northern region coal, which shortened the average length of haul. But could you share the domestic coal mix of Illinois and PRB during the quarter, and perhaps your expectations for how this will influence length of haul, maybe in the next couple of years?","Clarence Gooden ","The combination of our Illinois Basin and PRB for this quarter was 49%. And a positive impact is that the more of the Illinois Basin that replaces the Central App, particularly into the Florida regions and the longer haul regions, is actually we view as a positive, because it\u2019s a much longer length of haul and the revenue is higher on it. ","Michael Ward ","Illinois Basin now is about 30%, which is similar to our Central App tons of freight. So it\u2019s equal to Central App right now, and growing.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar ","Is the length in PRB shorter than that?","Clarence Gooden ","It tends to be, because it comes across the Chicago Interchange, and mostly penetrates into our system as far east as New York. ","Michael Ward ","Well, thank you everyone for your interest and attendance, and we\u2019ll see you next quarter.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. David Baggs, Vice President of Capital Markets and Investor Relations for CSX Corporation. Sir, you may begin.","David Baggs","Thank you, Lori. And good morning, everyone. And again, welcome to CSX Corporation's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Presentation.","The presentation material that we'll review this morning, along with our quarterly financial report, and our safety and service measurements, are available on our website at csx.com under the Investors section. In addition, following the presentation this morning, a webcast and podcast replay will be available on the website.","Here, representing CSX this morning, are Michael Ward, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Clarence Gooden, our Chief Sales and Marketing Officer; Oscar Munoz, Chief Operating Officer; and Fredrik Eliasson, Chief Financial Officer.","Now before we begin the formal part of the program, let me remind everyone that the presentation and other statements made by the company contain forward-looking statements. You are encouraged to review the company's disclosure in the accompanying presentation on Slide 2. This disclosure identifies forward-looking statements and risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance to differ materially from the results anticipated by these statements.","In addition, let me also remind everyone that at the end of the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session with the research analysts. With nearly 30 analysts covering CSX, I would ask, as a courtesy for everyone, to please limit your inquiries to one primary and one follow-up question.","And with that, let me turn the presentation over to CSX Corporation's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Michael Ward. Michael?","Michael Jon Ward","Well, thank you, Dave. And good morning, everyone. Last evening, CSX was pleased to report record financial results for the first quarter. Earnings per share were $0.43, up 23% from the same period last year. Despite significant weakness in utility coal, we continue to see broad-based revenue strength across nearly all of our markets. This led to a revenue growth of 6% to nearly $3 billion in the quarter. Our team supported the revenue gains with excellent results in safety, service and productivity. These are the foundations of our business and our ability to drive value for both customers and shareholders.","The strong revenues and operational results produced an 11% increase in first quarter operating income versus the same period last year and 140 basis point improvement in operating ratio. Both were first quarter records and an indication of our commitment to producing strong results for our investors.","With that, I'd like to turn the presentation over to Clarence Gooden for his sales and marketing review. Clarence?","Clarence W. Gooden","Thank you, Michael. And good morning, everyone. Before I discuss the quarterly results in detail, let me take you through our near-term outlook. Most key indicators we look at continued to project year-over-year growth in 2012, which supports our expectation that the second quarter outlook is favorable for 58% of our volume and stable for 32% of our volume. Utility coal, which represents about 10% of CSX's volume, is the only market with an unfavorable outlook. However, with a growing economy, continued truck conversions from the highway and the onboarding of the new Maersk business, Intermodal is expected to continue leading our growth. In addition, the expanding industrial economy supports growth in our Automotive and Metals markets and stability in our chemicals market.","Modest improvement in the housing and construction sectors supports growth in our Forest Products business and a stable environment for emerging markets. While the overall agricultural sector is expected to be stable, we see upside in our phosphate and fertilizer market. And finally, we expect stability in our Export & Industrial Coal business. This outlook is generally consistent with what we experienced during the first quarter, which I will begin to review on the next slide.","CSX revenue increased 6% to nearly $3 billion in the first quarter. Starting with the left gold bar, you can see that the volume gains of 1% drove year-over-year revenue growth of $26 million. Moving to the right, the combined effect of rate and mix accounted for $64 million of the increase, reflecting yield gains across all 3 major markets as we continue to sell the value of rail transportation and the excellent value of CSX's service product. Overall, pricing in excess of inflation more than offset the mix impact associated with the higher Intermodal growth and declining coal volume. Finally, as you look further to the right, increases in the price of fuel resulted in an additional $66 million of recovery in the quarter, which helped to offset the impact of higher fuel costs.","Now, let's take a look at each of the major markets that we serve starting with coal. Coal revenue decreased 5%, driven by weaknesses in utility coal volume that more than offset the strength in Export & Industrial Coal. Domestic utility tons declined 28% as overall electrical generation was down in the eastern United States. In addition, natural gas prices remained at low levels, which led to the continued displacement of coal at some utilities. Partially offsetting this weakness, Industrial Coal tons grew by 11%, driven by increased domestic steel production, while export coal tons grew 17% as demand was strong for U.S. thermal coal shipments. Looking ahead, demand for export coal should remain strong with the increasing demand for thermal coal being offset by weakness in the metallurgical shipments. Overall, we still expect export volumes similar to the 2011 levels.","In addition, strength in shipments of industrial coal is expected to continue due to the increased steel production. At the same time, domestic utility volumes are expected to face continued challenges due to the low natural gas prices, above normal inventory levels and environmental regulations. Headwinds should be strongest in the second quarter and then moderate throughout the balance of the year.","Now let's turn to our Intermodal results. Intermodal revenue increased 19% to $389 million versus 2011, driven by a 9% increase in volume and a 10% increase in revenue per unit. Domestic volume was up 9%, setting a first quarter record. Strength was driven by highway-to-rail Intermodal conversion, the continued success of our UMAX interline container program and new markets and lines generating organic growth. International volume grew 9%, driven by new business gained as a result of our portfolio of service and network offerings, as well as the successful onboarding of the new Maersk traffic. Turning to the revenue per unit, the 10% improvement versus the prior year was attributable to positive mix, improved pricing and higher fuel recoveries.","Looking forward, strategic investments such as the National Gateway initiative and our Northwest Ohio terminal position CSX to compete for an estimated $9 million-truckload opportunity in our service territory. Our modern hub in Northwest Ohio improves transit times, increases capacity and expands our service offering by enabling connections between new and existing markets. For example, the transit time from Chicago to New York has improved by over a day. We expect healthy growth to continue long term as new terminals, such as Louisville, and capacity expansions, including Columbus and Charlotte, drive highway-to-rail conversions.","Turning to the next slide, let's look at our merchandise market. Overall, merchandise revenue increased 10%, driven by a 3% volume growth and a 7% increase in revenue per unit, reflecting increases across nearly all markets due to higher yields and higher fuel recovery. Metals and Automotive shipments were key drivers of growth in the industrial sector. North American light vehicle production grew 15% in the quarter. In addition, domestic steel production remained high due to strong demand from the Automotive and the oil and gas industries.","In the construction sector, growth in building products was offset by a decline in aggregate shipments due to the completion of several stimulus projects. In the agricultural sector, volume decreased slightly in the quarter primarily due to a decline in phosphate shipments as buyers delayed purchases in expectation of moderating commodity prices. Export grain also declined due to more competitive pricing from other world producers, and ethanol shipments softened as a result of lower gasoline demand.","Looking forward, we expect the agricultural sector to be stable with increases in both grain and phosphate shipments being offset by lower ethanol demand. Industrial sector strength is expected to continue led by the Automotive and Metals markets. New oil and gas related growth will also support increased shipments in Metals and chemicals. And finally, in the construction sector, growth should continue led by the strength in multi-family housing.","Now, let's wrap up on the next slide. Looking ahead, the economic backdrop remains favorable as most major economic indicators are positive for 2012. As I mentioned earlier, we expect solid growth in 58% of CSX's markets and stable conditions in 32% of our markets. While the utility coal volume will continue to be challenged by lower generation, low gas prices and higher coal inventories, we expect these headwinds to moderate somewhat through the balance of the year. Finally, service levels have improved significantly. In our most recent annual survey results, customers gave us the highest overall rating since the inception of the survey in 2004. And we will remain committed to creating compelling value and providing environmentally friendly solutions for our customers going forward. ","Thank you. And now, let me turn the presentation over to Oscar to review our operating results.","Oscar Munoz","Well, thank you, Mr. Gooden. And good morning, everyone. It's my privilege to represent our operations team today. And I got to tell you, the great part of telling the story is that the fundamental strategy we've been employing since 2003 continues, as does our strong operating performance. ","So let me begin on Slide 13. At CSX, operational success has, at its core, been driven by our people and the culture we've created. This has resulted in significant improvements in safety, service and productivity over the last few years. This quarter is no different. Safety and service are at or near record levels, and productivity and cost controls are driving margin expansion. At the same time, we are increasingly adding a strategic dimension to what we do. In operations, that means looking around corners and challenging ourselves to think like our customers as their supply chain and businesses evolve. It means being nimble to meet our changing business market conditions like those we're seeing in our coal business, and it means looking ahead as we allocate resources to developing market opportunities like those coming out of the oil and gas industry.","By focusing relentlessly on the operational fundamentals and thinking strategically, we will continue to drive excellence in our operations and value for our customers and shareholders.","Now let's return to the safety results in the next slide. Those of you who have followed us for any length of time know how important safety is to our business. It transcends every aspect of what we do because it affects the lives of our employees and the communities we serve. At the same time, it reflects the rigor and attention to detail we need to run every aspect of this great railroad. Looking at the FRA personal injury rate on the left, you can see that our employees produced another quarterly record, a testament to their focus and concern for each other. The chart on the right shows our FRA train accident rate, which improved 24% year-over-year, just over 2 occurrences per 1 million train miles. This improvement is driven both by the employees' adherence to operating rules and to their use of new technology to identify issues early.","Now let's turn to the next slide and review our on-time performance. On both of these charts, you see our performance in on-time originations and arrivals, which we show you every quarter. This time, however, we've overlaid 6- and 12-month trend lines. When you, as investors, evaluate business performance, you look at the fundamentals of the business as well as the technicals. We view our service measures in much the same way. But the fundamental results for the quarter represented by the bars and the technicals represented by the moving averages, black for 12-month and -- I'm sorry, in black, and 12-month average in red. When our quarterly results in service are below the 6-month trend line, it's an early indication that we need to take corrective action in order to avoid a longer-term negative trend. Likewise, when the quarterly results are above the trend lines, it's a signal that we have strong momentum in our service performance. So when you look at on-time originations for the quarter, they are at an all-time high, and arrivals are near record levels. That's great news and the feedback from customers, as Clarence mentioned, has been very positive.","Now if you step back and look at the broader story here, you can see that over the last couple of years, the trend lines for both originations and arrivals have declined. But last year, as you may recall, we made key resource investments to improve our service product. Those investments, along with the great work of our people, are now propelling our quarterly performance and the longer-term trend line. Back with the first quarter results, when the 6-month trends are above the 12-month trend lines, it's a strong signal of our momentum in the coming quarters.","Now turning to our system performance on the next slide, terminal dwell is another important measure, not only from a service aspect but also in terms of how efficient we utilize our assets. Here, we have reduced dwell time as favorable, the 6-month trend line is clearly improving. It has crossed the 12-month line, again showing momentum, and represents our best first quarter performance since 2009. Overall velocity on the right side of the chart is also in great shape but is more meaningful when you break it down by market, which we do on the following chart.","Here, you can see that the velocity is moving in the right direction across all 3 of our networks: Coal, Intermodal and Merchandise, with both results for the quarter and the 6-month trend line showing positive momentum. In Coal, with overall volumes declining, service and productivity are up with the average train length increasing to 106 cars. At the same time, with the increased fluidity in the coal network, we were able to deliver 12.5 million tons to the export market.","In Intermodal, higher velocity means we can make more capacity available to our customers, and therefore, a higher level of service. We did this in the first quarter while handling a 9% increase in volume. Availability, which is measured as the percent of loaded containers or trailers ready for on-time pickup in our most sensitive -- time-sensitive business is up to 98%. And availability across our broader Intermodal business is in the mid-80s.","Finally, in the Merchandise business, which grew 3%, higher velocity, combined with significantly improved terminal dwell time is enabling CSX to deliver products to customers with a higher degree of precision. ","Now looking at cost control and productivity on the next slide. We entered 2012 with high expectations for customer service. But we also knew that we had to regain some lost momentum and productivity and cost control, especially given the need to offset the decline in the coal market. The first quarter was a great start in that regard. In fact, cost controls and operational productivity contributed to our record first quarter operating ratio, as you can see on the chart on the left.","From a cost control aspect, as coal demand weakened further, we took steps to adjust our T&E resources in select areas, mainly, as you'd expect, in the coal regions. In addition, we recently began to store locomotives after a smooth and fast start towards spring peak shipping season.","On the productivity front, the first quarter was an excellent start toward our goal of delivering savings in excess of $130 million this year. Our train crews have operated with less overtime and fewer re-crews, while engineering overtime has also been reduced. Our improved service has also been reflected in faster cycle times, reducing car rents despite the increased volume in most of our markets. These are just a few examples of the types of productivity drivers we expect to help CSX again exceed its productivity goal for 2012. ","At the same time, it's important to note that we expect to achieve these goals while maintaining high levels of service. ","So let me wrap up on the next slide. The story of operational excellence here at CSX has been developed over many years and the commitment of our people is as strong as ever, which is clearly indicated in our first quarter performance. In safety, we are operating at high levels, and as the industry leader, we continue to identify new ways to achieve higher performance. In service, every key measure shows strong momentum. Value is created by people who are engaged, and nothing does that better than knowing that what you do matters to customers. We are seeing that throughout all areas of the operations. And when it comes to productivity, we told you before about our focus on asset management, and these efforts have progressed significantly over the past few months. In fact, we transformed our process improvement teams into asset management teams. They're focused on improved utilization, reliability, unit cost and creating the productivity pipeline for the next several years. These folks have a great track record for getting results, and I'm confident they will continue to succeed.","In short, we are committed to safely providing the high levels of service the customers expect while also generating the productivity required to create lasting value for shareholders. ","Now let me turn the presentation over to Fredrik to review the financials.","Fredrik J. Eliasson","Thank you, Oscar. And good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, CSX once again demonstrated the ability to leverage strong topline gains with a continuing focus on productivity and service to achieve double-digit earnings growth. Looking at the top of this slide, revenue improved 6% to nearly $3 billion on strong core pricing, modest volume growth and the impact of higher fuel recovery. This, coupled with only a 4% increase in expenses, generated first quarter operating income of $856 million, up 11% versus the prior year. Looking below the line, interest expense was up $4 million, other income was down $1 million and income taxes were up $24 million to $267 million in the quarter for an effective tax rate of 37.3%. Going forward, we continue to expect a normalized tax rate of about 38%. Finally, EPS was $0.43, an improvement of 23%, reflecting the very solid gains in core earnings and the impact of our share repurchase program.","Turning to the next slide, let's begin to discuss expenses in more detail. As you can see on this slide, total expense was up 4% with the most significant increase being driven by higher fuel prices that are essentially offset through our fuel recovery program. Despite the resource investments made in the back half of last year, nonfuel costs increased only 2% in the quarter as the high level of service that we are currently delivering for our customers is also improving asset utilization. I will talk about the top 3 expense lines in more detail in the next few slides, but let me briefly speak to the last 2 items on the chart.","Depreciation was up 6% to $257 million due to the increase in the net asset base. This is in line with our previous estimates and should continue to increase a few million dollars sequentially each quarter. Equipment rents were flat at $97 million as strong volume increases in Automotive, Intermodal and merchandise were offset entirely by improved cycle times. ","Turning to Slide 23. Labor and fringe expense was up 1% versus last year or $5 million. Looking at the chart on the left, headcount this quarter was up 6% versus last year and just 1% sequentially, which is in line with our prior guidance. Note that the employees in further retention status will continue to show up in our headcount numbers. Excluding these employees, headcount is roughly flat on a sequential basis.","Reflecting the additions we made to the workforce, and looking at the table on the right, hiring and training costs were up $12 million in the quarter, and volume and other related costs were up $9 million. The impact of wage and healthcare inflation in this quarter was a modest $8 million or about 1%. While core wage inflation was between 2.5% to 3%, this is being offset by moderating health and welfare costs, as well as the impact of lower railroad unemployment tax rights. Rounding out the table, incentive compensation was $24 million favorable in the quarter, reflecting the outlook for our incentive programs.","Looking forward, headcount should be relatively constant throughout the year. In addition, we expect that labor inflation will remain modest. Finally, the favorable year-over-year variance to incentive compensation will likely moderate in the second quarter and should even out in the second half as year-over-year comparisons ease.","Turning to Slide 24. MS&O expense increased 2% or $12 million versus last year. Looking at the table to the right, inflation was $14 million. Next, CSX recognized a $19 million deferred gain. This gain reflects the company's sale of property last year to the State of Florida, and we will continue to recognize a similar gain each quarter throughout the year. CSX recognized a $14 million gain in the fourth quarter of 2011, so the year-over-year favorable comparisons will mainly continue through this year's third quarter. ","Moving down the table, volume-related expenses increased $12 million in the quarter, reflecting cost related to our growing Intermodal, Export Coal and Automotive businesses. Finally, all other costs increased $5 million in this quarter.","Moving to the next slide, let's discuss the impact of fuel. Total fuel costs increased 10% or $42 million versus last year. Looking at the chart on the left, CSX's average cost per gallon for locomotive fuel climbed $3.15, an increase of 10%. This increase in fuel price accounted for $37 million of higher expense, as seen in the table on the right. Next, while the network was significantly more fluid, the addition of locomotives in the back half of last year reduced overall fuel efficiency by $4 million. With gross ton-miles up modestly, volume drove a $2 million increase in fuel expense, and running at the table, non-locomotive fuel decreased by $1 million.","Moving to the next slide, let's discuss our progress on incremental margins. The first quarter results, as we discussed, were outstanding, reflecting this company's continued commitment to deliver profitable growth, price above inflation and to serve customers safely and efficiently. As such, we were able to deliver an incremental margin of 53%, which returns us to the levels we saw in 2010 and the first half of 2011. As we look forward at the second quarter, the headwinds in utility coal are expected to be more challenging and we will cycle the repricing of several large contracts in the early part of last year. On the export side, while we expect volume to remain strong, we will continue to feel the impact of higher thermal mix and lower tariff rates in metallurgical coal. However, as we march in the back half of the year and anticipate the moderating headwind from utility coal, as well as the cycling of last year's resource additions, we expect incremental margins will be in line with the levels we saw in the first half of 2011.","Now let me turn your attention to CSX's balanced approach to cash deployment on the next slide. The first priority is capital investments. In 2012, we announced earlier, CSX plans to invest $2.25 billion in our business. Over $200 million of this year's capital investment plan is for Positive Train Control. While the amount we plan to spend in 2012 has not changed, we now expect the total PTC investment to be approximately $1.7 billion, up $500 million from our previous estimates. That means that as of this year, we would have a little over $1.1 billion left to spend based on this revised estimate. The largest driver of the increased spending is that, as technology has evolved, we have determined an additional 4,000 miles of track will be compatible with the existing signal systems. In addition, we've also seen increased costs associated with system integration and unit cost of various components. While we continue to target the 2015 deadline for PTC, we recognize that technological challenges are likely to prevent us from achieving this timeline.","Outside of PTC, our core investments for infrastructure, rolling stock and strategic projects have remained unchanged. Here, we have been spending 16% to 17% of revenue on capital over the last several years, and we expect that to continue going forward.","The second priority in the balanced approach is dividends. CSX remains committed to dividend payout range of 30% to 35% of trailing 12 months earnings, which were $1.75 for the first quarter, and a potential dividend increase will be reviewed by the board next month. The third priority in the cash deployment strategy is share repurchases. During the first quarter, CSX repurchased $300 million of shares and has now collectively repurchased $7.5 billion since 2006. There are approximately 400 million of repurchase remaining under the current program, which we expect to be completed by the end of 2012.","Turning to Slide 28. As you can see from these charts, CSX has remained committed to an improving investment-grade credit profile over the last several years. The long-term trend is improving for both funds from operations to debt and debt-to-EBITDA. These are 2 of the key measures used by S&P and Moody's to validate CSX improving credit profile. The market has also recognized our improving profile. We issued 300 million of 30-year debt in February at a 4.4 coupon rate, which is the lowest coupon rate ever secured by a company in the broader BBB space.","While CSX will continue to refinance debt as needed and look to take advantage of capital market opportunities, we remain committed to funding  future share repurchase primarily through free cash flow while, at the same time, remain committed to an improving credit profile.","Now let me wrap up on the next slide. Recapping the first quarter, CSX delivered record financial results despite the significant headwind from utility coal. Merchandise and Intermodal volumes grew above the rate of economy, and we continue to price in excess of inflation. CSX's ongoing commitment to safety, service and productivity helped deliver solid cost side performance that helped drive double-digit earnings growth with strong incremental margins. Looking forward, CSX remains focused on offsetting utility coal declines by relying on 3 key levers of price, productivity and strong volume growth in merchandise and Intermodal.","Looking further out, CSX remains on the path to achieve its 65% operating ratio by 2015. While the road has become more challenging, the target remains achievable. ","Finally, as we deliver outstanding financial results to our investors, CSX remains committed to a balanced approach to cash deployment that includes ongoing capital investments, dividends and share repurchases. ","With that, let me turn the presentation back to Michael for his closing remarks.","Michael Jon Ward","Well, thank you, Fredrik. Well, 2012 represents another challenging year, yet one in which our team expects to deliver excellent results. As we outlined in this morning's presentation, utility coal is our biggest headwind and it will be even a greater factor in the second quarter. In response, we will continue to maximize opportunities in all other markets that are solid to growing, as Clarence outlined, while keeping our focus on safety, service and productivity. This team remains vigilant and confident. We are aware of the obstacles, we know what we need to do to progress forward and we again expect to achieve year-over-year earnings growth in 2012. Our confidence is reinforced by the resiliency that this team has demonstrated while delivering record financial results in 5 of the past 6 years.","We accomplished this through the housing collapse, the biggest global recession in the last half-century and a significant decline in our utility coal business. CSX is a healthy growing company that responds well to challenges. We enter the future with a robust industry outlook, a diverse mix of product markets, a well-positioned transportation network and a track record for success.","Our first quarter performance was the fast start we were looking for, and our employees will remain highly focused in the months and years ahead. We thank them for being key to our success. And at this time, we look forward to answering your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I'm wondering, Clarence, if I can ask you just a couple of questions on pricing. First, in your presentation, I didn't hear any comments on same-store sales pricing. Maybe you can offer some views there. And along those lines, how do we think about how the potential for take or pay would affect how pricing will be perceived? Does that just show up as price without -- or revenue without any carloads? And are your comments on coal suggestive that maybe we're not actually going to get there if things are troughing in the second quarter?","Clarence W. Gooden","Okay. First question is on the same-store sales pricing. They were in the range between 5% and 6%. The second question there, which was on -- was it on take or pay?","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes. Just how does it show up? And do your comments suggest we're not going to see that effect on coal?","Clarence W. Gooden","When you say take or pay, are you referring to liquidated damages?","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, I'm sorry.","Clarence W. Gooden","Oh. Right now, there was no impact in this quarter on the liquidated damages. Usually, the way that process works is liquidated damages, if they are in fact applicable, apply in the following year for the year which the shortfalls were not met.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So if you have liquidated damages, you would get essentially just the loss of that revenue and the carloads this year with a kick next year?","Clarence W. Gooden","Well, actually, what you would get is the liquidated damages next year.","Michael Jon Ward","But, Bill, this is Michael, you're referring to it as take or pay. Most of our contracts, it's not officially take or pay. You have to pay the full price if you don't move it. There's usually a liquidated damages amount that's less than what the rate would be.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I'm just trying to figure if we will -- because the yields on coal, I think, surprised a bit to the upside. And I think what I'm trying to understand is when we think about modeling this going forward, we've seen some Export Coal pricing come down. We're getting questions about, is there room to move this. But there's a few moving parts here such as maybe you'll get paid for volumes you don't move. But I'm not sure how to think about modeling that.","Fredrik J. Eliasson","Well, I think -- this is Fredrik. I think first of all, in the first quarter, there was really no impact of that. And if there would be liquidated damages going forward, and I think that's on a customer-by-customer basis, that we will sit down and talk to that customer, it would really not show up in the line also. It would be show up in other revenue. And at this point, as we look out for the next few quarters, we don't see a material impact of that.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just on that last statement, you said the second quarter was the worst headwinds on coal. Just wondering what are you basing that on? Are you just guessing that inventory is as high as it's going to get, the switching is all done in region? And therefore, with the switching done, you have a better outlook?","Clarence W. Gooden","No. Ken, we're basing it on several factors. Number one is what our customers have told us that they expect to ship and receive. Number two is electrical demand, as we mentioned earlier, still down in the East from where it has historically been. Third reason is, is that our comps on a year-over-year basis are just more difficult in the second quarter than they are in the third and the fourth quarter.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then if I can just switch, Fredrik, on the incentive comp, I think you threw out that it moderates in the back half of the year. I just want to understand, should we then expect kind of on a cost-per-employee basis to see a kind of catch up as you had adjusted, you reversed some accruals in last year's third quarter. Does it get a lot tougher in the second half? Or does it just -- I just want to understand the impact on that reversal.","Fredrik J. Eliasson","Well, as we said, obviously, there's a big number here in the first quarter. We expect it to moderate in the second and then kind of level out in the fourth on incentive comp, specifically. Now cost per employee has some other factors in it as well, which we talked about as well, which is that the health and welfare cost is a little bit lower this year than it was last year and that's helping. The unemployment tax rate is lower this year than last year as well.","Operator","Our next question is from Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to ask, I guess, for a little bit more, Clarence, if you're willing to give a little more granularity on second quarter. So how big of a step down are you talking about in the utility coal, if you're -- I think you said you were down 27 -- or was it 27% of volumes in first quarter? Is it kind of a modest step down? Or what just kind of magnitude for what you're looking at in utility coal in second quarter?","Clarence W. Gooden","Yes. It's close to that. We should be down somewhere around -- it'll be close to what it was in the first quarter. Just a little, not a lot.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And is there an ability for the utilities to say, look, we just can't, our stockpiles are full and we can't, literally, can't take any more coal without having an operational problem of stockpile management problem and so we need to take a further step down? Or is that essentially what you're kind of saying that, that moderate reduction is maybe stockpile related?","Clarence W. Gooden","No. Tom, obviously, if you can't physically take the coal, you can't physically take the coal. I mean, that is what it is. But what we're seeing in our stockpiles now is 2 things. One is the burn itself. The coal burn is being displaced by natural gas, the days of burn de facto go up. And then the stockpiles of the sales from a tonnage standpoint are somewhat higher than they normally are at this time of the year in any event. That makes sense to you?","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, sure. Sure, that does make sense. And then I guess the second topic, just on Intermodal train lengths. How did the Maersk business affect -- did you actually -- you had good volume growth in Maersk and in other areas, did you see train lengths improve? Or did you see kind of train starts go up with the added addition in volume?","Clarence W. Gooden","We saw both. The train lengths did, in fact, improve, and then into a couple of OD pairs, specific OD pairs, we had additional train starts.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Can you give a sense of overall, how much train length was up?","Oscar Munoz","This is Oscar. Not on Intermodal, but we still have plenty of capacity there. I mean, I think the merge in the Intermodal world, we have 10% to 15% capacity on these areas. So we'll continue to put a lot of the volume that we're getting on to that network. The extra starts was due to new markets for our new customer.","Operator","Our next question is from Scott Group with Wolfe Trahan.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Clarence, I'm wondering, can you give us the breakdown of the met versus the thermal exports in the quarter? And then, can you talk about -- how do you think about the balance between volume and pricing in your different coal segments? I understand that the export met tariffs are down starting in April, but how do we think about contractual export met and thermal rates this year? And then I guess maybe longer term or this year, how do we think about the pricing strategy in the utility business? Can you continue to get rate increases? Or do you think you have to think about slowing or even cutting the utility coal rates going forward?","Clarence W. Gooden","Okay. On the first question, the split between the thermal and the metallurgical for us in the first quarter was almost 50-50. And the how do you view pricing in the midterm here, obviously, the metallurgical prices will start to mitigate some over the next few months, as you saw the fact that we took our tariff rates already down as we're trying to price to the market. The thermal rates have historically carried a lower transportation cost, as well as a lower coal price, in the marketplace. So you'll see that mix change impact our same-store sales pricing in the coal business as we move forward. Then on your third question there, which is how do we look at utility coal prices going forward, we're going to price to the marketplace in those utility markets going forward. And as that market develops over time, we'll be able to give you a clearer picture.","Michael Jon Ward","And a lot of those context have built-in escalators, don't they?","Clarence W. Gooden","They do.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","The 50-50 split on met versus thermal, how is that on a year-over-year standpoint for the 2?","Clarence W. Gooden","Well, last year, the mix on a hit -- or for a year basis, was about 65, 35 in favor of met.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay, great. And then just second thing if I can, just in terms of some of the alternative energy things, how big at this point is the crude oil and the frac business? And what kind of growth are you thinking about in those markets that can help offset some of the pressure in coal?","Clarence W. Gooden","The frac sand market is very robust now, and it's becoming even, in the near term, better for CSX in our franchise because a lot of the drilling is moving to Western Pennsylvania and the Eastern Ohio. That's a positive move for us. In fact, we added fracs and cars to our fleet last year and again this year. We've moved some crude by rail. We have some contracts in place to move some more crude by rail. I wish it was as big on us as it is the western carriers, but it's not. And we think it's a future market, though, that will develop nicely for us.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Wetherbee with Citi Investment Research.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","On coal yield, I just want to try to understand, sequentially, as you move from the first quarter to the second quarter, outside of some of the metallurgical tariffs on Export Coal changing on April 1, how much of the business kind of gets repriced in that interim? Or how should we think about the change sequentially in the rest of the business? Or is there a piece of that business that gets repriced? Or does it roughly stay the same kind of quarter to quarter?","Clarence W. Gooden","Well, you'll see a couple of things with the pricing. One is that the metallurgical coal will not have the same pricing characteristics this year that it had last year. And you can read that real simple. It will be cheaper rates for the metallurgical coal. The thermal coal is mostly all under contract, under an annual contract, and has already been priced and it's in place.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then just on the rest of your coal business, the domestic business, the utility and the domestic met, is there any reason to think that there will be meaningful amounts of business repricing between first quarter and second quarter?","Clarence W. Gooden","No, there is none.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, there's none there. Okay, that's helpful. And then switching gears just to headcount for a second. When you think about kind of the level of employees you have furloughed at this point, when you look at the weakness that you're expecting for the quarter in the domestic side of the business on coal, do you feel like you're at the right point there? Do you need to take any further steps or is headcount, based on what Fred has said, kind of should be flattish going forward overall for the business?","Fredrik J. Eliasson","Yes, I think that's the right place to be thinking about it, as flat. Obviously, we will adjust up and down depending on the demand levels. But right now, our crystal ball is saying that we're in a pretty good place.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Ceraso with Credit Suisse.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a couple of quick ones. I know you mentioned that longer-term in the domestic utility coal market, you would so-called price to the market. But maybe you can give us a little more detail on how to think about this in terms of things like, what proportion of your utility customers are regulated versus competitive and maybe what proportion of your customers have capacity to switch to gas versus those that don't?","Clarence W. Gooden","Chris, I don't have that number off the top of my head.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Do you have a ballpark? Is it 60% or 70% of your customers are regulated? Anything close?","Clarence W. Gooden","I don't want to guess on a data point that I just don't have the facts on.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Maybe one for Oscar then. You mentioned that you're on track for the 130 million. Can you give us a number? And then maybe, more importantly, do you have a rough estimate of how much benefit you're deriving from the improvements in your velocity and dwell and performance? Is it 50 basis points worth of OR? Is it 100? How do you -- you're kind of in a unique position as the finance guy\/CFO that became an operations guy, so maybe you've got some insight on that front.","Oscar Munoz","Chris, I've forgotten how to do all that math. It's amazing how quickly it changes, Chris. We are well on path and feel very comfortable about 130-plus number. We're not yet prepared to give a full number with regards to that, but we'll probably do that here in the next couple of quarters. And with regards to the operating ratio performance, I mean, it's always been a big factor in that incremental margin. And I don't want to take any particular number on that one, but it's -- the important part is over the course of the year, our productivity efforts are well -- started very well and will continue for the rest of the year.","Operator","Our next question is from Justin Yagerman with Deutsche Bank.","Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It's Rob Salmon on for Justin. I guess as a follow-up to the last question, regarding kind of the productivity tailwinds, if I think about this on a CapEx basis, if you guys can maintain these productivity levels looking forward, does that change the percentage of revenue that you think you should be deploying for CapEx looking forward?","Fredrik J. Eliasson","No, I don't think that changes cause. I think we've been consistent, around 16% to 17%. Then for the next few years, that looks like the right place to be.","Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","All right, that's helpful. And then going back to the utility coal, domestically. If we think about this business longer-term and if we got a secular shift from the baseload capacity to more of the surge or supplemental capacity when electric generating demand is much higher, does that change your philosophy about your ability to price? And if you do get a switch at one of your utilities, is there a corresponding contract clause, which has a step up in terms of underlying price because the business becomes less visible and much more volatile? If you're in that section, any color would be really helpful.","Clarence W. Gooden","Okay. I'll answer the second question first. I can't discuss publicly any of our provisions in our contracts with our customers as to how the rates change and move up or down. I can tell you that if this is, in fact, a secular change in the natural gas, that the railroads and the utilities will have to sit down because what we can't do is build a church for Easter Sunday, if you'll pardon the clich\u00e9. And we've got to be able to resource -- Oscar has to be able to resource his operations here to some practical level in order to handle this. So I think that will end up being a common ground reach between the carriers, the coal suppliers and the utilities as we move forward.","Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","When you think about that in light of kind of the much higher CapEx that's required for some of those utilities because the tracks were built explicitly for that customer, what sort of step up should we expect in pricing over time, if it is a secular trend, to justify reinvestment in those track?","Clarence W. Gooden","I'm not sure I have an opinion on that. Most of those track structures that the utilities have essentially are loop tracks designed to unload the coal with belts. So I'm not sure where you're heading.","Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess the track, you'd have incremental track, which would need maintenance to kind of serve the utilities. And it's on -- my understanding is that the routes that you run are more exclusive for the coal franchise. And if you're seeing less domestic coal, to me, that would imply you would probably need to see higher pricing on the business to justify the continued reinvestment. Is that a fair conclusion to be drawing? Or are we missing something there?","Michael Jon Ward","This is Michael. I think what I'd say, Rob, is a lot of the line haul movement from the mining areas to the utility itself uses lines that we use for Intermodal, merchandise that are common lines. The only place we've had the issue you're alluding to is perhaps in the coal field themselves. And as Clarence said, at the utilities, it's just a little loop track there. That's not a big deal. So it'll be mainly in the coal mining areas. We do see good vibrancy in the export market longer-term, which I think will help support that infrastructure. So but to Clarence's earlier comment, it's probably too early in this evolution to really get specific. There will be dialogues between us and the utility companies of how we ensure that they have the capacity they need, but that we also have the predictability that we need. And that's yet to be worked out.","Operator","Our next question is from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Can you just remind us, how much contract repricing did you have on the domestic side last year?","Clarence W. Gooden","We had one contract last -- of significance, one significant contract last year.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And we should assume that, that helped the same-store comps last year, right?","Clarence W. Gooden","That's right, yes.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And maybe just switching back to this $130 million out of cost offset, Oscar. How much of that is really associated with idling some of your coal assets right now? Or should we be thinking this is incremental to what you're doing in the business today? And how much of that run rate did we see in the first quarter, how much more is coming throughout the year?","Oscar Munoz","Yes. So the coal asset reduction is an incremental piece. The 130 productivity is an ongoing initiative that we have in the company. And as business conditions allow, we'll take more of that cost management aspect. So it will be incremental to our 130. And I think your question was asked before in a couple of different manners to try to ascertain what the actual number was in the first quarter. It was significant as that we've made great progress to the number we have for the year. I'm not quite ready to share the full year number just yet.","Operator","Our next question is from Jason Seidl with Dahlman Rose.","Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Two quick questions. I'll start with the non-coal one first for you. Oscar, sticking sort of with that productivity number, how much of the productivity gains in 1Q were just sort of weather-related? I have to imagine there were some benefit from not having winter for you guys?","Oscar Munoz","Yes. That's, gosh, it's been a great quarter for the industry with regards to that, and we'll take it. Trying to quantify that is a little bit more difficult. We tend to be better at quantifying the impact when we hit adverse conditions. But let me tell you how I've kind of looked at it to, in essence, assure myself that we've actually run better. If you take the sequential view from the fourth quarter of last year to this quarter, it was roughly the same kind of quarter, roughly same level of workload, roughly same number of resources and roughly, to some degree, the same kind of weather pattern. And the quarter-over-quarter sequential improvement in those are, as our charge talked about, on those trend lines actually improved. So there was definite improvement, sequentially. The mild weather helped both quarters, so, but it's hard to quantify specifically.","Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","But you're confident that you guys are heading in the right direction x weather.","Oscar Munoz","Definitely. That's how I look at it. If you look at the sequential numbers, again, roughly the same kind of quarter, that's where I get. That's where I've been able to make that statement.","Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So my second one is going to be on coal, I apologize. When looking at the -- you guys, obviously, are more positive on the thermal side. When you're looking on the thermal, is the ARB spread for our U.S. coal still in the money or are you just moving coal that's been booked in the past on backlog?","Clarence W. Gooden","Yes, we're still in the money.","Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","You're still in the money.","Clarence W. Gooden","Barely, but we're there.","Operator","The next question is from John Larkin with Stifel, Nicolaus.","John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","First question relates to your comment that you continue to expect that this year will be a record year for EPS. Does that comment apply to each individual quarter as well?","Michael Jon Ward","I think we are forecasting on a full-year basis. We're trying to stay out of forecasting on quarter-by-quarter basis.","John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I'm just trying to get a handle on the second quarter in particular because you've been so careful in pointing out that it's going be the toughest quarter with respect to the coal comps on the utility side.","Michael Jon Ward","Yes. It is going to the toughest quarter. And we're going to be seeing a little bit more favorability in the second half as we lap some of those resource additions and most of the work. The coal headwind will moderate, but the comment is really about the full year.","John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then just maybe as a follow-on, we talked about the weather in the first quarter. Is it safe to say that there were fewer or less severe fuel headwinds in the first quarter relative to the first quarter of 2011? In other words, did fuel rise at a slower pace? And was that somehow reflected in the results?","Oscar Munoz","In terms of just the lag piece first, we did have a little bit of a negative lag in the first quarter. We had even a greater lag last year in the first quarter. In terms of fuel efficiency, as you saw, we had a little deterioration there, but that's predominantly due to the fact that we have more locomotives on our property here in the first quarter. And the same thing was true in the fourth quarter. So that's really the reason for the degradation in the efficiency numbers.","Michael Jon Ward","It was the headwind in both quarters, a little bit less than this year, right?","John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","But you don't care to quantify that?","Fredrik J. Eliasson","The end quarter lag was $15 million here in the first quarter in terms of the lag.","Michael Jon Ward","So it was what? 35 last year?","Fredrik J. Eliasson","Yes. It was about 35 last year. That's correct.","Clarence W. Gooden","John, this is Clarence. Just to elaborate on the question you asked Fredrik. Our business this year -- this quarter, although the volume was only up 1% in total, if you take coal out of that mix, our business was up 6%. And if you look at that first slide that we had in my presentation, 90% of all of our business is either stable or growing. So the way I look at the second quarter other than coal is, I'd look at it very positively.","Operator","The next question is from Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities Equity Research","I wanted to ask you something a little bit broader. You've indicated that you are still on track to achieve a 65% OR by 2015. And I think the market wanted to hear that. If I recall at your analyst day last year, you did describe that as growing to 65%. So I wonder if you could just elaborate on the relative importance of pulling harder on the cost lever versus a renewed focus on business development to stay on track?","Michael Jon Ward","This is Mike, Cherilyn. I guess when we look at it, we do, when we were going to grow to 65%, there was really 3 components: The pricing above inflation, which we're still very confident about, growing our business and the productivity of $130 million to $140 million per year. So as we look at it now, we're still going to be getting that $130 million, $140 million. We'll strive for more because, obviously, the coal dragging down some probably implies or impels us to think a little bit more on the productivity side, but the growth element is still pretty critical. And we're very excited about what we're seeing in our Intermodal business especially. We've been growing that domestic Intermodal 6% to 7% for the last 6 or 7 years. And we think the conditions in the highway trucking is going to continue to fuel that. So I'd say the basic thematics we laid out in our earnings release are still there, as Fredrik alluded to earlier, it's just a little bit more challenging with some of the loss of that utility coal business. So it's still going to be about the great service Oscar and his team are going to provide for us. And as he alluded to, and I think is very true, better service is cheaper. So we think the discipline around that will help us grow the business, as well as produce the cost efficiencies we need.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities Equity Research","Okay. And my second question, quickly, it did catch my notice that if you annualize the 12.5 million tons of Export Coal in the quarter, you effectively were operating at the high end of what you've indicated is the annual capacity of that Export Coal network as currently configured. Did that change your view of current capacity assuming that the demand is there?","Clarence W. Gooden","Cherilyn, this is Clarence Gooden, it's interesting you'd ask that question because we discussed that this morning and had some prep. And that is that the number that we used last year was 45 million to 50 million tons in capacity. And what has happened is, is our people who've been handling this coal have gotten more experienced, as the dumpers and stuff now have been replaced and the maintenance and all has been caught up with that, a lot of that capacity was idle. We feel very comfortable in that range.","Operator","Our next question is from Ben Hartford with Baird.","Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Question, I guess, on the CapEx side into lower-than-expected utility coal volumes. Are we seeing a shift in some of that CapEx allocation to some of the other growth-oriented commodities? Can you talk a little bit about maintaining that CapEx bucket for 2012 despite the fact that we're seeing coal volumes as weak as we are?","Michael Jon Ward","Yes. So on the utility coal side, most of our capital -- there's very little capital that actually goes into the car side for utility coal. So on -- and then if you look at our overall spend and coupling that with Clarence's comment that 90% of the business is doing well, there is some shifting occurring, on the maintenance side perhaps, but it really isn't that much of a difference. And Export Coal still remains very strong. So there isn't a lot of changing going on.","Yes, almost all of that utility coal moves in privately owned equipment.","Oscar Munoz","Ben, it's Oscar. Clearly, while there are very specific needs for a specific utility customer that we don't see a large forecast for, we are clearly moderating. But I think to Fred's point, it's not as significant you think given the fungibility of our track network that we use and the fact that we are growing our business in all the other aspects besides that.","Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, good. And then I guess just to provide a little bit more context to the OR target in light of coal volumes being as weak. Can you talk about what that contemplates in terms of your expectations for the utility coal market over the next 3 years as we near 2015? And kind of what the underlying maybe industrial production growth assumptions might be and continued productivity gains? Or can you provide a little bit of context in terms of how that trajectory might shape up in light of what we've seen in 2012 from a demand environment?","Fredrik J. Eliasson","Yes. If you look at the overall target of getting 65, as Michael indicated and I indicated in my comments, it's obviously more difficult now than it was a year ago. There are certain pillars that needs to be achieved in order to get there. And clearly, utility coal has to stabilize at some point. We don't know when that is, if that is sometime later this year or early 2013, but it has to stabilize. We can't have this headwind along the way. That obviously doesn't work. Where that specifically is, I think, I don't think we're in a position to say, but it has to stabilize. And then you look at the other components on the top line side, we do need a robust economic recovery that continues in line of what we've seen here. We need our continued inflation plus pricing, and you probably need Export Coal to stay as robust as we're seeing it here right now. And then on the productivity side, as Mike alluded to before, we need to continue to see that 130 plus in order to get there. So we need to hit on all cylinders in order to still achieve that number.","Operator","Our next question is from Peter Nesvold with Jefferies.","H. Peter Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I actually want to follow up on the comments that Fredrik just made because Central App has been in secular decline for years and certainly, that's not new. What we've probably seen here in the last 3 to 6 months is that the declines have been more accelerated. And Fredrik, you just said that utility coal headwinds have to bottom out at some point. I think there's a segment of the investment community right now that doesn't think it's going to stabilize, at least out of the Central App. In the scenario in which you don't really get stabilization over the next 1 to 2 years in Central App, what do you do? I mean, what operationally can you do in order to take cost out? And can you get back to a 50% incremental margin as Central App continues to be a bit of a runoff business over time?","Michael Jon Ward","Peter, this is Michael, and you're tied into Central App. I think we think more of our total coal portfolio. The Illinois Basin and the Pittsburgh Seam Coal's are growing in prominence because of their cost characteristics. So we think we will see some shifting, have been seeing shifting from cap to Central App over to Illinois Basin and to the Pittsburgh 8 Seam over the last several years. We expect that to continue. As to the end use by the utility companies, I think that's more of what Fredrik was referring to. We think that will stabilize at some point because there will be the need for the generating capacity to meet the electrical demands. So a lot of the fall we're seeing right now has been largely these plants that were built in the '50s and '60s that were going to go out, in our view, by 2014 or '15 anyway. It's just been accelerated by the weak demand due to the weather and the natural gas prices. So I think you're right, it was envisioned, it's happened a little quicker, but I think there's going to be a strong base of regular business out there just to meet the electrical demands in the Eastern half of the United States. And Clarence, I don't know if you have anything you'd like to add to that.","Clarence W. Gooden","No, I agree with you, Michael. And plus, I'm not so sure that natural gas is going to stay at $1.95, where it is now, because I don't think the gas companies can afford to allow that to happen and justify the drilling.","H. Peter Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Yes. I don't necessarily disagree on that sub $2 gas, it remains long-term. But I think that, that fear is out there in part of the investment community. And on Slide 26, when you show effectively a U-shaped recovery in incremental margins, though, is this just like a transitional quarter in which you need to reposition equipment in order to move it over to the Illinois Basin and other parts? Or is this based on -- is this kind of predicated on the areas where we're seeing the greatest weakness right now actually start to stabilize, looking out 90 to 120 days?","Oscar Munoz","Well, I think, there's a -- as we said, the second quarter because of the 2 factors that we mentioned in the presentation, first of all, the fact that utility coal continues to be very weak and you couple that with where the export tariff changes that we made and the pricing impact on that, and we haven't lapped the resource additions that we made in the second half of last year, that is what makes that quarter as challenging as it is.","Clarence W. Gooden","Peter, I'd like to address your comment about the markets and the jitteriness. I mean, if we just step back as we look at our company here, so if we go back to 2006, then our domestic utility, about 1\/3 of that business has went away over that 5- to 6-year period. And during that period, we basically, through the diversity and the strength of our overall markets we serve, we've been able to produce record years 5 out of 6 years with that dramatic decline in the utility coal. And right now, as I think Clarence said earlier, it's earning about 10% of our portfolio. So I think somewhat there may be an overconcern about that because we have been experiencing this for half a decade and still been able to produce records year after year.","Operator","The next question is from Matt Troy with Susquehanna.","Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Quick question, I just want to clarify. Before, earlier, I think Clarence said that you guys had not seen any impact from liquidated damages. I assume you mean financial impact, i.e. there's usually a one year look back, and we don't hit that until next year, but I assume some of your utility customers are wanting to and asking to operate at the minimums in their contracts? Is that fair?","Clarence W. Gooden","Yes, that's correct. They are asking to operate at the minimums.","Michael Jon Ward","Some might not be able to make the minimums, and you're quite right, Matt, it would be a next year issue should they not make the minimums.","Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I'm just trying to take weather out of the equation because only an idiot would try and call that. But I'm trying to understand from a volume perspective, what percentage of your coal business domestically is operating currently at those minimums? Is it a minority, is it about half, is it the majority? Just directly trying to understand if weather doesn't help out, how much more downside might there be until everyone is operating at those minimums?","Clarence W. Gooden","Well, Matt, that's difficult for me to give you a finite number on. I would tell you that, as we said, we expect the second quarter is going to be -- look a lot like the first, maybe a little worse in the headwinds there, that's number one. Number two, that we're working with all of the utilities where they have minimums in there. The utilities, themselves, are trying to take the minimums they can. They don't want to pay liquidated damages any more than anyone else, so are the coal companies. So I don't know if that helps you.","Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Well, it's directionally just trying to figure out the scenario by which we call out. I guess, Clarence, last question for you. You've been at this for a while. The take or pay is the liquidated damages. They're in place for a reason, they have been historically, and we've tested them before. Are you getting anymore or incremental pushback from utilities saying, Listen, this is not sustainable, we'd like to revisit this, or any signaling that the current contract structure for you and the industry may not work if coal ultimately does become more of a marginal supply or surge supply? I'm just wondering if that posturing from the customers has changed and what those minimum levels might be.","Clarence W. Gooden","We have had very little negative feedback or pushback from any of the utilities that we work with. Now having said that, we've had a couple of utilities that's called that understand that with the way things are going in their particular situation, that they may be looking at some potential liquidated damages. And what they've said is, Hey, let's stand out here and try to work together and solve our problems. And it's been all very positive. Now how's that going to impact the 3, 4, 5 years from now? To your point, I've been doing this a long time and I don't -- my crystal ball gets cloudy when I get out there 3, 4 years.","Michael Jon Ward","But there will be some changes in those relationships. We just -- it's too early to know what they are, Matt, as we discussed earlier.","Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","But the conversations are rational and controlled. Is that fair to assume?","Clarence W. Gooden","Yes.","Operator","Our next question is from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I just have a few clarification questions. First on the guidance that you're providing for 2011, you mentioned, of course, record levels. Just to understand, that's on an EBIT basis, not an EPS basis, and it includes the roughly $19 million per quarter, call it $75 million in the deferred income or the deferred gains that you're booking. Is that correct?","Fredrik J. Eliasson","Yes. We're looking at record levels, operating income, EBITDA, earnings per share, and, yes, that would include that $19 million as it will continue in the second and third quarter, and then moderate out in the fourth quarter.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Perfect. Okay. Next question is, I think, sort of a follow-on to Matt's last question there is, if -- do you get a sense that any of your utility customers today are taking the minimum volumes because contractually, to do otherwise would be negative that upon the end of that contract, do you see risk in provoking that coal to nat gas switch that might not be there as long as that contract is in place? In other words, how much of your business do you believe that is running at minimum volumes is at risk of completely going away at the end of the contract?","Clarence W. Gooden","Well, if I were speculating on that, I would say that to the point Michael made earlier, which is most of the plants that got throttled back here in the near-term were already plants that would -- that the CSAPR rules would've effectively taken out between now and 2015. To the second point that Michael also made earlier is you've got to have a certain amount of baseload coal just to beat the demand. If we have a hot summer here, and I think one of our other analysts just mentioned to predict the summer weather is crazy, and I have to agree with him, but if we have a hot summer here the -- it changes some of the dispatch that you will see the utilities have.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So that's very, very helpful. The other quick question here, you've been always targeting pricing plus inflation. Big step down in your tariff rates, down 12%. Can you just give us, simply put, why is it down so much when you're typically looking at pricing plus inflation?","Clarence W. Gooden","You're talking about the tariff in coal?","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Correct.","Clarence W. Gooden","That was a metallurgical tariff, and if you'll recall, we had taken that tariff up 2 or 3 times in the last few years when the boom happened in the metallurgical coal. And I don't have the number right here in front of me, but I know with discussions with our coal folks last week that the amount that we've taken down, the tariff is still greater, is still greater than what the tariff rate was when we started taking it up.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Is there -- given that differential, is there still room next year for it to come down but still be above that differential?","Clarence W. Gooden","On the met side, yes.","Operator","The next question is from Jeff Kauffman with Sterne Agee.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Real quick, let me ask a non-coal question and then a coal question. The ILA, we're talking about discussions on the East Coast ports. Typically in years where this happens, some of the shippers may be talking to you about moving goods at a different time of year than normal in case you get some brinksmanship in the discussions. What is it your customers on the international shipping lines indicated in terms of their concerns for later this year?","Clarence W. Gooden","Well, as you probably are aware, the ILA had a very significant policy speech out at the Pacific Maritime Conference about 2 or 3 weeks ago, in which they had at least alluded to possible work stoppages on the East Coast. What our customers have told us that they're doing is evaluating any of the East Coast ports of call that they have to build contingency plans to divert some of that business to the West Coast. And in either event, CSX will still haul our share of that business.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And let me ask kind of a more positive question on coal. We focused a lot on the utility needs, but let's talk about where these utilities are going to source their coal when they do need it. A lot of production shutdowns announced more in Central App. Are you seeing any change in the length of haul that your customers are having to get their new coal? And I'm under the assumption as your length of haul increases, you're not actually paid by the carload, you're paid by the ton mile. So can you kind of talk about some of these mix effects?","Clarence W. Gooden","Well, we had already seen over the last several years, as Michael spoke to earlier, the Illinois Basin coal starting to grow. We had several utilities that had already switched over to the Illinois Basin coal. It's got lower cost mining characteristics. It's got higher BTU content. And given the fact that the power plants now are all essentially scrubbed, the sulfur content is of little consequence there. And so and in those rate structures, the longer length to haul out the Illinois Basin versus some of the Central App locations is more favorable to us in our rate and pricing.","Michael Jon Ward","But it's not a huge model, just difference of Central App versus Illinois Basin, it's not huge. If you get up into the Pittsburgh 8 Seam coming into the Southwest -- or Southeast, it's a big difference, not a big difference on the Illinois Basin, Jeff.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. But the point is some of these factors are beneficial on a met basis to your coal franchise despite what's going on with utilities.","Operator","Our next question is from Anthony Gallo with Wells Fargo.","Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to be clear on the incentive comp discussion. I thought I heard Fredrik say that the incentive comp benefit moderates as the year progresses. Is that correct? In other words, it was a big help in the first quarter, and it's less of a help as the year progresses. Is that correct?","Fredrik J. Eliasson","Yes. That is correct. If you look back at last year, we were in a different trajectory that point. So we had significant amount of incentive comp in the first half. And then as the economy slowed down and we did some of the resource additions in the second half, we reversed some of the incentive comp last year in the second half. And so the comparisons will be easier as you get to the second half of this year. So we expect it to moderate in the second quarter and then once you get to the second half, probably flat year-over-year.","Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, if I could just briefly, you mentioned that you're moving crude on rail. There's no shale oil produced on your network, correct? This is a handoff from shale oil production in the West, is that correct?","Clarence W. Gooden","So far, that is a correct statement.","Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then along those lines, with the frac sand that you're moving, I know David and I have talked about this in the past, but can you put any numbers around that right now in terms of carloads?","Clarence W. Gooden","No, I would rather not.","Operator","Our final question will come from Keith Schoonmaker with MorningStar.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Knowing the $275 million of cash pension contribution in the period, do you expect no more such contributions for next couple of years?","Fredrik J. Eliasson","That's correct. We took advantage of what we saw was very attractive rates to the marketplace and prefunded what otherwise would've been funded the next several years. So at this point, we don't see any additional funding required.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Great. And another quick cost question. Can you maybe elaborate on a couple of the details in the decline in rail inflation that you mentioned? And more broadly, how closely do CSX estimates generally agree with the global insight values?","Fredrik J. Eliasson","On the inflation, a couple of things there that we talked about. First of all, we have some new contracts with our union members, and we have a little bit better cost share in the health and welfare side that is helping us. Then, we also have lower contribution year-over-year into the unemployment fund, the railroad unemployment fund, which is also helping. In terms of how we compare to the global insight, our forecast, over time, we should be pretty close. There could be some variations quarter by quarter but over time, it should be very, very close.","Michael Jon Ward","Thank you, and thanks, everybody, for joining us, and we'll see you next quarter.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference.

As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. During this call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode.","For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. David Baggs, vice president of capital markets and investor relations for CSX Corporation. Sir, you may begin.","David Baggs","Thank you, operator, and good morning everyone, and again welcome to CSX Corporation\u2019s third quarter 2013 earnings presentation. The presentation material that we\u2019ll review this morning along with our quarterly financial report and our safety and service measurements, are available on our website at csx.com under the Investors section. In addition, following the presentation a webcast and podcast replay will be available on that same website.","Here representing CSX Corporation this morning are Michael Ward, the company\u2019s chairman, president, and chief executive officer; Clarence Gooden, chief sales and marketing officer; Oscar Munoz, chief operating officer; and Fredrik Eliasson, chief financial officer.","Now, before we begin the formal part of our program, let me remind everyone that the presentation and other statements made by the company contain forward-looking statements. You\u2019re encouraged to review the company\u2019s disclosure in the accompanying presentation on slide two. The disclosure identifies forward-looking statements as well as risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance to differ materially from the results anticipated by these statements.","In addition, let me remind everyone that at the end of the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session with the research analysts. That said, with approximately 30 analysts covering CSX, I would still ask, as a courtesy for everyone, to please limit your inquiries to one primary and one follow-up question.","And with that, let me turn the presentation over to CSX Corporation\u2019s chairman, president and chief executive officer, Michael Ward. Michael?","Michael Ward","Well, thank you David, and good morning everyone. Last evening, CSX reported third quarter earnings per share of $0.46, up from $0.44 in the same period last year. The quarter benefited from overall revenue growth, excellent operating results, and items that are outlined in the quarterly financial report covered later in the presentation.","As the energy markets continue to evolve, our business mix is increasingly favoring merchandise and intermodal movements. The team is effectively managing this change by capitalizing on the modest growth in the economy and by focusing relentlessly on safety, service improvement, and asset efficiency. These are important drivers of our foundation for long term profitable growth.","In the quarter, this foundation helped our operating income and operating ratio remain strong, at $854 million and 71.5% respectively. The 31,000 employees of CSX have learned from experience that the best way to stay on track through the ups and downs in our marketplace is to focus relentlessly on the things that are in our control.","As we go through today\u2019s presentation, I think you\u2019ll see we\u2019re doing that very well as we focus our resources on capturing the longer term opportunity in rail transportation. We\u2019ll begin our discussion with Clarence, who will provide a more in-depth analysis of the top line results and a forward outlook.","Clarence?","Clarence Gooden ","Thank you, Michael, and good morning. Starting at the left side of the chart, total volume increased nearly 3% to over 1.6 loads in the quarter with mixed performance across the diverse markets we serve.","Growth in the merchandise and intermodal market was partially offset by declines in coal volumes. As a result, merchandise and intermodal now combine for 82% of our volume.","Moving to the right, total revenue increased $105 million to nearly $3 billion in the quarter, reflecting overall volume growth, price increase across most markets, and a $38 million year over year increase in liquidated damages. Looking at the bottom of this panel, merchandise and intermodal now combine for nearly three quarters of our overall revenue.","Next, revenue per unit increased to $1,825. The impact of core pricing gains and liquidated damages was partially offset by the unfavorable mix impact related to growth in intermodal versus the decline in coal.","Finally, core pricing on a same-store sales basis remains solid across nearly all markets. Recall the same-store sales are defined as shipments with the same customer, commodity, and car type, and the same origin and destination. These shipments represented 78% of CSX\u2019s traffic base for the quarter.","On this basis, all-in core pricing was 1% in the quarter, down from 1.5% in the same quarter last year, reflecting continued rate pressure in the export coal market and more modest increases in domestic coal pricing.","Since we have now greater variability in both our export and domestic coal business, reflecting global market conditions and our fixed to variable contract structure, and since our merchandise and intermodal markets are becoming a larger portion of our business, we have also provided you with the same-store sales pricing for these markets on a combined basis.","At the bottom of this panel, you can see core pricing for these markets averaged 3% for the quarter. This is slightly down from what we\u2019ve been seeing over the past several quarters, reflecting lower rail inflation, which is embedded in many of our contract escalators.","A strong service product provides a solid foundation for pricing above rail inflation over the long term. We are confident in the value of our product offering, and remain focused on profitable growth.","Now let\u2019s look at the individual markets in more detail, starting with coal. Coal revenue declined 9% in the quarter to $720 million. Domestic coal shipments declined 7%, impacted by lower electrical demand and high stockpiles in our service territory. Export coal volume declined 10% on softer demand for U.S. thermal and metallurgical coals, due to a global oversupply of coal. Finally, total revenue per unit was down 2%, with lower export pricing more than offsetting the modest domestic pricing gains.","Next, let\u2019s look at the merchandise business. Overall, merchandise revenue increased 7% to over $1.7 billion. Chemicals remains the key driver for the industrial sector, growing 11% on strength in energy related products including crude oil, liquefied petroleum gas, and frac sand.","Overall volume in the agricultural sector was slightly down. Feed grain shipments declined as a result of low inventories, due to last year\u2019s severe drought. In addition, ethanol shipments declined due to lower gasoline demand and production levels.","Finally, in the construction sector, building products and industrial waste increased due to high construction activity and the continued recovery in the residential housing market.","Moving to the next page, let\u2019s review the intermodal business. Intermodal revenue increased 8% to $431 million. Domestic volume was up nearly 9%, setting a new quarterly CSX record, driven by growth with our existing customers and continued highway to rail conversions.","International volume was up 3%, as growth with existing customers and from new service offerings more than offset volume losses from a carrier port shift. Total intermodal revenue per unit increased 2% on core pricing gains.","Finally, 90% of our intermodal traffic is now moving in lanes that are double stack cleared, and that number will continue to grow through strategic network investments, most significantly in the Virginia Avenue Tunnel clearance project in Washington, DC.","Now let\u2019s to turn the outlook for the fourth quarter. Looking forward, we expect stable to favorable conditions for 79% of our markets, and the overall volume outlook for the fourth quarter is positive.","Looking at some of the key markets, agricultural is favorable, with higher year over year crop yields supporting mid-teens growth in grain shipments. We expect growth in chemicals as we continue to capture opportunities created by the expanding domestic oil and gas industries. Intermodal growth will continue as our strategic network investments and service reliability continue to support highway to rail conversions.","In addition, we will be cycling the impact of Hurricane Sandy from last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Export coal is expected to grow slightly, despite soft global market conditions as we are cycling weaker comparisons from last year\u2019s fourth quarter.","That said, pricing levels will be lower as we continue to focus on keeping U.S. coal competitive globally. The outlook for the automotive market is neutral as the benefit of increased vehicle production is offset by competitive losses.","Finally, domestic coal volume will decline. We will continue to expect full year volume will be 5% to 10% lower on a year over year basis as we expect fourth quarter volume to decline slightly more than that range.","Now I\u2019ll wrap up on the next slide. The slow, steady expansion of the U.S. economy is expected to continue, with projected fourth quarter GDP growth of 1.7%. In addition, both the ISFM purchasing managers and the customer inventory indices point to continued growth. This macro-environment is supportive of growth across all three merchandise sectors, industrial, agricultural, and construction.","In addition, the intermodal business continues to grow at rates that well exceed the rate of the broader economy. Finally, coal headwinds are expected to persist into 2014. Both the export and domestic coal markets are challenged due to the low demand levels and the high inventories.","Thank you, and I\u2019ll turn the presentation over to Oscar to review our operating results.","Oscar Munoz ","Well, thank you Mr. Gooden, and good morning to everyone. Allow me to be brief, since I\u2019m happy to once again report that CSX continues to demonstrate excellence in what have been our key focus areas over the last few years: safety, customer service, and efficiency.","On the chart, I\u2019ll begin with the safety column on the left. The personal injury rate was essentially unchanged from the prior year, and the train accident rate improved 23% to 1.70. This reflects our continued commitment to keep our employees and the communities where we work safe.","Moving to service, on time performance remains at record levels, reflecting the diligent efforts of our organization. Looking at the network, velocity has improved once again, and dwell is at an all-time low, which means that customers are receiving outstanding service while we continue to maximize our assets. Moving to the far right, and as a result of all these efforts, we still expect to deliver over $150 million of efficiency savings this year.","Let\u2019s talk about resource management on the next slide. The company\u2019s improvement in operating efficiency complements the great service CSX is providing to its customers. Carloads and gross ton miles were up about 3% in the third quarter, and we absorbed this additional workload with fewer resources on a year over year basis.","As you move down the chart, you can see road crew starts were nearly 3% lower as volume growth was largely incorporated onto existing trains. Additionally, the active locomotive count was 3% lower than last year, and total operations employment was down 4% in the quarter. This demonstrates our ongoing commitment to adjust resource levels to operate reliably and efficiently.","Now, if I could, let me discuss one of our productivity initiatives in a bit more detail, on the next slide. Gross ton miles per road crew start was up over 6% versus last year. Now, remember that crew costs are variable to train starts, and the improvement in this metric allows us to grow volume without significant incremental costs.","Now, this ability to absorb volume with an existing train service does not happen by accident. And while it takes many departments working together to make this so, I want to thank our operations research and service planning teams who developed sophisticated modeling tools that allow us to optimize our complex network. Field execution of this operating plan enables us to deliver this excellent service while also realizing the greater efficiencies.","Now, going forward, there\u2019s still additional capacity on existing trains, and as business grows, we\u2019ll absorb that volume whenever possible, always monitoring customer service levels closely to ensure reliable and predictable train performance.","Now let me wrap up. The safety of our employees and the communities we work in remains a primary focus for us, and we urge our employees every day to look out for and support one another in this endeavor. Service and customer satisfaction remain at high levels, and we remain committed to providing flexible solutions for our customers to enable their growth while driving improved asset utilization and of course long term value for you as shareholders.","Finally, as I mentioned earlier, we remain on track to deliver $150 million in efficiency savings this year.","So, with that, let me turn it back to Fredrik for his review of the financials.","Fredrik Eliasson ","Thank you, Oscar, and good morning everyone. Starting to the left of the slide, revenue increased $105 million in the third quarter to $3 billion as gains in merchandise and intermodal continue to offset declines in coal. At the same time, other revenue, which included $51 million of liquidated damages in the quarter, or $38 million year over year, also contributed to the improvement.","Moving to the right, relative to the third quarter of 2012, operating income was flat at $854 million. Here, higher revenue and productivity gains were offset by the cycling of last year\u2019s SunRail gain, as well as higher incentive compensation, inflation, and volume related costs.","As a result, the company\u2019s operating ratio increased 100 basis points to 71.5%. Overall, EPS increased to $0.46 per share, up 5% versus last year, reflecting growth in net earnings and the impact of share repurchases.","As we turn to the next slide, let\u2019s briefly discuss how fuel lag impacted the quarter. On a year over year basis, the fact of the lag in our fuel surcharge program was $10 million favorable. This reflects $6 million of negative in quarter lag during the third quarter of 2013 versus $16 million of negative in quarter lag for the same period last year. Based on the current forward curve, we would expect the year over year fuel lag impact to be slightly unfavorable in the fourth quarter.","Turning to the next slide, let\u2019s review our expenses. Overall expenses increased 5% in the quarter. I\u2019ll talk about the top three expense items in more detail on the next slide, but let me briefly speak to the bottom two on this chart. Depreciation was up 3% to $277 million, due to the increase in the net asset base. And equipment rent was down 2% to $94 million, predominantly driven by a reduction in locomotive leases.","Now, let\u2019s discuss our labor and fringe, MS&O, and fuel expense in more detail on the next slide. Starting to the left, labor and fringe expense increased 5%, or $37 million, versus last year. Here, the primary driver was higher incentive compensation as labor efficiency, volume related costs, and wage inflation all offset each other in the quarter.","Looking at the fourth quarter, we currently expect headcount to remain roughly flat on a sequential basis, although as we continue to demonstrate, we will adjust our resources to reflect the current volume levels and drive efficiency.","In addition, we expect labor inflation in the fourth quarter to continue to increase $15 million to $20 million year over year and the incentive compensation headwind to be slightly less than the level we experienced in the third quarter.","Moving to the right, MS&O expense increased 10%, or $51 million, versus last year, driven primarily by the cycling of last year\u2019s SunRail gain and inflation. Looking at the fourth quarter, MS&O expense will continue to be impacted by the cycling of real estate gains which, as a reminder, totaled $35 million in the fourth quarter of 2012.","Lastly, fuel expense increased 3%, or $10 million, versus last year, as an improvement in efficiency and price was more than offset by volume related costs and adjustments to interline fuel receivable, which was the primary driver of the unfavorable variance in other fuel.","Now let me wrap it up on the next slide. In the third quarter, CSX once again displayed the benefits of a diversified portfolio of business to generate record third quarter earnings per share. This was achieved by ongoing strength in our merchandise and intermodal businesses and helped by $51 million of liquidated damages in the quarter.","Through the first three quarters of the year, CSX has generated nearly $2.7 billion in operating income, a 70.2% operating ratio, essentially flat to last year, and earnings per share of $1.43, despite continuing coal headwinds in both the export and domestic markets.","As a result of this performance, we now expect CSX to deliver 2013 earnings per share that is slightly up compared to the $1.79 that we delivered in 2012. We expect to do so despite a fourth quarter that is not anticipated to include any real estate gains or material liquidated damages, as I mentioned earlier. At the same time, we will be cycling a below the line $57 million pretax gain on the sale of a non-operating property last year.","With our earnings remaining strong in this evolving energy environment, we remain committed to deploying cash within a balanced framework that prioritizes investment in the business to drive long term value creation along with dividends and share repurchases that also provide value for our shareholders.","At the same time, we continue to target an improving credit profile that balances between financial flexibility and cost of capital through a full business cycle. Looking forward to 2015, we continue to target a two-year CAGR of 10% to 15% for EPS.","However, due to the continuing near term coal headwinds, especially in the export market, this target has become more challenging, and achieving this guidance will most likely not follow a linear path, requiring higher growth in 2015.","Looking at the operating ratio, by continuing to focus on the things that are more within our control - safety, service, efficiency, above-inflation pricing, and profitable volume growth - CSX will continue to drive towards a high-60s operating ratio by 2015 and sustain a mid-60s operating ratio longer term.","With that, let me turn the presentation back to Michael for his closing remarks.","Michael Ward ","Well, thank you, Fredrik. Since the beginning of 2012, the CSX team has successfully overcome almost $750 million of a coal revenue loss due to the transition taking place in the energy markets. As you heard this morning, we expect that this transition will continue into next year.","As it does, our focus will be the same. First, relentlessly pursuing safety, customer service, and efficiency, the things that we control the most. Our culture and systems are built for this, and it has seen us through many ups and downs in the marketplace.","Second, continue to pursue opportunities in our growing merchandise and intermodal businesses. That growth is already happening as the economy continues its slow recovery. Third, continue to invest in the most promising long term growth opportunities we see, especially in our intermodal business, where we are finding that the marketplace is very receptive to our enhanced capabilities.","Our third quarter results show the resiliency of this team and its ability to work through transitions while also managing to grow volumes in most of the product markets we serve. Once the transition in the energy markets is complete, we believe that the investors will appreciate the new diversity and vibrancy of our product portfolio, especially when paired with an underlying business that is strong, highly focused, and able to capitalize on opportunities in the near and long term.","This team\u2019s energy and motivation is not only fueled by the market opportunities we see now in merchandise and intermodal, but also by the ongoing belief in the long term outlook for rail transportation as population and consumption increases, American manufacturing gains competitiveness, and the global trade requires the movement of products across this country in ways that are good for the economy and the environment. That\u2019s what we do.","With that, we\u2019ll be pleased to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] Our first question comes from Anthony Gallo with Wells Fargo","Anthony Gallo - Wells Fargo","I\u2019m wondering if there are other markets that may lend themselves to the type of pricing flexibility that you introduced into the export coal mass market. The one that comes to mind is crude, obviously, where you\u2019ve got differentials that can play a role in volumes. So are there other markets that lend themselves to that flexibility?","Clarence Gooden ","We\u2019ve looked at a couple of the markets, but we just haven\u2019t seen one. And crude was one that we looked at early on, and we just did not see where we had any flexibility at all to price as we do in the coal market.","Anthony Gallo - Wells Fargo ","And I hope this is a related question. Does the change in your coal pricing influence how liquidated damages may or may not occur next year?","Clarence Gooden","It does. On the fixed variable, there would be no liquidated damages. The fixed part almost in effect is replacing the liquidated damages. All the other contracts that are in coal that are not fixed variable you could assume would have liquidated damages applicable.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","I guess I\u2019ll throw another one at Clarence. On coal, you noted export coal pricing could be down next year, or as you move into fourth quarter. Can you talk about the scale necessary? I guess if you look at API, at 81-82, is it still in the money for the producers? And what kind of scale do you have to take pricing down?","Clarence Gooden ","I think you\u2019ll see, in the case of the export coal, just a slight downward movement in the rates for the thermal side of the business, in the coal, particularly with that API index starting with a 7, like a 7.9 or 8.0. It\u2019s essentially to keep our producers in the marketplace during this downturn until it ticks back up. It would only be a very slight downward movement in our rates, and you\u2019ll see the producers having to absorb a lot of that downturn in order for them to keep their mines in production.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","And then related, I guess, on domestic coal volumes, you noted that was going to be down 5% to 10% throughout this year. Are there any thoughts initially on how you look at next year? Are the plants shut that need to be shut? Or do you still look at accelerating declines on the utility side?","Clarence Gooden ","I think for next year the plants that are down currently today that are both have been shuttered or that are being impacted by low natural gas prices will stay in that mode as long as gas prices are down. The major impact we\u2019ll see next year will remain in our southern utilities, where stockpiles continue to be stubbornly high, and will probably remain that way, through the midyear or beyond.","Operator","Our next question is from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays Capital.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital","Fredrik, I wanted to come back to the 10% to 15% earnings CAGR you guys have for 2014 and 2015. It sounds like with the coal headwinds that Clarence was talking about, heading into next year, you could have maybe a little bit worse outcome than flat coal like you had been predicting before. But what are the assumptions you\u2019re baking into 2015 that give you the confidence you\u2019re still going to hit that CAGR in two years?","Fredrik Eliasson ","Well, as we\u2019ve said, and I\u2019ve said this now for a period of time, it\u2019s become more challenging because of both what we\u2019re seeing in the export market and the fact that the utility stockpile has not worked itself down as we had expected originally by the end of this year. The economy, though, continues to be strong, growing at a relatively slow pace, but it\u2019s still moving forward, which is a good sign. And so what we\u2019ve said, when we laid out the guidance, was that we expect coal to be flat.","And as we look at 2014 to 2015, in order to get that, we\u2019d like to get pretty close to that assumption. Clearly, with continued strong productivity gains, a little bit stronger pricing that we have, or the economy doing a little bit better than we think, we still think there\u2019s a shot at getting to that 10% to 15% CAGR. But clearly it has to be not linear at this point, based on what we\u2019re seeing in the coal markets today, which is why we think that 2015 has to probably be a little bit higher growth than what we\u2019re going to expect in 2014.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital ","Is that going to be growth in the merchandise segment? Or are you going to have a bigger ask on the productivity side as well?","Fredrik Eliasson ","I think as you\u2019ve seen in the past year, one thing that you know when you lay out a plan, it really never comes to fruition exactly the way you had planned, so you\u2019re going to have to be flexible and agile. And that\u2019s exactly the way we execute. We focus on the things that we control, and productivity is one of the areas that we do have relatively good control, and if we also can get some help on the commercial side, both in price and additional volume, there\u2019s still a path to get there.","Operator","Our next question is from Christian Wetherbee with Citi Research.","Christian Wetherbee - Citi Research","Maybe a question just on the utility coal contract side. I think you guys had mentioned in the past that about 20% of the book of business comes up for repricing. Clarence, maybe an update on what the uptake of the fixed and variable strategy that you\u2019re taking has been. Or is it too early yet to determine that, because the contracts haven\u2019t been settled?","Clarence Gooden ","It\u2019s a little too early right now to determine that. As we told you in the past, the fixed variable contracts account for about 25% of our total domestic coal revenue. We\u2019ve got about 20% of our utility contracts up for renewal this year. So depending on how that goes, by the end of the year we\u2019ll have a better outlook on that.","Christian Wetherbee - Citi Research ","And then just a follow up, as you think about the structure of maybe some of these contracts, historically we\u2019ve tended to think about coal contracts on the longer term basis. Is it fair to assume that maybe these contracts will be of a shorter duration, as short as maybe a year? Do they get less than that? Do they get longer than that? Just kind of curious what your thoughts are there.","Clarence Gooden ","They tend to be longer than a year.","Christian Wetherbee - Citi Research ","And the expectation would be as they renew they would still stay longer than a year?","Clarence Gooden ","Yes.","Operator","Our next question is from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse ","My first question was on intermodal pricing. It seems that the RPU was fairly solid, but if I think about the growth in domestic versus international, it seems that that would have a negative mix impact, which seems to imply that pricing was actually quite robust during the quarter. So I was wondering if you had any comments on that.","Clarence Gooden ","Pricing was strong for intermodal during the quarter, and it was on the domestic side, that is true.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse ","And am I thinking about it correctly, that the domestic intermodal has a shorter length of hauls than what you\u2019re moving internationally?","Clarence Gooden ","Not necessarily true. In fact, it could be just the exact opposite. It depends on whether or not the international traffic is originating on the West Coast and coming east to us, or originating in our East Coast ports and coming in. We\u2019ll tend to have a longer length of haul on that traffic that we interchange from the western carriers than we do from the traffic that originates in the east. So it just depends on which direction it\u2019s coming from and whether or not the private asset parts of it also would, on the domestic side, have a difference in the pricing.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse ","And my follow up question, in the past you\u2019ve talked about your coal sourcing moving more towards the Illinois Basin and interest from your southern utility base to start testing that and ultimately possibly burning that. How has this changed in light of the mild summer conditions and the lack of inventory drawdowns? Is this something that\u2019s sort of off the table in the near term?","Clarence Gooden ","No, not at all. In fact, the Illinois Basin coal is actually growing for us. Both Illinois Basin coal now and Powder River coal combined are accounting for nearly half of the coal burned on CSX. ","Operator","Our next question is from Justin Yagerman with Deutsche Bank.","Justin Yagerman - Deutsche Bank ","Oscar, I think the question is for you. Your team\u2019s done a pretty good job here of offsetting inflation, even with a difficult economy and mix. And what I\u2019m kind of curious about is as we look out, if we\u2019re looking at an environment where volumes are flat to down, can you do better than offsetting inflation, do you think? How much wood, basically is what I\u2019m asking, is left to chop in productivity if we\u2019re in this kind of muted growth environment?","Oscar Munoz ","I might quibble with the \u201cpretty good\u201d definition. I think we\u2019ve done a great job for the team, but thanks. I think if I characterize your question as, can you continue to deliver productivity in sort of a softer environment, I think we\u2019ve proved that we can. So the answer to that is yes. Is there more to be had? I think there is.","There\u2019s a lot of opportunity in our field. If you think of our local serving areas versus our main line road, there\u2019s an opportunity there. Our assets still could use a lot more efficiency in how they\u2019re utilized across our system. So we see lots of activity going forward. In fact, we just recently completed a review of, for instance our next year\u2019s productivity savings, and I\u2019m happy to say as well that we are very much in line with the long term guidance we\u2019ve given at this early stage.","So there\u2019s a lot there to be had, and there\u2019s a lot of detail behind it, so I think we\u2019re going to talk here in November at one of the analyst conferences, and I think I\u2019ll be outlining some of the more specifics in that area to give you more confidence in our ability to continue to do that.","Justin Yagerman - Deutsche Bank ","And my follow up is I guess at least somewhat related. When I think about the growth in intermodal as a piece of the overall franchise, a question I get a lot from clients is how does core intermodal profitability compare to the rest of the total business. And obviously we know the RPU is lower, so it takes more volume to kind of create that overall revenue effect. And it would seem obvious that the incrementals are quite good. But if you could give us a quantification, especially now that you\u2019ve got more of your network double stacked, of how you feel about core intermodal profitability as it relates to the total business, I think it would give us a good idea of how to think about profitability for the total business given how much growth has taken place here.","Fredrik Eliasson ","You answered your own question there, because if you think about what\u2019s occurred over the last couple of years, with the double stack clearances that we\u2019ve done, and the fact that we are continuing to make sure, as Clarence alluded to before, have solid pricing gains in that market as well, coupled with the train density that we\u2019ve been able to build up over the last few years, the investments we\u2019ve made there, we think that our profitability not just on the incremental basis, but on the average long term economic basis is very attractive and at par with the rest of our merchandise business, with maybe one or two exceptions. So we feel very good about our ability to not only grow that business going forward, but also make a significant amount of money on it going forward.","Operator","Our next question is from Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs","Just wanted to follow up with regard to the question on the 10-15% CAGR target. Could you perhaps provide a little more color in terms of the breakdown of that? What percentage do you anticipate being driven by the ongoing core pricing gains versus improvements in productivity?","Fredrik Eliasson ","One of the things we\u2019ve said, in the previous seven or eight years or so, it\u2019s been driven a fair amount by a lot of legacy pricing and clearly productivity as well. As we now look to the next few years, our view is that it\u2019s going to be a little bit more balanced between all three levers. So, productivity, price, and volume. And that\u2019s really how we\u2019re thinking about it going forward. And clearly because some of the challenges we see on the coal side, we do expect the rest of the business to remain pretty robust during this period of time, because of some of the initiatives we have in place.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs","And if I could just ask a follow up question with regard to pricing, we\u2019ve noticed in the latest quarter Q some of the companies, in particular some of the brokerages, are starting to face a little bit of pressure with regard to the pricing environment coming from shippers showing reluctance to pay higher freight rates. And I\u2019m just wondering to what extent are you beginning to see any concerns with your ability to raise pricing, and particularly, let\u2019s say, in the intermodal side, where there are ongoing pressures within the retail environment, with their own ambitions to be pushing up their margins by cutting costs.","Clarence Gooden ","We think we offer a good product, a good value. We think our fundamental economics are good. We think that the environmental aspects of the product that we offer are pretty good. As always, you get pushback from many of your client base on price increases, but we\u2019ve been able to get those increases in the marketplace.","And as you can see, in the same-store sales results that we had today, we had a 3% year over year improvement in our same-store sales pricing. And that compares with last year on the same comparison basis of 3.3%. Most of the difference there has been the difference in what the escalators were for inflation. So we feel pretty solid about being able to get above the inflation pricing going forward here in the next quarters, as we move forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan.","Tom Wadewitz - JPMorgan ","I guess there have been a surprising lack of questions on export coal today, so I wouldn\u2019t want you guys to miss out on the export coal comments. You gave some thoughts on 2014, that export coal would be a source of a little bit of pressure. I\u2019m wondering, is that on the thermal side? And is there some impact from multiyear contracts expiring where maybe some coal that wouldn\u2019t be economic in the current environment being taken by European utilities? So maybe just how you look at the multiyear contract impact, and where you would think thermal exports may look in 2014.","Clarence Gooden ","The multiyear contracts are pretty much phased out. And that was mainly driven by the forward curve of the API2, because it continued, as you\u2019re aware, to drop precipitously over the last year. And so the ability to sell forward for most of our producers and our coal traders just simply hasn\u2019t been there. So we expect some pretty strong headwinds until that API2 thermal index picks up in Europe for 2014. So it\u2019s going to be a tough year in that thermal environment for 2014. Does that answer your question?","Tom Wadewitz - JPMorgan ","I guess I\u2019m just trying to figure out if all of the thermal coal from Central App that\u2019s being exported is uneconomic, or if the 4 million ton level in third quarter of export thermal coal is the level that\u2019s still going to be economic at current prices, or kind of where you go between that.","Clarence Gooden ","Somewhere in that area where you\u2019re describing now is about the low end of the economic level.","Tom Wadewitz - JPMorgan ","The level in third quarter is the low end? Or is it somewhere between 4 million and zero?","Clarence Gooden ","The level in the third quarter is the low end of the economic level.","Tom Wadewitz - JPMorgan ","And I guess if I can get kind of a second topic in quick, Oscar, obviously you\u2019re doing a great job on productivity. The performance is strong there. Can you give a quick insight on your train length in merchandise and intermodal? You said there\u2019s productivity there. And what that looks like relative to what capacity would be?","Oscar Munoz ","We\u2019ve got, as you can imagine, plenty of capacity, probably 20-25% in some of those markets. And again, we\u2019re waiting for the volume to come back to fill those. The train side is actually increasing a little bit, but be careful with that, because higher capacity cars, intermodal double stacking, all of that\u2019s affecting those lengths. So mix does affect that a little bit. But overall, on both merchandise and across our system, all train lengths have improved quarter over quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley.","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley ","I don\u2019t know who I should address this to, so we\u2019ll say Clarence or Michael. In the press release, and even in the slides, you don\u2019t reference as much as you have in the past competitive losses. And I\u2019m curious if that is a reflection of lapping some of those losses, or does it feel like the dynamics in the market are sort of improving from a competitive standpoint?","Clarence Gooden ","I think the main reason is we\u2019ve lapped most of the ones that we\u2019ve already had. We had earlier the automotive loss that you saw in there, and we had the port shift, which really wasn\u2019t a competitive loss. Business has just shifted ports. We have a lot of puts and takes here all the time. We lose some business, we gain some business, and so that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing a reflection of.","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley ","Okay, so there\u2019s not sort of any real change in the competitive dynamic from your perspective?","Clarence Gooden ","Right.","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley ","And then secondly, Clarence, when you look at the growth rate you\u2019ve just delivered on domestic intermodal, how much of that would you attribute to these new hours of service rules? Could folks even move their business yet to a rail? Or does that take a little bit longer?","Clarence Gooden ","Bill, I\u2019ve got to tell you, I think what I\u2019ve seen, and what our intermodal people have seen, is that the hours of service law has really had negligible impact on the trucking industry. What it has in effect done is put more regulation, and has made it more expensive and more difficult for the truckers to do business with, which is another dynamic that is making intermodal a better product for the customer to use. I would attribute more of our growth success to the fact that we put a lot of emphasis on organic growth and we had a specific program launch, and put a specific sales force behind a program that we call highway to rail conversions.","So we\u2019ve been very successful in that program this year, and going out to the beneficial cargo owners, along with our channel of sales partners and introducing to people who are not traditional users of the intermodal product, or were fairly light users of the intermodal product, what intermodal is, what its capabilities are, and what the service product that our operating team is delivering for us, those combinations together have proved to be very successful for us.","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley ","Yeah, it\u2019s very impressive. Would you favor growth or price going forward on intermodal? Because 9% is a lot of growth.","Clarence Gooden ","Yes. I would favor both. [laughter]","Operator","Our next question is from Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research.","Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research ","Clarence, I want to ask a little bit more on coal and export pricing. If I just do the math on the revenue ton miles and tons, it looks like length of haul in coal was probably up about 3%. So all things being equal, you\u2019d think revenue per car would end up being up something similar, but it was down almost 2%. So you\u2019ve got a 500 basis point differential. How much of that can be explained by mix versus, say, pricing of international shipments, versus what\u2019s going on domestically?","Clarence Gooden ","I would say there are two major factors that occurred there. One was what we had described both last quarter and this quarter, and that\u2019s the fixed variable component that\u2019s in the domestic part of our coal, and a principal driver, then, would be the rates and the export coal.","Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research ","But wasn\u2019t the domestic variable component net positive to yields?","Clarence Gooden ","No. It was not.","Operator","Our next question is from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.","Scott Group - Wolfe Trahan ","Clarence, just one more on export coal. Can you give us a sense, how much business at this point is on contract, or contracted for 2014? And do you think that\u2019s a meaningful number, or at this point of the year do you just not have a lot on contract yet for the next year?","Clarence Gooden ","It\u2019s not a meaningful number, and at this point, we don\u2019t have much under contract for next year. And with everybody playing coy right now, it\u2019s going to be difficult for us to know that number really right up until the end of the year.","Scott Group - Wolfe Trahan ","So it\u2019s tough at this point to give kind of any kind of rough forecast for millions of tons of coal for export this year.","Clarence Gooden ","It is.","Scott Group - Wolfe Trahan ","And the second question, the new breakout of merchandise and intermodal pricing, that\u2019s very helpful. Can you just give us some historical context here? That 3% and 3.3% you got last year, how would that compare with four or five years ago? Are we seeing better pricing there now, because the service is getting better? Or is that the pricing is getting a little bit tougher there, just because it\u2019s kind of later in the pricing story and you had some legacy in merchandise and intermodal as well? Just on the historical context on that 3% would be helpful.","Fredrik Eliasson ","And maybe I\u2019ll take this one, just having looked at it not that long ago. Clearly, as I said earlier in my remarks, pricing going forward is not going to be as big of a portion as it\u2019s been over the last decade or so, because of legacy pricing, merchandise adjustment. Some of the other markets were probably higher back then. But at the run rate that we\u2019ve seen here this year, and what we saw last year, was really impacted predominantly by what Clarence outlined before, the change in the escalators in our contract, as they\u2019ve come down, as rail inflation has come down. But I would say the last few years have been pretty stable in those markets.","Operator","Our next question is from Jason Seidl with Cowen & Company.","Jason Seidl - Cowen & Company","A couple of questions here. One, I guess I\u2019ll talk a little bit about the intermodal side. When you look at the trucking market, and you look at your success in the pricing market, is there any concern that you might drive some business back to the highway? Because clearly what we\u2019ve seen on the truckload side is their lack of ability to raise pricing.","Clarence Gooden ","We don\u2019t have that concern right now. No, it hasn\u2019t come up. In fact, it\u2019s just the opposite. Number one, we expect to continue this growth, and I hope you picked up in our prepared remarks that we\u2019ll be cycling Hurricane Sandy in the fourth quarter. So we expect to continue to see good growth throughout this year.","Jason Seidl - Cowen & Company ","And let me switch a little bit to the crude markets. If we look at everything combined, you know, we\u2019ve seen obviously frack looking a little bit better as operators are looking to pump more sand per lateral foot. If you add up your crude business, your fracks, your tubulars, your pipe, what percent of the overall business are those things combined now?","Clarence Gooden ","I don\u2019t have that number in front of me, but it\u2019s a relatively small number compared to our overall business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird.","Ben Hartford - Robert W. Baird","Clarence or Oscar, I\u2019m looking for some context in terms of what the differential between a like-for-like domestic intermodal move is relative to truck. I assume it\u2019s still at a discount, but I also understand that the difference has narrowed from that 10% to 15% discount that we had experienced over the past several years. Could you provide what it would be today, the discount, domestic intermodal relative to truck?","Clarence Gooden ","Well, it depends on, I guess, whether you\u2019re dealing in transcon or in eastern move. But typically in an eastern move you might see that number somewhere between 5% and 10%. Transcon, you may see that number around 10%.","Ben Hartford - Robert W. Baird ","And then how should we think about it over the next three to five years? You guys want to continue to grow volume and raise rates, and raise rates above the cost of rail in inflation, obviously with some of the pressures that we\u2019re seeing in the truck market. Should we expect that differential to continue to narrow? Or are there opportunities from a productivity standpoint that allow you to keep a 5% to 10% discount and continue to take share? How should we think about that balance over the next period of years?","Clarence Gooden ","I would think of it two ways. Number one, a truck is always going to be a more direct form of transportation, a higher premium, than it is going to be in intermodal moves, simply by the sheer nature and design of the vehicle itself and what you\u2019re doing. What we\u2019re trying to do is stay focused on the bottom line contribution and the profitability of that move. So we\u2019ll probably, for the foreseeable future, carry a discount against the the truck itself. But our focus is going to be on improving the contribution to the bottom line of that intermodal move.","Operator","Our next question is from David Vernon of Bernstein.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein ","Oscar, a quick question for you. On the GTMs per road crew start metric that you provided, what percentage of the labor costs would that productivity metric apply to? Obviously you guys are doing a lot to drive more efficiency on the road crews. What I\u2019m trying to get a sense for is what weighting that would have on the total labor cost in the P&L.","Oscar Munoz ","Oh, golly. I don\u2019t have that number in front of me. Labor is our biggest line item, and of course operations is the biggest. So probably a third maybe?","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein ","And then Fredrik, with the commentary on pricing may be getting a little bit weaker than it has been in the last decade, does that start to change the way you think about capex a little bit going forward?","Fredrik Eliasson ","No, I think that, once again, the focus from our perspective has always been the bottom line. And we\u2019re going to continue to push inflation plus pricing. Nothing has really changed there. But we do think, and we\u2019re seeing now, there\u2019s an opportunity to grow volume in a more meaningful way than we have over the last decade. And as we grow volume, there\u2019s going to continue to be a need to reinvest in our business and expand facilities. So the guidance we have out there of 16% to 17% of core capital as a percentage of revenue, we still think that\u2019s the right place to be.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein ","Okay, but am I hearing you correctly in the sort of a little bit less pricing than maybe we saw over the last decade?","Fredrik Eliasson ","No, nothing has really changed. What we\u2019re saying is we had a lot of legacy pricing that we had opportunities to reprice early on in this kind of rail [Renaissance] cycle. And over the last few years there hasn\u2019t been a lot of legacy pricing opportunities anymore, so we\u2019ve continued to push inflation plus pricing, just not at the same degree as we\u2019ve seen before. Nothing there is changing going forward from what we\u2019ve seen in the last few years.","Operator","Our next question is from John Larkin with Stifel Nicolaus.","John Larkin - Stifel Nicolaus","I wanted to dig a little bit into the terrific growth you\u2019ve had on domestic intermodal. Could you break that down between local east and transcon? Is the local east really driving that, or are you still seeing a growth with connecting traffic from the west?","Clarence Gooden ","I don\u2019t have that number in front of me, and I\u2019m doing this strictly from memory, so I\u2019ll be directionally correct. I\u2019m doing it from memory of the last review I had with our intermodal people. But the growth will tend to have been more in the east than in the transcon.","John Larkin - Stifel Nicolaus ","And your sense is that that growth has many years ahead of it in terms of capturing share from the highway, even though the price discount is only 5% to 10%? I guess that 5% to 10% discount does not include the differential in fuel surcharge, is that right?","Clarence Gooden ","That\u2019s right, and we just had a study updated this past quarter that we had done last year, as a matter of fact, and we\u2019ve got 9 million addressable loads in the east, over 550 miles, that we still haven\u2019t touched as an industry, that could possibly be converted to intermodal.","Operator","Our next question is from Matthew Troy with Susquehanna International.","Matthew Troy - Susquehanna International","Michael, a question for you if I could. It seems if I look at the long term spectrum the last 10 years, next 10 years, the railroads have kind of subtly shifted from, let\u2019s call it, victor to victim in coal. Yet you accomplish a lot in terms of U.S. infrastructure. I\u2019m just wondering, the dialog in Washington for the last several years has been focused around reregulatory risk. I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts about one, your dialog in Washington now about what the railroads provide and how they seem to be somewhat collateral damage of the current administration\u2019s war on coal, but more importantly how you and the other railroads may be posturing in Washington to demonstrate what you do provide, both from an infrastructure perspective and a reinvestment perspective, on a long term basis.","Michael Ward ","Well, when we visit with the legislators, the one thing that they really do appreciate is the private capital we bring to the infrastructure of the United States. Clearly, we have huge challenges with our infrastructure, and quite frankly all the rails have been investing 16-17%. They\u2019ve realized that\u2019s valuable, helps relieve highway congestion and some of the burden there. So they\u2019re very supportive of the fact that we\u2019re making more. And I think the fact that we\u2019re making more but investing more is an equation that for them makes really good sense.","On the issue of coal, clearly we knew that there was going to be some issues come 2015. Natural gas obviously accelerated that with the low prices. And one thing I read in the Journal today, though, that you might find of interest, the Supreme Court has agreed to take up the issue of EPA expanding the SO2 from mobile sources to stationary sources, which I think could be a very interesting twist. Because quite frankly, the law doesn\u2019t allow them to do the stationary sources in the manner that they are doing so. So we\u2019re really pleased that the Supreme Court has taken that up.","But clearly, this administration doesn\u2019t favor the use of coal. I think personally that we\u2019re going to find it\u2019s going to be part of the mix longer term. If you look at the nuclear plants that are being built, they\u2019re already being delayed into late in this decade, maybe even next decade. So I think over time - and this is my own personal view - we\u2019ll find coal will once again have a role. But it\u2019s going to be a tough few years here with this administration\u2019s war on coal.","Matthew Troy - Susquehanna International ","And I appreciate that. My follow up would be then to either you or to Clarence. You obviously have the 2015 regulations. To what extent have you modeled out, or can you help us just understand, what your current haulage base, or tonnage base, what those regulations may mean in terms of some of the utility closures, and what that might mean from a tonnage or carload perspective when they go into effect.","Clarence Gooden ","Well, we\u2019ve looked at what is in place now up to 2015, and there probably won\u2019t be much impact to us, because the plants that would be impacted have already been impacted, either by shutting down or by the impact of natural gas itself. Now, the proposed EPA requirements that may or may not go into effect for the existing power plants, we haven\u2019t really taken a look at that, because as you\u2019re probably aware better than I am, that will be litigated before any impact of that occurs.","Michael Ward ","But I don\u2019t think they\u2019re even going to propose rules on existing [unintelligible] until the middle of \u201914, and putting them in place in the middle of \u201915. So it\u2019s certainly far out, and we don\u2019t even know whether they\u2019re planning on that.","Operator","Our next question is from Walter Spracklin with RBC.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets","I just wanted to cover a little bit on the guidance, so perhaps for you, Fredrik. When I look at what your 10% to 15% encompasses, I guess it\u2019s off the $1.79 as a starting point, or it could be off 2013. You can clarify. But essentially what I\u2019ve seen in 2013 is a fair degree of kind of SunRail gains, tax benefits, liquidated damages, which you add up, it probably equates to anywhere from kind of a $0.06 to $0.09 lift on your earnings this year. I\u2019m curious just to see how you kind of make up for that next year.","In other words, what I was hearing was that we\u2019re not going to see anywhere near the same benefit from those kind of more lumpy or one-time items. So I guess you\u2019re indicating you\u2019ll be able to make up for that and still achieve, over the course of two years, CAGR of 10% to 15%. So without ramping significantly other items to get to that, I guess where I\u2019m going is to offset that $0.06 to $0.09, I\u2019d have to ramp quite significantly your pricing or volume or your expense savings to get to a 10% to 15% CAGR. And perhaps you could give me a little bit of sense where perhaps my math is wrong, or my starting points, or there\u2019s something I might be missing on our assumptions going forward.","Fredrik Eliasson ","First of all, it is off the 2013 base, and not the 2012 base. And it is a two-year CAGR. And you\u2019re absolutely right that because of the fact that we have received some additional one-time benefits that perhaps we did not anticipate originally, we have made the two-year CAGR a little bit more difficult as the base for this year has come up. But that is incorporated into our statement around the fact that it\u2019s become more challenging.","And so once again, as we look to the next two years, it is a two-year CAGR. It is going to mean that at some point, in order to get there, coal is going to have to come back. And as we have outlined, we think that\u2019s going to be more in 2015 versus 2014. And so overall, I would say that those two assumptions, the economy is going to be growing, albeit at a slow pace, is still something we feel good about, but the coal assumption obviously is still challenging.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets ","So to paraphrase, you need coal to come back to hit those targets in 2015?","Fredrik Eliasson ","I think right now we\u2019ve said that in \u201915 we need some help on coal again. It doesn\u2019t mean that we need it all the way back, because in any plan you also have opportunities to do better in other areas of your business, including pricing, productivity, the economy coming back a little bit faster than we would have expected. But clearly some help on the coal side from where currently seeing it is probably something that is required.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets ","Second question is on pricing. When I consider your inflation plus objective, and perhaps [unintelligible], we\u2019ve seen that kind of core 3% ex coal coming in, albeit ticking down, as you mentioned, due to increased flexibility or legacy contracts or what have you, when I look out at next year, and we lapped enough of the coal contracts, which are bringing overall core pricing down to the 1% level, such that we can go back to some normal run rate of inflation plus for next year. Or do we still see some negative impact from lapping perhaps early year coal contracts that is still going to run us below that inflation plus pricing overall for next year?","Fredrik Eliasson ","Well, I think that the additional rate adjustments that we made here in the third quarter to keep the use producers in business and us maximizing the value of our export portfolio is going to be with us into 2014 and well into 2014. And obviously we also will see what the fixed variable contracts will do also. If, for example, the domestic business picks up a little bit, you will see some impact on that all in pricing number as well that will be negative. So that\u2019s what we\u2019ve broken out here, the merchandise intermodal business, because that\u2019s the truest indication of what same-store pricing will do. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on right now to keep that above rail inflation.","Operator","Our next question is from Justin Long with Stephens.","Justin Long - Stephens","You referenced some of the excess capacity you have in the network earlier, and I would imagine, if you continue to rebuild density in the non-coal businesses, these volumes are coming back at pretty favorable incremental margins. I also know that\u2019s getting masked by what\u2019s happening in the coal business. So I was wondering if you could give any insight into what non-coal incremental margins look like today, and also how we should think about that metric as we go forward.","Fredrik Eliasson ","Well, we\u2019ve said this repeatedly. Obviously incremental margins, as you add volume onto an existing train network, is very attractive. And as we continue to grow that business - we grew 5% here in the non-coal business in the third quarter - you will have some train starts. So it\u2019s not like a step function change. You will have some train start increases.","But clearly the incremental margin is very attractive. But we do look at everything from a long term economic perspective. That\u2019s how we measure profitability. That\u2019s how we look at things over a longer period of time. But one of the reasons why we\u2019ve been able to hold up as well as we have with this significant change in our coal business is because of the fact that the incremental margin in the intermodal network, and in our merchandise business, is very attractive.","Justin Long - Stephens ","And as a follow up, as I think about capex for the next year or so, I was wondering if you could comment on your railcar equipment needs, and any areas that might be pressing in terms of either replacement or growth.","Fredrik Eliasson ","I think we are comfortable with, as I said earlier, the 16% to 17% of revenue. We have long term plans that we\u2019re executing against. We are in a good place in terms of our railcars reinvestment cycle. We will bring some additional locomotives on next year, probably not so many in 2015. But we do also have some assets stored, so we feel we\u2019re in a good place with equipment, even if the economy comes back a little bit faster than we might current be expecting.","Operator","Our next question is from Donald Broughton with Avondale Partners.","Donald Broughton - Avondale Partners","Most of the good questions have been taken, so I\u2019ll ask something rather esoteric. I was looking at a difference in complexion in your operating statistics, and we continue to see train speeds improve, dwell times come down. Obviously all good performance metrics, for which you\u2019re to be applauded.","But there\u2019s some disparities when I look at some of the different terminals. Some of the terminals have been rather static in their dwell times, and others have had remarkable improvements, example being Louisville. Did you get a different yard master? Did you change technology? Or is there a change in mix? What\u2019s driving the disparities in the change in dwell time between the different terminals?","Oscar Munoz ","I think there\u2019s a degree of movement and mix, and so something like a Louisville has got a lot of the auto business going through it. And so as I mentioned before, we have an operational design team that\u2019s constantly looking at it. And in fact, we\u2019re in the process of making some investments with another railroad, the LIRC, to actually understand the choke points we have interest in that area, and be able to relieve them.","And so it is purely a function of, as our train movements go from place to place, we\u2019ll always have these little choke points, how you react and recover from them is the critical area. And for that particular place in Louisville for instance, we have a very specific solution for it. But thanks for noticing.","Operator","Our final question will come from Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar ","A question for Oscar, probably. Oscar, the 6% gain in GTM per road crew seems like a pretty large increment. You had mentioned greater double stacking and slightly longer trains, but does this improvement stem mostly from a mix that might be richer in longer hauls, or were there some other levers that you pulled to accomplish this?","Oscar Munoz ","It\u2019s a combination. So certainly longer hauls are part of the mix. There\u2019s a lot of difficult planning and work, and a lot of technology that\u2019s been involved recently. We have items like trip optimizer, dynamic train planning, and a host of other areas that actually affect that. And at the end of the day, the operating train plan is the one that has to be developed efficiently to get those things. So it\u2019s not just about a longer haul movement.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar","And Oscar, was this a step change unique to this period? Or do you think this sort of gain, maybe not in this great an increment, but is this going to be more routine?","Oscar Munoz ","You know, like everything else, as the team continues to work and collaborate closely, and as well the use of all these tools, it\u2019s a nice slow and gradual ramp up. And we hit our mark very nicely this quarter.","Michael Ward ","Well, thank you everyone for your attention and your interest, and we\u2019ll see you again next quarter."],"6502":["CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) Q1 2015 Earnings Conference Call April 15, 2015  8:30 AM ET","Executives","David Baggs - Investor Relations","Michael Ward - Chairman, President and CEO","Fredrik Eliasson - EVP and CFO","Clarence Gooden - EVP of Sales and Marketing and Chief Commercial Officer","Oscar Munoz - EVP and COO","Analysts","Christian Wetherbee - Citi Research","Tom Wadewitz - UBS","Alison Landry - Credit Suisse","Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs","Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays","Brian Ossenbeck - JP Morgan","Matt Troy - Nomura Securities","Ben Hartford - Robert W.

As a reminder today\u2019s call is being recorded. During this call all participants will be in a listen-only mode.","For opening remarks and introduction I would like to turn the call over to Mr. David Baggs, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations Officer for CSX Corporation. Sir, you may begin.","David Baggs","Thank you and good morning everyone. And welcome again to CSX Corporation\u2019s first quarter 2015 earnings presentation. The material that we'll be reviewing this morning along with our expanded quarterly financial report and our safety and service measurements, are available on our Web site this morning at csx.com under the Investor section. In addition, following the presentation a webcast and podcast replay will be available on that same Web site.","This morning, our presentation will be led by Michael Ward, the Company\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Fredrik Eliasson, our Chief Financial Officer. In addition Oscar Munoz, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Clarence Gooden, our Chief Sales and Marketing Officer will be available during the question-and-answer session.","Now before we turn the presentation over to Michael, let me remind everyone that the presentation and other statements made by the Company contain forward-looking statements. You are encouraged to review the Company\u2019s disclosure in the accompanying presentation on Slide 2. This disclosure identifies forward-looking statements as well as the uncertainties and risks that could cause actual performance to differ materially from the results anticipated by these statements.","In addition at the end of the presentation we will conduct a question-and-answer session with the research analysts. With nearly 30 analysts covering CSX today, I would ask as a courtesy for everyone to please limit your inquiries to one primary and one follow-up question.","And with that let me turn the presentation over to CSX Corporation's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Michael Ward. Michael?","Michael Ward","Well, thank you David and good morning everyone. Yesterday CSX reported first quarter earnings per share of $0.45 up 13% from $0.40 reported in the same period last year. The Company also generated double-digit growth in operating income, net earnings and earnings per share. Revenue in the quarter was $3 billion with continuing broad based demand for freight transportation. We see better pricing vibrancy than in previous years and we\u2019re pursuing new growth opportunities in the merchandised and intermodal markets.","These efforts are helping to offset the headwinds in coal the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar and lower fuel recovery.","In addition, lower fuel price and cost saving initiatives decreased expenses in the quarter. As a result, operating income increased 14% to $843 million and the operating ratio improved 330 basis points to 72.2. While operations remain stable sequentially during the quarter, we expect sustained improvements going forward driven by the combination of resource investments coming online, asset utilization adjustments and the extraordinary efforts of our employees. Specifically, we expect the positive trends we\u2019ve seen over the past few weeks to gain momentum in the second quarter and accelerate in the second half of the year as we progress towards the record levels of service we saw in 2012 and 2013.","These efforts will drive our ability to continue pricing ahead of rail inflation, growing merchandised and intermodal faster than the economy and improving efficiency which is expected to produce savings approaching $200 million this year. With that foundation, we took action just yesterday to reward our shareholders with a 13% dividend increase and a new $2 billion share buyback program that we expect to complete over the next 24 months.","Now, I will turn the presentation over to Fredrik who will take us through the top and bottom line results as well as our shareholder actions in more detail, Fredrik?","Fredrik Eliasson","Thank you, Michael, and good morning everyone. Let me begin by providing some more detail on our first quarter results. Top line growth slowed in the first quarter with revenue slightly up versus the prior year and volume up 1%. These results reflect weaker market conditions in domestic coal a stronger U.S. dollar and the impact of winter weather which together suppress volume growth across the industry. Revenue per unit was flat in the first quarter and includes the impact of lower fuel surcharge revenue which declined $89 million versus the prior year.","Core pricing for the quarter was 1.6% overall and 3.4% excluding coal. Other revenue increased $23 million versus the prior year driven mainly by higher liquidated damages. However, we incurred a similar year-over-year increase in train accident cost stemming from the Mount Carbon West Virginia derailment, which essentially offset the game in other revenue. Expenses decreased 4% versus last year driven primarily by the impact of lower fuel prices. Operating income was $843 million up 14% over $104 million versus the prior year.","Looking below the line interest expense and other income were similar to the prior year period and income taxes were $261 million in the quarter, reflecting an effective tax rate of approximately 38%. Overall net earnings were $442 million and EPS was $0.45 per share up 11% and 13% respectively versus the prior year period.","Now let me turn to the market outlook for the second quarter. Looking forward we expect a generally flat demand environment in the second quarter as we cycle the strong surge in pent-up demand during last year's second quarter then volume increased 8%. Overall we are projecting favorable conditions for 49% of our markets in the second quarter and stable to unfavorable conditions for the remaining 51%.","We expect strong intermodal growth to continue as our strategic network investments support highway to rail conversions and growth with existing customers. Increased infrastructure development products are driving a favorable outlook for minerals. Agriculture is neutral as strengthened domestic grain shipment is offset by weakened export grain market resulting from the strong U.S. dollar. Automotive is expected to grow modestly driven by projected North American light vehicle production.","The outlook for chemicals market is also neutral due to a reduction in drilling activities stemming from the low commodity price environment. As a result we expect crude volumes from the remainder of the year to hold relatively flat to the level we saw in the first quarter. We have sustained low natural gas prices under $3, domestic coal volumes was adversely impacted in the first quarter and we expect volume to decline in the second quarter and to be down at least 5% for the full year.","Export coal volume is expected to be lower in the second quarter reflecting to oversupply and the strong U.S. dollar. While volumes have held up recently well in the first quarter, we still expect about 30 million tonnes for the full year. The strong U.S. dollar is particularly impacting the metals market where U.S. steel production is down 12% year-to-date. Overall the key drivers for a flat demand outlook in the second quarter or the change in commodity prices, the cycling of a period of strong pent-up demand during last year second quarter and a strengthening U.S. dollar.","Turning to the next slide, let me talk about our expectations from expenses in the second quarter. Beginning with Labor and Fringe, we expect second quarter average headcount to be essentially flat sequentially. On a year-over-year basis this represents a 3% increase driven by T&E employees added over the course of the last 12 months to support service. We expect second quarter labor inflation to be around $35 million similar to the level seen in the first quarter and then moderate to around $25 million dollars per quarter in the second half. As we saw in the prior quarters, there will be a $10 million to $50 million shift between the labor and MS&O expense lines in the second quarter as a result of the locomotive maintenance agreement we amended in June of 2014. This will be the last quarter that we are cycling this expense shift.","Looking at MS&O expense, we expect the second quarter to be driven primarily by inflation and higher resource levels versus the prior year, partially offset by efficiency savings. Fuel expense in the second quarter will be driven predominantly by lower cost per gallon reflecting the current price environment and a continued focus on fuel efficiency. We expect depreciation in the second quarter to increase around $10 million dollars versus the prior year reflecting the ongoing investment in the business.","Finally equipment and other rents in the second quarter is expected to stay relatively flat to last year with higher freight car rates offset by improving cycle times.","Turning to the next slide, as Michael mentioned, CSX will be increasing its dividend. The company will pay a dividend of $0.18 per share starting in the second quarter which represents a 13% increase. This build on 13 dividend increases we've made over the last 10 years and a 26% CAGR over that period and reflects the underlying strength in our core business. Our second quarter dividend increase will result in a payout ratio of 36% of trailing 12 months earnings.","Going forward we're expanding our target payout range to 30% to 40% which reflects our confidence in the future earnings power of the company. In addition to the dividend increase CSX is also initiating a new share buyback program. CSX remains committed to utilizing share buybacks to return cash to investors, and as such we have announced a new $2 billion buyback program which is double the size of our previous program. We expect the program to be completed by the end of the first quarter 2017. This program will be conducted on a pro-rata basis during that period and is expected to be funded by debt, excess cash and free cash flow from the business.","Going forward, we expect to sustain our current BBB +, BAA1 credit profile with balances our financial flexibility and cost of capital through the business cycle while targeting a debt to EBITDA ratio in the low 2s.","Now let me wrap up on the next slide. Overall CSX delivered strong bottom line results in the first quarter and this is now a third consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth while top-line growth was lower than our initial expectations due to volume headwinds, productivity gains and improved pricing contributed to strong earnings growth this quarter. While we continue to see strength across many of our merchandise in intermodal markets headwinds in coal are not greater than we anticipated at the start of the year. Domestic coal volumes are being impacted by the low natural gas price environment and we now expect volumes to be down at least 5% this year.","In addition, export coal continues to be challenged by soft global market conditions and we\u2019re maintaining our full year guidance of 30 million tonnes. Looking at the second quarter as we previously mentioned, we will be cycling a very strong demand environment from last year resulting in an overall flat volume outlook. In addition, since we do not expect to see the full benefits from the resources we\u2019re until later this year, we now project second quarter EPS to be flat to slightly up on a year-over-year basis.","Looking at the full year 2015 earnings with our first quarter results being less robust than originally expected and with our new projections for the second quarter, double-digit EPS growth has clearly become more challenging. As a result, we\u2019re updating our guidance to mid to high single-digit EPS growth for the full year. While our growth expectations this year are diminished, we still expect to have a strong margin expansion by remaining focused on pricing above inflation, delivering efficiency savings approaching $200 million and driving a stronger service product for our customers.","Bottom line CSX is committed to delivering full earnings potential of the business and maximizing value for shareholders. Our second quarter dividend increased and a new $2 billion buyback program reflects our confidence in the company\u2019s future.","With that, let me turn the presentation back to Michael for his closing remarks.","Michael Ward","Thank you, Fredrik. Before I begin my closing remarks on behalf of all CSX employees, I want to extend our heartfelt sympathies to the family, friends and colleagues of one of our employee who was fatally injured in the switching yard earlier this month. His death is a tragic reminder of why safety is and will remain our first and highest priority.","Turning to our closing thoughts on the quarter, we continue our work to transform this railroad by consistently expanding the most diverse business mix in company history. We\u2019re investing growth markets, technology to improve safety, service and efficiency and innovative ways to collaborate with our customers.","As we\u2019ve said the foundation of that transformation and those innovations is service excellence which creates value for our customers and enhances our ability to price above rail inflation grow merchandised and intermodal faster than the economy and improve efficiency and asset utilization.","In short, these are the actions that will drive CSX to the mid 60s operating ratio. We are relentlessly focused on that goal and the shareholder actions we\u2019ve announced clearly underscore our confidence. CSX is committed to maximizing new opportunities as we continue our critical role in serving with a growing American population and expanding global supply chain all while creating sustainable value for you our shareholders.","And now we will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Christian Wetherbee from Citi Research. Your line is now open sir.","Christian Wetherbee","I was wondering if you maybe talk a little bit bigger picture about sort of the balancing of resources relative to the sort of the volume outlook, it seems from a volume perspective a little bit more of a sluggish sort of outlook for this year across the industry and as we\u2019re kind of recovering from a service perspective over the last year or so obviously you have more resources coming on board, taking a step back do you think sort of -- do you feel like the network is balanced enough or sort of when do you reach that point where you can kind of think a little bit more strategically about sort of the resources you bring on to network relative to the outlook of the volumes?","Oscar Munoz","Christian, it\u2019s Oscar, it\u2019s probably appropriate for me to take that one since we do think a lot about that. And again I think a couple of things about how you think about with regards to the moderating volume forecast, we still have quite a strong baseline from the growth we had last year. So there is from an operational perspective quite a bit of work to do, so I\u2019ll have comment what happened to last year with that kind of growth, we are actually glad to be in a position where we may indeed have a slightly higher level of resources than we need. But again with the increased volatility we\u2019re facing and all the other issues, I think we\u2019re pretty comfortable with that.","I might take the entire listening group to back to '09 where we did some extensive work around the sort of variability of the industry and certainly CSX and I think those facts and data there prove to be again rough order of magnitude of third of third of third where a third is relatively fixed and you really can\u2019t get out it other than our very long, long period of time. But two-thirds of that we bifurcated into sort of a short-term variable aspect which is immediate unit trains we can shutdown, but we kind of went through this long-term variable cost aspect of that where we can take steps and I think as we think about this very question and you hear about something like variable trains scheduling which is initiative we kicked off a month ago. That\u2019s part of a long-term variable cost adjustment that we\u2019re working through.","So the obvious results or the obvious initiatives that we can take when volume moderates is we can put our locomotives into storage very quickly, we talked about that a couple of years ago, and certainly the furlough aspect is available to us, so we think about it, we think about it hard, we have some strategy around it. We do not see that coming into play over certainly the next couple of quarters with the kind of baseline growth we have from prior year.","Christian Wetherbee","And then just when you think about sort of the longer term growth potential of the business, so we\u2019re now going to be I think about three years sort of in this mid to maybe high single-digit growth rate down from the double-digit expectations earlier this year. How do you think about sort of the longer term outlook for the business? Is it possible to ramp back up to double-digit EPS growth, or you think about things like coal, and sort of the overall volume environment is potentially being somewhat limiting to that ability.","Fredrik Eliasson","This is Fredrik, I think that all depends on your assumption about coal, but I think you\u2019ve seen that we just have three quarters in a row where we had double-digit earnings growth though we think that it is certainly possible for us to do that, it just depends on how much the headwind is on coal. We\u2019ve had three years of very significant headwinds in coal that clearly has impacted our earnings growth, but at some point we believe that\u2019ll moderate and when it does we do feel that what we have lined out in terms of our inflation, plus pricing continue to drive productivity in excess of 130, 150 a year and continued to grow with economy as the markets allow. I think we have an opportunity to continue to get back to very strong earnings growth going forward.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question here comes from Tom Wadewitz, UBS. Your line is now open sir.","Tom Wadewitz","Want to ask you, I guess just start with a question on utility coal. Fredrik I think you said 5% or more decline in utility, I think that\u2019s been your comment for the last, I don\u2019t know six weeks or so. Can you give us a little more color in terms of where you think stockpiles are at in the south and in the northern parts of your network? And how much I guess visibility you have to that being down five -- five sounds like potentially an optimistic number given where natural gas prices are. So just wondered if you give a little more color on the kind of utility coal picture and then maybe rest of that 5% decline.","Clarence Gooden","Tom, this is Clarence, the stockpiles in the north and the south are both well above the target levels and that\u2019s particularly true when you take the reduced burns that are rates that are into account. In March the stockpiles were about 85 days at the current burn rates in the north and about 180 days in the south.","Tom Wadewitz","I mean if stockpiles are that high, I would guess your normal target is something like what 60 or 65 days or maybe.","Clarence Gooden","It varies in the north versus in the south and you\u2019re right about 65 days in the north, it\u2019s a little bit higher than that in the south but not much.","Tom Wadewitz","So if the stockpiles are that high and natural gas prices are as low as they are. Do you think there's risk that your utility coal is down quite a bit harder than 5%?","Clarence Gooden","There's some risk that it's slightly down more than 5%. Depends on what the weather conditions will be this summer, we're hoping they're going to be hot.","Fredrik Eliasson","And Tom just to clarify, this is Fredrik, what we've said it's at least 5% to put a lower level or a higher level on it, depending how you look at it.","Tom Wadewitz","And then on liquidated damages, can you just give us a rough sense of how to forecast that the next couple of quarters, that was obviously a little higher than we thought in the first quarter.","Fredrik Eliasson","Sure Tom. I think that for the rest of the year at least based on the visibility we have today we don't expect any material liquidated damages.","Tom Wadewitz","So flat, year-over-year for other revenue or\u2026","Fredrik Eliasson","If we just look at each quarter I don't think it's going to be more than $5 million to $10 million if that, in terms of absolute amount.","Tom Wadewitz","5 million to 10 million.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Alison Landry from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Alison Landry","I wanted to actually ask about how we should be thinking about the progression of coal yields for the balance of the year, and is there a possibility that RPU could be up in spite of fuel and sort of the things that I'm thinking about are lapping of the export coal rate concessions which I believe happens in 2Q, correct me if I'm wrong. And then thinking about the new fixed variable contract structure on a meaningful portion of the domestic book with volume declines, I would expect the yields to rise on that. Am I thinking about that correctly, what are some of the other factors that would move that up or down?","Fredrik Eliasson","This is Fredrik, I'll start with then I'll let Clarence add any thoughts there. I think that from a fuel perspective I think you're going to continue to see pressure in the remaining three quarters of the year. We benefitted a little bit here in the first quarter from the lag, so you're going to continue to see that impact in RPU for the full year, at least based on where we're seeing fuel today and probably more so than we saw in the first quarter. You were right that as we get through the second quarter we are lapping the decreases that we took last year for export coal and that should be beneficial as we get to the second half, And I always point our investors to looking at the same-store sale, that\u2019s where we provided there because I think that\u2019s a much more meaningful number to look at because that gives you true indications what\u2019s going on from a pricing perspective, and with the fuel surcharge mechanism that is designed to make us neutral to fuel price volatility with exception of lag. I think when you look at that perspective I think that gives you more better view of it, but fuel surcharge revenue will be low and it will year-over-year it is going to impact the yields negatively throughout the year.","Alison Landry","But you don\u2019t think that lapping of the sort of concessions and then with the fixed variables structure if volumes are down then yields theoretically should be up that\u2019s not enough to offset the fuel decline in other words?","Fredrik Eliasson","I think it will be helpful but I am not sure it\u2019s going to be enough to offset the impact we\u2019re seeing from fuel.","Alison Landry","And then just a follow-up question based on some of the numbers you gave in the release it looks like the productivity gains in the quarter were around 18 million. Should we expect to step up in the second quarter or would you say that the bulk of roughly 200 million is expected to be realized in the second half as service is restored?","Fredrik Eliasson","Yes, so if you look at the different line items in our quarterly flash, you will see that if you added up between labor, MS&O and fuel that it was about $38 million in the quarter. In total and that is obviously the first quarter of our target to get to something that approaches $200 million for the year.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Rob Salmon, Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open, sir.","Rob Salmon","Very strong performance with regard to the core price increases, could you give us a sense in terms of the expectation and the cadence as we look out through the remainder of the year, have we kind of experienced kind of the full benefit of those stronger pricing increase in the first quarter or can we potentially see a step up as we look out through the duration of the year particularly in intermodal?","Clarence Gooden","No, Rob, this is Clarence; I think you can expect to continue to see our pricing increase. I think we've mentioned in the fourth quarter that we had begun fairly aggressive pricing earlier in the year. Our third quarter same-store sales pricing in our merchandise area was 2.5 in the fourth it was 2.7. In this quarter as you saw it was 3.4, so I think you can continue to see a continual increase in our same-store sales pricing and in our business as we move throughout 2015.","Rob Salmon","But that's really helpful. I guess Clarence I think you had mentioned about the little bit -- speaking little bit more positively about the potential for international intermodal conversions over to East. Could you give us your updated thoughts in terms of what that opportunity is looking like for kind of '15 and then as well as longer term perspective?","Clarence Gooden","I think the water is little muddy and unclear given the situation is and ongoing is in the West. I continue to believe that there will be diversions to the Gulf in the East Coast as more and more customers get comfortable with what is going to finally emerge with the canal and with the post West Coast strike. It's just too early to see how that's going to settle out and as you know there is a lot of congestion up and down in the East Coast so that's going have to settle down for people to make decisions, but I think you'll see more than what even we had anticipated seeing as time moves on over the course of the next couple of years.","Operator","Thank you. And now our next question comes from Thomas Kim, Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Thomas Kim","I had a couple of questions just with regard to the near-term guidance, with your 2Q EPS is that including buybacks?","Fredrik Eliasson","Yes, that is in all view, yes.","Thomas Kim","And then with regard to the outlook for the year, does your guidance assume the fuel prices increase as a forward curve would imply?","Fredrik Eliasson","I think we've just included whatever the forward curve currently is that we're seeing out there. I don't think it's a significant difference from what we're seeing right now, but yes whatever the forward curve dictates.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ken Hoexter, Merrill Lynch.","Ken Hoexter","Can you clarify the other revenues, is that $5 million to $10 million comment from other revenues from liquidated damages, is that a change or year-over-year increase of 5 million to 10 million or you're only looking for 5 million to 10 million from now on, on the entire other revenue line?","Fredrik Eliasson","Ken, and I think I've heard at the beginning of you question, so I'll just to make clear. On liquidated damages what we are expecting for the rest of the year, if I look at the each quarter it looks like it's going to be somewhere between $5 million and $10 million of absolute amount of liquidated damages not year-over-year.","Ken Hoexter","And then just on, looking at operations Oscar, the on time originations is fallen a 50% arrivals down to 41%. Kind of all the way back to the start of the one plan here going back to 2005. Can you kind of just talk through what's going on, what needs to happen, why we're not seeing maybe even a more negative impact on that from operations or cost side, and what needs to swing back into the positive on that.","Oscar Munoz","I think it's what we've been saying for the last almost year, the amount of growth that came on to our very structured and disciplined one plan was the only missing part was the amount of resources in order to run it. And I think we've been fairly consistent with saying, as those resources arrived well trained and well manufactured we can put them to good use and start to spin again and that's exactly what's been happening over the last month along with our own initiatives and the efforts of our employees. And so the -- the really last saving kind of grace is this locomotives arrival that are beginning to trickle in here, some in the first quarter and second quarter. That's the big factor in the whole business and I think again we've been consistent with this second quarter being sort of the vital point and then the increasing level of service that we'll get in the back half of the year and then again trying to approach the record levels we had just a couple of years ago.","Ken Hoexter","So the crew basis where you think it should be now, is that correct?","Oscar Munoz","Literally we've got 400 people here in the first quarter that came out, we'll have another 400 to 500 that come out here in the next three months and then it tapers off. And so, resources from a crew perspective I'd say other than a couple of spot areas we're in very-very good shape and that's caught up and that's been a six to nine month sort of initiative to get those folks well trained and ready to work.","Ken Hoexter","So just to clarify then on maybe the cost per employee, do we see that ramp up or is that at the levels you want it now?","Oscar Munoz","I think it's essentially at the level, we'll have a few more people coming in here in the second quarter, some of it is for attrition but some of it's for a specific areas of shortage and in terms of the cost per employee I think to some degree over time we expect the cost of employee to come down, because right now we're working in a very elevated level of overtime and so the cost of employee should over time moderate from where we are right now and have been for the last few quarters.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Bill Greene, Morgan Stanley.","Bill Greene","Oscar and Michael I know you sort of are aware of this and we look at the eastern rails, the margins have sort of moved towards the lower end of the group. And I'm curious your thoughts on, I realize there's a priority of things we have to do so coal has been a challenge recently and we want to get the service right. But when do you sort of come back and say, let's take pen to paper here and let's really figure out how we're going to get the costs out, because coal may never come back and while the pricing can accelerate maybe there's a lot more we can do on costs. How do you think about 2016 or '17 or even longer term about addressing that and getting you guys back toward these long-term targets, mid 60s, try to accelerate that as best you can. How do you think about doing that from a cost standpoint?","Michael Ward","This is Michael, and I think you're quite right, so, I guess as we look forward the coal has been a challenge to both the eastern roads. And I think as we look forward it's about how do we grow the other businesses intermodal or merchandize above the rate of the general economy which we have been doing. Price above inflation which, that is actually accelerating and start getting new cost out and as you know we targeted $200 million this year and we think the combination of those three, some modest growth, pricing above inflation and good cost discipline and efficiency will drive us towards those mid 60s.","Oscar Munoz","And Bill I would add at the trailing part of your question you specifically mentioned how that relates to cost and I think Michael's concept is a great one, it's not just about one thing, it's about pulling all the levers we pull historically, but specifically to address the cost aspect of it. It's the normal productivity we've been able to achieve plus some and so the plus some is initiatives and objectives that probably sort of border on more innovative and potentially in the world of rail roading a little bit more risky people think. So these variable scheduling thing that we've done, I mean as you read the press about that, half the people are supportive and the other half are oh my god, they're going to tank the whole place by doing all this crazy stuff.","You got to understand the things that we do we think through very thoroughly, we plan through it and we'll communicate to our folks and that particular program right now is just really, it's freed up 50 locomotives in a month. Our metrics are starting to go up for a lot of different reasons but including that. But I guess my point on the cost side is it's an efficiency play it's not just necessarily a wholesale reduction in people. Efficiency creates productivity and productivity creates the economic value that you're coming.","So pull all the levers, the cost one's a big one, the rate that we're increasing this year is probably a rate that we'll keep thinking about in the next future years to get to that mid 60s.","Bill Greene","And when we think about the challenge that occurred in 2014, partially that was weather but partially significant growth in volume and then as we look at what you've just sort of walked me through here, the volume aspect of it, it would almost seem to me that the more profitable way to do it would be to focus on both price and productivity. Volumes can do what they'll do but growing faster than the economy actually would seem to make it more difficult to solve the service issue. Am I missing a piece of that?","Oscar Munoz","Yes, in a way, because when we talk about growing faster the economy you may remember last year the second quarter we surged 8%. We don't do surge as well we do 2% to 3% growth very well. So, our hope is that we can modestly grow at a little bit above the inflation. We can adjust to that kind of growth there is just surges we don't do well Bill. But I agree with you it's clear to the pricing and productivity are more under our control and obviously we are going to focus intensely on those, but we do think that third equation, some growth above inflation will create shareholder value.","Bill Greene","And just one point of clarification on that last point, does the growth above inflation require higher levels of CapEx or you are at where you need to be?","Oscar Munoz","I think the 16% to 17 % we have been at, historically will take care of it going forward.","Operator","Thank you. Now our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays.","Brandon Oglenski","So, Michael or Oscar this is -- kind to be the third or fourth year now when we've taken guidance down and yet your lead off the release last night with the $2 billion buyback. So can you put in context, what the board is thinking and up in the buyback right now, in the midst of what seems to be another challenging year for all the reasons we've discussed on this call.","Michael Ward","Brandon I think, we've all along thought that the best way to create shareholder values are balanced approach to capital deployment and cash deployment, so we are going to spend $2.5 billion this year, 17% above revenues investing for growth in the future. Secondly, this increase on our dividend takes us a little bit above a 2% yield which some of our shareholders value that dividend, we think we want to be a little bit above the average for the S&P 500 and the share buybacks the 2 billion we think it helps those shareholders alike buybacks, so we think that balance deployment of doing all three, really is the best way to create shareholder value as we've done over the past decade. So I don't view this is very different than what we have been doing and a way to create a strong shareholder value going forward.","Oscar Munoz","And Brendon, this is Oscar, you kind of ask how does the board think about it, so being a board member on different place than here out our company the way board members think about it, any time you project sort of forward things like this, they're based on a base line of financial strength and economic viewpoint that there is growth and strength in this business and in this particular company that can actually pay for that, so it's a very thorough review processes, it's not something that gets done very lightly.","So we have a lot of potential for growth, we weathered a significant storm here over the last few months, and I know it's hard to go back to it but you lose that kind of volume stream and revenue stream and operating profit strength and make it up and stay even. That's the strength of our business, now we got to build upon that and clearly our board sees that benefit has approved the initiatives that we've opened up here with.","Brandon Oglenski","And I guess to follow up on Bill Green's question on margins, there is other U.S. carriers that do have 20% of their revenue exposure in coal, they haven't had great outcomes either on the volume side, and growth hasn't been right for the industry for the last 10 years. And yet, we've seen a lot of margin traction on price and productivity. I know that\u2019s part of your plan. But what is changing in the forward outlook for CSX that suggest we are going to get significant margin expansion beyond just the fuel contribution in 2016 or 2017, that I assume took to the board and said it doesn't make the shares relatively attractive at this point in time. And are you willing to put out a long-term margin target like you did I think back in 2010 or 2011 when we said we are going to be at a 65 OR by 2015.","Oscar Munoz","On the first part of your question about the margin expansion, I think if you look at the underlying business that we have, that has actually been expanding over last couple of years, but the headwind from almost a billion dollars loss of coal has offset that. So we are comfortable, when we look at the underlying core earnings part of our company, that it's clearly capable of continuing to expand margin over time similar to what you have heard earlier.","In terms of setting a target out there and so forth, I think what we have said before and I think you know in 2011 we set a target for 2015 of mid 60s and with the exception of what happened in our coal business that is clearly outside of our control, we would have been there. What I've said repeatedly has been, that I think what we need to do right now is to establish some progress here and hopefully we will do that this year of sustained margin expansion and some earnings growth, and hence once we have that track record behind us, I think we can step back and say are we comfortable now to put another target out there. But I think right now our focus is margin expansion this year, and continued earnings growth.","Operator","And our next question here comes from Brian Ossenbeck, JP Morgan.","Brian Ossenbeck","So you mentioned that frac sand volumes were down in the first quarter and highlighted the reduced energy related drilling activities. Would you expect kind of similar decline in the second quarter from sands or will it accelerate up with the rest of the year as the E&P is kind of picking there the CapEx plans. And can you also just give us a mix of the basins that you'll serve again as a reminder.","Clarence Gooden","And what was your last part in your question, a mix of what?","Brian Ossenbeck","The basins, the shale basins that you served, just so we have a sense of where the sand is going?","Clarence Gooden","Our frac business was down about 10% in the first quarter, we will see numbers may be similar to that in the second quarter, it's probably a little too soon for us to speculate on that for the rest of the year because one of the formations that we serve which is both the Marcellus and underneath that the Utica is a different type of formation and in fact the deals in a lot of wet gases as oppose to oil type formations, and so some of the fracking has continued into those areas. And we also are shipping frac to some of the other formations that are not as active and our volumes that we shift to those formations are not in the quantities that other rail carriers are shipping to those formations and those formations are western formation. What was the first part of your question involving crude?","Brian Ossenbeck","I think that basically covered it, but if you want to I guess give an update on crude given, potentially some of the more safety issues, the tank car standards which we'll probably see in the next month and so, any further initiatives on track inspections, if you can kind of bring us up to the current operating environment that would be helpful.","Oscar Munoz","This is Oscar. I think what you hear and read is very accurate, our process of attempting and to prevent any of the accidents through inspections and a host of other initiatives continues to be a very-very strong initiative not just at CSX but across the industry and to some degree had a very strong alliance with the petroleum producers. On a tank car standards, we are very anxious to have that standard out there. It's going to take some time to get those cars of this systems, so as sooner the government can release those standards that we can begin to manufacture those I think will be critical, because I think on the mitigation of when night a incident happens, that car and that standard of car is going to be very-very helpful in that process, so we look forward to the government's decision on that.","Brian Ossenbeck","And just quick one on intermodal. You mentioned that the West Coast congestion was impacting East Coast volumes. Can you give us an update just how that improves or may be it hasn't since the labor negotiations have settled there, so may be what's going on in March and in early April? And then, also when you think about East Coast taking potential share, is there is a lot of infrastructure expansion that needs to be done at those ports or on a CSX network to potentially handle some of that when it does start to land on-shore.","Clarence Gooden","Brian I am certainly not as good an expert on the West Coast as a Western rail carrier is going to be of on answering your questions on the West Coast, I would tell you that it's better today that it was yesterday and it was better yesterday, obviously then it was few weeks ago, but they have certain amount of congestion on the West Coast and a certain amount of backup still exists on the West Coast that is going to take a few more weeks ahead of us to get straight. And regards to the East Coast, we still have congestion on a lot of ports on the East Coast. There is going to be a requirement for lot of infrastructure improvement on the East Coast to handle the larger vessels, the deeper water requirements that are going to be required for the larger ships and that's going to take place over the next several years.","Lot of ports that you are aware, already have plans in place to do that. Some have plans but no financing in place to do that. And then of course there is going to be a need to have a lot more infrastructure on the land side that support the ports themselves to be able to handle the type of volumes that come into that. We shortly think that the rails, both Eastern rails who play a big part in what happens in the rail infrastructure that serves the ports.","So, I think it's still a couple of years away of being able to see how it will finally shake out on how the infrastructures that's needed to support that growth on the east occurs and exactly where on the East Coast that growth occurs.","Operator","And our next question comes from Matt Troy, Nomura Securities. Your line is now open.","Matt Troy","I wanted to talk about the variables you can identify with some specificity in coal specifically was curious if you have any updated thoughts on your internal work or studies you may have commissioned about what kind of capacity be it tonnage be it volume may be coming offline in 2015 over the next three year period as some of these older coal fired plants are required to shut down. Is there a tonnage at risk number or business at risk number you've developed internally that might help us kind of understand at least what that baseline number might be away from the variables that are harder to predict that are more tied to things like nat gas and other things.","Fedrik Eliasson","I think what we have said. This is Fedrik. I think what we have said in the past is as we looked at 2015 we identified about 4 million tonnes that removed in 2013 that will going to be impacted by the MATS or Casper rules and then beyond that, we had another 3 million tonnes that we moved in '13 that were going to be falling out in '16 and '17. I think that's our best estimate for impacts from those regulations. I mean in longer terms we have to understand and better study and see what ultimately comes out of the proposed CO2 regulation.","Clarence Gooden","That's true, but now you also need to be ware there is a lot of capacity at the remaining plants that will be able to pick up a lot of that slack that as it comes out of that system, so it's not as if you know the capacity in total goes away.","Matt Troy","Understood, I just wanted to double check and make sure that there hadn't been change in light of some of the pricing in gas and differentials there. I guess the second question a follow-up would be simply with gas now down taking to 250 range, what's your sense as you look across your customer base the potential impact from switching, is it fully felt at this point and can't get much worse or if we take another $0.25 to $0.50 down and hit that reach a historical low, is there an added or incremental hit to the coal business to those utilities that at that point becomes just too compelling not to switch to gas or are we feeling the full effect now?","Clearance Gooden","I think all the utilities that can switch to gas as the low rates are switching gas have already switched to gas that could conceivably do it, number one. I think number two when you start seeing gas prices get into those type ranges the utilities themselves get nervous about that because what utilities look for is stability not for extreme price changes or price ranges.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ben Hartford of Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.","Ben Hartford","I just wanted to get some context to your demand outlook here in the second quarter you talked about the flat volumes year-over-year, I assume that's all and if so given the coal headwind and anticipated declines in the second quarter would suggest a fairly healthy and above seasonal ramp through the quarter comparable to what we saw a year ago. And I am wondering what you're anticipating as it relates to the sequential improvement in volumes on the merchandised and the intermodal side, will it look like 2Q 2014 and what are your customers saying as it relates to some of the pent-up demand in the context of what we experienced a year ago, some perspective there would be helpful?","Clearance Gooden","This is Clearance. I think our view was on the slide that you saw there, towards the end of the presentation where that in 49% almost half of our markets we saw it is very favorable in the food and consumer, intermodal, minerals and waste and equipment markets and neutral in about 22% of the market. So our ag products we still have a large carryout from the last year's crop. And in fact one of the largest that we have ever recorded in the United States. The South American soybean crop in particular is strong this year and given the fact that we have a strong U.S. dollar, it's impacting our U.S's ability to export soybeans. We still have by historical standards a fairly strong export.","Automotive on a year-over-year basis essentially be flat with North American light vehicle production at 17.4 this year versus 17 last year, still a large year by historical standards one of the largest since 2000, but flat on the year-over-year basis. Our chemical business the chemical side of it being relatively flat but with petroleum products still being up, it will be a flat year in a year-over-year basis but flat at a high level and where we're down is in some of the bulk commodities the coal, export coal some of the ForEx products, some metals which as Michael pointed out yesterday on CNBC are being heavily influenced by the imports coming into this country. Steel consumption is very high in the country but U.S. mill utilization is not high in the country. And by our phosphates and fertilizers that are due to both high inventories and a strong U.S. dollar that\u2019s allowing some imports into the country. So while we're seeing flat, it's flat at a very high level.","Ben Hartford","And I guess you pointed to that slide if we look at that same slide from a year ago, you had 83% of the volume in the favorable category now at 49 which just to react to that, it doesn't seem as though you have the same type of favorable pent-up demand bias here in the second quarter of '15 as you might have had in 2014 and so you won't have the same degree of seasonal improvement in 2Q '15 as you might have had a year ago, as weather improves and as we work through some of these port congestion issues, is that fair?","Clarence Gooden","That's fair. We won't see the surge that Michael spoke about.","Operator","And now our next question comes from Cherilyn Radbourne, TD Securities. Your line is now open.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Just one question for me and it's on price and I guess what I am wondering is one of the reasons that pricing has been accelerating and expected to continue to accelerate has been that capacity has been tight across the transportation industry. And I am just wondering now that volumes are coming in a bit slower than expected, can you just address whether you think capacity is still tight enough to support the kind of increases that you've been expecting?","Clearance Gooden","This is Clearance. Yes, we still see capacity as been very tight. For example housing is still robust and that's positive for us. If you notice our minerals business was I think around 11% or so based on a lot of highway infrastructure, projects going on particularly in the region and country that we serve, so we're seeing truck capacity staying relatively tight. Coast wise barges have been very strong and strong demand, so we still see capacity fairly tight and we still see a strong need for transportation, pricing does seem to be very robust if you look at the spot truck load market it is remaining fairly strong. So we see that it's still a very strong, robust pricing environment.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from David Vernon, Sanford Bernstein. Your line is now open.","David Vernon","Maybe Fredrik or Oscar, a question for you on the network itself, with respect to the coal business becoming a little bit lower density are there any opportunities to create efficiency by rationalizing some of that what is now lower density pieces of track or is it too integrated into the network to make that type of cost action feasible?","Oscar Munoz","This is Oscar, we took a lot of those actions clearly when we first started to see the coal declines, and it's one of our more variable cost structure businesses as coal is, and so as that volume sort of decreased we are able to decrease the train starts fairly quickly. The infrastructure is a little bit more difficult, it is part of a broader network and the way the -- sort of the rules of the land work is if you run a certain amount of tonnage it has to be maintained at a certain level. And we've not really gotten down our tonnage in those routes much below what we, what would constitute a large reduction in sort of the capital reinvestment and maintenance that's required.","So we\u2019ve done a lot, we'll continue to manage and monitor that, but it is a little bit of integrated into the network as you suggest.","David Vernon","And then maybe just as a quick follow up, could you give us an update on the Virginia Avenue tunnel and when the double stocking there is going to be cleared? And if you guys have tried to figure out what kind of impact that could have on the intermodal profitability?","Michael Ward","Well, we're really pleased there was a group that was trying to have an injunction against us proceeding and fortunately the federal court in DC denied that injunction request last week which allows to commence with the construction. We got a few permits we have to get which we think will come pretty quickly. We think the first tunnel will be done within 18 months and that both tunnels will be done within a three year timeframe. So that is the last piece of our national gateway, obviously that dramatically improves the economics out of the Mid-Atlantic ports because we can then double stack versus single stack, so great increase in our efficiency and our ability to move the traffic, so we're very excited. It's been a long process, we've been at it for five years now and looks like we're finally going to start moving some dirt and get this thing moving.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from John Larkin, Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is now open.","John Larkin","Clarence you laid out a pretty attractive ramp in same-store sales pricing growth starting with the third quarter all the way through the first quarter, you said that would continue and when you said it would continue did that imply that it would sort of level off at somewhere between 3% and 4% or do you see the potential for that to go higher, part number one. Part number two, given that you have 3% more people working on the railroad to provide a service, you've got some inflation embedded in the labor contracts. How high does that number need to be to absorb the 3% more labor and what I'll call rail inflation? Are you more than covering that with the 3.4 or do you need a little bit more.","Cherilyn Radbourne","On the first part of that question John, I think we have the potential, not the potential -- we will take that number higher each sequential quarter going forward. I don't know how to be any more emphatic and straight forward than that.","John Larkin","Fredrik or Oscar would you comment on the second half of the question?","Fredrik Eliasson","Yes John, and my job is to not let those increased resources and costs sit idly by and we create efficiency that way so that again we maximize where we can get on the top-line with that increasing margin story on the bottom-line.","John Larkin","So there'll be plenty there to derive some margin expansion. And then secondly as a follow on, I did read an article yesterday that talked about some of the operational changes that are going on within the company. And I've seen this before but there was some discussion of running what used to be a daily train every 28 hours, so that you ended up running six trains where there were seven per week in the past. From an operational point of view how is that working out? Are you seeing the savings that you hope to see and has there been any degradation in service as a result of this?","Oscar Munoz","John, it's Oscar, and I I've thrown it out a couple of times over the course of the calls, the early returns are great, it's part of our merchandise network is about a 100 trains that we're working through this. And frankly we've seen an immediate reduction certainly in a crew starts and addition to the train length that we're gaining. We've also freed up about 50 locomotives and the operating measures that we sort of work through from train to ultra power to just velocity and dwell, actually have followed positively.","Now certainly milder weather has helped, little bit of volume reduction has helped up. So we don't want to attribute it all to that but we're very encouraged by the early signs of this. And with regards to any potential concerns I think one of the things you worry about, about running less trains in a given week is that you start sort of messing with your flow through in your terminals and yards. And we've not seen that anywhere significantly. So at this point again I have good month into what we've seen all the great positive results and very little degradation and the other measures, so we'll continue that for the near future.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the Bascome Majors of Susquehanna. Your line is now open.","Bascome Majors","Just curious where do you think you might be on the OR without the almost 1 billion loss in coal that you've seeing since 2011?","Fredrik Eliasson","This is Fredrik. I think that obviously some other assumptions goes into the two, but if you take 1 billion and add it back and the appropriate margin on that I think you're pretty close right around that 65 which we had originally outlined to be at, at this point.","Bascome Majors","And into follow up on that presumably the profitability on what's left in coal is certainly decline from that period both because of the export cuts but the lower utility volumes on the network. Could you refresh us directionally speaking on where the margins in your segments sit by segment from both an absolute standpoint and the incremental margins you see on volume growth here?","Fredrik Eliasson","Well so I think we've said publically before that if you look at our business overall across the 10 or 11 markets, I think coal because of its very -- the way that we operate coal has always been the top end of the margin, also chemicals because of the risk profile. I think those two and I think the good is rest of our business is very homogenous in terms of the contribution to the bottom line that we generally look at this from a long-term economic perspective including asset recovery charges.","Incrementality is a little different depending on whether its unit train versus batch, clearly we're very -- we think that the intermodal margins from an incremental perspective is very attractive as is adding stuff to the batch network to schedule network as well. And then obviously when you add unit trains that does require additional resources wholesale to move that unit train. So overall I would say that we feel good about what we're in terms of contribution clearly the coal is still at the high end and as is chemicals because of its risk profile.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jeff Kauffman of Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.","Jeff Kauffman","I wanted to focus a little bit on the operating metrics that may accompany service improvement if you're able to hit your goals and targets here. I guess question one is it as simple as locomotives or are we going to require stronger infrastructure in the track whether it's sidings or double track or extra track? And then I guess secondly, if we look at some of the key operating metrics such as average systems speed, dwell time. Where do you believe if you're successful these metrics can be by the fall and kind of should be within say 12 to 24 months? And what does that do for you in terms of equipment utilization or ability to grow without incurring incremental cost?","Oscar Munoz","Jeff, it's Oscar. With regards to sort of locomotives versus infrastructure, I think we've done and again we've talked about over the course of the year all the infrastructure investments that we've made different routing protocols, different interchange points. All of that by enlarge has been invested with regards to the volume we've seen. So we've worked through that part fairly quickly. On the crew side we've been hiring madly and those folks have gone -- right it gets down to the locomotive space.","Long-term from a strategic perspective there is always issues around infrastructure siding as we've run longer trains for instance, some technology to get our hump yards a little bit faster and quicker with the merchandised train that's mixed that\u2019s got to be obviously worked. But for right now it is a big issue around locomotives which is why there is variable train thing, freeing up 50 locomotives is a very important part of our initiatives.","I think as you think with regards to our operating metrics that you see as you know those are very top-line. There is many, many metrics that we watch inside the company but all-in I think what we've said is that they'll continue to progress forward in the near-term to certainly get above prior year that's our first goal. And then as we progress longer term you said 12 to 24 months, I think inching up to again to a record year we had back in 2013 and that is always going to be sort of our goal over the long-term.","Operator","And our next question comes from Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Scott Group","So flat to slight earnings growth in the second quarter comps get tougher in the back half of the year just on a year-over-year basis. What are the offset? What's the offset there? Where you think you see an acceleration in earnings growth in the second half?","Fredrik Eliasson","Well, I think as we outlined before, the number one priority right now for us is to restore or put the service back to where it needs to be in order to be able to get the assets fluidity that we've been lacking here for essentially five quarters, and as that happens we know that there is a lot of embedded cost that will come out. You also heard Clarence talk about where we are from a pricing and the fact that we expect an increased pricing. So it's really about pulling those two levers harder and the foundation in order to be able to do that is getting the service level back to where it needs to be because we know a lot of good things happened from that. It's not as I think you're implying in your answer as much of a volume story right now, because the fact that we're cycling for the rest of the year frankly very strong volumes, so it is pricing and it is productivity.","Scott Group","And then other revenue, what was the drop in the adjustments to revenue reserves and is that kind of a one-time thing or is there any ongoing impact there. And then I know it's early but is there any way to think about liquidated damages in '16 if coal is down a lot this year, do they go up or at some point I'm guessing they need to all come down but I'm not sure if that's in '16.","Fredrik Eliasson","So taking your last part of your question first, I think it's a little too early to think about that, I think we'll have to see where volumes come out before that. But I don't expect as much liquidated damages in '16 or '17 as we've seen over the last couple of years, but we will have a better view of that as we get closer to that year. In terms of the other revenue that's simply just a reflection of the fact that the network slowed down in the first quarter and we have something called in transit reserve and the biggest factor of that decline in supplemental revenue was because of that. So as the network, at a very level of network slows down, you have more of your cargo on the network when you end the quarter and therefore you have more in reserve to reflect that and the network improves it actually comes out the other way so that's essentially all it is.","Scott Group","So we shouldn't have that as a negative impact in the future quarters as the comps.","Fredrik Eliasson","No, you should not.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jason Seidl, Cowen and Company. Your line is now open, sir.","Jason Seidl","Two quick questions, one Clarence getting back to intermodal and obviously some of the shifting has gone on with the West Coast issues, how should we think about yields as some of the freight may move back to the West Coast on the intermodal product.","Clarence Gooden","I would expect that if it moves entirely back, you're talking about international traffic on a transcon basis?","Jason Seidl","Yes.","Clarence Gooden","I would expect the yields to improve to go up.","Jason Seidl","And I guess my follow up question. The STB reauthorization bill that's out there, Michael I was wondering if you had any thoughts about that and what are the potential impacts you know that might come on to the rail industry.","Michael Ward","Jason, we're actually supportive of that bill, we think that it strikes a good balance between some of the things some of our customers we'll like to see and also our need to continue to make sufficient money to reinvest in this business, so we're supportive of it, of course you don't like everything in every bill but I think all in all it\u2019s a good balance and we're hopeful that the House who is generally supportive of the rail industry would take up similar legislation.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Cleo Zagrean, Macquarie Capital.","Cleo Zagrean","Both of my questions relate to pricing and the first one is on coal. Could you please share some insight into same-store price for coal excluding fuel in the quarter? And your thoughts on the outlook for pricing given volume challenges for each of domestic and exports and if you envisage taking some action there if the volume drop should be stronger than 5%? Thank you for the domestic utilities.","Clarence Gooden","So the first part of your question was same-store sales for pricing coals?","Cleo Zagrean","I am trying to get a sense for pricing ex the fuel noise in the quarter for coal.","Fredrik Eliasson","This is Fred, just to clarify, so our same-store sales that we publish excludes the impact of fuel and there are two numbers that we show in there, one is the overall pricing same-store sales and one is the ex coal. So implied in that is that if you look at the delta I think you can get a sense of what the same-store sales is for coal. So that makes sense?","Cleo Zagrean","I thought somehow fuel was in the same-store impact. And then the second question, with a strong focus on pricing that we're hearing from you. Should we expect to see a trade-off in volume growth against the potentially softer spend from peers and maybe continue the adjustment in network resources in response to a more moderate volume growth scenario?","Clarence Gooden","I don't think so necessarily, I think that the value that we're offering our customers, I think at the service levels that we have that are improving, I think given the fact that capacity particularly on the truck side of the business is and with the highway congestion with the driver issues that our customers are facing, with the overall value proposition that rail is offering. I think that our pricing and the value that we're offering I think we can retain the volumes that we have and continue to grow and expand our business. And I think when you see it for example in this quarter, our pricing and same-store sales and our merchandise which includes our intermodal being at the 3.4 and the fact that our domestic intermodal grew at 9% supports that theory.","Operator","And our next question comes from Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar. Your line is now open.","Keith Schoonmaker","Thanks a quick follow-on to that comment Clarence, concerning a strong domestic intermodal volume growth. You said this drivers both highly conversion in growth with new customers. Would you estimate what portion of recent growth stems from each?","Clarence Gooden","Well, I really don't know from the standpoint of new customers because we use multiple channels of sales and it would be difficult to define what some of those new customers are, but I would tell you that a large portion of that's been the result of a couple of programs we have both with beneficial cargo owners as well as our highway to rail conversion programs that we have in our intermodal product, and it has been I think extremely -- both programs have been extremely successful programs that we've had.","Keith Schoonmaker","And then a quick question on coal pricing, you've mentioned the negative impact of both export rate pressure and of fixed variable contracts in the period domestic. Was export by far the most powerful influence or were these factors similarly and significant would you say in the period?","Clarence Gooden","I would say both factors were similarly significant.","Keith Schoonmaker","And could you elaborate just to bit more on the mechanism of the how fixed variable effected the period?","Clarence Gooden","Fixed variable effects in the period where we have whereas the customers take a larger shipments of coal that the larger the shipments that they take based on what their fixed price is that the average rate for that coal shipment comes down.","Michael Ward","Then the fixed portion is shared over more tonnes lowers the rate.","Operator","Thank you. Now our next question here comes from Justin Long of Stephens. Your line is now open.","Justin Long","I wanted to ask your Eastern competitor said this week that it expects to get back to 2012, 2013 service levels by the back half of the year. For your network do you think that's an achievable target just given the significant or significantly more crews and more locomotives, is that something you have pretty clear line of sight to two at this point, and if not what are the risks to getting back to those service levels?","Oscar Munoz","This is Oscar. I think again being consistent with what we've said we see certainly acceleration towards those levels in 2013 which were for CSX very much record levels. And again in full transparency I think we'll gradually improve to those levels and I think every bit of improvement will have a nice bottom line impact, but I am not quite ready to prepare to sort of give you a sense that we're going to be back to those record levels in this year certainly striving us for a bit longer term.","Justin Long","Okay fair enough. And then just one quick follow-up, thinking about your second quarter guidance, could you talk about your volume assumption for coal in the quarter?","Clarence Gooden","Well I think as Fredrik has articulated, we expect that coal to be down in the 5% range. It could be slightly worse than the 5% range but at least at 5%.","Justin Long","I just didn't know if that was any different for the quarter versus the full year but you're just sticking to the same guidance.","Fredrik Eliasson","That\u2019s for the full year, we haven't given a specific number for the second quarter but for the full year we think that's the right place to be.","Operator","At this time we don't have any questions on the queue.","David Baggs","Thank you and we'll talk to you again next quarter.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. During this call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode.","For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. David Baggs, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations Officer for CSX Corporation.","David Baggs","Thank you, Sherlyn, and good morning everyone. On behalf of the management team I would like to welcome you to our first quarter earnings call, and also thank you for your interest in CSX Corporation. This morning we are being represented by our Chief Executive Officer, Hunter Harrison; our Chief Marketing Officer, Fredrik Eliasson; our Chief Financial Officer, Frank Lonegro; and our Chief Operating Officer; Cindy Sanborn.","Now, before we begin the formal part of our presentation this morning, let me remind everyone that the presentation materials, our safety and service measures, our quarterly financial report and our press release announcing our new guidance and dividend and share repurchase are all found on our website at CSX.com under the investors section. In addition, following this presentation later today, our webcast replay and the 10-Q will be filed.","And so now let me turn your attention to Slide 2 of our presentation. Here are our forward-looking disclosure statements outlines the risks and uncertainties of forward-looking statements. There will be a number of them this morning during our presentation, and I imagine quite a few during our question-and-answer session. So I would encourage you to take those forward-looking statements in the full context of this disclosure statement.","On Slide 3 is our non-GAAP disclosure statement. While CSX does file all of its financials in accordance with US GAAP, we are providing some non-GAAP financial measures in addition to the GAAP financial measures to help you better understand the business. But these measures are not a substitute for GAAP.","Finally, I would say that we have close to 30 analysts this morning, and so I would encourage everyone to play nicely in the sandbox, so to speak. You will have one primary and one follow-up question, so that everyone can be heard and we use everyone\u2019s time wisely. And before I turn the presentation over to the team, let me also remind you that the earnings call today is limited to discussions of the earnings and the business of CSX only, and we will not touch upon matters that are currently the subject of the company\u2019s annual meeting."," And with that, it is my great pleasure and privilege to introduce our President and Chief Executive Officer, Hunter Harrison. ","Hunter Harrison","Thank you, David, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. I guess my first comment would be I am back. I didn't think this is going to happen, but [Indiscernible] hopefully \u2013 well, not hopefully, I think factually my last leg on this journey that I have taken on this railroad, [Indiscernible]. In the 50 years did I ever think that I would finish in Jacksonville a group of railroaders with the talent that they did this, and the franchise that is before us, and I am very, very excited about the opportunity.","I met yesterday with the first board meeting, formally with our board. I think it is safe to say that all of us were pretty excited about the opportunities going forward. As I found here, [Indiscernible] there is a group of [railroaders]. There might be a little shift in direction, but this company is going to achieve things that some of you don't think could be achieved.","I'm not going to spend a lot of your time on the first quarter because I was only here for 30 days, and the three leaders here with their team produced those results are going to spend some time going through that with you. I certainly think it was a pretty outstanding quarter. As an outsider certainly looking in and it builds the foundation for us to go forward on with our plans for the future.","I would say that I was reflecting this morning on what I might say here today and I know if you look at the various [Indiscernible] that we deal with, certainly our investors are represented \u2013 certainly our employees are represented. The one group that is so important to us that is not represented directly that I am [Indiscernible], and I am extremely excited.","If you look at our service offering as it is today, there is a lot yet to learn but pretty good job in our bulk movement and cycles. Do a good job in the intermodal area. I think all of us would say that in our core merchandise category, we can make some significant improvement. I think the [majority] have already started down that road. And I think you will see some what I would characterize as some pretty dramatic changes in our cycles and I think you will see things like from Chicago to Florida markets that we will take two and three days out of that as a result of some strategies you are going to hear about today.","So I think that is pretty exciting for the customer base. So without me taking additional time let me turn it over to the team here, and let Frank give us some observations on the results in the quarter.","Frank Lonegro","Thanks Hunter, and good morning everyone. Consistent with the transformation that we are undertaking through Precision Scheduled Railroading under Hunter\u2019s leadership and knowing that you are eager to ask questions this morning, we are going to be very efficient in the way that we discuss the numbers.","So with that as a backdrop, let us turn to Slide 7. The safety of our employees in the communities that we serve will continue to be a top priority for CSX and for this leadership team. While the personal-injury frequency index was 9% higher year-over-year the absolute number of injuries was down slightly, and that is part of our continuing drive towards the ultimate goal of zero injuries.","Our train accident frequency index was 25% improved with substantially fewer reportable incidents. In terms of efficiency, we are continuing to drive both train length improvements and fuel efficiency gains, while our service levels remain stable on a year-over-year basis.","Cindy Sanborn","Thanks Frank. Let me just add a little bit. First of all, it is very exciting to be working with Hunter here, and as the operating leader spend a lot of time with him. And so I will talk a little bit about the quarter, but I will talk about going forward how we are working on some of the items that Hunter has briefly alluded to this morning.","First of all, as you would expect, and has always been the case for CSX safety is our highest priority, and we will continue to focus on that not only employee injury performance, but train accidents in order to improve or make sure that the communities that we operate through we operate through safely.","Turning to productivity, in the first quarter we delivered $123 million worth of savings. Significant resource productivity drove this. Continued train length opportunities and reduction in crew starts, and also we saw some other support costs, particularly in engineering and mechanical labor cost also affecting us positively in the quarter.","But I think what we really want to hit on here is how we think about our business going forward to drive to and in the past six weeks we have done a couple of key things I will just highlight this morning. One, we have adapted our operating plans to incorporate some of our unit train business into our merchandise business \u2013 merchandise service. And this allows us to do a couple of things, as you think about our 28 hour train dispatch, our variable train dispatch, we did that in order to improve our train length and we have done that and very successful with it.","But I think what is helping us continue to move forward with train length and cycle time improvement is adding the vast network into the merchandise service, so now we can have a more balanced network with a more highly likely probability of seven-day a week service and still keeping the length of the trains where it is productive. This also serves our customers well as we are able to improve dwell time in our terminals as a result of these changes.","The second item that we have been working on is reduce our \u2013 changing or converting our switching operations in some of our traditional pump yards into a flat yard model. We have 12 pump yards across the system. To date we have converted four of those over into flat switching operations. This has allowed us to reduce \u2013 support resource efficiencies, particularly in managing the infrastructure that is necessary to support in pump yards, in the pumping process, reduce that as well as at the end our plan has been focusing on improving the cycle times through those terminals.","So we have been able to do both of those things. As we look forward, we expect to continue to reduce several pump yards. We don't have a hard and fast specific number. We look at each one individually. We will make sure we are making the right decisions to improve both productivity and service.","And I would also say that as we look at our quarter one measurements, our network performance measurements we are seeing as we have implemented some of these changes I am talking about, improved dwell time, improved velocity across the network and we think that will compound the effect of some of the changes that we are making to lead us to feel very comfortable moving forward that will actually have record productivity in 2017 following our previous record productivity in 2015.","So overall I think the team is doing very well coming together with some significant changes as we adjusted to the reductions in management headcount as part of our first quarter initiative. We saw a lot of change there and we are continuing to see change, and we are driving that effectively I believe, and we will continue to do so incorporating that into our business model going forward.","Frank Lonegro","Thanks Cindy. Those are great insights for the analysts and for the investors. Going forward as we implement Precision Scheduled Railroading you will see what we believe is a powerful combination of improved safety, improved service and improved efficiency that exemplifies a great railroad.","We believe that that powerful combination will benefit employees, customers and shareholders alike. Turning to Slide 8, the GAAP view of our income statement highlights the 10% year-over-year top line improvement, which has been achieved through a combination of volume growth, higher fuel surcharge recoveries, favorable mix and value pricing.","Volume is up 3% with pricing on a same-store sales basis increasing 3.9% all in, and 2.5% excluding coal, driving revenue per unit up 7%. Looking at the expenses at a high level, total costs were up $243 million, with a $173 million restructuring charge accounting for most of that year-over-year increase.","As for the charge of the combined impact of increased fuel prices, inflation and volume, were nearly offset by the $123 million of efficiency savings that you heard Cindy reference. The focus on cost control and a rising volume environment produced incremental margins of over 70%, excluding the charge. Bottom line, ex-charge CSX delivered record first-quarter operating ratio of 69.2%, operating income of $885 million, and a record first quarter EPS of $0.51. ","Turning to Slide 9, these financial results drove over $1 billion in operating cash flow, a nearly $300 million year-over-year improvement. This improvement carried through to free cash flow before dividends of $630 million. Earlier this morning we announced a free cash flow target of around $1.5 billion for the year, which takes into consideration the combined impact of our earnings trajectory and a Capex reduction of over $100 million.","We continue to remain focused on returning capital to shareholders through a balanced deployment strategy. In the quarter, we distributed $166 million to shareholders in the form of dividends, while repurchasing 258 million of CSX shares. Having now completed the two-year $2 billion program we commenced in April of 2015, we were pleased to announce a new one-year $1 billion buyback program earlier this morning.","While ROIC was stable on a year-over-year basis, we fully expect that it will inflect more positively going forward as we continue to increase efficiency and reduce the asset intensity of our railroad.","Debt-to-EBITDA was also relatively stable as we continue to appropriately utilize our balance sheet and remain committed to a BBB+ Baa1 credit-rating.","Turning to Slide 10, the volume outlook for the second quarter is largely positive with nearly 70% of our markets in the favorable category and over 20% of our markets in the neutral activity. Only domestic coal is expected to be unfavorable in the second quarter.","Fredrik Eliasson","To just add a little color to that, if you look at the macroenvironment, several indicators support continued growth. Obviously the economy continues to grow at a modest pace, GDP in the 2% to 2.5% range for the full year and probably a similar pace in the second quarter itself.","The consumer sentiment continues to be at high levels, which helps many of our markets especially the intermodal market. At the same time though the truck market right now continues to see excess capacity. But as we move through the year we do expect that to gradually improve in the second half and into \u201918. And then, of course, on the favorable side export coal had a very strong year in the first quarter, 8.7 million tons that we moved in the first quarter.","We do expect that to taper off as we move through the year, but we still think that an upper 20 million range in terms of tons for the full year on the export side is a good estimate at this point.","As we think about some of the headwinds, we think that auto production is clearly flattening out, and we think for the rest of the year relatively flat. It is probably a good place to think about the auto business, and then while the core chemical market continues to grow at a nice pace we expect crude by rail to continue to decline both year-over-year and sequentially as we move through the rest of 2017.","And then of course on the unfavorable side, we see our domestic coal business. We talked about it in the fourth quarter, we lost some short-haul business but despite that we did about 15 million tons here in the first quarter on the domestic side and we expect a similar pace in the second quarter. But as you saw in the first quarter the quality of the revenue and the impact to the bottom line is still very strong and we expect that to continue as we move through the year. It is obviously reflected in our RPU.","So I would say overall we feel good about the top line. We continue to expect our merchandise and intermodal business to grow at or above the economy as a whole, and it is nice to see coal revenue to be growing a little bit here this year as well. And lastly and echoing Cindy\u2019s comments earlier, we are very excited about what this operating model can do for CSX, not just in terms of the bottom line, but really what it can do for our customers. We are already seeing that from a service perspective both in terms of transit time, reliability and recoverability. So we feel very good about this change. ","Michael Ward","Thanks Fredrik. A very helpful again commentary for the investors and for the analysts. Let us finish up on Slide 11, with our first quarter results we are off to a very good start in 2017 and expect to accelerate the transformation to Precision Scheduled Railroading in the coming quarters.","Earlier this morning you saw that we issued full year guidance, excluding restructuring charges. To that end in 2017 CSX expects to achieve a mid-60s operating ratio, record efficiency gains that you heard Cindy mention, EPS growth of around 25% off of 2016\u2019s reported EPS of $1.81 and free cash flow before dividends of around $1.5 billion.","In issuing these expectations we assume, of course, that the coal markets and the overall economy will remain stable. This morning we were also pleased to announce 11% or $0.02 increase in the quarterly dividend along with a new one-year $1 billion share buyback program. And finally we look forward to sharing our longer-term plans with you in the second half of the year. ","With that we will be delighted to take your questions this morning.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Ossenbeck with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Go ahead with your question.","Brian Ossenbeck","Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for taking my call. Hunter, I guess my first one for you I know with have a scheduled day later in the year perhaps to hear more about the longer-term plan, but the initial impressions that were laid out in the file, could you just give us some context in terms of where do think the significant opportunities are to further streamline the network, you talked about monetizing real estate, which is a target that \u2013 any specific when you are there, and just in general if you think there is just too much track with too few [Indiscernible] going over there, just the ability to improve the network density and the design as you move forward over the next couple of years?","Hunter Harrison","Let me \u2013 I don\u2019t think that this franchise is significantly different than others that we have overlaid this model with. Cindy touched on a lot of these things, and as we have talked internally, we don't have some ironclad numbers on what the headcount number got to be, what the pump closures got to be. It is going to be what is smart to do.","I don\u2019t think that I have spent a great deal of time with Cindy and her team. We are \u2013 I think step one was cutting through a lot of bureaucracy. We are getting through where we had nine-divisions, and so we are going to be going down to maybe a couple. [Indiscernible] just cost money, and I think we are trying to streamline that. We are trying to get the right leadership in the right spot. We have got nine dispatching offices. I don't think any railroad has nine dispatching offices, and we are going to make some efforts there.","There is efforts going on now promoting productivity, I would expect before the summer is up, we will have 550 or so locomotives [restored]. We will probably have 25,000 freight cars put up, and all of the associated costs that go with them, labor, material, and the locomotive fuel productivity, velocity, and a lot of things, dwell time in terminals I would say would come down dramatically. Some of our facilities historically have they been overbuilt? Yes. ","Like the auto railroad. But this railroad has had a special challenge. If you look back at the mergers, there were more companies involved with mergers of that what is now the CSX than any other major railroad. So if you are going to place [Indiscernible] and we have four or five yards, well, it is because you have money to have a yard there if you go through some of these common points.","So, we are doing some things. For example, [Indiscernible] is a good example, where I think we have four yards there. Cindy is helping me here, and I think we will be down to, maybe there is one super operation there. But I know we have a track of land there that is an operating proxy that needs to be a good deal of money. So there is going to be some monetization of assets. So this is going to be more of the same at maybe a more rapid pace taking advantage of larger opportunities.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay, great. Thanks Hunter. So, just one quick follow-up just on the coal side, Frank or Fred, if you could just give us a sense is that the export market price and that really spiked pretty much after the quarter ended. So, just want to see if you thought that the mix, the favorable benefit that you saw in the first quarter is something that you would also be able to capture in the second and third quarter? Thank you.","Frank Lonegro","Well, thank you. We don't forecast size, but we have said overall, over time that we do have indexes on our contracts on the export side that when things go well we share some of those economics, and when things aren\u2019t as well, we take some of that pain. Clearly this quarter, it wasn\u2019t just export pricing that helped. We also see some pretty favorable mix and a lot of that mix we do expect to continue, but it of course, depends on where we see the utility business, for example, go in terms of resale replenishment of the inventories of through the years. So, I think there's a favorable mix story and favorable sort of going forward but I think it's unclear at this point how favorable it's going to be through the year.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. You may ask your question.","Chris Wetherbee","Hi, great. Thanks, and good morning.","Michael Ward","Good morning.","Chris Wetherbee","I want to touch on the volume side, Hunter. If you could just sort of give your initial impressions on what you give sort of volume opportunities that are out there for CSX, obviously playing in the E3 automatically kind of think of the intermodal market and efficiency obviously played big and to being able to gain shareable from truck as well as your rail competitors. Can you give us a sense as what your initial impressions are about sort of the franchise there and how you think about that going forward?","Hunter Harrison","Well, I'm obviously in 30 days, I've limited amount of knowledge. I will say that I think one of these starting things going forward with this organization as well as rail overall is the opportunity catch before us to get this off the hour. And I think that we're set up in almost a perfect storm here to take advantage of that.","If you look at that we have we start with a strong base to begin with, with great market that we serve up and down the East Coast and Chicago, Florida, and some really some growth areas, where there is congestion, the highway systems aren\u2019t going to be able to contemplate everything. If you look at the advantages of rail would, from an environmental standpoint, from an energy standpoint.","And if you look at an organization that is going to be able to take a combination of dual times and terminals about limiting terminals, which lowers cost, that at the same time then takes dual times now from an average of effectively a day or 25 hours or 26 hours of dual, down to 18 or so, and you say we're going to skip some terminals and you start to look at really what we used to talk about the strong competitive, that is not strong competitive, it's better than pro.","Now, the issue is the change and is tried to take that to the market place and to sell it and converted and change it. But that's where look the individual markets, I mean this can be just as we guess more the competitors out there, we'll stretch and fighting and win the business there. The real opportunity has been is on the in the high wall.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay, that's very helpful. I appreciate that. And then just a follow-up thinking about some of the guidance and we had to think about it a little bit beyond 2017. So, mid-60s for this year, we're having pull forward some of the benefit, but clearly some of the things you are going to be doing are going to be gaining traction as the year progresses. Presumably you'll be entering 2018 at a better run rate.","So, obviously I'm trying to jump the gun here a little bit and get some of this forward. Look, before you might be ready to give it but when you think about 2018, and I think you got it wrong in the respect that it is sort of natural that some of the benefits you're acquiring in 2017 will be playing out in 2018 and maybe we're thinking about something like the low 60s or show a warn in 2018?","Hunter Harrison","Is that based -- send me your mail, Chris, and I'll fill it in. I think you're right on. Look, this is not the first time this movie played out. We see opportunities, not going to happen overnight. Is it going to exactly linear? No. will be there be a fair step approach? Yes. Do we have any barriers here? Structural issues, as we deal with the board discuss, we can't do what's been done before. And even go beyond that? No reason.","Chris Wetherbee","Got you, that makes sense. Thanks very much, it's worth the shot. I appreciate it.","Hunter Harrison","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. You may ask your question.","Tom Wadewitz","Yes, good morning.","Hunter Harrison","Good morning, Tom.","Tom Wadewitz","Hunter, I wanted to see if you could offer some thoughts on the opportunity at CSX versus what you saw at CP. I think of your approach being one of the things you do is simplify the flow of traffic and reduce work event. If CSX has a greater complexity and the network begin with versus CP, that would have find maybe greater opportunity for cost take out in or as you take out that, that complexity right simplify things.","So, that's the right framework and I wanted to see if you could comment on that and maybe compare the opportunity you see so far at CSX versus what you had at CP.","Hunter Harrison","Well, I mean, Tom, they're totally different franchises. The maker, the market. As generally speaking, a lot of roads are in North America. So, you look behind your belt and you say look what is the best way to operate and run this franchise and I think that the -- there is a lot of talk about this is not a simple T operation that it got all the complexities and the density and the spaghetti bowls.","Well, the waiting, the hand led, eat his spaghetti and get rid of it. So, one of the things we've done, is the same the time we work diligently on is being sure that we're not going through terminals and process and cars just because the terminals there. So, it's almost kind of the old term we use before the wide motocross, let's start on with this franchise.","The last, and I was there yesterday when I talked to group but the last stop yard, it was built in North America, the last two, with one and way across which is the heart of this CSX in my view. And the other one was our [indiscernible] in mid-80s. Markets have changed since mid-80s. Demand of traffic that's bulk, that is intermodal, that is very nearly -- true trends. It don\u2019t have to be sold it in Swiss, so you adopt that year your operating strategies to the market.","And I just think that there's much more of a natural fit to make some of the changes that we need to make here that will present even more opportunities to both year point for the complexity as said in the past and built in and simplified. This franchise, if you apply the marker here to some degree, adds more potential than anyone up there will.","Tom Wadewitz","Okay, great, that's helpful, I appreciate it. Then the second question of the follow-up would be, CSX approached intermodal has benefit different than I think what typical if you look at Norfolk, they have the corridor strategy. I think that will be more characteristic maybe of the Canadian road. But CSX has this Baltimore Ohio hub strategy, and has talked about one in the South East. Do you think that is the right approach to continue or do you think on the intermodal network is their opportunity to maybe simplify and go towards more of a kind of a origin to destination as opposed to sending it to the hub that you have in Baltimore Ohio? Thank you.","Hunter Harrison","Well, Tom, I don\u2019t want to get into about there. I'm sure the people here they\u2019ve have potentially a different better strategy given what they had to work with. The operating groups challenge is to present velocity and speed in customer requirements to the marketing sales group and then given how well that service going to apply to the market, then its spreads changed job into this end of service to take that to the market.","And I think a better product raw product this Wendy and team can produce the more successful and more latitude, it will give thread and technique till I think that I think the competition, we're going to get bears in our rear view mirror and they're going to be looking at the rear, we're going to be pass him on the left.","Tom Wadewitz","Okay, great. Thank you for the time, Hunter, I appreciate it.","Hunter Harrison","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.","Allison Landry","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Hunter, Chicago has always been at the forefront of your mind and historically you've made comments that CSX used the Chicago belt and perhaps the Indiana belt for switching more than any of the other rail. So, now that you're in arguably a much better see to effects change. Do you have any plan to pick Chicago and if so could you provide some content surrounding that?","Hunter Harrison","I don\u2019t know that how quick to pick Chicago. But Chicago is a special issue. And if you noticed in a lot of our what we've discussed and talked about, it hadn\u2019t included Chicago, but those Chicago we here affectively carved out and are taking a different special type look at. Chicago has some real challenges to this all North American infrastructure. Chicago cannot survive as it is today. You got law suits now, the imminent domain, had you want to take rail infrastructure to replace it with that one.","You got it right beside all here. Okay. Everybody wants to grow, they want to grow in Chicago and it's not going to work. Now, the plus for us is this. We own a lot of assets in Chicago and we can be a more significant player that in positions that been in the past. And only one move could change things in Chicago and so people have to be aware of it and not I don\u2019t read, I'm not going to mention the term but just a stroke of a pen of a partnership could shift a lot of track away from Chicago, and infrastructure thing to people think it's need for Chicago will be needed.","For example, if you look at Kansas City today. Kansas City used to be a Chicago. And we were little late in the real business and built tons of infrastructure and now you look at Kansas City and it's pretty much rail business relative to the infrastructure. So, Chicago is going to be gravy on top of this plan of what we eventually decide we're able to do with our partners and fellow owners and all the other entities that want to be part of Chicago.","So, it\u2019s real opportunity is that we're taking a special look at.","Allison Landry","Okay. And when you refer to the stroke of a pen of a partnership, is that a single partnership that you have in mind or could it be multiple?","Hunter Harrison","Look, I don\u2019t have anything in mind. I got four years contract, I want to go out and CSX with a green, with a blue and gold jersey running under the goal post, okay. If even if I want to do something after that, it's up to them. I'm only pointing out that one of the challenges that's brought to my attention, almost every time, I'd be with the big customer, is real consolidation.","And in spite of the fact that which you might hear, in proper statement, we got to LA to a customer in South and West of adding service to New York and I'll talk to you about half of it. They don\u2019t want to hear about half of it, they want to hear about all of it. And until one easy and control movement rail is never going to have the competitive alternative to the highway.","But what I'm just pointing out that for a lot of these reasons, Chicago was kind of a wild card.","Allison Landry","Okay. And then, as a follow-up question, how are you thinking about the coal network or other areas of the network that doesn't necessarily have as much density as you would like. And I know there was sort of a question earlier in this round. But ask a little bit differently, is there any opportunity to short line any of this business and are there any carriers or holding companies that you think would be a good fit?","Hunter Harrison","Now, look I think that -- I think that you give us off to and buy into, what we say we're going to do, that you don\u2019t need to think about short liners all the time. I do think that we do domestically move coal a little bit different than I'm traditionally used to, in a very disciplined close loop unit train operation that can be much more efficient. You can't move unit train coal train for three days and then park them two days and then run them for three days and then move again to very efficiently. Now if you do that there is a higher pulse associated with it with higher cost maybe comes the higher price. So what we are trying to do both with the -- is to create and encourage our super stores with us to create more disciplined approach what we can do with [indiscernible] and fewer locomotives and we can be more competitive for them and give them a constant supply of coal which is what they want and if we developed the reliability we need then it will all come together.","Allison Landry","Okay. Excellent. Thank you for the time. ","Operator","Thanks. The next question comes from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question,","Amit Mehrotra","Okay. Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. The first one is just on the operating expectations for this year. It looks like the OR target of the mid 60s implies around 800 million year-over-year on your profit improvement. It just seems by our estimate at least that only about 300 million of that will come from revenue growth and improved fixed cost absorption which leaves about call it somewhere close to half a billion dollars of absolute reduction in the cost base. So first of all is that the type of cost take out that you hunter in the team and are targeting to realize this year and just for our own, my own avocation, how does one achieve sort of half a billion dollar of cost take out without maybe driving a significant amount of disruption at least in the near term. Thank you.","Frank Lonegro","Amit, let me, it's Frank, let me take that one first and then turn it over to Hunter for additional commentary. In the targets that we gave you one of the things that we mentioned was record productivity embedded within that is obviously the prior record of $427 million in 2016 so clearly you can have your own estimate in terms of how much we will exceed that to a very good start in terms of the $123 million of efficiency. I think from just a line item perspective other than fuel you should expect us to continue to drive cost out across the board in terms of the various items there when you look at better service you look better productivity, you look at the ability to absorb volume with literally no additional cost associated with that, you get huge flow through from what your expectations are on the revenue side. So we are kicking one off cylinders here in terms of the volume side, the pricing side and the efficiency side so that's what gave us the confidence to put out the targets that we did this morning.","Michael Ward","Yes, I mean I don't want to add more example that which you want to look at odd numbers just the achieve it. Taking on some initiative to take the 1000 position, those 1000 positions were a lot of more voluntary and there was store room that is what we are all position that has not touch any of the [inaudible] we are going to utilize the people internally we have, we are very sensitive to your comment about the disruption and the moral and we have at [inaudible] but it is a little higher when normal and so I think if you had the [inaudible] member on it and I haven\u2019t got into that kind of level yet but I think the potential is there that sometime around the first half of the year by the end of, there would be probably be a similar number taken out also now we didn\u2019t take any of those to take some real cost without impacting the service or safety or anything else. These are just a different ways to doing things.","We are bringing some job own. We have, I don\u2019t know all of that, 250 or 300 boys in India, we are reviewing those jobs back here but [inaudible] also some job but I am really [inaudible] worried about India right now I am worried about CSX [inaudible] America, so there is a lot of opportunity and I don\u2019t think that there was a breach as far as we do the job and we have the ability to do that we can achieve all these things that we dealt that.","Frank Lonegro","Okay, one other point on the folks in India, there are contractors not employees but obviously we're going to in source that work and really look to absorb that with the existing workforce. I know Cindy also had some points, she wanted to make here.","Cindy Sanborn","I just put it in a couple of broad categories as I think about it. [inaudible] mentioned the reduction in the management that took place last month, I think as you think about [inaudible] conversions and so forth those types of actions I would call core operations and we expect to do more of that. Volume absorption, we are seeing our outlook with a higher level of volume for us to move and we think we can absorb that of more efficiently than putting resources back one for one and then I would also say, some of the, looking back and some of the improvements that we have made other railroads [inaudible] I would call it network efficiency cars online velocity [inaudible] those types of things, we think will see improvement improvements there. So I would call that just network efficiencies going forward. And when you put all that together that's what's given us our confidence to move forward with that with another record here.","Amit Mehrotra","Right. Well thanks for all that. Let me just ask one follow up if I could. Frank, on your comments about productivity, maybe I'm thinking about incorrectly but I feel like productivity is different than absolute reduction in the cost structure? Because productivity is in my view the way I understand it you're optimizing the cost structure to maximize the incremental, may be minimized to detrimental but it doesn't necessarily mean the cost structure is declining. So you guys achieved 72% incremental operating margin in the quarter which is unbelievably great. Is there a way to understand or help us in terms of what was that was actually fix cost absorption? What was that actually absolute reduction the cost structure?","Frank Lonegro","So, when we think about productivity and how, I would say keep score internally, we do look for structural cost reductions. So a big part of that record productivity, structural cost reductions meaning each line item in the expenses is going to get lower again I'm excluding fuel just given the price environment that we're in but we are focused on fuel efficiency as well. I think there as you can see from an incremental margin perspective, we're also a very good start with about 72% incremental for the first quarter when you understand what we're trying to do on the cost side and you will understand what the volume outlook looks like I would estimate that the incremental margins were actually improve throughout the year which is going to give you the bottom line to flow through the revenue that we are bringing up.","Amit Mehrotra","That's great. Hunter, one last one for me if I could. Can you just comment on your relationship with the union so far? You have the company has over 20,000 union employees, can you just talk about those initial meetings and conversations and just in the context of all the operational changes to come? That\u2019s it for me. Thank you.","Hunter Harrison","Well, I hope it's pretty good. I've worked most of my career. The first four years alongside of the various roles that now make up the effects and those some of the leadership I've had some, I mean terrible what I say here, I had some bad things conversations, exploring new opportunities with those individuals. It's not real common for a new CEO to get me in and I don't care what your name is in the labor leaders to be bringing in a [inaudible] that just now, [inaudible] but at the same time I [inaudible] to be approached unofficially at least, the conversations about potentially there was something like an hourly agreements that has been extended in some part of the US system and now the Canadian national that we developed.","It is very encouraging to say that, even that there are dialogue like that and one of the things that, the beauty of that would be, a couple of things that the people should think that one: those agreements guarantee people position that\u2019s important today people they certainly have job and they have the job guarantee and that\u2019s very important in people and at the same time for us it lowers our, potentially our cost, 30% to 35%.","So we're going to have some squabbles. They don't like to see their people disrupted nor do I but you got to do which you got to do some time. And so there'll be some, I'm sure there'll be some, comment but all I care about is the bottom line and profit and I hope that in turn we're very sensitive to the employees in the part they play in this.","So I think we'll do fine with it.","Amit Mehrotra","Okay. Thank you for answering my questions, I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ravi Shankar with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Ravi Shankar","Thanks. Good morning everyone. Hunter, just to summarize tie-up everything you said in the call so far in terms of playbook the precision railroading playbook that you've so effectively deployed several times before at other railroads, do you think that's kind of directly applicable to CSX here or do you think the complexity of the network here involves changes to the way that it's been under before and also CSX has in recent years had a playbook of deemphasizing coal and becoming more of an intermodal rail. Do you agree with that and do you think that kind of becomes part of your playbook as well.","Hunter Harrison","Well, the question was, yes it was. I think, is the more complexity there in the network the better model you can apply to it, you can get more advantages or opportunity but if you just got a linear street line railroad because there would be lot of people can do that into the model to that. So this has certainly, those implications. Now, strategically going down there in the line as to far as, look I think, if you look at three years out of five years, out of ten years that we need to understand that the world is going to continue to change though and we need to be flexible and to have a plan that allows us to change with those changes, okay. And we got things going on as we speak from energy standpoint, what is the future of fossil fuel, what is the future of crude, how much influence of the environment is going to have? What is the next we are going to do with the railroad, you go ahead inject rail, you drive manage huge warehouse of Amazon and so the supply chain is going to change and we have to be, going to be some of the game that are traditional [inaudible] we have to be more flexible and more creative to be able to deal with those changes in the world.","Frank Lonegro","I mean we have to emphasized call CSX, the coal has been the emphasize by the utility and so we want as much business as we can what is called, but we will deploy our strategy where we can capture the growth and create the bottom line value for CSX through excellent service to our customers.","Ravi Shankar","Got it and your vision of your intermodal, is this largely, I think you spoke about service initiatives a little earlier on the call, but it is largely a case of improving the service levels and gain to a point where it become super-competitive versus struck or are you looking for more demand improvement from macro or kind of being able to take price and segments. So between service and demand and price kind of which do you think is the most important level for intermodal? ","Hunter Harrison","I don\u2019t know that, the market would have you believe, to begin with, we are not going to sit here and let our precious service the kind of commodity and so that there we create in service and I would [inaudible] at this we are just in time an intermodal get real hot, if you look back and do a little history, you will see that prior I am in, it was not going to our 20% [inaudible] you let interest rate and they are going back up after, I just can\u2019t tell you when they do people do move merchandize will be rewarded because caring are going to go up. The beauty is this the quicker we move it, the cheaper it is and so it goes on itself and so we turn the equipment quicker, we give better service to the customer and we got the lower cost and then we can may more convincing and it all fits in this model.","Ravi Shankar","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.","Ken Hoexter","Good morning. Hunter, you sound well I look forward to your tenure at CSX. If you noted you're going to be an advocate for customers in your intro remarks. Is that a change in how you're going to attack the plan? I mean after you've left obviously we heard keep talk about fixing ruffled feathers and a customer focus. So now it sounds like you start this with a little bit of a different tact. Maybe you can just talk about that a bit.","Hunter Harrison","I have in my whole career in fact one of the reasons why I'm sitting here was I have to be an operating guys that [inaudible] okay. I have got a little reputation [inaudible] people look at your bill and that wouldn't they do on the ground, but look there's no one more sensitive than I am and more [inaudible] than I am of the business that our customers yield, okay. I am the greatest advocate in the world which you could sit in some of our meetings when we talk about service and we talk about [inaudible] because that\u2019s not just about creating pain and suffering for our customers which I don\u2019t want to see creating.","One example of a customer turn over a period just when we are going to do a transition that sense any problem or issue from it didn\u2019t exist, okay. So I am going to do a little coaching couple of mine and actually anticipate had a response.","Ken Hoexter","Let me just read it, something you talked about on the union because the US has changed like historically have been a little bit different right in terms of all the rails coming to negotiating in one team against kind of the all the unions in one group. You always had things may be a little bit differently in Canada, can you, is that something you think you need to shift how you would address that as you move forward?","Hunter Harrison","Well, I think, if you look back, the parts when I was parts of the U.S. operation, we were not part of handling. So negotiated our labor agreement and then we can do that now we are going to have some dialog it appears to me and I have had a chance to some of my colleague about it but it appears to me that some of the big -- if you will or seven or they start to see the world differently than if they start to see the world differently and then on one page and that's makes a lot of sense to have this one big care conference negotiated for us. I would much prefer I think us to sit down with our employees and do what's the best for the organization and employee. So I think that all those things that deal with policies and all we will take a look at it and see how they see the world and how we see going forward and what's the most appropriate action.","Operator","Thanks. Your next questions comes from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. You may ask your question.","Brandon Oglenski","Yes good morning and thanks for taking my question and Hunter definitely welcome back and I know there is a lot of investors excited to see you back in the field.","So surprisingly though it just keeps coming back we hear it a lot that length of farm, and the short length of farm from the east coast just means that the return on invested capital or the margin potential is not as high as railroads or some of the stuff going out, out west in the US can you just talk to that dynamic and whether or not you think length of plays a lot of determination in the ultimate profitability of the network.","Hunter Harrison","Well [indiscernible] the markets of the market. We don't get a chance to make the market. I know this the more productive we are the better we are at cost controlling that cut inflation -- controlling cost okay will put us in the position that says people used to say -- 800 miles plus you could make -- well that's not true. If you are operating -- 90s it's true. The operating ratio is 58 it's wrong. So it's I don't really, necessarily while on the short it's the bottom-line margin that we can make out the business and what I don't think we set the price out there. The market sets the price which we want to play or not. And we keep ourselves competitive with the market both with long and short term.","Brandon Oglenski","And if I could, kind of also that question maybe what Ken was asking well there is some fear that as you go through these operations changes and focus more on service that maybe some of your customers are disruptive from the way business is done in the past is there potential here that you see some share shift as you go through this transition period or do you think as service improve you could actually improve top line at the same time.","Hunter Harrison","Yes. That's the story. That's why you provide good service. It starts with your product but you don't have the product you don't have anything. So we start with the product and the better we make that product the more we can extract in value added both in market share and whatever the revenue. So this is not one set of the game. It's the revenue up and cost down and investor get rewarded and it's fun. Okay.","Brandon Oglenski","We look forward to Hunter. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question.","Scott Group","Hey thanks. Good morning everyone.","So maybe Fredrik can you isolate the strength and export pricing from the mix benefit of losing the short haul business and understand what bigger impact in the quarter and can you just kind of confirm it if the guidance for the year assumes kind of export pricing stays where it is or that it does come down in the back half of the year and then bigger picture on call maybe for you Hunter, we can see this quarter how profitable the coal franchise is if we kind of assume that coal resumes at secured in the next couple of years do you think that maybe could impact the ability to get to us sub 60 OR in a couple of years?","Fredrik Eliasson","So let me take your first part of your question first. I would say that the majority of the [indiscernible] change was stable mix, with favorable mix on one hand that some of that short haul traffic obviously went away which was short in marginal but also we saw a more replenishment of utilities in the south versus last year where if you recall not for gas prices were tremendously low for design and then also on the export side we saw additional traffic going into the Virginia which is generally little bit of a export there that is longer length of haul so we had a couple of things that was favorable from a mix perspective that certainly helped so that was the majority of the driver that we saw. And then turning to question about the coal franchise to Hunter.","Hunter Harrison","My numbers, my analysis as a short timer don't include some big goal, if coal comes back stronger than anticipated it's very \u2013 will it change any of these numbers, I don't think so. If you look at the last story we get the same thing -- and you will get to the numbers well I think that group has done an excellent job and they continue to do it I think they bound through 60 it through with their life 58 so no I don't think that I have set longer term almost \u2013 western Canada that I can't retract it. I just take longer term coal is not something that rails should depend on. Now it can take a while to transition out it's not going to happen overnight and we might see another 10-15 years but longer term I don't think that fuel I mean coal is going to be the energy source of the future.","Scott Group","Okay and just the part about coal pricing assumed in the guidance in the back half.","Hunter Harrison","Well overall, side that we follow in this index after the variety of them and as you can see in the forward curve currently that is coming down as we move through second half of the year and that certainly then our expectations as well but we will ultimately see where the market ends up.","Scott Group","Okay. Thanks and then Hunter since this is your first call, there is couple of things that I want to address. There is some people that presume that ultimately M&A is part of the strategy and maybe you can talk about that and then also in some of your past, you have brought some people on in terms of the team should we be expecting something similar here?","Hunter Harrison","Well look I don't know what I can say but I would emphasize, okay M&A has nothing to do with this strategy here at all okay. And one thing I take very proud and the integrity okay I am telling you there is no such plan. Even I don't have hands I have got four years it's not going to happen in 10 years [indiscernible] is a lot to play with the hand and bill okay and we got a good hand here. Now do we have a couple of midst, maybe but we are looking internally in fact that was last night talking about some people.","I am not sure that we have \u2013 that we have taken advantage of all the internal talents that we have here. But if we hint avoid that we have that we need then we can \u2013 we always have the ability to go externally. If there anybody wants to get the work force the list is long and we don't have any restrictions about who can leave and can't go here, they can't go there. We are okay, work here they can leave. Okay. In fact if they want to go some other railroad let them go. But we have got we will not have a short of talent and resources to be on the railroad that we described.","Scott Group","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Jeff Kauffman with Aegis Capital. Your line is open. Go ahead and ask your question.","Jeff Kauffman","Thank you very much. Welcome back, good to have you back on. My questions have been asked six ways to Sunday how CCX differs from some other rails you have been at but what I would like to know is at CP there needed to be a capital investment and sighting and some other portions of the rail to achieve the things you wanted to achieve. CN it was different investment can you talk a little bit not so much about multiple yards because we have been built through acquisition but talk about the capital plan at CCX and is there investment that needs to occur for what you need to do and kind of how we think about that strategically.","Michael Ward","Well. Overall just to look at it without starting to break it down, I think it's clear to me that the capital investment will come down overtime. It has been a good deal since the last few years about -- if you take a look at just what's been spent the last few years on locomotives you would say we are not going to have to do that for a while if we get 550-600 locomotives stored and I can know one of our previous experiences there that we count as numbers and we said well maybe we can take couple of year holiday for locomotives and we did and I think fifth year holiday. So well, we don't have to spend anything on locomotives generally for four, five years clearly a lot of the replacements that were issued with the yards are not there clearly if we have sighting that are too short for the longer train we are certainly not going to leave those sit on the ground and not being utilized so we will pick up 165 [indiscernible] railroad included with the another 6500 and that will we got 13000 and the only thing we capitalized is in the labor we don't have to capitalize the rail and so there is some ways save capital and another issue of overlook is this the better productivity you have with capital the more you can put in. the higher productive you are good in lower with 100 miles main productive stuff is the productivity factor -- but I think my numbers were that over three or four year period we can see 500-600 million reduction in the capital spend and then there are points where you will potentially trend back up and if we don't have something else like coming along to help with our capital spend and I am not big of some percent of revenue we should work that that way and out whatever is the revenue is but I think overall to answer your question there will be some positive for free cash flow out of the reduction in capital.","Jeff Kauffman","Okay. Well Hunter thank you for your answer and best of luck to you all at CCX. Thank you.","Michael Ward","Thanks Jeff. ","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from David Vernon with Bernstein. You may ask your question. ","David Vernon","Hey good morning. Hunter maybe just a quick question for you on the presence of the share asset areas the old legacy of acquisition is that sort of joint operations in some of the bigger eastern metros create any challenges or opportunities for you when you think about railroad model into the CFX?","Michael Ward","Well I don't have to, I have not spent in my first company days a lot of time in that area and I'm limited on my knowledge there and I don\u2019t want to try to mess you with the stories that I've heard a lot of best of. Cindy, you got any comments there?","Cindy Sanborn","Yes David, I think we are always looking for efficiencies where we hand off car whether to the joint facility and then this car rail or IHP in Chicago and there's nothing that really jumps off the page but as we've said many, many times everything's on the table and if we can find opportunities, we will certainly take advantage of them.","David Vernon","But do you think there are any sort of constraints because you're tied to a schedule that maybe the Conrail serving for, that means both your and the Norfolk needs and it's harder to change or is that something that's probably not an issue?","Cindy Sanborn","That's really not an issue. It's in all of our best interest to serve our customer better and they just simply supply the last mile service and do a very good job of it and we work very closely together on making sure that the efficient and effective for customers.","David Vernon","Okay. And Fredrik, may be just as a quick follow-up, when you look at same store sales pricing, I hear your comments on mix in coal and I think what I've heard is where we should expect that to continue to happen but I think in the intermodal merchandise the deceleration in the core price, is that something that we should also expect to kind of happen here or we starting to see some signs of improvement in that domestic intermodal market that would help kind of assure that number?","Fredrik Eliasson","Well, this is just to clarify also and I am not sure that will really go to a question. The mix was obviously out of the same store sale number, which is why we are doing it. In fact, once again we don't forecast price but I think it's clear that we've been in a place over the last few years where there's been a fair amount of exits capacity in the marketplace and all our customers as Hunter alluded before have alternatives, so we have got a price-to-market.","The key thing is, is I look forward now between what I think you guys write a lot about which is that there's a structural change coming and closing an attractable market with some of the ELD limitations and the shortage of drivers and hopefully getting to better placement and capacity perspective. And coupled that, what we're doing with this operating model where I already see a significantly improved service. I think there's an opportunity as we move into '18 to really capitalize on that.","So we feel good about where we are, we've priced the market each and every day and as we move forward we will do the same.","David Vernon","But many as everything I worry are right now are we starting to see things kind of improve sequentially or we're still kind of in a soft patch on the domestic market?","Fredrik Eliasson","I see some opportunities on the stock market side I follow closely where things seems to be moving in the right direction. I do think that obviously if you see some of the -- and you thought this more than I do on the trucking side as there has been some challenges out there but I see that the light is coming close at the end of the tunnel and supply and demand should be getting to a better place as we move through the second half of the year end and take thing.","David Vernon","All right. Thanks very much for the time, guys.","Fredrik Eliasson","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna Financial Group. Your line is open. You may ask your question.","Bascome Majors","Yes. Thanks for fitting me in here. Just real quickly on the attrition rate, can you guys help quantify that for us whether in percentage terms or the number of people per year?","Hunter Harrison","I think they were working on some numbers for me and let me clarify something that I'm trying to, we all have kind of dramatically a different type of explanations for, I'm talking about contractors, consultants, employees, all of the above everybody to get the cheque. Okay, I think that I'll correct this if I'm wrong, that the attrition is going to come in at that 9% level range, 8.5% to 9%. And so, if you look at those numbers as opposed to where we are, you use some kind of order or magnitude of what we get absorb without adversely affecting people.","Bascome Majors","Yes. Thank you for that and Hunter as we take a step back, if you look recently at least, management canters have been based in the short term on operating income in the longer term on a mix of ROA. And as you in the reconstituted board looked at the outcomes you want to drive over the next four years, is there a change to that coming? How do you want to incentivize this in your management team to accomplish what you want to accomplish?","Hunter Harrison","Well yes, I think that quarterly, look, I am not obsessed for example with the operating ratio. The more I try to get away from it the more people push me back in the middle of it. I mean clearly there's some, there are issues that are return on your name it, capital equity that whatever there are more material ways over a longer timeframe to look. The problem gets to be as we're incorporated into your yearly, daily operation and make the conversion because there is a lag period that you go through.","I think a lot of businesses and I think we are a little bit that we have to address is this, we've got our compensation system so complex the employees won\u2019t understand it, I mean you have gone too far but I think that's something that the board talked about this week it happens facing committee discussed it and I think it's something that we want to be sure that we are motivating the right behavior with the employees of return effectively on caption.","One of the rules of this model is this, they'll spend $1 in precious capital and so your growth been explore every operating alternative. And so, I think there's going to be a push that way more and more for return numbers than rather than just roll margins on operating ratio.","Bascome Majors","Into that point, I'm sorry?","Fredrik Eliasson","But once I get, on the you have talked about the long term being ROA. ROAs half of it and operating ratio has got the other half of it. I just want to make sure you knew both of it.","Bascome Majors","Appreciate it. Is there a possibility for a free cash flow component, is that something you guys are considering?","Hunter Harrison","Yes, free cash flow works. I mean, in all of the above, it\u2019s how you weigh those factors, and if you do you do those things in a material manner. Everyone has got some downside too. You focus this year on free cash flow and you make some inventory decision to make some artificial goal which deals you next year. So, it really takes a material approach from management and sometimes that\u2019s hard to put together.","Frank Lonegro","And certainly a focus on cash is important as you saw in the quarterly financial report we put out last night and the guidance we put out and we're certainly being transparent in terms of free cash flow and how we are calculating it and what the goals are for the year. So that's a new thing for us.","Bascome Majors","Hunter and Frank, thank you for the color here.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Seidl with Cowen & Company. You may ask your question.","Jason Seidl","Thank you operator. Hunter welcome back. Everyone else hello. Couple of quick things Hunter, looking at intermodal clearly it's an opportunity in the East. In your eyes, what's the most important piece of intermodal and how to get it more profitable for the railroad?","Hunter Harrison","Well I mean clearly, it's pretty simple formula. Cindy talked about this morning and the longer the train, but here the train, the lower the cost the better we can be in the terminal. And the service factor, that\u2019s how you get to do. Get personal, get the toiler, get the container get it on the train, get it to its destination and get it on the ground and have it available for the customer. And it\u2019s not so much, if you do the job right and this organization has done a pretty good job there. I mean I look at some of our numbers that I am learning and with our domestic business we are like up in the mid or higher 90s which is pretty admirable with pretty demanding customer as they should be demanding.","Like UPS, I mean UPS, just all I want you to do is right what we say intermodal if they were to stay under it. You say you are going to be here third morning, x\/x, be here. And if you do that, okay, it's not sometimes we make these things too complex and you simply get it to move it, do what you say you are going to do it and be efficient with. Are we looking at some time saving that we can do little bit here and little bit there continually but I think we are going to do fine there, we are going to get even better there but and then we'll at the same time take advantage of this merchandize network.","Jason Seidl","And Hunter, is the offering is big it needs to be? Does any investment beyond the typical investment that goes and it needs to be made at intermodal?","Hunter Harrison","Well I mean Fredrik and probably and Frank can speak to that better than I can. I know that, look I know this company is going to be in a much better position from a base stand point that if we see the opportunity we are ready to make whatever investments we need to take advantages of opportunities in the market out there.","Frank Lonegro","Yes and we talked about it before over the time. In terms of the network itself, we're 95% double stack clear which is a critical as opposed to driving efficiencies. We are opening one new customer in a live space that we felt was needed which is in Pittsburgh in July and we are looking at longer term terminals that we announced in Carolina the CSX terminal we talked about and we are also to Hunter\u2019s point earlier trying to see where their opportunities to leverage existing facilities and have perhaps combined things to create value that way. So, Hunter have been a great supporter in the franchise in what we are trying to do. And the essence of precision railroading is about running a scheduled network at a high level reliability and that is what we have been doing and we are going to do it more so going forward.","Jason Seidl","All right. I've look at my follow-up. Hunter, let me hear your opinions on CSX the rest of the rail industry pushing towards one-man crews and when do you see that as a viable option?","Hunter Harrison","I am not a one-man crew advocate. Now, there are special circumstances, there are different issues, I mean clearly if you're switching a race track or you're switching a mine track with one track or something, there's applications that we have today for one person. But today to take a 20,000 ton train on line of road with one person, I don't think it\u2019s good business. Then why I don\u2019t think that and shame on us that we don't have in my view the quality control to do it.","So you have got one person on the train and you have a air hose failure or a drill bar or whatever, as the one person going to deal with the delays of the customers the domino effect and all that and then in some of that go hearts, tell me well, we're going to have people in trucks along the ride away with all these materialism and now they'll be dispatched to the train to help the engineer, the one-man crew and as said well it's not one and then it's one point whatever piece, particularly the day with where rail is relative to take the issues and the whole issue commentary obligation.","I just don't think that it's something that we're focusing on. If you look at the payload, and people will shudder what I say this, when my peers with labor leaders if you look at the cost of the other person on that train that's has gotten rid of the payload of X, it's relatively drop in the bucket that the value of that person can bring as an additional eyes and ears and you came watch both sides of the train. And just, we've got a lot of things in the ABCs that we need to get better it before we start talking about one-man crew, then I guess before we total with that, we'll have -- we run the electric train with nobody up there with somebody with a reason is somewhere around it.","I don\u2019t know having go and get the demand but I had figured out more, so.","Jason Seidl","All this and I appreciate the thoughts as always. Thank you for your time.","Hunter Harrison","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Hartford with Baird. You may ask your question.","Ben Hartford","Thanks for fitting me in. Hunter, I am just curious about your, we've talked a lot about intermodal on the call but curious about your go-to-market perspective on that the focus has been on the operational side and improving service and efficiency for the customers but if you think about being innovative and creative and flexible as you see CSX's IMC partnerships, do you see opportunities to expand into new partnerships with new IMCs or even kind of even kind of go more direct to market on the intermodal side as you think about a marketing strategy. Do you have any perspective on that? Thanks.","Hunter Harrison","Under certain circumstances I think all work. I think there is a lot of things that we can do intermodaly that for whatever reason they may try before and it's then got away from it, but am a big as it could have be as repricing. One of the things that you have to do in our model which you'll hear a lot about is balance. And when you look at the graph, the intermodal for instance and it's kind of survive more lend and it keeps showing very denied and then it sync down on Sunday, it's just money that's being wasted.","And I tried one experiment. When you hear, you listen to the market and you listen and you hear service, service. And so, we say, well we haven\u2019t run three trains on Friday night, so maybe we can discount on Saturday and Sunday to move some of that business from Friday to Saturday and Sunday. And so, we discounted 15% and 20%. Just how many people came Friday? Nobody. Everybody went Saturday and Sunday. So, you start to find out what the real market is out there.","So, there is a lot of creative things I can see today, that we are going to have dispatch or sitting there at two o'clock in afternoon selling the slots. Then I get eight slots left that are going to be opened in less and they are going to discount. I see that my personal view is we will see a day where there won't be full contracts as such as we think about. They will be half but there will be shorter even in late and so I think there is a lot of things to do the way we compensate sales people, for example. And lot of things that rail can do that we can't, I mean, will stuck in the mud with that we can be much more creative to supplement this standard and low product.","Ben Hartford","Thanks for that, best of luck.","Hunter Harrison","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Your line is open, you may ask your question.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Thanks very much and congratulations on a strong part of the year. Fredrik, I wonder if you could talk about after margin how you feel that the volume with for 2017 versus how you felt that the time at Q4 call and just what influence that had and the team confidence in providing 2017 guidance this morning.","Fredrik Eliasson","Sure. I would say that coming out of the I guess election, I am not sure it has anything to do with it but at the end of the year we did see little bit of up take in our volume and our projections through the year. I'm not sure that it's transferred into the macro numbers at this point but we did see a little bit more volume and perhaps who anticipated at the beginning of the year. We obviously also saw a coal market on the export side that improved beyond what we had anticipated originally even though we still expect it to taper off as we moved through the year.","So, I would say that there is probably a slight increase in topline projection but it really isn't the foundation for what we did here in terms of the guidance that incremental change. It is the item that what we have done here over the last quarter or so to put ourselves in the position coupled with Hunter's arrival here and his operating model that has allowed us to do this.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Okay. So, it's more the operational side then.","Hunter Harrison","Which Cherilyn, gives the flow through obviously to the bottom line.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Right. And then just a quick one on CapEx, you have adjusted down by about 5% for 2017, can you just talk about what you've already found room to trim there?","Frank Lonegro","Sure, so you are right. We started out the year with about 1.97 billion in core capital meeting before you get the positive train control. We trimmed little over a 100 million from that number as we gave you the free cash flow numbers for the year. What we really did was we looked at all of the network investments and then to pause some of those given the fact that we are making terminal changes operating plan changes we have higher expectations for service products and so we really got to give that sometime to sync in before we decide exactly where we want to deploy some of that network capital.","And then, on some of the return seeking projects to the point Hunter made earlier, we really looked at ways that we can get there through better process, better execution of that process and better accountability etcetera. So, we found some opportunity on both of those category.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Thank you, that's all from me.","Operator","Thank you. And next question comes from Walter Spracklin with RBC. You may ask your question.","Walter Spracklin","Yes, thanks very much and welcome back Hunter.","Hunter Harrison","Hi, Walt.","Walter Spracklin","My question is on the free cash flow and how that's going to go into your buyback program leverage. I know you announced $1 billion new program here but I know how you've always liked your buyback. Leverage doesn't seem to be an issue at all and if I don't know if you huddled with Frank here little bit and talked about longer term where you want to see your leverage ratio go to and as a result and with the free cash flow you are going to generate from your initiatives. Could we see a much more expanded buyback in the billion dollar announcement here this morning?","Hunter Harrison","Well Frank spent a lot of time this week with the board and the finance committee and I have believe it or not got the back up from that discussion and be a little more operating focused and let me let Frank help you there.","Frank Lonegro","Yes, we had a great discussion this week and obviously you have heard us reiterate the BBB+\/Baa1. Today you saw the size of the program for the next 12 months obviously as we get more and more monthly quarters under our belt and we get an understanding of the free cash flow numbers both for coming quarters and coming years. We'll take a hard look at whether or not we are deploying the capital in the correct way to shareholders in the correct amounts and we always look at the balance sheet and try to determine what the appropriate place is given really the cyclicality of the business on the merchandise and intermodal side as well as the capital intent for the business and making sure we preserve the access to the marketplace that we need in tougher time.","So, we want to stress test the numbers that we have internally to make sure if there is in fact a holding line or any can see decline that we can stomach that. So, we think we are on pretty good shape with good numbers up for you in the quarter and the forward guidance as well as the buyback and the dividends. So, right now we feel like in pretty shape.","Hunter Harrison","Yes. Also, I don't think our policy going to be different than what we you have been familiar with, okay. If you look at allocation basal, the first call is going to be always reinvestment in this railroad and hopefully we got opportunities to make the appropriate returns there. If those don\u2019t present their self, then we're going to look at other ways the most efficient ways as Frank described to return that case to the owner, whether it's through buyback, dividend, combinations thereof, will always be a little debated about what your structure is and what kind of fund you are managing and which customers want which.","But I think we, I think the board yesterday had our both for two days estimating these and the board meeting, that a third discussion of our policies there and there was a great deal of common understanding in directionally which way we need to go.","Walter Spracklin","Okay. This is the second question here is on the competitive response to your initiatives both from a service standpoint but also from a operating standpoint as you get lower cost, your ability to more efficiently and higher profitability services for customers. And I am just interested in what the competitive response might be that might cause problems for you Hunter, in terms of what you're trying to achieve.","I know you've always had a great view on pricing, the pricing is what the market dictates but often we hear when market share shifts, they want it on price. So, is there a risk that a competitive response might come in and may put problems on how you can effect change or make them a little longer to achieve at the end of the day? Do you have any views on that?","Hunter Harrison","Yes. Then they ought to be careful. If that's the response, look, as I think it's just pretty simple response. As long as we provide the service we talk about today and we become and we are going to get there the low cost carrier, okay, we got to worry about to tell you. I don't know what they are going to do in the way of response that is smart, is they can do that first. After competitors doing things stupid, that's good.","And sometimes it's short term pain but I don't think that I'd see anything out there but this they are going to have some different response than they've had six months ago than what they are going to have in the future that's going to set this organization back. We get an agenda, we have got a wonderful customer base, we are going to see some organic growth. I'm convinced we're going to see some market share growth. I got to be a little patient there but this is going to come together. And I don't think a lot of what takes places is going to be negatively impacted by the competition.","Walter Spracklin","Is there, there is a view out there that it can be emulated that some of your initiatives can just be copied and the efficiency you achieve can be followed by your competitors or anything you'd respond to that with regards to what you're doing and a unique way you are doing it that will make it more difficult for the competition to copy you?","Hunter Harrison","Couple of that would. It's on eBay for a $1000, I mean, it's the market, if not then we can't get it recopy that some of the competition used to work for all of those to get copy rights business. It's not secret, okay. It's one thing to write its play book, okay. A lot of companies keep sitting down and give you yes and no, okay. The key is you got to have players that can execute. You don\u2019t have to play, you're going to execute. You steal every play but you all.","So, I hope they do copy but if they copy us, I think they might be more efficient and I'll look at other rails generally speaking much more is our partners is our near competitor. Of course, we had so much airline business too here. So, we have that. The secrets in this, I miss them.","Walter Spracklin","Fair enough, thanks very much.","Hunter Harrison","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. You may ask your question.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks, good morning. Hunter, I was curious, just your comment taking two to three days out of the Chicago Jacksonville route, I'm curious what type of time it would take to do such a thing and is that unique because the Chicago should we expect that more broadly then?","Hunter Harrison","Well, that's I think you expect it broadly. If you look at the overall velocity, I mean, I just used Chicago for an example and how quick can you see it, you can see it overnight. I mean, we are starting to reach schedules at railroad, I know that the main company has gotten especially Florida pretty well reworked and done and that\u2019s been I've been doing some looking, work for towards and on. And so, we're going to kind of go up the line, we will have what you have been used to before with every guy have its own trip plan.","One plan, they only get re-tripped and re-tripped, you got one plan, we got to tell the customers going to be 83 hours door-to-door and we're going to do it. And one of the ways to do it is this. Look, I -- we've get a lot of good things going, we got some things, we got to say. Our train speed is not right out of it, our merchandise train speeds between terminals is like 18 miles an hour.","We got the potential to be at 27, 28, and you start taking numbers like that and then you avoid terminals and rather than drive into a terminal and dwell for 26 hours you can drive by that one and skip that 26 and pick up a little here and you do the math and don\u2019t take long, you get to Florida two or three days quicker depending on where at large you are going. That's just an order of magnitude that impact both service and cost and asset turns and all of the stuff is good.","Scott Schneeberger","Great, thanks. And then just some of the -- with regards to this year's operating ratio guidance, what is the one big bucket item that you think could where you could outperform and then maybe a bucket item where you are most nervous where you may underperform? Thanks.","Hunter Harrison","That's how way late wake at night worry about that in that regard. If something happens that I'm not aware of or there is some geopolitical or something happens in Washington or something like that but I mean this is a pretty simple formula of there something that most of us have been in our whole life and they'll have to do this railroad, and that's how we got to do to get these things accomplished. Now, I mean obviously look, people, when you take a 1000 people as an organization, that's a bit hit.","It's a big saving right there. That's a lot of it, but the other thing that you look at, the rail cars, the train starts, the start and the yard starts with the closest to the hub. All those things, those are natural that kind of about working capital will be then go -- we weren\u2019t going to be with the best part for some of these entirely. Retires, and these old up gear, they don\u2019t like them anymore. So, we have moved a lot of profit there but this is going to happen.","Scott Schneeberger","Great, thanks.","Operator","Thanks. Your next question comes from Duran Marabala with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, you may ask your question.","Duran Marabala","Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Hunter, I guess just one question from me on the revenue side. I am wondering, is there any sort of revenue that you see on the book of business that maybe doesn't meet the return thresholds and maybe needs to be demarcated. I know some of that did happen with CP sort of early on in the process there. Thank you.","Hunter Harrison","No. Look, there is some odds and ends that just pops every once a while with the individual move or something. Everybody goes through a little bit of that, but generally speaking I mean for instance then maybe they're here to point those kind of things out and obviously if they were there and I was coming, you might have been motivated to get them out of there. You have to and so no we are not going to demark and we're looking at marking.","Duran Marabala","Thank you, that's helpful.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Justin Long with Stephens. You may ask your question.","Justin Long","Thanks and good morning. I know it's still early but I was wondering if you could talk about any structural changes to the network that we could see this year as it relates to divestitures of non-core assets and when thinking about that mid-60s OR guidance for 2017, does that include the impact of any real-estate gains?","Hunter Harrison","The second part, no we don't include any real-estate gain. The real-estate gain is it where they are and that's been discussed internally, are all gravy but I can tell you that the experience in the past, there are lots of opportunity up there, even now in Chicago. And it's a big number in my book and it's something that we will be sensitive to and talk to about. It's not going to drive the business but it certainly going to be in the bucket and the blender when we make certain operating decisions about where we operate from and locate and let me make sure I understood the first part of the question.","Justin Long","Just asking about the potential for divestitures at some points in this year, maybe some short line assets that you would view as being non-core to the franchise?","Hunter Harrison","There is not anything. Look, there is a lot of initiatives going on here that I am sure that I am not even aware of yet that but to my knowledge there is nothing of any large metrics that we are looking at what we\u2019ve been both the knowledge just getting better what we do with the franchise that we have.","Justin Long","Okay. And secondly, Hunter you made the comment earlier that this franchise has more potential than any other you've dealt with. With that in mind do you think there is a path for this business to have industry leading margins or do you think there are structural limitations getting to an OR level that we've recently seen from the Canadian route.","Hunter Harrison","No, I think you can have the industry leading margins, I think you will have. The only issue there in massive world is if I can get all that done before I have to go, I'd like to be here to cut the ribbon, that's kind of big deal it's just a little personal goal but there is no reason that structurally certain I know knowing that this railroad it can now become the greatest road in north America. If it's greatest in North America, it's probably greatest in the world.","And let me just [indiscernible] people look at this. I went to Canada the first time as an American and meant not fun to begin with, but I got there and seeing it just can do with great restructuring coming out of that deal and it's impressive numbers but the one thing they did is a problem, do not expect the Canadian railroad to ever achieve numbers like the US rail, it's just not structurally possible until our operating ratio went to the leading operating ratio in North America.","And then just what the US roads did. The US roads did, look we're going to improve but don't think we are ever going to reach the level of the Canadian road, it's just not structurally possible. So, it's got something new with what you're paid for exists and where do you reside, but it's the same vein, that whole board up here does mean that much.","Justin Long","Okay, great. I appreciate the time and we are all looking forward to watching this play out.","Hunter Harrison","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research Partners. You may ask your question.","Brian Konigsberg","Hey, good morning. Thanks for bidding me in and welcome Hunter. And just almost all my questions have been answered. I think an award is deserved for many of the analysts still coming up with stuff this late into the call. But I guess just the one thing just for the model sake, obviously Hunter you've got an employment contract that has been stamped and we're still waiting for the result of the shareholder meeting. We'll expect that to go through most likely.","So, how should we be baking in kind of the share grants and additional payment set have been agreed upon so far throughout this year in cash flows and into these share baseline?","Hunter Harrison","Yes. I'm not sure that it's appropriate for me to address that, let me let Frank address that.","Frank Lonegro","So, in terms of the share based compensation, obviously we book expense on that one onto the Black-Scholes model and we've done that in terms of the guidance that we've given you. In terms of the shareholder vote, obviously you heard David's opening remarks and we're not going to touch on that one. But the free cash flow number that we gave you for the year is excluding the existing restructuring charges and any subsequent restructuring charges that might happen in the second quarter.","Brian Konigsberg","And so just presumably the share count could does not reflect any grants at this point but that can certainly change at their shareholder meeting. Is that -- I am just saying the share grants, I presume it's not in the numbers now and likely not in the guidance that was provided but that could change after the shareholder meeting that could be baked in our next discussion if it's approved.","Frank Lonegro","The numbers we gave you, the around $1.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow excludes the cash impact of the things that we're discussing both in the first quarter and perhaps things that could happen subsequently in the second quarter. Is that cleared now?","Brian Konigsberg","Yes. I could follow-up on that offline but that helps. Thank you.","Frank Lonegro","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. And this does conclude the question and answer session. At this time, I will turn the call over to Hunter Harrison for closing remarks.","Hunter Harrison","Well, thanks very much for joining us in a very simulating goal. Hopefully, we have answered all your questions. And I got a rental key. So, if you'll excuse me. Thanks.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation in today's call. You may disconnect your lines at this time."],"6203":["CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) Q4 2015 Results Earnings Conference Call January 13, 2016  8:30 AM ET","Executives","David Baggs - VP, Treasurer and IR Officer","Michael Ward - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Frank Lonegro - Chief Financial Officer","Cindy Sanborn - Chief Operating Officer","Fredrik Eliasson - Chief Sales and Marketing Officer","Analysts","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays","Brian Ossenbeck - JP Morgan","Chris Wetherbee - Citi","Tom Wadewitz - UBS","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse","Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank","Alex Vecchio - Morgan Stanley","Jason Seidl - Cowen","Matt Troy - Nomura Securities","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities","Ben Hartford - Baird","David Vernon - Bernstein","John Larkin - Stifel","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna","Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","Justin Long - Stephens","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar","Operator","Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the CSX Corporation Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. During this call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode.","For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. David Baggs, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations Officer for CSX Corporation. ","David Baggs","Thank you, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. And again, welcome to CSX Corporation\u2019s fourth quarter 2015 earnings presentation. The presentation material that we\u2019ll be reviewing this morning along with our quarterly financial report and our safety and service measurements, are available on our website at CSX.com under the Investors section. In addition, following the presentation, a webcast replay will be available on that same website.","This morning, our presentation will be led by Michael Ward, the Company\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Frank Lonegro, our Chief Financial Officer. In addition, Cindy Sanborn, our Chief Operating Officer; and Fredrik Eliasson, our Chief Sales and Marketing Officer along with Clarence Gooden, our President, will be available during the question-and-answer session.","Now, before I turn the presentation over to Michael, let me remind everyone that the presentation and other statements made by the Company contain forward-looking statements. You are encouraged to review the Company\u2019s disclosure on the accompanying presentation on slide two. This disclosure identifies forward-looking statements, as well as the uncertainties and risks that could cause actual performance to differ materially from the results anticipated by these statements. In addition, at the end of the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session with the research analysts.","With nearly 30 analysts covering CSX and out of respect for everyone\u2019s time, including our investors, I would ask as a courtesy for you to please limit your inquiries to one question and if necessary, a clarifying question on that same topic.","And with that, let me turn the presentation over to CSX Corporation\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Michael Ward. Michael?","Michael Ward","Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, CSX reported fourth quarter net earnings of $466 million or $0.48 per share, down 2% from the same period in 2014. Revenue declined 13% in the quarter. A strong pricing was more than offset by the impact of lower fuel recovery, a 6% volume decline and the continued transition in the Company\u2019s business mix. Expenses also decreased 13%, primarily the result of lower fuel prices, lower volume related cost and efficiency gains. As a result, operating income decreased 12% to $791 million while the operating ratio improved 20 basis points to 71.6%. In addition, CSX remains an industry leader in safety and service measures continue to progress well as we enter 2016. In fact, Chicago operations have now been fluid for nearly 12 straight months.","Now, turning to the next slide, I\u2019ll discuss full year performance. Over the past five years, CSX has transformed its business to continue delivering solid results despite the global energy transition. As you can see on the left side of the chart, during that period, CSX coal revenue alone declined from $3.7 billion to $2.3 billion a cumulative reduction of $1.4 billion. CSX has overcome that loss by significantly diversifying its market mix, improving service and investing in long-term growth opportunities. As a result, in 2015, coal represented only 19% of CSX\u2019s revenue, down from more than 30% in 2011. During that same period, shareholder returns including dividends and repurchases have continued to reward the owners of our Company, reflecting the steady growth in earnings per share which reached $2 in 2015. Our 2015 performance was achieved despite the challenges in the energy market, low commodity prices and a strong U.S. dollar that impacted many of our markets. Revenue of $11.8 billion reflected growth in intermodal, automotive and minerals that partially offset the continued declines in coal. Improving service, aligning resources and costs against the lower demand environment and driving efficiency gains of more than $180 million helped generate operating income of nearly $3.6 billion and our first sub-70 full-year operating ratio at 69.7%. Those results reflect the employees\u2019 relentless focus on safety and delivering service that supports strong pricing and ever increasing operational efficiency as well as the benefit of lower fuel prices. We will continue to leverage our core strategy, superior network reach and diverse market mix to create long-term value for our shareholders.","Now I\u2019ll turn the presentation over to Frank who will take us through the quarterly results and future outlook in more detail, Frank?","Frank Lonegro","Thank you, Michael, and good morning everyone. Let me begin by providing some more detail on our fourth quarter results. As Michael mentioned, revenue was down 13% or $411 million versus the prior year. This was driven mainly by $198 million decline in fuel surcharge recoveries and about $175 million from the impact of lower volume. At the same time, core pricing gains were more than offset by the impact of negative business mix. Volume decreased 6% from last year with coal driving the majority of the decline. Low natural gas prices coupled with the impact of significant flooding in South Carolina impacted domestic coal volumes while low commodity prices and the strong U.S. dollar challenged export coal in many of our merchandise markets. We continue to see strong core pricing, which for the fourth quarter was up 4.1% overall and 4.5% excluding coal.","Other revenue increased $19 million from last year, driven primarily by unfavorable adjustments to revenue reserves in the prior year period. Expenses decreased 13% versus the prior year, driven mainly by $117 million in lower fuel prices, $107 million in lower volume related costs and $59 million in efficiency gains. In order to further drive efficiency, we closed two facilities in our coal network and completed a new union labor agreement in the fourth quarter. As a result of these actions, we incurred a $48 million or $0.03 EPS impact in the quarter. These short-term restructuring costs will drive future benefits as we gain greater workforce flexibility and continue to adjust to lower demand in our coal market.","Operating income was $791 million in the fourth quarter, down 12% versus the prior year. Looking below the line, interest expense was up slightly from last year with higher debt levels partially offset by lower rates. As we highlighted on our last earnings call, a property sale closed in the fourth quarter for a gain of $80 million or a $0.05 benefit to earnings per share. This gain was associated with a non-operating property and was booked below the line in other income. And finally, income taxes were $275 million in the quarter with an effective tax rate of about 37%. Overall, net earnings were $466 million, down 5% versus the prior year and EPS was $0.48 per share, down 2% versus last year.","Now, let me turn to the market outlook for the first quarter. Looking forward, we expect volumes to decline in the first quarter. We expect the challenging freight environment to continue as the headwinds associated with coal, low commodity prices and a strong U.S. dollar more than offset the markets that will show growth. Automotive is expected to grow consistent with light vehicle production and especially in comparison to a year ago when the auto network experienced weather and service related congestion. Minerals will benefit from continued highway and non-residential construction activity and new business. Intermodal is neutral as continued secular domestic growth and our strategic network investments that support highway to rail conversion are essentially offset by customer losses in international. Agricultural products is unfavorable due to low corn prices coupled with weakness in export grain and import sourcing in ethanol driven by a strong U.S. dollar.","While core chemicals is expected to again be flat, the overall chemicals market is expected to be down as energy markets continue to reset to an environment marked by low crude oil prices and challenging spreads. Domestic coal will continue to be unfavorably impacted by low natural gas prices and an inventory overhang due to mild weather. For 2016, we expect domestic coal volume to be around 19 million tons per quarter. Export coal will continue to be pressured by the strong U.S. dollar and global oversupply. Our full year outlook for export coal volume is around 20 million tons with some downside sensitivity. Metals is unfavorable as the strong U.S. dollar and high levels of imports continue to negatively impact steel production levels. ","Overall, despite a slow growing economy, the freight environment continues to have pronounced challenges with low commodity prices, low natural gas and a strong U.S. dollar.","Turning to the next slide, let me talk about our expectations for expenses. Overall, we expect first quarter expense to benefit from the low fuel price environment as well as continued productivity and volume related cost savings. Looking at labor and fringe, we expect the first quarter average headcount to be down approximately 2% on a sequential basis, driven primarily by the structural changes in our coal network that we announced in the fourth quarter. This reflects about a 10% reduction from the prior year. We expect labor inflation to be around $25 million per quarter throughout 2016, in line with the level seen here in the fourth quarter.","Looking at MS&O expense, we expect inflation to be offset by efficiency gains and volume-related savings, in line with the trends we have seen in the second half of 2015. In addition, the first quarter will reflect a shift in our northern Ohio coal operations. Here, we took action early in the fourth quarter to consolidate freight from a facility in Ashtabula to CSX\u2019s Toledo Docks, which further streamlines our coal operations.","Fuel expense in the first quarter will be driven by lower cost per gallon, reflecting the current price environment, volume related savings, and continued focus on fuel efficiency. We expect depreciation in the first quarter to increase around $15 million versus the prior year, reflecting the ongoing investment in the business. Finally, equipment and other rents in the first quarter is expected to stay relatively flat for last year with higher freight car rates offset by improved car cycle times.","Now, let me talk about our capital investment plan for this year. In 2016, CSX\u2019s total capital investment will decline over $100 million from the 2015 level to $2.4 billion, which includes $300 million for PTC. Similar to 2015, we expect 2016 core capital investment to be higher than our long-term guidance of 16% to 17% of revenue due to our locomotive purchase commitment. This investment in new locomotives expands our ability to run longer trains and we\u2019ll continue to storing older locomotives to maximize the efficiency of the fleet.","Looking at our capital allocation for 2016, you can see that over half the investment will be used to maintain infrastructure to help ensure a safe and fluid network. The majority of our 2016 equipment investment is focused on upgrading our locomotive fleet. We took delivery of 200 new locomotives in 2015 and expect to receive another 100 new locomotives in 2016 which will complete our existing locomotive purchase commitment. In addition, we will continue to focus on strategic investments that support long-term profitable growth and productivity initiatives. Here we are prioritizing these investments in our intermodal business, infrastructure projects that support network fluidity, and technology initiatives to enable productivity.","Finally, looking at our investment in Positive Train Control, we have invested $1.5 billion through the end of 2015 and we plan to invest an additional $300 million in 2016. CSX is committed to meeting a new legislative timeline for PTC. As we look at the path to achieving this goal and with PTC now extending over a longer period of time, we now believe the total cost of PTC implementation will be about $2.2 billion.","Now, let me wrap up on the next slide. Overall, CSX delivered solid financial performance in 2015 despite significant market challenges. Full year EPS increased 4% from the prior year, while our operating ratio improved 180 basis points to 69.7%. Revenue in 2015 was lower than we initially expected with volume declining 2% for the full year. But our continued focus on pricing for the relative value of rail service, driving efficiency gains and aligning resources to the softer demand environment helped to offset those volume headwinds.","Looking ahead, we expect the coal headwinds to continue in 2016. As I mentioned earlier, domestic coal volume in 2016 is expected to be around 19 million tons per quarter, while full year export coal volume is expected to be around 20 million tons, again with some downside to the export estimate. In addition, for the full year, we\u2019ll be operating in a more challenging freight environment than we saw in 2015. Natural gas and broader commodity prices are expected to remain at low levels and the strength in the U.S. dollar is expected to persist during the year.","Furthermore, in 2016, we\u2019ll be cycling a couple of large items that benefited our 2015 results, mainly we received about $100 in liquidated damages and had an $80 million property gain in 2015 which are not expected to recur in 2016. As a result, we currently believe that 2016 earnings per share will be down from last year.","Looking at our expectations for 2016, we will continue to right-size resources with lower demand and pursue structural cost opportunities across our network. In addition, we expect to deliver productivity savings of around $200 million in 2016, which builds on the $184 million of productivity that we achieved in 2015.","Overall, we remain intensely focused this year on delivering a service product that meets or exceeds our customers\u2019 expectations, achieving strong pricing to support reinvestment in the business and driving efficiencies across our entire cost structure.","With that, let me turn the presentation back to Michael for his closing remarks.","Michael Ward","Well, thank you, Frank. CSX has continued to deliver solid results for shareholders, despite the transformational decline in the energy environment and the challenging market conditions. The efforts of our dedicated employees combined with the diversified business mix and the premier network in the east have helped us to overcome the significant losses in coal. As Frank mentioned, 2016 will be a more challenging year. Volume in the first quarter and for the full year will decline as growth in some markets continues to be offset by the significant impact of continued coal declines, low commodity prices and the strong U.S. dollar.","We are taking necessary actions to manage our business in that environment, including making structural and network-wide changes to manage resources and cost with business demand, driving further efficiency gains and remaining focused on strong pricing that reflects the value of CSX\u2019s service. In response to the further challenges expected in 2016, we have also decreased the capital budget by more than $100 million. We expect to invest $2.4 billion this year, as we remain competitive to reserving safety, service and efficiency for customers and communities alike while positioning CSX for the future.","As we look to the future, this Company will continue to transition its business toward long-term profitable growth opportunities in the merchandise and intermodal markets. In that regard, we remain focused on achieving a mid-60s operating ratio longer term as we execute our core strategy of meeting or exceeding customer needs to support strong pricing for the value of our rail service, and continuously improving operational efficiency.","With those efforts, we are confident that CSX will continue to be a preferred service provider for customers who face a growing population of more integrated global economy and the need for more reliable more sustainable supply chains.","Now, we would be glad to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Ken Hoexter from Merrill Lynch.","Ken Hoexter","Michael, good job in a difficult environment. If I can just talk to you about the outlook here, when you think about earnings going down, I guess can you -- do you have comfort when you look at the economy putting any scale on that? And I guess within that, it seemed like coal and intermodal rate declines were over 8%. I understand fuel and mix were a big part of that. But can you talk about the competitive losses? Is that something where you\u2019re seeing increasing price pressure with that, are we seeing the competition increase their focus on pricing to win some of those intermodal contracts that you noted had been lost? It seems like that the volume or amount of those have been accelerating. Maybe if you can just talk a little bit about that and the outlook.","Michael Ward","Good broad question there, Ken. So, Fred, maybe address some of the market conditions.","Fredrik Eliasson","In terms of the pricing for the quarter, as you saw, our ex-coal pricing actually improved from the third quarter; went from 4.4% in the third quarter to 4.5% here in the fourth quarter. All-in went down and that really is the reflection of what we did in the export coal market here as we\u2019re now in a position to actually have some surplus asset, again as we get the network running a lot better and very strong service performance, we do have some excess locomotives. We\u2019ve seen the export market deteriorate and as a result of that we felt this is time when we went back and revisited what we could do to optimize our bottom line. And this is one market where we actually don\u2019t have fuel surcharge in. And as a result, the fuel prices have declined throughout the year. We did feel that it was still an opportunity to do a little bit more there and still make money on it. So, what you\u2019re seeing in the pricing side in the all-in is really a reflection of what we do in export coal market. The core pricing actually sequentially improved quarter-over-quarter.","Frank Lonegro","Ken, on the EPS, for the year, you\u2019re right, we did guide to EPS being down on a reported basis versus the record $2 a share that we delivered in 2015. We tried to give you guidance in terms of the onetime items that we\u2019re cycling in terms of the liquidated damages in the property sale, the continued transformation in the energy sector. So, we updated the coal guides, both on the domestic side and the export side and then tried to give you some view into the broader economy. And clearly those are on the industrial side being suppressed by the combination of low commodity prices and the strong U.S. dollar. But this Company\u2019s remained relentlessly focused on driving the things that are most within our control, as you saw our performance this year or 2015 I should say in terms of the rightsizing that we did and the efficiency gains that we delivered in 2015 and the projections of 200 million as we get into 2016. We\u2019ve got an improving service product and Fredrick just mentioned the strong pricing for our shareholders. So, it\u2019s likely going to be a unique year for us in 2016 and after that we fully anticipate EPS growth toward that path of mid-60s longer term.","Fredrik Eliasson","And then Ken, in this one very broad question that you asked, I\u2019ll come back to the international losses that we referred to. We\u2019ve had several now over a period of time with us throughout 2016 and as we think about where we are, we\u2019re growing with our existing customers very well but there has been some customers that we\u2019ve lost. And clearly from our perspective, we feel that we have a very strong service product right now. We have what we think is a superior network reach. So, the only thing we can assume is that there are factors outside of our control that has allowed us to lose that traffic.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be coming from Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Your line is open.","Brandon Oglenski","Thanks for taking my question, and similarly pretty good results in a difficult environment. So, can we talk more broadly about what could become a manageable level of volume declines where we could think earnings get back to flat; we can get back to operating ratio improvement, or maybe you\u2019re not even suggesting, you can\u2019t get operating ratio improvement this year? But can you talk to levels in the network where you would feel comfortable saying our cost performance and our efficiency plan can get earnings to right-size if not even go up a little bit?","Frank Lonegro","I think on a 2016 basis, obviously as I mentioned, it\u2019s going to be a bit of a unique year, continuing resets in the energy environment. And on the operating ratio question for 2016, obviously, it\u2019s going to be difficult to sustain a sub-70 performance especially giving what we\u2019re cycling and the coal projections that we\u2019ve given you and the uncertainty in the industrial economy. But then again, it\u2019s January the 14th, it\u2019s the middle of the first month of the year. We got a great network, as Fredrik\u2019s mentioned we got a track record of success, we have improving service products. So, we\u2019re going to be relentless in terms of our focus on the things that are most within our control. And so those are the things that give us confidence that the future beyond 2016 is a positive one.","Brandon Oglenski","Is there any way though to quantify for folks on the call just at a broad level? If volume is down low single digits or mid single digits, does that become more problematic than -- trying to quantify for folks where the loss in earnings [kicks out] [ph].","Michael Ward","Well Brandon, not to be repetitive but obviously the one-timers, clearly those could be easily defined. I think we\u2019ve given very strong guidance as to where we see the coal market this year. Obviously a little bit of potential downside in the export; it\u2019s a little hard to gauge this early. I think probably the wildcard is the rest of the economy. And it is very early in the year to try to gauge that. Obviously I think if you look at most prognosticators, they\u2019re saying the first half of the year probably looks weak on the industrial side but potentially it recovers. And I guess we don\u2019t really have a better crystal ball than that a couple of weeks into the year and that\u2019s probably the wildcard in the entire thing. And we\u2019re going to drive the efficiencies over $200 million; we will take actions to also reflect lower volumes which would be in addition to what we do on the productivity side. And I think with those parameters, this should be able to give you some relative idea of what the expectations could be.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Brian Ossenbeck of JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Brian Ossenbeck","I was curious in the 19 million tons per quarter guidance we have in domestic, what level of destocking from inventories do you have kind of reflected in there and whether you\u2019ve outlined some downside risk to export coal? I was just wondering what your thinking is on the domestic side from the utility stockpile and also what level you think natural gas will be?","Fredrik Eliasson","Yes, I mean obviously we don\u2019t foresee natural gas rebounding significant than from where it is today. And as a result most likely for the rest of the year, we expect our coal plants that we serve to be dispatched last. We are seeing obviously excess stockpiles right now. If we look at where we are, we are probably in the 110s or so in terms of the south and more in the 80 range in the northern part of our network; we should probably be in the 55 to 70 range. So, as we think about that 19 million of domestic coal, it really breaks down into two components, one is the utility coal which is about 14 million tons and steel industrial about 5 million tons to make up the 19. We did about [13.6 here] [ph] in the fourth quarter. And so we\u2019re essentially saying we will continue that run rate. And we expect some destocking to occur over the year but how much really will be dependent on the weather since we now -- dispatch last were essentially peakers, so we\u2019re very much weather dependent. If you have favorable weather conditions from a railroad perspective or utility perspective, then you can see a more significant destocking. If you have continued sort of weather pattern we saw in the fourth quarter where heating degree days were actually off by about 25% to 30% of normal, then that will be much more challenging. But hopefully we won\u2019t see that and we will see some destocking occur within the guidance that we provided. ","Brian Ossenbeck","And the other one related to gas, that would be coal to gas switching, difficult to tell but from a structural perspective, are there any pockets of the network perhaps in the north near the Marcellus and Utica shale where you would expect to see some more gas plants being built that could perhaps provide a little bit of incremental pressure on the rest of the networks?","Fredrik Eliasson","No, I think that all the switching that can occur already occurred back in March or April of last year. What we have seen is in some instances we are seeing some of the coal burners actually now burning some natural gas in conjunction to coal firing it with natural gas that has to have a little bit of an incremental additional negative impact on us. But all the switching that can occur has already occurred. And we are being dispatched last or the utility that we serve are being dispatched last.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be coming from Chris Wetherbee from Citi. Your line is open.","Chris Wetherbee","I wanted to ask about the coal network and sort of where you are in terms of potential structural changes that you\u2019re doing. You took some actions in the fourth quarter. I guess I\u2019m curious what else can be done as you move forward to 2016, given the outlook. And then maybe how that ties into productivity and benefits that you\u2019re getting as a great run rate in the fourth quarter. I\u2019m kind of curious what could potentially give upside to that 200 number in 2015.","Cindy Sanborn","This is Cindy. As far as structural cost, you did mention the actions that we took in the fourth quarter. And as I talked in our third quarter release, everything is on the table, not just in our coal network but also in our broader footprint and our opportunity that we\u2019re looking forward to drive density, maximize asset utilization and drive out costs. Facilities are still maybe some opportunities there. I think line segments will take a little bit more time; they involve customers and other constituencies there that make those a little bit more longer term. But we are looking at all of these. And as we find opportunities and make announcements, we\u2019ll obviously share that publically. But we have not given up on continuing to find ways to make our footprint much more consistent with the demand that is put on. And you asked another question about productivity, can I ask you to repeat that?","Chris Wetherbee","Sure, just wanted to get a sense of maybe how the coal network ties into the productivity, the $200 million of productivity and then given the run rate that you had in the fourth quarter which was bit above that level, how do you think about maybe potential upside; is there more that maybe we could see from productivity in 2016? Thanks.","Cindy Sanborn","So, thinking about productivity, we\u2019ve said we\u2019re going to be able to achieve $200 million in productivity savings, in addition to the right-sizing actions that we\u2019re taking. I think when you look at the $200 million in productivity, about $100 million is already -- those initiatives have already been completed and we feel really good about that. And the other initiatives are in slide and we feel good about that. There isn\u2019t necessarily tie or non-tie to the coal network; it\u2019s all -- it\u2019s broad-based and it\u2019s everywhere. And as far as the rightsizing initiatives, I\u2019ll comment on that even it\u2019s not necessarily your question, it might be something you\u2019re thinking about. The way to think about that is fourth quarter is the past is [ph] we\u2019ll be restless on driving out costs that are volume related, as we see demand go down. And then in the opposite, as Michael mentioned, as we see opportunities where demand comes back, we will be able to bring back these resources.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be coming from Tom Wadewitz from UBS. Your line is open.","Tom Wadewitz","I wanted to ask you, I guess that how maybe train starts, just a brief follow-on on that and then maybe on pricing. I don\u2019t know if you want to me give me two but the train -- just a quick, how much were train starts down in the fourth quarter, maybe what that could be in 2016? And then on the pricing, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve answered this when Ken was on earlier. But did you give us a sense of what core price and same store price might be in 2016 or is that something that you cannot comment on? Thank you.","Fredrik Eliasson","Let me just take the pricing question because that\u2019s probably the simplest one. We don\u2019t forecast pricing we\u2019re going to provide you each and every quarter where we come out. The key thing is that you should know that we always focus on pricing and make sure that we get the appropriate value, so we continue to reinvest in our business. As we think about our pricing right now, we have an incredibly strong service product; it\u2019s improved significantly over the last six months as we now have the resources in place. There is a lot of contracts that we still haven\u2019t been able to touch since really the step function change that occurred in early 2014. The contract side on the trucking side, it\u2019s still holding up, even the spot market is very soft. And the key thing for our team is to continue to sell through this down cycle and make sure we provide value to our customers by selling a longer term commitment in terms of making sure they have access to our network. And so that we work through this down cycle right now and sell for the long-term.","Cindy Sanborn","And Tom on starts, I would say probably about thousand starts per week that are scheduled starts will be -- are out. And obviously starts will come out that are volume related more on the unit train side.","Tom Wadewitz","Can you give that percentage, like how much -- what percent train starts were down maybe in fourth quarter and what they might be in \u201816?","Cindy Sanborn","I don\u2019t have a percentage right in front of me there, Tom. But I can tell you that our train length initiatives have obviously driven a lot of this opportunity and\u2026","Michael Ward","From the beginning of the year, Cindy, about 15%.","Cindy Sanborn","For the total year of 2015, they\u2019re up 8% from \u201814 versus \u201815 and in the fourth quarter, they are up 14% from the fourth quarter of \u201814 to the fourth quarter of \u201815.","Tom Wadewitz","The decline year-over-year in train starts, you\u2019re saying.","Cindy Sanborn","I\u2019m saying train lengths in terms of\u2026","Tom Wadewitz","Train lengths, okay.","Cindy Sanborn","Which then translates into the thousands starts per week which we talk about. ","Tom Wadewitz","Okay. ","Cindy Sanborn","It gives you percentage and gives you some sense of where we stand on a percentage basis.","Tom Wadewitz","Okay, yes. I mean those are strong gains, especially given the volume headwind. So, okay, alright. Thank you for the time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be coming from Allison Landry from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Allison Landry","So, given all the debate surrounding M&A and both of the eastern rails talking about getting to a 65 OR over the next few years and some others saying 60 should be bogie. First, could you help to look in the timeframe for when do you think you can achieve the 65 and what if any your plan is from a longer term perspective to close the gap with your peers to ultimately achieve a 60 OR","Frank Lonegro","Allison, it\u2019s Frank. Obviously we can\u2019t comment on what other railroads are projecting into the future. But the challenging environment that we see in 2016 does not in any way diminish our confidence and the ability to deliver the mid 60s operating ratio longer term that we have guided you toward in the past. And again today, as you know, we\u2019ve got an awfully good network, a world-class network in the east. And you\u2019ve seen our success over time, both in terms of delivering margin improvement and the cost takeout that Cindy referenced in addition to the operating side, on the G&A side. So, the effort that we\u2019re taking now especially in an improving environment in the future is going to help us improve margins in a meaningful basis, as that improves. But as we sit here today, based on the forward view of 2016, it just seems a little inappropriate for us to guide on a specific time frame right now.","Allison Landry","And I guess just sort of clarification question, do you think that at some point in the future, is there anything structural that would prevent CSX from achieving a 60-OR?","Frank Lonegro","We don\u2019t see anything structural that would impede us from getting to the mid-60s and through the mid-60s. Obviously it\u2019s going to depend on a whole host of things. And again as Michael said, the crystal ball is a little cloudy in \u201816. And obviously as that clarity improves, we\u2019ll be able to give you more guidance around that.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will be coming from Rob Salmon from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Rob Salmon","Fred, if I could take it back to the intermodal discussion, you had alluded in some international contract losses that have happened through the year. In the guidance, it\u2019s implying roughly 70,000-unit sequential decline which is much more than normal we would see in Q1 versus Q4. Was there an incremental contract loss in the fourth quarter or are you guys contemplating additional inventory destocking that we should be thinking about in the first quarter?","Fredrik Eliasson","We have the intermodal business flat, is that what you\u2019re referring to?","Rob Salmon","It\u2019s in aggregate intermodal carloads being roughly flat. And so I was just thinking of flattish number and comparing that sequentially to the fourth quarter carloads that we saw. And just curious what\u2019s driving the worse than normal drop off in Q1, whether it\u2019s an incremental international loss or some inventory destocking that you\u2019ve got contemplated or something you\u2019re hearing from customers?","Fredrik Eliasson","Sequentially fourth quarter to first quarter is a very different story obviously with the peak that we\u2019re seeing in the fourth quarter, especially around some of our partial business and so forth. So, I think that\u2019s more of a normal thing. If you think about our intermodal business, there is two components to it. We\u2019ve talked about the international side where we have had some competitive losses and you can continue to see that throughout \u201816. However, on the domestic side, we are having good continued success with our H2R initiative, and we\u2019re also seeing some additional outsized growth here over the last probably six months and will probably continue in the first half of next year. But we have one domestic customer that is continuing to shift additional traffic to us which is really a decision that they had made, it\u2019s nothing that we have done to incentivize that. They seem to have wanted to diversify their portfolio. And as a result, we think the domestic business will continue to be strong, at least for the first half of the year and probably beyond that we still think there is opportunity to grow even if that shift subsides.","Rob Salmon","And as a follow-up, when do you lap the final piece of the international competitor losses, should I think about that as Q4 of \u201816, or earlier?","Fredrik Eliasson","Yes, that is correct, Q4 of \u201816.","Rob Salmon","And is that the end or beginning?","Fredrik Eliasson","No, so, we will have one account that we\u2019re just really kicking and having lost here in the first quarter, so you will see it to hold through all of \u201816.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will be coming from Alex Vecchio from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Alex Vecchio","My question is with respect to the guidance for earnings to be down next year. You guys had called out about $180 million of tailwinds in 2015 from property gains and liquidated damages, which is roughly $0.11 to $0.12 a share. So my question is if we were to normalize for those numbers, would you still expect your core, if you will, EPS to be down in 2016 or would it be roughly flat, if we were to normalize for those figures?","Frank Lonegro","So, I think we gave you a couple other data points to look at. Clearly, we gave you a new coal guidance today that is down from what we had telegraphed on the third quarter call. So that\u2019s clearly something to think through. And then on the broader merchandise side with the industrial sector a little sluggish here, so that\u2019s in thoughts. But then again on the other side, continued strong pricing for an improved service product and efficiencies and rightsizing, so there is going to be some pluses and minuses as we go forward. But in terms of your original way of thinking about it, I mean you do have to normalize it and then really look at the pluses and minuses from there.","Michael Ward","And the other thing I would add to that Alex is obviously over the last couple of years, we\u2019ve been able to grow our other markets to offset the declining coal. So, we\u2019re going to have continuing declining coal here and as uncertain industrial economy. So again, that\u2019s the piece that\u2019s least clear but I think it really depends on what happens with the rest of that market. We know we\u2019ll get the productivity; we know we\u2019ll continue network size properly, we know we\u2019re doing the pricing. So really, the wildcard in that question would be what does the rest of the economy do.","Alex Vecchio","And then just a quick follow-up on the first quarter guidance. Can you may be help us quantify little bit how much of year over year tailwind you\u2019d expect lower incentive comps to be on the labor expense line in the first quarter and maybe through 2016.","Frank Lonegro","Yes, so obviously on the incentive comp, the plan resets at the beginning of every year. So, we had favorability in the back half of 2015 as the year played out differently than we had originally projected. And we disclosed that to you on a quarterly basis. So, be on the lookout for that one. In terms of the Q1 EPS, obviously based on the cycling of the 100 million in liquidated damages in a different demand environment of the first quarter of \u201815 versus the first quarter of \u201816 especially in coal, that\u2019s going to impact us and the demand environment that we talked about. But again, you\u2019re going to have to look at the improved service and the rightsizing and the efficiencies and the pricing performance, and that will ultimately help us give some guidance in terms of how far quarter one of \u201816 will be down versus reported \u201815.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be coming from Jason Seidl from Cowen. Your line is open.","Jason Seidl","Fred, I want to go back to something I think you commented about your truck competitor pricing. You mentioned that although truck spot pricing was down, contract was holding up. If contract starts to roll over to sort of meet where spot is, how much pressure is that going to put on intermodal pricing; how should we look at that?","Fredrik Eliasson","I do think that we are seeing holding up okay; it\u2019s clearly gotten softer throughout the year on the contract side. And intermodal side, it\u2019s where we do see most of that direct pressure. Now you know that still we have probably 10% to 15% gap between what the truck prices are and what our prices are. And one of the key things in intermodal space is the strong service product. And as we think about our service product here this year entering into \u201816, it is clear that it\u2019s very different than it was a year ago and that is also going to be very helpful as we approach contract season and we put new contracts in place.","Jason Seidl","Okay, but in terms of if you just say you make some service improvements and you see the truck pricing take a step down, is it going to be tougher to maintain your pricing even with a superior service product?","Fredrik Eliasson","I think we\u2019ve tried to stay away from forecast pricing but directionally you\u2019re right. Obviously the longer this softness is there, the harder it\u2019s going to be to maintain the key challenge for our team is to make sure that our customers are aware that while there\u2019s a softness here right now in \u201816 I think all of us still know that the macro drivers that we talked about for a long time are still prevalent. If we think about some of the productivity challenges that the trucking industry will face is we get to \u201817 with the electronic logs, as unemployment continues to come down, it\u2019s going to be harder to retain the drivers without outsized increases in driver pay. So, we are facing softness; I think also though our customers are acknowledging that that is probably temporary, as some of these macro factors will come back into play.","Jason Seidl","Fantastic, and my follow-up, Michael, given the recent comments by the STB on mergers and also the proposed merger or the talked about merger I guess between CP and NS, what\u2019s the likelihood that you see that the current board would approve a combination?","Michael Ward","That\u2019s a very timely and difficult question to answer, Jason. As you know, there hasn\u2019t been any mergers under the current regulatory environment. That is a really complicated question; it\u2019s probably better addressed by the STB. But as you saw by their letter last week, they\u2019re going to be very focused on one, the public interest of the potential merger, potential downstream effects. And I think the thing that\u2019s probably the most uncertain but probably going to be there for sure, the question to the extent is what regulatory cost will be put on this merger.","Operator","Thanks. Our next question will be coming from Matt Troy from Nomura Securities. Your line is open.","Matt Troy","I just wanted to ask with respect to pricing obviously, rail\u2019s peripherally or tangentially tied to the commodity super cycle which is winding down; you\u2019ve got some more bearish people out there talking about rail pricing being vulnerable, anecdotes of carriers cutting price to incent volume. I just wanted to hear from you or confirm with you that you still remain committed to inflation plus type pricing, consistent with similar years and that there hasn\u2019t been in change in thought or philosophy that perhaps price might be a lever you might use to incent volume in 2016.","Fredrik Eliasson","No. I think our philosophy is still there hasn\u2019t changed in terms of making sure that we do value price in the -- the value provide to our customers and being able to continue to reinvest in our business. At the end of the day, it goes back to what is the second best option for our customers from a service and a price perspective. As we think through each one of them, we still think that we have an opportunity to continue to make sure we get the pricing that we need to getting to reinvest in our business, which benefits both our shareholders but also our customers as we continue to strengthen our infrastructure. It\u2019s one market where we have consistently said that it makes sense in this commodity downturn to be flexible because we\u2019ve seen\u2019 we\u2019ve got additional demand by doing so. And that\u2019s our export coal market. And we\u2019ve taken some additional action here in the fourth quarter to reflect a very, very difficult and challenging environment for them. But in the rest of the markets, we\u2019ll work with our customers in partnership and try to figure out what the best service product is and at the same time also make sure we get the appropriate price. So, I would say that nothing has changed in terms of the philosophy that you\u2019ve seen here from CSX for more than a decade.","Matt Troy","And then I guess my quick follow-up would be the intermodal growth, obviously you spoke at length about the loss in international but the domestic of \u201814 was a fantastic number. You kind of have tale of two railroads when you look at average volumes in fourth quarter, you guys were up mid single-digit; your competitors were down. So obviously domestic, you alluded to a contract moving over on its own, not you incenting it. Just wondering if you could talk about that 14% really high level directionally, how much of that growth would be that singular contract which you have seen shift and how much of it would be what I\u2019d refer to as more organic highway to rail conversion? Thank you.","Michael Ward","It is a significant portion of that growth. I think that prior to last year, we\u2019ve been growing our domestic intermodal business about 7% and we\u2019ve guided long-term to about 5% to 10%. And with a softer market, we\u2019re probably at the low end of that range, if you exclude this shift. But nothing has changed in terms of our opportunity to convert what we\u2019ve said is over 9 million units in our network territory that we think over time can be converted to a rail based solution in partnership with our truckers. And so, we think it\u2019s softer right now. But as I said to previous -- answered to previous question, the macro environment still favors a rail based solution longer term.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be coming from Cherilyn Radbourne from TD Securities. Your line is open.","Cherilyn Radbourne","My first question is on your variable train scheduling initiative and just how much of an impact that had in the increase in train lengths that you saw and what inning you think we\u2019re in, in terms of realizing whole benefit?","Cindy Sanborn","I think as far as the variable trains which that has -- that applies to our merchandise network, I think we\u2019ve seen the biggest increase in train size in the merchandise side. So in the fourth quarter, we saw increase in the train side of 23%. So, I think what the variable schedule does for us going forward is as we see softer demand we are able to right-size that network more effectively. In terms of what the components are of variable train that are in place, we pretty much got them in place but it does allow us to continue to shift and expand and contract on a more effective way than we\u2019ve been able to do in the past in our merchandise network.","Michael Ward","And you\u2019re doing a lot more in the bulk. ","Cindy Sanborn","Yes, we\u2019re also continuing train length initiatives on the bulk side as well. We\u2019ve seen increases in train lengths across coal, grain and others in the 5% to 10% range also over the quarter. So, it\u2019s not just a merchandised -- train length is not just a merchandise initiative, it also follows the rest but merchandise has seen the biggest benefits.","Cherilyn Radbourne","And then to the extent that you expect earnings to decline in 2016 and see some volume uncertainty, can you just comment on whether that will have any impact on the pace at which you expect to execute on your share buyback program?","Frank Lonegro","You saw us repurchase 9 million shares in the quarter or just under 260 million which was essentially the same rate that you saw us in the third quarter and it\u2019s consistent with the $2 billion program that we announced back in April. And we currently expect to complete that program ratably over the next five quarters, using balance sheet cash, free cash flow and debt. So, I think you\u2019re going to continue to see us based on what we see now to continue on that ratable program. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be coming from Ben Hartford from Baird. Your line is open.","Ben Hartford","Just quick question on the export coal side. In your mind, what is the risk to further downside? You obviously talked about some downside risk to the 20 million tons number this year but what provides any comfort that you have line of sight to a floor and that we shouldn\u2019t be thinking about, the early 2000 levels of a number less than half, this guided 2016 number or even something above and beyond the 2002, 2003 levels? Is there any way to -- obviously the market is uncertain, but is there any way to frame up the likelihood of a 50% or even deeper cut to the export coal number over the course of the next few years?","Michael Ward","I think that over the last couple of years, as we provided you guidance at beginning of the year, we\u2019ve been actually very, very close to those numbers. And while these are uncharted territory in terms of underlying commodity prices, both on the thermal side and the met side, we do work very closely with our customers, both on the producer side and also with some of the agent to sell for us and really try to go over and understand the markets themselves. As we think about this \u201816 right now, out of the 20 million, we probably have about 6 million that we have very good visibility to, probably little bit lower than you normally would have at this time of the year but we still think that there is an opportunity to get to that about 20 million tons for the year. And one of the drivers here is also that you do have such a large excess surplus of domestic coal where the producers are very eager to push that out to the market and that is helpful as well as we move through 2016.","Ben Hartford","Frank, share buyback, what is the thought process there this year? And then, I want to confirm something on the CapEx side that the 307 million from the 113 locos that were purchased late last year; is that in the 2016 CapEx budget of $2.4 billion?","Frank Lonegro","So the answer to your last question is yes. And on the buybacks, it\u2019s the same ratable methodology that you heard us talk about previously. And so, the $2 billion program was intended to be over two-year period. And as we currently see things, we\u2019ll continue to do it at about 260 a quarter.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will be coming from David Vernon from Bernstein. Your line is open.","David Vernon","Fredrick, maybe just to put some more numbers on the issue around utility coal pricing, if you look back over the last couple of years when you\u2019ve seen the utility business get cut by half or so. Can you talk about the trend you guys have seen in your distance neutral rate per ton; has that been moving up or have you seen some weaker years went because of the lower gas price? Just trying again put some numbers around the utility coal pricing.","Fredrik Eliasson","So clearly, in mid part of last decade, there was a significant opportunity to a touch legacy pricing and that probably lasted from 2005 to 2011 or so. And then since then, it\u2019s been much more normalized pricing. As natural gas prices now come down as much as they have, there really isn\u2019t much that we can do to incentivize incremental burn. We look at each and every contract when they come up to see if there are opportunities to optimize the bottom line but being more flexible in pricing. And if there is, we will do that. But generally, at these natural gas prices, there isn\u2019t really anything we can do to improve the burn rates with maybe one or two exceptions.","David Vernon","And then maybe Frank, just as a follow-up on the productivity, can you talk a little bit about how dependent the level of productivity you\u2019re getting right now is on the CapEx budget? It sounds like some of the new locomotives that you\u2019re getting are necessary to run a longer train. And I\u2019m just wondering about how much more upgrading of the fleet may be required over the next few years? And when that CapEx get down to 16%, 17%?","Frank Lonegro","So, on the locomotive piece, obviously we\u2019ll complete the deliveries in 2016, as Cindy has mentioned, we\u2019ve certainly looked at rightsizing the fleet and taking out the bad actors and the high fuel burn locomotives. So, it certainly helps but you\u2019re talking about 300 engines on a 4,000 engine base. On your tie between productivity and CapEx, there is always some in the CapEx budget that relates to productivity and it\u2019s really I would say dog\u2019s breakfast. You\u2019ve got structural changes in the coal network; you\u2019ve got G&A restructuring and downsizing; you\u2019ve got terminal efficiencies; you\u2019ve got training length which gives you lower crew stars as we mentioned earlier in the call; you\u2019ve got technology initiatives which are funded through the CapEx process that relate into some of the productivity initiatives. So, I think you\u2019re looking at a lot of things that we did in 2015 that will carry over into 2016 and then there is a little bit of a tie between CapEx and productivity. But it\u2019s small in the grand scheme of things, David.","In terms of long term and getting back down to 16% to 17%, if you were to normalize this year\u2019s capital budget for the 300 million in locomotive payments, you\u2019d be at that range now. So it\u2019s certainly something that on a long term basis we\u2019re going to continue to look at. Fuel surcharge that\u2019s come down has obviously been a bit of a headwind for us in the past as we look at that 16% to 17%.","David Vernon","And I guess just as a short follow-up to that, and in the number of the 300 locomotives you\u2019ve taken against the 4,000 fleets, if you had a capital unconstrained world and you wanted to go and push trail lengths in other parts of the business, would there be opportunities to go ahead and continue to upgrade that fleet and operationally find opportunities to run longer trains in other parts of the network or are you nearing the end of the ability to get that extra productivity from train lengths?","Cindy Sanborn","The train length constraints really are not locomotive base; they are sighting capacity based in the southern part of our network. And in terms of capital, we\u2019re looking at those types of investments going forward to allow us to unlock the value of longer trains. So, it\u2019s really not locomotive based.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be coming from John Larkin from Stifel. Your line is open.","John Larkin","I wanted to dig a little bit more into the stated objective of producing another 200 million in productivity savings in 2016. Could we talk a little bit about how that might be spread over the year and how much of that is tied to the rationalization of the coal network and whether the rationalization of the coal network also would envision potential abandonments and\/or sales to short lines on some wider density lines in the coal network?","Cindy Sanborn","So from a productivity perspective, the 200 million is again as I said initiative based, a 100 million is pretty much, those initiatives are in place. Two of those are one area that is included is the actions that we took in the fourth quarter on the reduction in volume across the Erwin gateway and the closure of the Corbin locomotive facility. So to the extent those are obviously in the coal fields that is an impact to productivity in 2016 around both facilities reduction and facilities and headcount reduction. So that\u2019s basically the way I see 2016 looking with productivity. As far as continued rationalization in the coal fields, as I said, we\u2019re going to look at that not just in the coal fields but broadly, whether it\u2019s facility related and\/or line segment. The line segments take a little bit longer to work through; they involve customers; they involve other constituencies. So, as we make those determinations and make those decisions, we\u2019ll be very public with that information but that\u2019s more longer term.","John Larkin","So, the 200 million will be folded in pretty much evenly across all four quarters, is that a way to think about it?","Cindy Sanborn","I would say it\u2019s right, John, yes. Easiest way to think about it.","Operator","Your next question will be coming from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Your line is open.","Bascome Majors","I wanted to take a directional look at the margin profile of the coal business; it looks like from your guidance, tonnage is going to be -- if you\u2019re at your guidance for the year, tonnage will be down 45% or so. For the entire business, it\u2019s 2011. Can you just talk a little bit about the balance within the segment of the margin profile between the export business today after the price cuts you\u2019ve taken over the several years, and the domestic business where you transition to the fixed-variable contract structure? And also more broadly where is coal comping versus the rest of the book today? Is it still your premium business up there with chemicals or has the profile fallen down the ladder a bit as the revenues have fallen? Thank you.","Fredrik Eliasson","Back in 2012 or so, we used to say that our export and utility business was about the same level of contribution and on a margin basis. But since then as we have adjusted export rates significantly down, our utility book of business has a higher margin than the export business. If you look at the overall portfolio of coal versus the rest of the business, I would say that it\u2019s still clearly more profitable because of the fact that it\u2019s such an efficient way for us to move the cargo have a tonnage, just the unit train back and forth is very-very efficient for us to operate that way. And so, it\u2019s still at the high end of our business.","Bascome Majors","As my follow-up here and maybe for Michael or Clarence if he\u2019s in the room, I understand you guys are railroaders; you\u2019re not economists here but just looking at the volume declines you\u2019re seeing today, both the depth of them and the breadth, have you ever seen an environment like this in your business or careers outside of a recession?","Michael Ward","It\u2019s Michael; I\u2019ll answer that although Clarence is here. So, if you take out the recession, no, we\u2019ve not seen these kinds of pressures in so many different markets because you have multiple aspects working against you. The low gas prices; the low commodity prices; the strength of the dollar, all three of those together are really pushing. And in some ways, I think you can almost think of it as a straight recession, except for say markets like automotive and housing related, you\u2019re seeing pressure on most of the markets. So clearly outside of a recession, this is one where we\u2019re seeing lots of pressure in lots of different markets.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be coming from Jeff Kauffman from Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Jeff Kauffman","First of all congratulations, I mean just a very difficult quarter. I thought you guys did a great job on the cost side. I wanted to zero in on the changing coal guidance for next year. If I look at kind of what\u2019s changed, I think you were talking around kind of a 21 million ton domestic run rate going down to 19, so that\u2019s about an 8 million ton change. But it really looks like almost half of that drop was on the coking coal and domestic met side. So two questions, number one, when I look at domestic, how much of that change is your view on utility versus your view on kind of other domestic coal? And when I look at the exports, you did about 31 million this year; the guidance is for 20 million. Can I look at end markets and can we think about it that way in terms of where has the incremental demand ebbed for your export coal geographically?","Fredrik Eliasson","Yes, you\u2019re right. If you go back to the third quarter guidance that we did at the call, we essentially said 21 million tons per quarter of domestic which was 15 of domestic -- of utility and 6 of steel and industrial, and we said then about our export was about 6 million tons a quarter for 24 in total. So, we\u2019ve essentially seen a deterioration in all of those three markets by about 1 million tons a quarter. And it\u2019s really reflection of the fact that natural gas prices and the very mild fourth quarter in the utility side has dampened our expectations.","On the steel and industrial side, it\u2019s the reflection of the fact that when we look at the steel industry right now, having utilization of about 60% versus 75% a year ago and we saw it deteriorate throughout the fourth quarter. And on the export market, it\u2019s also just reflection of the fact that underlying commodity indexes are telling us that market has gotten softer as global oversupply continues. So, in terms of where the export market is going, we did about 60-40 split here between met and thermal. They\u2019d probably be a little bit higher next year will be my guess at this point in terms of probably one-third, two-third, two-thirds in favor of met. And traditionally over a half of our business goes to Europe. And I\u2019d say that split is probably going to continue in terms of the end market as well. And so, I think it\u2019s just proportional between markets and I think you\u2019re going to see relatively proportional count in terms of the end markets as well.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Scott Group","So, Fredrik, just wanted to ask about the coal yield, so I thought that the fixed-variable was supposed to help in environments like this when volumes are down so much and help the yields out, why aren\u2019t we seeing that?","Fredrik Eliasson","Yes, in the third quarter, they were helpful actually. They were still helpful here in the fourth quarter but not as much because some of this also depends on who you are actually shipping to. And the big driver though in the coal yields was really the fact that we have made these accommodations on the export side and further adjusted our rates downward to reflect the reality of the underlying market and thing trying to optimize our bottom line.","Scott Group","And then Michael, I just want to ask, so a lot\u2019s changed -- certainly a lot\u2019s of changed in the market from year, year and half. Since your view or appetite on M&A changed at all or has it changed it all in that year and year and half?","Michael Ward","Not really, Scott. If you think about it, I think our position is the same, as it was a year or year and half ago. We think there is tremendous opportunity for shareholder value creation with our existing portfolio. And if you think about any mergers, there\u2019s going to be substantial regulatory cost, some of the synergies will be very limited because they are end to end mergers. So, if you are going to offset those regulatory costs, you\u2019ve got to have compelling interfaces of synergies. And I really have a hard time envisioning where that would be in any rail merger.","Scott Group","So that the challenge is that the markets don\u2019t change your view on that.","Michael Ward","No, sir. I think we\u2019ve done well in prior down periods; we think we will in this one as well. And we think the long-term future with our existing customer base two thirds of the population we serve, pressures on the trucking, the service improvements we continue to make in the pricing, allows to create lots of value for the shareholders over the intermediate long-term.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from Justin Long from Stephens. Your line is open. ","Justin Long","So you talked about cycling the benefits from liquidated damages and gains on sales this year. And just taking those items out to someone\u2019s point earlier, you get to a mid single-digit EPS decline in 2016 along with anticipated volume declines, mix headwinds, your commentary that it will be difficult to improve the OR. Is it fair to say that EPS should be down at least double-digits or low double-digits this year?","Michael Ward","Yes, all we\u2019re prepared to talk you about today is the directional piece, what we try to do is to give you some clarity around the moving parts that we have, obviously certainty on the cycling piece and we have we think good insights into the coal sector. It\u2019s really what happens in the industrial space, especially as we get out into the second half of the year. And again it\u2019s really, really early in the year in an uncertain environment to project full year EPS with specificity. At the same time, as you look at the things that we\u2019re doing, the pricing performance, the productivity, the rightsizing, the service improvements and all of those things are the things that are most within our control. And those are the things that you are going to see us be relentless about.","Justin Long","And as a quick follow-up, I wanted to ask about PTC, you mentioned the $300 million of anticipated spending this year and $2.2 billion in total but of that total amount, what\u2019s remaining after 2016? And after you\u2019ve fully installed the technology, do you anticipate any incremental maintenance cost associated with PTC that would be ongoing?","Michael Ward","So, let me give you the facts and the figures on PTC. So a $1.5 billion is what we spent through the end of \u201815, we\u2019ve given you the $300 million guidance for \u201816 so that would take you upto the $1.8 billion through the end of this year. Our project takes us to a hardware completion date of 2018 and fully operational by 2020. I think you will see the majority of the difference between the 1.8 billion and the 2.2 billion being spent between now -- excuse me, end of \u201816 and the end of \u201818. In terms of the tail on OpEx and some refresh CapEx, we\u2019re still working through that. Obviously there is a piece that\u2019s embedded within depreciation as well as in departmental operating expenses. And that\u2019s still being worked on right now as we understand the support agreements that will go along with the hardware and the software as well as the useful life on those pieces of equipment.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be coming from Cleo Zagrean from Macquarie. Your line is open.","Cleo Zagrean","So the follow-up already since the recent conversation, let\u2019s imagine ourselves this time next year after the lower earnings base set by \u201816 and I am not asking for guidance but conceptually how do you see the new growth trend? Can we see double digit sustainable EPS growth or should we think of maturing into a pattern of lower growth, maybe more distributions for shareholders? Because we\u2019ve been talking about the structural changes not in a so called recession such as lower profitability from coal, consumer spending, shifting more towards services, probably sustainable strong dollar, sluggish industrial economy. So, what is the new normal and how can you grow in that? Thank you.","Frank Lonegro","From just an EPS directional thinking beyond 2016, we see 2016 as again a unique year. And clearly we should be able to provide strong EPS growth off of a 2016 base. And I\u2019ll allow Fredrick to comment on some of the commercial items of your question in terms of where some of the various lines of business might be going?","Fredrik Eliasson","So, as we go through this year and cycle some of these headwinds that we\u2019re going to be facing, clearly for the first half of this year and we look at where the macroeconomic indicators are and projection for the U.S. dollar, I think we\u2019ll start seeing things stabilize, normalize and we can start seeing year-over-year growth as we move through hopefully late in 2016 and clearly move into \u201817. Based on what we\u2019re seeing right now, as Frank I think has said many times throughout the call today and Michael as well, the key thing for us right now is the focus on the things that we can hold the most. And then the macro headwinds are going to be whatever they are and the key thing for us is to adjust our infrastructure to reflect the reality of what they provide us.","Cleo Zagrean","And as a follow-up, can you talk to us about the rate at which you\u2019d see investing in growth opportunities? And maybe what it would take for you to consider higher sustainable dividend yield to appeal to more broadly to dividend focused investors? Thank you.","Michael Ward","On the capital side, clearly there is a portion of our capital budget every year that is geared toward growth investments. The majority of that over recent years has been focused on our growth engine and that\u2019s on the intermodal, especially in domestic intermodal side. So, you will continue to see us focused in that area. In terms of dividends, I would say currently where we are, we have a very healthy yield. We have guidance out there in terms of what we\u2019re willing to pay out on a trailing 12 months basis and that\u2019s in the 30% to 40% of trailing 12 months earnings. And so we look at that every year, generally speaking after the first quarter and we\u2019ll continue to do that and look at where we are against the broader environment.","Operator","Thank you. And the last question will be coming from Keith Schoonmaker from Morningstar. Your line is open, sir.","Keith Schoonmaker","Your expectations for automotive are scarce bright spot as were actual auto shipments last year. Could you please add some color to this growth expectation, maybe particular locations where you\u2019re seeing some strengths, as well as perhaps comment on general shifts of production to Mexico and how that affects your network? Thank you.","Fredrik Eliasson","So if you look at the North America light vehicle production, I think we\u2019re earning up about 17.5 here in \u201815 and the projection is for 18.2 next year, so that provides us good growth opportunities; U.S. sales also based on the projections that we\u2019re seeing indicates good growth. The Mexico shift is clear, so the North American light vehicle production numbers are probably skewed a little bit more towards Mexico which we don\u2019t capture as much but we still capture some of that. And sometimes that is actually a length of how it vantage for us, so that is helpful.","So overall, if you go back in history over the last 30-40 years, I am sure that you will find our core relation in North America light vehicle production is probably in the very-very high 95%, 98%. So, we follow what producers tell us and then we adjust our fleet and service accordingly. And right now, it looks like we\u2019re going to have another year of growth but not anywhere closer to where it\u2019s been since \u201809 but still nice growth and especially in this environment; we need these sorts of growth opportunities.","A - Michael Ward","Well, thank you everyone for joining us and we will talk to you again next quarter.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. During this call, all participants will be in a listen only mode. For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. David Baggs, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations Officer for CSX Corporation. You may begin, sir.","David Baggs ","Thank you, Shirley and good morning, everyone and again welcome to CSX Corporation's third quarter 2015 earnings presentation. The presentation material that we'll be reviewing this morning along with our expanded quarterly financial report and our safety and service measurements are available on our website at CSX.com under the investor section. In addition, following the presentation a webcast and podcast replay will be available on that same website. This morning our presentation will be led by Michael Ward, the company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Frank Lonegro, our Chief Financial Officer. In addition, Cindy Sanborn, our Chief Operating Officer and Fredrik Eliasson, our Chief Sales and Marketing Office along with Clarence Gooden, our President will be available during the question-and-answer session.","Now, before I turn the presentation over to Michael, let me remind everyone that the presentation and other statements made by the company contain forward-looking statements. You are encouraged to review the company's disclosure and accompanying presentation on slide 2. The disclosure identifies forward-looking statements, as well as the uncertainties and risks that could cause actual performance to differ materially from the results anticipated by these statements. In addition, at the end of the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, with the research analysts.","With nearly 30 analysts covering CSX today, and out of respect for everyone's time, including our investors, I would ask as a courtesy for you to please limit your inquiries to one question and if necessary, a clarifying question on that topic. And with that, let me turn the presentation over to CSX Corporation's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Michael Ward. Michael?","Michael Ward","Thank you, David, good morning, everyone. Yesterday, CSX announced third quarter financial results that demonstrate our ability to effectively manage in a dynamic marketplace. Our results included net earnings of $507 million, which translates to earnings per share of $0.52, a third quarter record.","Looking at the top line, revenue in the quarter declined 9% as pricing gains were more than offset by lower fuel recovery, the continued transition in CSX's business mix, and a 3% volume decline as we cycled 2014's high demand environment. At the same time, we continue to be an industry leader in safety and we are leveraging our improving network performance to deliver strong service and efficiency savings to help reduce operating expenses. As a result, CSX delivered operating income of $933 million and a third quarter record operating ratio of 68.3%.","As we look across our business, low natural gas prices are clearly challenging domestic coal volume. More broadly, low commodity prices and the strength of the US dollar continue to challenge many of our other markets. In this environment, our goal remains providing safe, reliable service that consistently meets our customer's expectation. That service is the foundation of our ability to create long-term value for customers and shareholders as it supports pricing for the value of our service and produces increasingly efficient operations.","Now, I will turn the presentation over to Frank, who will take us through the financials and the outlook in more detail. Frank?","Frank Lonegro","Thank you, Michael and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by providing some more detail on our third quarter results. As Michael mentioned, revenue was down 9% versus the prior year. This was driven mainly by $175 million decline in fuel surcharge recoveries and a $75 million impact from lower volume. At the same time, core pricing gains were essentially offset by negative business mix. Volume decreased 3% from last year with low natural gas prices impacting domestic coal volume and low commodity prices coupled with the strong US dollar, challenging export coal and some of our merchandise markets, particularly metals.","Core pricing continues to improve sequentially and for the quarter was up 4.6% overall and 4.4% excluding coal. Other revenue decreased $32 million versus the prior year, driven primarily by lower liquidated damages, and an adjustment to reserves related to volume-based customer refunds. Expenses decreased 11% versus the prior year, driven mainly by a $145 million favorable impact from lower fuel prices. Our ongoing focus on efficiency drove $42 million in productivity gains in the quarter, while lower volume resulted in over $70 million of cost reduction versus last year. As a result, operating income was $933 million, down 4% versus the prior year.","Looking below the line, interest expense was similar to last year. Other income was favorable as we cycled environmental charges nor non-operating activities, as well as costs associated with the early retirement of debt from the prior year period. And finally, income taxes were $292 million in the quarter with an effective tax rate of about 37%. Overall, net earnings were $507 million, essentially flat to last year, and EPS was $0.52 per share, up 2% versus the prior year.","Now, let me turn to the market outlook for the fourth quarter. Looking forward, we expect volumes to decline in the fourth quarter. Although we are projecting stable to favorable conditions for several key markets, this will be more than offset by unfavorable conditions for the remainder of the portfolio. Intermodal continues to be a strong growth engine as our strategic network investments support highway to rail conversions and growth with existing customers, and automotive is expected to grow along with light vehicle production trends. Agriculture is neutral as strength during the fall harvest season and our improved efficiency will be offset by weakness in export grain and the continued risk of ethanol imports driven by a strong US dollar in a challenging global market. Chemicals is expected to be down materially as energy markets reset to an environment marked by low crude oil prices and reduced drilling activity. We expect that crude oil volumes may be down at least 25% in the fourth quarter on a sequential basis. Metals is unfavorable as the strong US dollar and high levels of imports continue to negatively impact domestic steel production levels. As such, we expect the year-over-year rate of decline to be similar to what we experienced in the third quarter.","Domestic coal will continue to be unfavorably impacted by sustained low natural gas prices and we now expect domestic coal volume to decline around 20% in the fourth quarter. As we look ahead to next year, significant coal headwinds are expected to continue in 2016. Sequentially, our quarterly run rate for domestic coal volume in 2016 should hold relatively flat to the level we expect to see in the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter, export coal is expected to be lower, as global oversupply and the strong US dollar continue to pressure volumes. Despite the year-over-year decline, we continue to expect about 30 million tons of export coal for the full year. Looking ahead we expect this market to be even more challenged in 2016.","Overall, we expect fourth quarter volume declines as we cycle a strong 2014 volume environment, continue to feel the effects of low natural gas and crude oil prices, and the impact of strong currency on our export and import sensitive markets.","Turning to the next slide, let me talk about our expectations for expenses in the fourth quarter. Overall, we expect fourth quarter expenses to benefit from the continued low fuel price environment as well as productivity and volume related cost savings as we remain focused on increasing train length and aligning resources to the lower demand environment. To illustrate our progress, in the third quarter we increased overall train length by about 10% versus the prior year, which drove a significant reduction in crew starts.","Looking at labor and fringe, we expect the fourth quarter average head count to be down approximately 2% on a sequential basis, which reflects about a 6% reduction from the prior year. We expect labor inflation to be around $25 million in the fourth quarter, slightly below what we saw in the third quarter.","Looking at MS&O expense, we expect inflation to be offset by efficiency gains and volume-related savings. Fuel expense in the fourth quarter will be driven by lower cost per gallon, reflecting the current price environment, volume-related savings, and continued focus on fuel efficiency. We expect depreciation in the fourth quarter to increase about $15 million versus the prior year, reflecting the ongoing investment in the business. Finally, equipment and other rents in the fourth quarter is expected to stay relatively flat to last year with higher freight car rates offset by improving car cycle times.","Now, let me wrap up on the next slide. CSX delivered another solid financial performance in the third quarter with earnings per share up slightly from the prior year. Top line growth was lower than we initially expected, but our continued focus on pricing for the relative value of rail service, driving efficiency gains, and aligning resources to a weaker demand environment helped to offset those volume headwinds. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we will again be cycling a strong demand environment last year, which coupled with the challenging market conditions we are facing this year, is expected to impact our volume growth. In addition, we expect headwinds in our coal and crude oil markets to increase in the fourth quarter driven by sustained low commodity prices. As I mentioned earlier, domestic coal volume is expected to be down around 20% versus the prior year. And crude oil volume is expected to decline at least 25% sequentially. As a result, we expect fourth quarter EPS to be down slightly versus the prior year.","Included in this outlook are two possible items that could be finalized in the fourth quarter. First, EPS could benefit $0.05 from a conveyance of non-operating property that could close near the end of the quarter. This will be booked below the line in other income. Second, and above the line, EPS could also be impacted by a few cents relating to short-term costs in the fourth quarter associated with a new union labor agreement and some structural changes in our coal network. Both of these costs will drive future benefits, as we gain greater workforce flexibility and adjust to lower demand in our coal market.","Looking at full year 2015 earnings, we are still targeting mid-single digit EPS growth and meaningful improvement in our full year operating ratio. In addition, as we further align resources to the soft demand environment, coupled with our expectation for 2016 coal volume, we are looking at opportunities to drive structural changes in our coal network, in order to accelerate efficiency gains next year. Our commitment to service excellence continues to drive efficiency gains, strong pricing, and long-term profitable growth, all of which supports investment in the business.","With that, let me turn the presentation back to Michael for his closing remarks.","Michael Ward","Well, thank you, Frank. As you heard today, CSX is taking action to manage the challenges of this dynamic marketplace. With currency and commodity prices to continue to impacting coal and several other merchandise markets in 2016, we will continue to match resources to the business environment.","At the same time, we remain committed to delivering strong service that supports operating efficiency and creates customer value necessary to support strong pricing, which enhances our ability to invest for the future. Through these strategic investments and productivity initiatives, we are positioning the CSX network to leverage longer term opportunities for profitable growth in our merchandise and intermodal markets. As such, this management team absolutely believes that CSX can and will achieve a mid-60s operating ratio longer term. We will now be glad to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator instructions) Our first question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. You may ask your question.","Eric Morgan","This is Eric Morgan with Brandon's team. Thanks for taking my question. I want to focus on intermodal, obviously, a really strong growth domestically, called out some share shift on the international side. Can you talk about just the outlook for each of those segments and if that sort of the growth domestically is really sustainable throughout next year?","Fredrik Eliasson","Well, thank you, Eric, this is Frederick. On the domestic side, we are seeing the benefit of the investment and improving service product that we are seeing. We have been able to grow that business somewhere between 5% and 10% over last several years. We are seeing a little bit of an enhanced growth here this quarter, as we know one of our customers who has the contractual ability to further diversify the portfolio is doing just that here in the quarter. So we are seeing a little bit of an uptick in the growth with that customer right now beyond what we would normally see, but we feel good about that business, feel good about the ability to continue to grow that at a multiple economic output for a period of time here going forward.","On the international side, we are experiencing growth with several of our existing customers. We have lost several contracts over the last 12 to 18 months, but overall we feel very good about our network reach and the service that we are providing, and so we feel good about that business going forward and we want to make sure that we continue to reinvest in that business, a critical goal of ours as we move forward.","Eric Morgan","I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Ossenbeck","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my call. So I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the coal outlook. Maybe you can just run through some of the assumptions you are embedding in the domestic coal kind of holding where it is right now and may be retirements, natural gas, and any coal to gas switching, and then if you can touch briefly on export coal, a lot of the thermal pricing we're seeing now suggests that there's not a whole lot that's going to be economic going into Europe at least, especially when you adjust for FX. So I'd like to hear a little bit more behind your assumptions there. Thank you.","Fredrik Eliasson","Sure. This is Fredrik again. In terms of the domestic coal, Frank gave you a view there in terms of that sequentially, after we are going to be down, at 20% year-over-year is our estimate in the fourth quarter. Sequentially from there, that run rate of about 21 million tons or so for domestic as a whole is a good place to think about next year. And really there are two drivers behind that, one is that our -- at this point, we are being dispatched last because of where natural gas prices are, so that is not going to shift as we move into next year unless natural gas prices come up. Obviously, it would be a very different and more appealing picture, but there are two drivers behind it. One is the fact that we have probably about 3 million tons that we are moving this year that we will not see next year because of planned closures; and then the second driver is, as we look at the inventory levels at utilities that we serve, they are still at elevated levels. So we are going to have some headwinds next year and that's kind of the foundation. And that 21 million tons that I alluded to, which is the sequential quarterly run rate, is probably about 15 million tons on the utilities side and about 6 million tons on account of that net coke and iron ore.","On the export side, I think what we've said is that we did about 18 million tons in the first half of this year. We are in a run rate with implied guidance that we've given of 30 million tons -- of 12 million tons in the second half. And as I think about the second half run rate, I think that's a good run rate if you analyze that, so 24 million tons for next year. We will have a much better sense as we get to the fourth quarter because we are obviously in a market right now to try to see what we can do, especially on the steam side, and it is a much more difficult environment even today than it was just six months ago, so we are working through that but we will have a better sense of export market as we get to the fourth quarter earnings release.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay. Thank you. A quick follow-up on just some of the initiatives on the coal network. It sounded like you're taking some steps to do some realignment on the actual infrastructure, if you could just run through what you're doing and what type of benefits you are seeing and when you would expect to see those. Thanks a lot.","Cindy Sanborn","Okay, Brian, this is Cindy. Frank mentioned that we are analyzing and looking at what we need to harvest from our existing coal network, where we have seen the most significant declines in Appalachia. We haven't announced anything yet, but we have plans to do so and stay tuned on that one.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citi. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Chris.","Christian Wetherbee","Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Cindy, if you could just bear with me, I wouldn't mind just following up a little bit on that. If there is any way you can give us a sense of what might be on the table, if it's sort of shuttering lines completely or at least sort of dialing the volume dynamic down quite a bit. I mean, is everything on the table? I'm just kind of curious if there is any incremental detail you can add to that. Thank you.","Cindy Sanborn","Chris, I think everything is on the table. And as far as whether it would be facilities or lines, I think you will understand and appreciate that we want to be able to talk about those things internally before we do externally, but there's really not anything that's not on the table.","Christian Wetherbee","Okay. That's helpful. And then when you think about sort of the head count of the business as you look out into 2016 and start your planning there, assuming we maintain sort of a fairly slow growth economic environment, how should we think about the appropriate staffing levels at CSX? And maybe what the opportunity is, potentially, in terms of leveraging that dynamic of growth and volume -- maybe not so much growth on the head count side. Any help you can give us there would be really great.","David Baggs","Well, I think what we've demonstrated here in the third quarter, we have to run a tight, efficient, and reliable network. And we are, as you mentioned, in a very dynamic environment. From the standpoint of operations head count, we do have 1200 T&E employees furloughed. We have ramped down our training significantly. And we will be continuing to do that going forward to match demand. Clearly, we have furloughs that we can pull back into active service if needed. Although, there are a handful of locations where we have very few furloughed and we will need to -- we may need to hire in those locations. We will be offering opportunities for existing employees and what we would consider deep furlough, those opportunities to go back there -- back to those locations. But generally speaking, we are managing that on both the hiring side and recognizing that we have furloughs to pull from as needed.","Christian Wetherbee","Okay. All right, that's helpful. Thank you so much for the time. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Tom.","Thomas Wadewitz","Hi. Yeah, good morning, Michael. Good morning, everyone. So, I wanted to ask you a question to start with on the pricing side. You guys have done a great job at ramping up the pricing and really capturing the opportunity with the further ramp up in same store price. I think when we saw the tightness in 2014, we thought, \"Well, maybe there's at least two years of good price.\" But, obviously, 2015 volumes have been pretty tough. How do you think that translates into pricing in 2016? Would you say, \"Well, given the weakness in volumes, we are likely to see a deceleration versus the same store price?\" Is that realistic or do you think there's some way that you can just really leverage your position in the market and sustain what's been very good pricing this year?","Michael Ward","Well, I think the key thing is continued service excellence for value proposition with our customers. And that's what Cindy's team is doing a great job here as the resources have arrived to really provide the in-service excellence for our customers. So, we are pleased with the results here in the third quarter in terms of the same store sales. And, as you well know, you will be able to see that each and every quarter, as we move forward, in terms of what we are able to accomplish. But, strong pricing is a critical component of what we're trying to do from an overall value equation. It's one of the key levers we are pulling. And, as we tip to improve our service product, we feel good about what we are going to do going forward as well.","Thomas Wadewitz","Okay. So, it sounds like you don't really want to comment at this point on 2016 pricing, whether it gets better or worse. What about the sensitivity to the truckload market? I think there's been good truckload contract pricing this year, but the spot market has been weak. Is that something you would expect to impact your pricing fairly broadly? Or is that -- would you say, \"Well, that's kind of narrow in terms of impact maybe on 2016 pricing?\"","Fredrik Eliasson","Well, I do think and just going back to your first point, you know, we do look at pricing as being critical in terms of what we are doing and we said this for a long time, strong pricing is paramount to our long-term success financially. That's a key driver for us going forward as well.","Thomas Wadewitz","Okay. So it sounds like you don't really want to comment at this point on 2016 pricing whether it gets better or worse.","What about the sensitivity to the truckload market? I think there's been, you know, good truckload contract pricing this year but the spot market has been weak. Is that something you would expect to impact your pricing fairly broadly or is that -- would you say, well, that's kind of narrow in terms of impact maybe on 2016 pricing?","Fredrik Eliasson","Well, I do think that, and just going back to your first point, we do look at pricing as being a critical component to what we are doing. And we've said this for a long time, that strong pricing is absolutely paramount to our long-term success financially. So, that is a key driver for us going forward, as well.","In terms of the truck market, it's clearly sequential over the last, probably, four to six months, it has gone softer. But you also have to remember that, if you look at where truck prices are today, versus the beginning of last year, they are still up significantly. And we have only been able to touch portions of our contract base. So, I think you know that in our merchandise business, only about half of our business is up on the annual basis. And most of our other businesses, they are mostly 3 to 5 year contracts. We do feel that we will have good opportunities to reflect what the value we have in the marketplace, and with improving service on top of that, we do feel good about our pricing opportunities going forward as well.","Thomas Wadewitz","Okay. Great. Thank you for the time.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Alison Landry with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Alison.","Alison Landry","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Within context of your comments on coal for 2016, and specifically on the domestic side, could you help us think about coal yields within the -- given the variable coal price structure, obviously we saw some impact this quarter, but thinking about 2016, any color there would be helpful. Thanks.","Fredrik Eliasson","Yeah, so in terms of the coal yields overall, not just on domestic, but on the export, if you look at the book of business as a whole, there are three, really, drivers there. One hand we are clearly getting core pricing in that business and we expect to continue. Clearly, the export side is very difficult right now, but on the domestic side, we are getting some good core pricing. On the fixed variable, was clearly also a big driver here in the third quarter, as the volume came down significantly, about 20% of the utility contracts have that sort of structure, in terms of their contractual nature.","And then also lapping, fully lapping the significant pricing declines that we took in our export market in the second half of last year, having fully lapped that was also very helpful as well. So we have three drivers. As we move forward, I think you are going to continue to see the export market being very challenged. And there's little opportunity, if any, to really improve pricing there. But, on the rest of the market, we are going to continue to see what the -- what the value proposition is. And we are going to look, plant by plant, to see what we can do.","Alison Landry","Okay. And then, just on the 20% of utility contracts that have the fixed variable structure, do you have a sense of what that percentage would be in 2016?","Fredrik Eliasson","I don't, right now, see that that's changing materially. But as we go through the normal sort of negotiations, that might change. But, right now, I don't see that changing materially.","Alison Landry","Great. Thank you so much for the time.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes with Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Rob.","Robert Salmon","Hey, good morning. And thanks for taking my question. As a quick follow-up to Allison's question with regard to the fixed variable component. With the domestic coal expected to be down even more strongly next quarter, should we expect coal yields to improve sequentially, even with the lower fuel price? Or is kind of Q3 a pretty good run rate for us?","Fredrik Eliasson","I think, to Tom's dismay, a few questions earlier; we tried to stay away from specifically forecasting our pricing. Mix will always play an impact in it. But, ultimately, the same store sales, I think, is the best way to look at our pricing. So, we are going to continue to do what we can to make sure we capture the value that we provide in the marketplace and then let the chips fall where they fall in terms of what the ultimate number will be.","Robert Salmon","Fair enough. And, Frank, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned, kind of, that you guys were doing some work on a labor agreement and there being, potential savings. Can you remind me whether it was a cost or a benefit we should be expecting in the fourth quarter? And any sort of preliminary thoughts that we can use as we think out to next year for what that means for the bottom line for CSX?","Frank Lonegro","Right. So, publicly, we've announced that we have a tentative agreement with some of our mechanical unions which would imply, if ratified, a slight cost in this quarter, and then benefits as we go forward into next year and beyond, based on labor efficiencies there. But we are not going to quantify that right now, until everything gets ratified by the unions.","Robert Salmon","Understood. And the cost in the fourth quarter? What did you call out in the prepared remarks?","Frank Lonegro","Yeah, we said a few pennies and we bundled a couple of things together, there that are above the line. The union agreement that I just mentioned. And then some of the coal structural things that Cindy had talked about previously.","Robert Salmon","Got it. Appreciate the time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom Kim with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Tom.","Thomas Kim","Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask, on the service side, obviously, we are still seeing some good incremental improvement. But, we did notice that, sequentially, whether in speed or in dwell, the rate of change, or the rate of improvement slowed a little bit. And, I'm just wondering, can you give us a sense on how -- so you are thinking about the trajectory of when your service levels get back close to that 2013 level. And, if you could, frame what sort of cost savings opportunity that presents for us. I think that would be very helpful, thanks.","David Baggs","I think, Tom, we are where we thought we would be on our service measures, as we look at this, about this time last year. We feel like our customers are seeing and feeling that benefit. And we are also seeing, from a performance perspective, reduction in overtime crews and those type of costs.","And it's worth noting that we have accomplished these significant improvements in -- during the same timeframe we have been working very hard on our operating plan to institute our variable train schedules, which has also given us some consistent and valuable productivity, particularly on the T&E side, yet is still giving our customers a very clear and obvious trip plan that they can depend on.","So, I think, as we go forward, we will continue to see some improvement. I don't think it will get quickly back to 2013 levels at all, as we are -- as we are challenged at some locations on the southern part of our network with side incapacity with our longer trains. But we will see incremental improvement and we think we are doing a pretty good job of balancing the service measurements along with the productivity and efficiency side by taking this approach.","Thomas Kim","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Alex [indiscernible]. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Alex.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to just touch on the efficiencies in the quarter.","Michael Ward","It looks like you got about a $41 or $42 million, if I added it up correctly, in the quarter, roughly in line with kind of the first half. Is that kind of 40 millionish per quarter productivity savings something that you would expect to kind of continue, or should we expect it to maybe accelerate into 2016 as service continues to improve? I know there's a lot of moving pieces, but how do we sort of think about that productivity savings and maybe within the context of your the long-term historical productivity achievements?","Frank Lonegro","Thanks, Alex, it's Frank. You are right. We saw a little bit over $40 million in productivity in the quarter and also delivered over $70 million in volume-related cost reductions. Sometimes that gets left out of the conversation, but for the fourth quarter, I think you should you expect a similar productivity level from us that you saw in the third quarter and, again, volume costs ought to come down in line with the volume declines as well. For the full year, as you probably remember, we started the year with approaching $200 million as our productivity target, and throughout the year we helped you understand that that would be more and more challenging as volumes came down and our mix began to change, and we're now targeting the full year 2015 productivity to be approximately $160 million. And, again, that's in addition to the volume right-sizing that we're doing as we take resources as volumes decline.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then I just wanted to clarify a comment on the 4Q guidance. Does the 4Q guidance for EPS to be down slightly year-over-year, is that inclusive of the two items you highlighted as possibly occurring and finalized in the quarter?","Frank Lonegro","Correct.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Hoexter","Hey, good morning, Michael and team. I just wanted to follow up on the coal outlook for next year. You mentioned kind of run rate in the second half. Does that mean we should not see accelerated plant closings or continued conversions in nat gas when you look at that, particularly on the domestic side? I just want to understand Fred's second half outlook. And then just a follow-up on that last question on the charge in the fourth quarter that you've included, does that look at the gain offsetting the cost or can you quantify as one larger than the other? Thanks","Fredrik Eliasson","This is Fredrik. Let me just clarify the coal guidance. There are two pieces to it. One is the domestic guidance where we said that we expect the fourth quarter to be down about 20%, and from that absolute level, which implies in 20% decline, about 21 million tons total for domestic, that that's a good run rate going forward by quarter for 2016. The second half guidance is really related to the export coal market where we said we did about 18 million tons in the first half of this year and implied in the guidance of 30 is that you are doing 12 in the second half. And I think that 12 million-ton, if you analyze that, it gets you to you 24 million tons in 2016. That's a good starting point at this point. They are still in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter. We have a lot of work to do here to see what ultimately gets placed, but our best estimate, just to give you as much transparency as we can on the export side, is that's probably a good starting point for 2016.","On the EPS, Ken, yes, the property sale below the line a nickel and then we have said a few pennies in the combination of the union agreement in the coal structure and I'll let you draw your conclusions from there.","Ken Hoexter","Great. I appreciate the follow-up. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Rick Paterson with Topeka capital Markets. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Rick.","Rick Paterson","Good morning, guys. A question for Cindy. Welcome. Could you update us on locomotive capacity and if there's anything more you need to do there? For example, are there any plans to increase rebuilds beyond 150 or increase next year's new order beyond the 100 currently on the books? Thanks.","Cindy Sanborn","I think where we are with locomotives, our active locomotives have decreased in terms of number sequentially from quarter one to quarter two to quarter three and to accomplish that, we are returning leases and we are also paying back horsepower hours. So those are the outputs, what we're moving out of the active count. We are, as you mentioned, getting new locomotives. We have 65 yet to receive in the fourth quarter and another 65 rebuilds, of which a portion of those are 4X, locomotives for our local fleet. Overall, we intend to manage demand by storing locomotives as the next option to take out any excess that we would have. And you mentioned the purchases in 2016 also that, yes, we are receiving 100 in 2016. But we will manage our locomotive fleet based on demand and obviously balancing that with service.","Rick Paterson","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Seidl with Cowen & Company. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Jason.","Jason Seidl","Thank you, operator. Good morning, gentlemen. Let me start with intermodal first. Can you talk a little bit about the demand side? Because we are starting to hear about pricing expectations in truckload slipping, and given that, diesel prices are near six-year lows. Are you starting to see any weakening on the demand front in terms of conversions out east or is it still staying strong?","Fredrik Eliasson","Well, in terms of the fuel reference that you made there, I think overall it's important to remember that our fuel surcharge on our intermodal business is different than the rest of the business. It really mirrors the trucker. So it really does not come into play that much in terms of what fuel does in regards to how much we can and can't convert. We are still seeing good vibrancy. There is no doubt, though, that at least on a spot basis right now that the truck rates have come down. But on the contractual side continues to have, as far as we can see, a pretty good rate increase on the contractual side, because I think people are cognizant of what will happen longer term, both in terms of driver retention and some of the negative productivity initiatives that the trucking industry is facing. So obviously, we'd like to see it get sequentially stronger from where it is today, but knowing where the contract rates are, and the fact that if you go back a year and a half, rates have come up quite significantly since then on the trucking side. We still feel that it's a good opportunity, both to convert traffic and to continue to have good pricing vibrancy.","Jason Seidl","Okay. Thank you. That was great information, Fred. And if I look out to 2016, you gave us some really good starting points on how to look at coal, I doubt anybody had coal up in their internal models, but we'll have to see how that pans out. How do you look at the rest of the business, given that coal is going to be a drag again? Are you guys going to be able to grow your overall volumes in 2016, based on what you see now in your book of business?","Fredrik Eliasson","I think that's a little bit too early to tell, but clearly with this sort of a significant decline in our coal business, it is going to be difficult to do that. What we are going through right now is our normal planning process and look at the rest of the business to see what we're facing. There are some opportunities for continued growth in several markets. In several markets, though, we are facing both significant volume from last year that gets the year-over-year comps difficult for the rest of this year and perhaps even a little bit into the first quarter. And we are continuing to see the negativism impact on the dollar and the lower commodity prices as well. So as we think about the book as a whole, there is a lot of dynamics that goes into planning for next year, but we continue to feel good about some of the secular things that we are seeing out there like domestic intermodal, for example. So we will have a much better view of that as we get into the fourth quarter and especially as we get to the fourth quarter earnings release.","Jason Seidl","I appreciate the comments and the time, sir.","Fredrik Eliasson","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Troy with Nomura. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Matt.","Matthew Troy","Good morning, everybody and thank you for the time. I just wanted to ask a question on the broader economy. Obviously we're getting mixed signals, but directionally there seems to be a sense that some of the industrial weakness, some of energy commodity weakness has crept in the consumer end markets, beginning in the spring and maybe spread a bit further into fall, early winter. I want to just get your sense, if we strip out energy, how does that consumer economy look? You've got good comments about intermodal, but you guys have been at this for a long time. How does the economy feel to you and where do you think we are in the cycle?","Fredrik Eliasson","Yeah, I think that if you look at some of the core tenants of our economy, such as the housing and the automotive side, you continue to see good vibrancy, obviously growth from a low base in housing and auto being at the peak demand, but continued expectations for growth there. The core chemical business is also doing okay. And then with the lower fuel prices, I think the consumers are feeling a little bit stronger. But then you do have the energy side that you talked about and the fact that if you look at kind of the broad industrial production index, you see industrial production sequentially coming down. And I think the latest number I saw for the fourth quarter was actually that industrial production will actually decline year-over-year. So I think you have a lot of different variables that goes through right now. Clearly, we are very much dependent on the industrial economies. That's a big driver of ours. But at the same time, we do our -- we are getting more and more exposure to the consumer side of things as we continue to grow our intermodal business. That's helping to offset that. So, without saying anything more than the fact that it's a dynamic environment and we are recognizing the industrial side of things are struggling sequentially, we still feel good about our long-term prospects in terms of being able to grow our business.","Matthew Troy","Thanks, Fredrik. And, I guess, one follow up would be -- As you mentioned specifically in your comments in the press release, that you had lost several contracts in international intermodal over the last 12, 18 months. Were there any additional ones in the last quarter? Or are you merely highlighting the ones you've previously highlighted, and the lag impact they had through the quarter. I'm just trying to get a sense if the competitive environment has changed at all. Or is this just a residual impact of contracts we already knew about? Thanks.","Fredrik Eliasson","Yeah, this was the residual contracts we already know about. I think we pointed out, in our second quarter earnings release as well. And, so nothing has really changed from that perspective. We continue to be focused on our network and continue to be focused on the service product that we are producing. And making sure that whatever we carry on our network allows us to continue to reinvest in the business.","Matthew Troy","Okay. Thanks, everybody.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Ben Hartford with Baird. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Ben.","Ben Hartford","Good morning. Good morning, guys and Cindy. Cindy, specifically, can I get your perspective on service and your expectations? Obviously, we are dealing with a weaker volume environment, we have been this year. Next year's outlook is being tapered lower. But, in terms of the pace of service improvement, could you provide any context to what expectations should be next year? And whether there's line of sight to getting back to some of the prior peak levels of 2012, 2013's experience at any point in time during 2016?","Cindy Sanborn","So, as I mentioned before, I think we will continue to see steady improvement in service performance. As far as 2013, I mean, that's certainly aspirational for us. I really can't give you that, at this point. It's a balance of -- of both service, which obviously our customers expect of us. We want that to be very reliable, but we also have to manage the efficiency component of that as well. So, that's kind of the place that we are in and figuring out what -- when we will get back to 2013.","Ben Hartford","As a follow-up, has anything changed -- has the experience, I should say, over the past 18 months, has it changed your confidence in your ability to get back to those high watermarks, as it relates to service?","Cindy Sanborn","I don't think it's changed. I think it's just simply balancing -- making the balancing act in an environment where we are seeing the reduction in volumes that you heard us talk about.","Ben Hartford","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Cherilyn Radbourne with TD securities. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Cherilyn.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Thanks very much. And good morning. Just on the economy, again, there has been some talk that what we are seeing, at least in part, is an inventory correction that's related to the West Coast port disruption. Because, in effect, shippers over ordered when they weren't sure how quickly inventory could move through the supply chain. I'm just curious if that's a dynamic that you are seeing in the marketplace?","Fredrik Eliasson","Yeah, I do think that that's a good point. We are seeing that the inventory levels are coming up. I think we referred to it in our paper market, for example. And as you look at some of the official statistics out there, you have seen an increase in customer inventory. So, that certainly is playing a factor here in terms of the more muted volume outlook.","Cherilyn Radbourne","And then just a very quick one on labor expense. It looks like labor inflation in the quarter was a little higher than you had been expecting. Was there anything of a one-time nature in there?","Frank Lonegro","Hey, it's Frank. Yeah, there sure was. In the quarter, we had inflation of $33 million, which is slightly higher than you are normally seeing. The base wage inflation was normal. We did have a fringe adjustment related to employee furloughs. So, you should expect a more normalized $25 million run rate in the fourth quarter.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Perfect. Thank you. That's all for me.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from David Vernon with Bernstein. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, David.","David Scott Vernon","Good morning. Thanks, guys. Maybe just bigger picture, Michael. As you think about looking for low double digit decline in coal next year, after a mid-teens decline this year. As you think about the earnings power of the business, how should we be thinking about that? Obviously, longer term people have been thinking rails as low double digit growers. This year has been a transitional year of more mid-single. Is next year also going to be setting up as more of a transitional year? Do you think there's a chance that you can get back up to that double digit EPS growth rate?","Michael Ward","Well, clearly, we have the challenges of coal we've discussed pretty extensively here. I think some of it depends on where the economy heads. Because, as you know, over the last two to three years, we have been growing those other businesses faster than the rate of the economic growth. If the economy improves, we think we can do that again next year. If it stays at a moribund rate, obviously, it's much more challenging.","David Scott Vernon","So, in your theory, is there more you guys can do on the productivity side to kind of help offset some of that? Obviously, the core pricing is good; the share gains in intermodal are great. I'm just wondering, obviously, you did a little bit of back office work in Jacksonville earlier this year. Should we be expecting you guys to dig a little bit deeper on that front, as well? Or how should we be thinking about the productivity side for 2016?","Michael Ward","I think you're going to see us extremely focused on the productivity side. You saw evidence of that here in the third quarter, that same intensity we will bring to 2016. And we'll take actions to make ourselves more and more productive going forward.","David Scott Vernon","All right. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from John Larkin with Stifel. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, John.","John Larkin","Hey, good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking the question. I'm fascinated by the strategy to run longer trains by running essentially six trains within a seven day window, where you normally would have run seven trains. How far along is the implementation of that strategy? And then, as a follow on to that question, how long will it take to add enough passing sidings or extend existing passing sidings so that those longer trains don't impinge upon network fluidity and service quality?","Cindy Sanborn","Good morning, John. I think what you will see is we are pretty far along in the adjustments that we are making for longer trains in our merchandise network. We are also, as an aside, increasing the length of trains in our bulk network too. So we are taking -- we are pushing both levers. What is great about the variable train schedule is, as demand requires, we can flex up and flex down. So, I think it will be a continuing effort on our part to match demand in what is traditionally been a fairly fixed -- what we considered fixed network on our carload side. So, I don't know that the answer -- I think the answer is we are probably not ever done, but a principle and preponderance of the work has been done, based on the demand that we are seeing right now.","And I couldn't remember your second question.","Michael Ward","Passing siding.","Cindy Sanborn","Passing siding. So, I think we are evaluating really where we are in the corridors that we need to adjust the length of passing sidings. We are really in the middle of that now. So, there's some corridors that are more impactful to us than others. Obviously the northern tier is mostly double track. What we are going to be working on is in the southern part of our network that is preponderance of single track.","John Larkin","Maybe just a follow on, on the general topic of capacity. Since intermodal is growing quite nicely, particularly on the domestic side, where do you stand with respect to excess capacity in the intermodal network? Can you absorb another 5%, 10% 15%? Where do we start to run into congestion problems and limited capacity issues, as intermodal continues to grow, even in a tepid economic environment?","Cindy Sanborn","I think from a train perspective, I think we have taken advantage of our northwest Ohio expansion and actually have reduced some train-- or increased some train length on our intermodal network as a result of that. But we do have capacity on the trains for the foreseeable volume that we think we will see. And I will remind you, we have done a lot of work on double stack clearances and so forth as well. So, we feel pretty good about where we are there.","John Larkin","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Bascome.","Bascome Majors","Good morning. I wanted to dig in a little more onto the longer term changes you are considering making to your coal network here. And I know you don't want to talk tactically about what's going to happen next year and the impact. And I understand that. But, you did say that everything is on the table. And I'm just curious, the end game three or four years down the road, could you frame, maybe, some metrics that would apply to your coal network today, whether it be related to capital, investment, CapEx to revenue and some of the dedicated parts, or any way that we can think about it and what your goals are for two or three years down the road to change that network and improve, be it profitability or capital efficiency on that part of your network where the revenues are down considerably?","Cindy Sanborn","Well, I think when we look at our -- the coal network, it's a kind of spaghetti branch-line kind of operation with some main lines in between. As we are seeing some of the loaders -- load outs either closing and consolidating, it is our -- we have an effort afoot here to try to figure out where the best efficiencies are. Some of it will be mainline operation; some of it will be facilities. Clearly, the capital investments have been over time not, maybe, transparent externally, but have been, over time, coming down. That will continue to take place. And as we really lose open a particular branch or a particular line volume there; we can also look at repositioning some of the assets into other parts of our network where we are growing.","And back to the siding capacity question that I got a few minutes ago. There's kind of a multifaceted way that we are looking at it, but as you can imagine, it's a very complex challenge because we want to certainly serve the customers that are loading. It is very profitable business for us, and as you probably would recognize, not everybody is on one branch is closing. We have multiple examples of places where we have got some closing, some not, that we have to look at how we are going to serve. So that project is underway, and I probably can't give you more color than that.","Michael Ward","I guess we would add we do expect the Illinois basin coal to continue to grow. As you know, we made an investment last year in what we call our Casky yard, to allow us to move unit trains from the Illinois basin down into the southeast in a much more efficient manner. So it's not just looking at some assets tar less intense but also making sure we are positioned for the future growth.","Bascome Majors","Understood. I appreciate the color. Tying it all together, is there an environment where CapEx could be hitting sort of its cycle high watermark in this year and last at the kind of 2.5 range? Or is it too early to see if that could fall off materially as we look into next year and 2017?","Michael Ward","This is Michael again. I think it's probably a little early to look at that. Obviously, we are still going to be making investments in the base safety and efficiency of our network, but in addition, as we see our opportunities in the intermodal market growing, there will probably continue to be strategic investments there. So I think it's a little early to give you an overall number on that.","Bascome Majors","Understood. Thanks for the time this morning.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff Kauffman","Thank you. Hey, good morning, Mike. How are you?","Michael Ward","I'm doing good.","Jeff Kauffman","Congratulations. Tough environment out there. These are terrific results.","Michael Ward","Thank you. [indiscernible] say that on this call. Thank you for doing so, Jeff.","Jeff Kauffman","Oh, a pleasure. Thank you. A question for Cindy, because a lot of my other questions have been asked. We take a step back and look at how these changes in the environment are changing the network. So, for instance, you are still down about a mile and a half, almost two miles an hour on train speed, but maybe the traffic mix doesn't allow you to get back there. We are still at 204,000 cars online versus 182,000 two years ago before we got the big volume surge. Can you talk about where you are in terms of getting productivity to where you want it to be? And, as you mentioned with the longer trains, maybe that's a drag on train speed and looking back to two years ago, maybe that's not the right metric to think about where you will eventually be. But when we look at train speed and when we look at accidents and when we look at assets online, where do you think we eventually go, say, over the next one to two years as you are looking to get the network where you want it to be?","Cindy Sanborn","So, as far as productivity, we obviously want to be a reliable network and serve our customers, but we are we are probably never satisfied on the productivity side. When you look at velocity and, to your point, take it a step back, we are seeing a concentration of volume on one portion of our network and we are seeing a tremendous reduction in volume on other parts of our network. So you've got a compression there on top of building longer trains that we talked about, which in a single track railroad can be a little bit challenging, at least at the onset, until we make maybe a few investments there. I wouldn't say we have a target with cars online. With volume running well, you don't want that number to ever get to zero. You want to be able to serve your customers and you want to be able to do it efficiently and effectively. I think our viewpoints on going forward, it's probably on the productivity side, the cycle time of equipment, and to a lesser extent maybe the velocity side, although that is an important component in terms of turning assets, but the asset component is really where we'll be spending the most of our time.","Jeff Kauffman","Okay. And, Cindy, this quarter we saw a big jump in on time originations, but on time arrivals still continued to lag. Can you talk about what's causing that friction and when you expect that gap to narrow?","Cindy Sanborn","Yes, and we've talked about that on previous calls that we are seeing the span on our arrivals decrease. And that has continued into the third quarter. So while the absolute number is exactly what with you see, we are seeing the amount of lateness, if you will, go down. And this is occurring as we are doing some tremendous -- I talked about tremendous and significant changes to our operating plan. So we expect that to get to more normalized levels going forward.","Jeff Kauffman","Okay. Everybody thank you and congratulations.","Michael Ward","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Group","Hey, thanks, good morning, guys. Frank, can you just clarify one quick thing? The comment on fourth quarter earnings is the base from last year that you are using $0.49 or is it the $0.52 excluding some of the one-time labor stuff?","Michael Ward","It's on the reported basis, Scott.","Scott Group","Okay. So I see kind of the fourth quarter is going to have really good productivity with labor down 6% or so. Very good pricing, but a big coal headwind and earnings down. It kind of feels like that's the environment for 2016 of good pricing, good productivity, but coal down a lot. What is your confidence that you can grow earnings in a full year 2016 environment?","Michael Ward","Well, I think your summation of the fourth quarter is correct. It's probably too early for us to talk about the specifics on 2016. We have certainly gives you a lot of visibility into domestic and export coal and as we always do, we'll be focused on the things that are most within our control, right sizing the resources, driving efficiency, running a better railroad and value pricing and growing what we can grow with the markets.","Scott Group","Okay. And Michael, maybe just one for you. So we had some unexpected management changes. Maybe give us your perspective on the changes, the new team and kind of what it means for you and your plan and long term at CSX.","Michael Ward","Well, I think evidenced today by the answers you have been getting from this new team we have in place, we have a super team here to drive us forward. I think we've got the talent we need. Our direction as a company is not changing. It's all about controlling the things we can control, growing where we can, and I'm very excited about it. I will be around. I have committed to at least another three years to the board to make sure that we have a good transition here as we work our way through this transition, but I feel very good about it, and I feel great about the team we have.","Scott Group","Okay. Thank you guys.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Cleo Zagrean with Macquarie. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Cleo.","Cleo Zagrean","Good morning and thank you. My questions relate to your targets for a long-term operating ratio improvement. Can you please refresh us on your latest view on how the building blocks for that may have changed, based on your experience this year and your latest strategic update? Where should operating improvement come from most -- price, volume productivity or any other way you would like to describe it to us? And as a follow-up, related to that, how should we think of the mix impact on margins, given that intermodal versus coal continues to evolve? Thank you very much.","Michael Ward","Thank you. In terms of the long term guidance, again, you saw in our prepared remarks and in the press release, we are still confident in our ability to deliver a mid-60s operating ratio long term. I think the drivers are going to be the same drivers that you've heard us talk about over the long term, and those are the efficiency, the service and the value pricing and adjusting our resources to volumes as they tick up and tick down, but we're confident in that ability. In terms the mix, certainly mix will be an impact for us in the fourth quarter and moving forward but that doesn't change our confidence in our future that we will reach a mid-60s operating ratio longer term.","Cleo Zagrean","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Justin Long with Stephens. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Justin.","Justin Long","Thanks. Good morning. So as we think about the pace of pricing over the next several quarters, do you think intermodal price increases will be roughly in line with car load price increases or is there a reason to believe that price increases in one of these businesses will outpace the other?","Fredrik Eliasson","This is Frederik again. I do think we're going to stay away from specific guidance. We are pretty transparent already in terms of the same store sales that we provide you in terms of a look back in the previous quarter. Intermodal is always the most difficult one to get sustained inflation plus pricing, but nevertheless, based on the fact that we haven't been able to touch as many contracts as we would like since the beginning of last year, we do feel good about where we are heading on pricing going forward.","Justin Long","Okay. Great. And maybe a quick last one. I wanted to ask about share buybacks. With the pullback in the stock, I'm just curious if you've considered a more aggressive approach to buybacks going forward.","Fredrik Eliasson","You know, we have considered that. At the same time, we are railroaders and not stock pickers so we've also done some post-audit work on prior programs and really looked at whether or not a rateable approach or a timing approach was better and we are sticking with a rateable approach. So you can anticipate a similar run rate to what you saw in the third quarter.","Justin Long","Okay. That's helpful I appreciate the time.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from John Barnes with RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Hello, John.","John Barnes","Hey, thank you. Hi, Mike. How are you? Hey, Mike, I know you said you are a little reluctant, maybe, to delve too deeply into the CapEx budget. But, your long-term guidance has been in that high-teens percent of revenue. It looks like you are tracking a bit over that this year. Is that the right metric to look at going forward? Or do we need to focus on the absolute dollar amount of capital required in the business? And just how do you think about that guidance going forward?","Michael Ward","Well, John, it's interesting that you mentioned. It may be a better way to look at it, just as the absolute dollars. Obviously, the fuel surcharge revenue is going down. And, as you know, it's not a profit element for us, but it clearly impacts those top line revenues and maybe that percentage. So, I think thinking of it in terms of absolute dollars may be the way we evolve over time.","John Barnes","All right. All right. Very well. And then, Frederick, you talked about the contracts and the intermodal-- I guess, the international side that you lost earlier in the year. Is there anything else from a competitive standpoint, contract-wise that's coming up for bid, that's out there that we should be keeping an eye on, nervous about? Has there been some change in the competitive environment that puts any other business maybe more at risk than it has been in the past?","Fredrik Eliasson","No, I think we continue to be focused on the intermodal side specifically, on making sure that we continue to reinvest in the business. We have a great service product. We have a strong network. We have some very innovative things in terms of what we have done with our hub and spoke system that gives us a network that I think is unparalleled in the east. And as we move forward, we always will have a contract that comes up and we will have some wins and losses over time. The key thing for us, as I said, we've got to make sure that we continue to reinvest in our business. And that's how we judge in terms of how we look at and how we approach contracts.","John Barnes","Very good. Hey, nice quarter. Thanks for taking my questions.","Michael Ward","Thank you everyone for joining us and we'll see you again next quarter.","Operator","This does conclude today's teleconference. We thank you for your participation in today's call.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. During this call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode.","For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. David Baggs, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations Officer for CSX Corporation.","David Baggs","Thank you, Sherlyn, and good morning, again everyone and welcome to CSX Corporation's fourth quarter 2016 earnings presentation. The presentation material that we'll reviewing this morning along with our expanded quarterly financial report and our safety and service measurements, are available on our website at CSX.com under the Investor section. In addition, following the presentation, the webcast replay will be available on that same website.","This morning, our presentation will be led by Michael Ward, the company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Frank Lonegro, our Chief Financial Officer. In addition, Cindy Sanborn, our Chief Operating Officer; and Fredrik Eliasson, our Chief Sales and Marketing Officer will be available during the question-and-answer session.","Now, before I turn the presentation over to Michael, let me remind everyone that the presentation and other statements made by the company contain forward-looking statements. You are encouraged to review the company's disclosure and the accompanying presentation on Slide two. This disclosure identifies forward-looking statements, as well as the uncertainties and risks that could cause actual performance to differ materially from the results anticipated by these statements. In addition, at the end of the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session with the research analysts.","With over 30 analysts covering CSX and out of respect for everyone's time, including our investors, I would ask as a courtesy for you to please limit your inquiries to one question and one follow-up question.","And with that, let me turn the presentation over to CSX Corporation's Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer, Michael Ward. Michael?","Michael Ward","Thank you, David, and good morning everyone. Yesterday CSX reported fourth quarter earnings per share of $0.49, up from $0.48 per share in the same period last year. You will note that fourth quarter of 2016 included two offsetting items. In addition, the quarter included an extra accounting week resulting from the company's 52, 53 week fiscal reporting calendar. This benefited EPS by $0.03 in the quarter.","On a reported basis, revenue increased 9% in the quarter driven by the benefit of an extra accounting week and strong pricing gains that reflect the value of our service products.","Turning to operations, safety performance remained strong, service levels continue to meet or exceed customer expectations, and the company drove nearly $100 million in efficiency gains in the quarter.","As a result, CSX produced $1 billion of operating income and a 67% operating ratio. Both of these results reflect the benefit of the extra week and a gain on a recent operating property sale.","Now, I'll turn the presentation over to Frank, who will take us through the fourth quarter and full-year 2016 results in more detail as well as providing our initial views on the outlook for 2017. Frank?","Frank Lonegro","Thank you, Michael, and good morning everyone. Revenue was up 9% or $256 million versus the prior year driven primarily by higher volumes as a result of the extra week. Total reported volume increased 5% in the quarter, but declined 1% excluding the extra week.","We continue to deliver strong core pricing from an improved service product. Same-store sales pricing for the fourth quarter was up 2.8% overall and 3.2% excluding coal. In addition, fuel recoveries declined $10 million in the fourth quarter, but were more than offset by a $13 million increase in other revenue.","Expenses increased 2% versus the prior year, driven mainly by the impact of the extra week. Excluding the extra week, expense declined 4%.","In the fourth quarter CSX delivered $98 million in efficiency gains and we also recognized a $115 million gain from the sale of an operating property. Further year-over-year expense details can be found in our quarterly financial report.","Operating income was just over $1 billion in the fourth quarter. Looking below the line, interest expense was up slightly from last year, reflecting the impact of the extra week. Other income decreased to $72 million driven primarily by an $18 million gain related to a non-operating property sale in the prior year's fourth quarter.","In addition, we incurred $115 million of debt repurchase expense in the fourth quarter associated with the call of $1.4 billion of debt that was maturing between 2017 and 2019.","Finally, income taxes were $293 million in the fourth quarter with an effective tax rate of about 39%. This included a $10 million unfavorable adjustment related to the apportionment of state income taxes, which impacted EPS by $0.01.","Overall net earnings were $458 million, down 2% versus the prior year and EPS was $0.49 per share, up 2% versus the prior year.","Now let me provide an adjusted view of our full-year EPS. Beginning with our full-year GAAP EPS of $1.81 we have provided the EPS impact of certain items that all occurred in the fourth quarter. You can see that the $0.08 property gain I mentioned previously was equally offset by the $0.08 impact from the debt repurchase expense in the fourth quarter. In addition, our 2016 EPS benefited $0.03 from the impact of the extra week. Excluding the impact of the extra week and the two offsetting items CSX's 2016 non-GAAP EPS is $1.78, which reflects a more normalized base for year-over-year comparisons.","Now let me turn to the market outlook for the first quarter. We expect volume to be flat to slightly up year-over-year in the first quarter, as the industrial economy is stabilizing and energy related headwinds are moderating slightly.","That said, a number of our markets are returning to year-over-year growth in the quarter as we cycle the challenging conditions of early 2016.","As you can see on the slide nearly 80% of volume falls in the neutral or favorable category in the first quarter, while a little over 20% of the portfolio is expected to be unfavorable.","Agriculture and food is expected to grow as the record grain harvest and new customer facilities are expected to more than offset the strength in U.S. dollar and a strong South American crop which curtails the U.S. grain export season earlier than normal.","Export coal will continue to benefit from China's production cuts driving increased demand for U.S. coal. In particular, the metallurgical benchmark has strengthened year-over-year attracting increased production from U.S. coal producers entering 2017. We expect export tonnage in the quarter to be about 8 million tons. For the full-year 2017, we expect export coal to be in the mid-to-high 20 million ton range.","Metals and equipment is favorable as imports moderate compared to last year and domestic steel production increases following successful trade cases. Additional infrastructure projects, increasing rig counts, and wind energy moves, are expected to provide additional volume opportunity.","Intermodal is expected to be neutral. On the domestic side, secular growth will continue spurred by new service offerings and our highway to rail program. However, this growth is mostly offset by domestic competitive loss that occurred mid last year.","On the international side, volumes are also expected to be roughly flat as we just finished cycling prior year competitive losses earlier this month.","Chemicals will be down as the economics of crude-by-rail remain unfavorable. These headwinds are partially offset by higher volume in the fly ash business, which began moving a year ago and ramped up over several quarters to current levels.","Domestic coal is also expected to be down, although we are seeing moderating inventory levels and slightly increased coal demand with winter weather, a shortfall competitive loss will result in lower volume for the quarter. As a result, we expect domestic coal tonnage to be around 15 to 16 million tons for the first quarter.","Overall the industrial economy is more stable and energy headwinds are moderating. However, we continue to face a strong U.S. dollar and low commodity prices which constrains growth in some markets. As we think about the full-year 2017, we anticipate a healthier volume environment. As a result, we expect the combination of merchandise and intermodal to grow on a comparable 52-week basis in line with the economy. In addition, excluding the short haul competitive loss of about 6 million tons, we expect domestic coal tonnage to be roughly flat to 2016.","Turning to the next slide, let me talk about our expectations for expenses in the quarter. As a result of aggressive cost actions taken in 2016, we achieved nearly $430 million of efficiency savings and about $175 million of volume related cost saving. As we turn to 2017, our intense focus on driving cost reductions across the Company is unchanged and we are targeting full-year efficiency savings of more than $150 million.","Looking at the first quarter outlook for labor and fringe, we expect average headcount to be down slightly on a sequential basis. Labor inflation is expected to be around $35 million in the first quarter.","In addition, we expect our pension expense to decrease about $15 million versus the prior year in each quarter of 2017. This reduction is driven primarily by adopting the spot rate accounting methodology for applying the discount rate, as well as the benefit associated with $250 million pension contribution completed in the fourth quarter. The combination of efficiency savings and lower pension costs is expected to more than offset labor inflation.","For MS&O expense, we expect efficiency gains in the quarter to help offset inflation. However, we will also be cycling some positive reserve adjustments, for example, improved safety performance in last year's first quarter favorably reduced personal injury reserves. As a result, we expect MS&O in total to be slightly up versus the prior year.","We expect fuel expense to increase in the first quarter, driven by the higher cost per gallon year-over-year reflecting the current forward curve. This price increase is partially offset by our continued focus on fuel efficiency.","We expect depreciation in the first quarter to increase around $10 million versus the prior year reflecting the ongoing investment in the business. This is partially offset by the favorable impact from an equipment life study.","Finally, equipment and other rents in the first quarter are expected to be relatively flat to the prior year with the benefit of improved car cycle times offsetting higher freight car rates and the increase in volume related costs associated with automotive growth.","Now let me talk about our capital investment plan for 2017. For this year, CSX's total capital investment would decrease to $2.2 billion, which includes about $270 million for Positive Train Control. As you will recall, our 2016 capital investment totaled $2.7 billion which included $307 million of payments in 2016 for locomotives purchased under seller financing and delivered in 2015. As a result, we expect our 2017 capital investment to decline nearly $500 million from the 2016 level and begin returning to our long-term core capital investment guidance of around 16% to 17% of revenue.","Looking at our capital allocation for 2017, you can see that over half of the investment will still be used to maintain infrastructure to help ensure a safe and reliable network. In addition, our 2017 equipment investment is down significantly from the prior year due to the completion of our locomotive purchase commitment. A major shift in our 2017 capital plan from last year is the significant increase in strategic investments which support improved service, long-term growth and efficiency initiatives under the CSX of Tomorrow strategy.","Finally, looking at our investment in Positive Train Control, we have invested $1.8 billion through the end of 2016 and we plan to invest about $270 million in 2017. CSX is on track to meet the legislative timeline for PTC. As we look at the path to achieving this goal, we now believe the total cost of PTC implementation will be about $2.4 billion before any third-party recoveries.","Now, let me wrap up on the next slide. Overall CSX has delivered solid financial performance in 2016 despite a dynamic freight environment that impacted nearly every market. This success was driven by pricing for the relative value of our service, driving record efficiency gains, and aligning resources to the softer demand environment which partially offset the 5% decline in total volume.","To mitigate the soft demand, we took significant action resulting in efficiency savings of nearly $430 million and rightsizing savings of about $175 million. Primarily as a result of these actions, CSX was able to improve its full-year operating ratio by 30 basis points to 69.4%.","Looking ahead, while we still face some specific market challenges from a strong U.S. dollar and low commodity prices, we expect overall conditions for the freight environment to be healthier in 2017. As a result, we expect the combination of merchandise and intermodal to grow in 2017 on a comparable 52-week basis in line with the economy.","As I mentioned previously, domestic coal tonnage is expected to decline again in 2017 on a comparable basis, primarily due to a shortfall competitive loss. Excluding this 6 million ton loss we expect domestic coal tonnage to be roughly flat despite low natural gas prices that continue to challenge the competitiveness of Eastern utility coal.","We continue to see favorable near-term market conditions for export coal and expect mid-to-high 20 million tons for this year. We remain intensely focused on delivering a service product that meets or exceeds our customers' expectations, achieving strong pricing to support reinvestment in the business and driving efficiencies across our entire cost structure. Again, we are targeting productivity savings of more than $150 million in 2017.","With CSX's continued focus on strong pricing and cost control, coupled with a stabilizing industrial economy and more moderate energy declines, we currently expect EPS growth in the low-to-mid-teens for the first quarter. For the full-year, we also expect overall EPS growth in 2017. Of course growth will be stronger in the first half as we cycle our two more challenging quarters from 2016, but we will keep you informed on a quarterly basis as we progress through the year.","Finally, we are reducing our capital investment by nearly $500 million to $2.2 billion. In combination with the higher earnings, CSX will also improve overall free cash flow in 2017 for shareholders.","With that let me turn the presentation back to Michael for his closing remarks.","Michael Ward","Well, thank you, Frank. In the year where the industry faced sustained low commodity prices and a strong U.S. dollar that had broad based market impacts, CSX lost another $470 million in coal revenue and experienced declines in nearly every other market. Faced with these challenging business conditions, the company generated strong financial results driven by decisive actions to produce an all-time record of nearly $430 million of efficiency gains.","Our performance underscores this teams' ability to rapidly adapt to changing economic conditions and the restructuring of the energy markets.","Looking forward, the CSX of Tomorrow strategy drives growth in the more service sensitive merchandise and intermodal businesses. We will achieve this by emphasizing reliable and cost-effective service, realigning our far-reaching network, and deploying additional technology solutions to further improve safety, efficiency, and service.","In addition, the more favorable economic conditions overall, and the prospects for more balanced regulation, coupled with the quality of our network, our team, and our strategy, lead us to expect full-year earnings per share growth in 2017 despite the overhang of the strong dollar and low global commodity prices. Longer-term as we continue the company's transformation we remain committed to achieving a mid-60s operating ratio.","And with that, we'll be pleased to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions].","Our first question comes from Christian Wetherbee with Citigroup. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Hi, Christian.","Christian Wetherbee","Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Wanted to see if you could talk a little bit more about the 2017 volume outlook. Frank, I know you mentioned I think merchandise and intermodal growth in line with the broader economy and you've talked a lot about coal, so that's helpful. But could you give us some sense about how you're looking at the broader economy and maybe what are some of the puts and takes as you think about that merchandise and intermodal business for the full year of 2017?","Fredrik Eliasson","Sure. This is Fredrik. I would say that if we look at our merchandise business, we feel pretty good now across the board in terms of being able to produce growth across essentially all of those markets, and as I said in line with overall -- overall economy. We've seen the economy obviously go through a pretty tough time here on the industrial side in 2016. But as we move into 2017, I think we see a little bit, obviously each year comes, but also little bit momentum here. And so we feel good about what we're seeing on the merchandise side.","On the -- in the national side on the intermodal side, we are done cycling some of the losses that impacted us in 2016 and that will be helpful.","And then on the domestic side, we continue to see the vibrancy that we've seen over the last decade or so being able to grow that market well above whatever the economy produces. So if you add those pieces up, I do think on the merchandise intermodal side that we will be able to grow in line with whatever the economy is going to produce and hopefully it will get little bit of the tailwind that we're feeling right now to continue, may be even little bit better than that. But we'll see where we end up and we'll keep you informed throughout the year.","Christian Wetherbee","Okay. Okay, that's helpful; I appreciate it. And then just wanted to touch on the 2017 outlook for the operating ratio. So great movement on efficiency savings in 2016; you have a target for 150-plus for 2017. How do we think about that in terms of the operating ratio? How much progress do you think you might be able to make this year?","Frank Lonegro","Hi Christian, it's Frank. We should be able to make good progress there. The challenge that we're going to have obviously is when you look at the numbers that we have on a reported basis there are things in there obviously that need to be pulled out in order for us to really look on a comparable basis.","So you saw a two year run sub-70% but each of those years had something in there that helped on the operating ratio side. So we're doing everything we can on the operating ratio certainly on the cost side, you're going to hear from Cindy that she'll do everything she can to pull productivity, Fredrik is going to continue to rely on that improved service product to drive pricing from the top-line side, you see an improving volume environment.","And so with less coal declines that certainly sets us up for a positive 2017. How much progress we make obviously we will give you some transparency as we get through the first quarter and get it before we know how long coal is going to help us.","Christian Wetherbee","But is the sub-70% OR sort of the target for this year?","Frank Lonegro","Well, we haven't really given any OR guidance, it certainly isn't lost on us but we'd like to go three years in a row with it and get it on a -- I'd say a more core basis obviously there has been help for last two years and so it's certainly something that we have our eyes set on.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Tom.","Tom Wadewitz","Yes, good morning. I apologize for any background noise here; I'm in the midst of some travel. But wanted to see if you could comment on the driver of the labor cost savings that ramped up nicely; I think it was $76 million fourth quarter versus $53 million in third. And so, as that -- your total productivity savings for 2017 is quite a bit lower than the big number you achieved in 2016, but the labor is ramping sequentially. So what -- could that labor savings continue to ramp or how do you think about that? And may be if you can relate that to additions of sightings and longer trains. Thank you.","Cindy Sanborn","Sure. This is Cindy. So in terms of labor savings as you referenced at the fourth quarter specifically, we did see some benefit in volume that we did not have to add headcount back one for one and we expect to see that type of impact volume increasing environment.","So what we have seen the past six quarters or so, is volume going down and product and we take -- we right sized a number of expenses specifically with headcount as one of them to reduce our expense. But we've also taken out expense and headcount through structural changes that we've -- that you've heard us talk about as well.","So you think about the structural changes going forward, you reference the sighting capacity and as you talked about that in the past we have to make some investments to continue to drive train length and that is true. We expect to invest in 2017 and 2018 to drive that; we should see some benefits of that in 2018 that you'll actually see in headcount from structural change on train length now.","Having said that, we're always looking for opportunities to improve our expense control whether it's headcount, whether it's fuel, and other areas and we'll continue to do that and certainly with in mind of protecting service for our customers at the same time.","Tom Wadewitz","Okay, great and one for Fredrik, I think we've certainly you can see how the benchmark export coal prices, clean blend, or the API 2 in Europe have gone up. Can you frame for us a bit the magnitude of the benefit on your pricing for export coal in fourth quarter and if it's how much percentagewise they went up or revenue or any kind of broad frame and then do you think that will be a similar impact in first quarter or a stronger benefit in first quarter on export coal pricing. Thank you.","Fredrik Eliasson","Yes. Sure Tom. First of all, we really don't forecast price. Now I think you know that since 2012 when we saw the peak of the market has been coming down, we've been pretty public about the fact that we've both obviously want to continue to optimize the bottom-line for us, but also strategically do what we can in partnership with the producers to stay keeping investors in a very difficult time, which we're obviously going through.","Now clearly the market has come back here a lot faster than a lot of people had thought and certainly we expect the same sort of partnership on the way up as we saw on the way down, there are other factors that come into play than just index themselves. There is a spread between different types of quality of coal. There is also the fact that there is, well the benchmark has going up significantly in first quarter.","The spot market is a very different place. So there's a variety of things that comes into play but overall that partnership that I think we've established over the last few years, we certainly expect it to go both ways.","Tom Wadewitz","So you think there is more sequential benefit in first quarter or similar or you just don't care to comment on that?","Fredrik Eliasson","I don't -- we don't forecast price but I think we've given you the philosophy of how to look at things. I think that pretty much all the visibility, we will -- we can give you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.","Danny Schuster","Hey, good morning, this is Danny Schuster on for Allison. Thanks for taking our question.","Michael Ward","Hi, Danny.","Danny Schuster","We are hoping to dig in a little bit more on CapEx. So, Frank, you mentioned today that the strategic investments are stepping up a little bit this year and I know over the last decade or so you spent around 10% to 15% of your CapEx on commercial facilities. So could you just provide us with a little bit more color on what's in the strategic investment bucket and whether we should expect this level of investment in that bucket to be sustained over the next few years.","Frank Lonegro","Sure. I think to answer the last part of your question around sustained investment in the strategic at roughly the percentage that you're seeing in 2017, over the next planning horizon, I think the answer to that is yes, that is very much aligned with our CSX of Tomorrow strategy. As part of that there is certainly investments in intermodal facilities you've already heard us talk about Pittsburgh that we'll complete about halfway through this year and then you've also heard us talk about the Central Carolina Connector the big hub that we're going outside of Rocky Mount to serve the Mid Atlantic and the Southeast. So you'll see us continue to invest in facilities like that to expand the terminal footprint and be able to expand the existing terminal footprint to be able to handle the increase in domestic business -- that domestic intermodal business that we believe is a big part of the growth story for us longer-term.","Danny Schuster","Great, thank you.","Frank Lonegro","So the other things I ought to add in there, Danny, is when you think about what's in the CSX of Tomorrow investments that you're seeing in that increase to say 25-ish-percent of the portfolio is also all of the network investments and the technology investments that we're looking to make to support, train length and fluidity and long-term growth as well as efficiency and better service for our customers.","Danny Schuster","Okay, okay that makes a lot of sense. And then we were just hoping would you be able to provide us with a little bit more color on the buckets of the efficiency that you're targeting this year. So is there a rough split you could provide us between what you expect in labor and fringe MS&O and the fuel.","Frank Lonegro","I think Cindy and I will tag team this one. I think what you'll find is that generally speaking; the productivity will follow the relative allocation in our cost bucket. So probably more so on the labor side, which is roughly 50-ish-percent of our cost base and then fuel and MS&O will be important, but lesser parts of that and then really it's across the board approach on cost it's certainly, given the size of the operating cost that we have, it's a lot of that falls on Cindy's shoulders but the G&A side also pulls its way to an offsetting inflation every year as well, Cindy.","Cindy Sanborn","Yes, I would say, Frank summed it up, if there is no one area specifically that you're going to see outsized productivity, it's going to be across the board.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning.","Amit Mehrotra","Great. Good morning, thanks for taking the question. So I had a question on mix and margins. Over the last couple years, it's clear that the mix of the business has changed pretty dramatically and you and the rest of the industry have adjusted remarkably well to that. But maybe as we enter a relatively more stable mix environment; maybe see some potential disproportionate growth on intermodal, just wondering how this impacts contribution margins. Could we see structurally higher incrementals in that environment, given the progress you guys have made on the productivity and pricing front? Just help us think about the moving parts there, maybe in a more stable and a controlled environment volume environment. Thanks.","Frank Lonegro","Let me hit the incremental piece and then Fredrik will hit the volume piece. Clearly when business comes back in the scheduled network, whether that's intermodal or we call classed merchandise traffic that set up well given all the productivity efforts that Cindy and her team have done as well as the pricing efforts that Fredrik and his team have done. So what you're seeing is a good setup for incremental margins in those growth areas, when things come back in more the both network things that move in unit train quantities and we're going to add cost in order to handle that business.","Fredrik Eliasson","Yes and similarly what Cindy says in terms of never done, I think we have never done trying to grow the bottom-line whether that's through price, volume or helping Cindy drive productivity gains. I do think that as you look forward the next couple of years and hopefully you are right that we will have a more stable environment especially if we refer to coal, but I do think also that the growth opportunities that we're seeing a lot of that is in domestic intermodal and it's going to have the higher rate or higher volume growth than you would see in some of the other markets.","So you will have a continued mix impact on the top-line but it doesn't always transit is bad thing from a bottom-line perspective because a lot of that growth is going to come into fixed and fixed network where we do have a fair amount of opportunities also to drive train length, we have double-stack clearance and we just obviously we didn't have in the tunnel, a fair amount of automation products as well. So well there is a revenue negative mix, so to speak, it doesn't necessarily mean that is a negative mix from a bottom-line.","Amit Mehrotra","If I can just follow-up one quickly on that, I mean it looks like, in the fourth quarter at least; the incremental EBIT margin was around 38%. But that did include some higher stock comp expense, maybe $30 million or so, above what you were originally predicting. So if you adjust for that, it looks like on an operating basis maybe it was closer to 50%. Would that be kind of the conversion you would expect on any revenue growth, at least in 2017 in the midterm around that 50% level?","Frank Lonegro","I think you're normalizing the fourth quarter in the way that we are as well when we are answering your question about incremental margins in the fourth quarter. Obviously you didn't see the flow-through that you would otherwise have looked for but I think there are some discrete parts in there that once you back those out then you're in the right neighborhood.","Amit Mehrotra","Okay. Let me ask one quick one, if I could, on taxes. I know it's probably a hard question to answer, but obviously this has the potential I guess to be a significant positive to the bottom-line. So you can't answer, obviously, what's going to happen, but if you do get some tailwind on the corporate tax rate, how do you think this plays out? I mean, do you think it gets competed away? How much do you think the keys to the Company? And then I think you have a pretty sizable deferred tax liability that would, I would imagine, get revalued down. And so just trying to understand if you would change any capital allocation decisions given the leverage would look probably better, at least on a book capital basis. Thank you.","Frank Lonegro","Sure. So in the tax proposals, obviously there are going to be moving parts in terms of what is the ultimate rate that applies to corporations as well as how bonus depreciation is going to be handled as well as the expensing of interest. So if you just go all of that through the model and think through what is that imply from a cash flow perspective, it's certainly positive from a free cash flow perspective, we would have to revalue the deferred tax liabilities. But that would be sort of more of a one-time hit as we reset the EPS number based on that that revaluation.","In terms of use of cash obviously, we would continue to apply a balanced approach to capital deployment. We would look hard at capital investments that might be able to; to be pulled forward and certainly we would look at the shareholder return aspects of dividends and buybacks as well.","Operator","Thanks. Your next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Ravi.","Ravi Shanker","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So question on merchandise intermodal pricing; that remains above 3% but has been decelerating a bit for the last few quarters. When do you expect an inflection there? Do you need those markets to come back strongly or do you expect that to react to inflation? Also, if you can share your inflation expectations for 2017, that would be great.","Fredrik Eliasson","Sure. So I will just remind again, we really don't forecast pricing, it obviously has been a tough period, an extended period now from a pricing perspective and lot of excess capacity out there and our challenge to our team is of course to sell through this trough, make sure we sell the improved service product that we have, the unparalled network access that we have and provide innovative solutions to our customers and I think the fact that we, we've been able to do as well as we have I think is a good testament to both the fact that, it isn't value driver of ours and it is also a good testament to the fact that we really do need to make sure to continue to value price to be able to reinvest in the business the way we want to. And so it has been a sequential downtick.","We'll see when it when it turns, I think there's a lot of good things going on as the economy picks up. I think is good thing if we continue to low unemployment that put pressure on the wages. We know that. We see the deal demand is coming into play here as we get into the second half of 2017. So I think things are lining up for better pricing environment as move through the second half of 2017 but it might not fully be where we want to be until we get to 2018.","Frank Lonegro","Ravi on your inflation question I think in the prepared remarks, you heard the $35 million inflation on labor and fringe and there are some pretty key industry drivers as part of that, it's not really on the wage side of things, it's on health and welfare side so medical inflation obviously there's always going to be a little bit, little bit higher than we would like. And then when you think about how we fund the Union side healthcare through an industry trust, we had a surplus in the trust or a couple of years and with all of the headcount reductions that the industry has made with that surplus has been a really evaporated.","And as you also know as furloughed employees go off of the payroll that you get four month of incremental health and welfare coverage that again has the hit to the trust and then fewer employees across the industry, which means you can spread the catastrophic losses over as many people.","So I'd say those are the big drivers on that one, if you were looking for inflation on MS&O and rent I think I would give you, just your sequential run rate from Q4. If you have those in your model for the first quarter and probably throughout the year, you'd be pretty close. And then I think we've given you some guidance on interest and depreciation as well so that\u2019s probably the full wrap on that one.","Ravi Shanker","Very helpful. So just wanted to confirm that you expect pricing above inflation for 2017?","Fredrik Eliasson","I said we don't -- we don't forecast price, we expect strong pricing. All our customers have options and we're going to make sure we price to market. But I think our result speaks to itself in terms of trying to find that interplay between where the customer feels we provide a great service product. And at the same time allows us to reinvest in the business.","Ravi Shanker","Got it. And just one follow-up for Frank. When you said the -- you expect the near-term market conditions for coal to remain favorable, what do you mean by near-term? Is that 2017; is that first half, first quarter? Can you just help define that?","Michael Ward","Can you repeat that question please?","Ravi Shanker","I think Frank said in his comments that he expects the near-term market conditions for coal to remain favorable. Just wanted to get a sense of what near term means.","Fredrik Eliasson","Well, I mean, I think our -- what we've done on the coal side just to reiterate some of the things that Frank said, our view is that as we think about coal for the first quarter we said 15 to 16 million tons for coal on the domestic side. And on the export side about similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter about 8 million tons. And for the full year, we said we will essentially be flat if it wasn't for the competitive loss, so and that is about as stable rate throughout the 2017 year.","Michael Ward","And that's for the year.","Fredrik Eliasson","On the domestic side. And export for the year, mid to the high 20s.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning Ken.","Ken Hoexter","Hey, good morning, Michael. Just, Michael, maybe for you on CSX of Tomorrow, maybe you could help define it. How do you define it? Is this a CapEx program or new network build plan like National Gateway? Is this a CapEx plan that you're going to target? Maybe you can delve into that a little bit.","Michael Ward","Yes, what its mostly dimensional Ken, obviously it's building at the intermodal network as Frank's discussed earlier. It's also looking at our network, we've done some of this, where we deemphasize some of the investment in the less dense lines and we're putting investments in sidings to allow us to run longer trains to some of those key corridors, our primary corridors.","But in addition, we're really working on involving more technology deployment to automate things to make them more safe and so it's really reforming to looking at the opportunities we have are really in the intermodal and the merchandise and we're reshaping the network with that strategic capital to allow us to capitalize on that, so increasing the train length and service reliability on the primary routes, deemphasizing some of the local, but still keeping it safe and high service and investing in intermodal and technology.","Ken Hoexter","Great. And then on -- maybe Frank; have you started to return some of the furloughed employees? I guess when you take your efficiency gains, should we, literally, be taking the $450 million -- or $420 million last year, the $150 million you're looking at and that's your -- you add $0.11 from that into earnings and that was offset by coal this year? Just want to understand how we should put those numbers that you give on the efficiency gains into our thought process for actual cost savings.","Frank Lonegro","Let me take high level and then Cindy will talk about the furloughed employees. When you look at us on a year-over-year basis, you really have to remember that we lost nearly $470 million of coal revenue. So that was a huge impact both from a top-line and the bottom-line perspective. And you look at what we did both on the pricing side and the record productivity that we gain, that's the big story that you see in 2016 on a year-over-year basis.","The furlough count is really something that Cindy keeps an eye on as we look at headcount which was down on a sequential basis and down I think about 3,000 on the year-over-year basis, Q4 against Q4. We're going to continue to look at that. We guided to headcount being down slightly sequentially as you think about the first quarter but that's some that Cindy is clearly focused on and making sure we have both enough resources to handle the expected demand but also that we're doing on efficient basis.","Cindy Sanborn","Yes on a furlough employee's piece, we got about 1,950 people furloughed right now and it's really location by location and still needing to recall, we do recall for attrition, we do seeing normal attrition. We are going to be training some locomotive engineers because that's where we see the most attrition this year. But we will pull people back as we need to and if we end up getting to a place where we don't have furloughed at a specific location, we will try to move people that are furloughed to other locations and then as necessary we will have to hire to tech service. But we look at this closely and it's really hard to be very general about what we recall because some of attrition and then we furloughed some other areas at the same time.","So it's we keep a very close tabs on it and we also do so to keep our employees informed too. We want to know when they're going to return back to work.","Ken Hoexter","So just to clarify Fred's answer there then, even with volumes inflecting and coming back, you're still expecting -- I just want to clarify -- you're still expecting employees to be down on an absolute basis?","Cindy Sanborn","Yes I think when we Fredrik talked about it little bit, when we see volumes coming back in our scheduled network, we have opportunities to add additional cars to trains without adding additional locomotives or people associated with that on a unit train basis, if it were to come back there we may see a little bit more that we need to pull back. But we look at it based on how we see volumes come, where we see volume coming and in what form and then appropriately handle it.","Operator","Thanks. Your next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Brandon.","Brandon Oglenski","Hey, good morning, Michael, and thanks for getting me on the call here. I want to come back to Ken's question on the CSX of Tomorrow, because I think your investors have heard snippets of what this new strategy is. But, first off, does it include a mid-60%s OR target? And then we've been talking about that target since 2011, so about six years now, and we're just scratching the surface of sub-70%. But when I think about some of the headwinds that have been in place the last six years with coal coming down, a lot of mix erosion in your business, doesn't 2017 set up to be a big potential year to show that OR expansion in the business? Because finally we have coal close to flat; you have gotten a lot of efficiency in the network. Isn't this where we can really see the potential of the CSX network? And why not, if that's not the case this year?","Michael Ward","So Brandon yes we still are targeting the mid-60s operating ratio longer-term and you're quite right. We've had that out there for a number of years and we've lost about $2 billion worth of some of our most profitable business during that process. So obviously that delays us giving there is quickly. I mean we love to have that $2 billion back and will be easily in the mid-60s, but that's not reality anymore. So we're going to continue to march, we are not going to predict what the operating ratio will be for 2017, as Frank alluded to, we will continue to keep you posted as the year goes on but we are not going to make a prediction on OR for this year.","Brandon Oglenski","I mean, Michael, is this just a case that it's really not an absolute cost opportunity in the networks? You feel that costs are structurally where they need to be and it's hard to get costs lower; so therefore, we need a lot of revenue expansion on the top-line to get that mid-60%s OR?","Michael Ward","No, we're going to continue to pursue cost reductions. I mean, while we did this year, I think was extraordinary but Cindy and her team and the G&A groups are not going to be relentless in taking cost out. We're certainly going to get at least $150 million this year, obviously we'll strive for more, but as we think about going to that mid-50s operating ratio is going to be a combination of efficiency, volume, and pricing to the value we create for our customers, all three of those levers going to be deployed to achieve that goal.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Ossenbeck","Hey good morning, thanks for getting me on the call. Fredrik, if you can just talk about the competitive loss on coal that you mentioned. Was that modal on price or was it something related to how utilities are sourcing some of their volumes in the New Year?","Fredrik Eliasson","Yes, it was a competitive loss that we believe we lost another railroad; it was relatively short haul, a very short haul business. So I think the tonnage is a little bit more severe than potential the bottom-line impact on it. And that happens. There is business changing hands between us and other railroads on a continuous basis and this one is a little bigger than normal, which is why we highlighted it.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay. And as you think of just pricing and coal in general, and the point-to-point was -- I think it's expected to roll out starting this year, how has that been received in your discussions with customers? And your guidance for volume for the full year, do you expect any of this point-to-point pricing to actually impact your volumes negatively or positively?","Fredrik Eliasson","No, I think the point-to-point price is something structurally that we need to do to make sure that it was more in line with the work that was being done up there and it was -- it was -- it was time to change the way -- the way from kind of these rate district that we had before and it really doesn't impact I think in anyway should perform the amount of volume that we're going to be moving here in 2017.","And I think we also have a lot of contracts that are out there but we haven't been able to implemented in yet but over time we will try to get into all of our -- all of our business --","Michael Ward","We have it in the tariffs.","Fredrik Eliasson","We have it in the tariffs but we haven't been able to touch in all in contracts yet so. It's something that we are doing to the network and through to make sure that is more reflective of the marketplace and the work that is actually being done out there.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay. Sorry, one quick follow-up. It sounds like, just to confirm, we probably shouldn't expect much more rationalization in the coal network this year. Is that correct?","Cindy Sanborn","Brian this is Cindy. We are always looking. I think as we think about transforming our network and network of tomorrow that's something we look at, but to further good point we are going to make sure we serve the customers that are able to load, so efficiently and effectively and where we can make further reductions we will, we think coal, over time, we'll continue to shift and close working relationship between Fredrik and I will be there with structural changes that are appropriate for the time.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Bask.","Bascome Majors","Good morning. I know we're going to see plenty of detail in your proxy in the spring, but I was hoping that you guys could share how the Board has adjusted senior management's longer-term financial incentives to better align with the CSX of Tomorrow strategy.","Michael Ward","They have there is two years ago. I think what we did is we changed, we used to have a major driver of our long-term -- let me go backwards, our short-term incentive compensation is based on operating income as well as that's about 60% of the bonus opportunity with a minimum amount and then 40% is based on safety, service, and strategic type initiatives.","On the long-term incentive plan we for many years, we're strictly operating ratio we now are on the performance piece of blend of operating ratio and return on assets because they thought we really need to focus more on deploying the assets in an appropriate manner that's one of the reasons, besides the change in the marketplace that you're seeing more of our capital going towards strategic initiatives is to increase that overall return on assets. So they're trying to incent us to make sure that where we're really focused on getting a great return on the investments we make.","Obviously, we've always have got some amount of our investments, with capital investments we make or to keep the railroad in good shape, keep it safe and keep it running well. That's going to be 50% or more over time but more and more we're going to push towards strategic investments.","Bascome Majors","I appreciate that color. So it sounds like the changes that we saw last year -- we're not going to see significant changes this year; that was kind of the shift?","Michael Ward","That's correct, yes. One of things when you think about long-term incentive programs Bascome, if you change them too much too often, the employees lose the focus of what is important. So I think the board wanted to keep some continuity and that the return on assets is still an appropriate focus as well as OR.","Frank Lonegro","Bascome it's Frank. I think one of the things you'll see within the annual cycle that Michael talked about where we do have a portion of the incentive opportunity against strategic goals, you will see us making sure that the things we're doing it in a given year to execute on that strategy will be part of the things that we're incented to accomplish.","Bascome Majors","I appreciate all that detail there. And just very high level, it sounds like you may have accrued above plan for 2016. Should we think of incentive comp as a tailwind if we're at plan for 2017 and --? Thank you; I'll drop off.","Frank Lonegro","Bascome thanks. Good question. Yes, you did see us take incentive comp up in the fourth quarter which is one of the misses, I think that several folks had when you look at it on an annual basis, it resets. I think if you're looking for tailwind, if we hit plan in 2017, it's going to be much more back-end loaded than impact in the first half.","Operator","Thanks. Your next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Group","Hey thanks. Good morning guys. So wanted to ask, first, just about the overall yields. We saw nice yield growth in the fourth quarter: mix was positive; coal yields up a lot. Are you assuming, Frank, in the first-quarter guidance, a deceleration in that yield growth and mix benefit? Because it feels like you kind of need to assume a mix -- a yield deceleration to get to the earnings numbers you're talking about.","Frank Lonegro","Well let me Fredrik and I will tag team this one. But I think what you're seeing is in the first quarter as you look at the guidance that we have out there for coal, you're seeing two things happen, you're seeing the impact on the domestic side of the competitive loss but you're seeing sequential stability and therefore year-over-year increase in the export coal. So you got to take that into the mix equation.","And then in terms of the other growth that we mentioned in terms of merchandise intermodal growing in line with the economy, we should see nice incremental margins associated with that. So I don't know that I see any specific mix change that you're mentioning there as we about the first quarter.","Scott Group","I guess I was just thinking like just from an overall -- maybe I asked it poorly. But just from an overall yield growth perspective -- well, to the 4% in the fourth quarter, are you assuming a deceleration from that in the first quarter guidance?","Fredrik Eliasson","Well this is Fredrik. I say that again we don't forecast price and clearly this is a combination of both our same-store sales number and the mix of the business for that given quarter. And so we'll give you transparency at the end in terms of how much was price and how much was mix and so that's, I think that's all the sort of insight we can provide you.","Frank Lonegro","What we try to do was to give you a blended view Scott in the way that we talked about low-to-mid-teens on EPS growth. And obviously that's going to be a combination of things. It's going to be the top-line, it's going to be the expense line, it's going to be a couple of things below line is going to be share count and when you blend all of those things together, you can get to the numbers that we're talking about.","Scott Group","Okay, that makes sense. On the -- so we started to see a little bit of slippage in some of the train speeds and service metrics. Are we at a point where we need to start thinking about bringing back people or broadly bringing back costs at a faster rate, or are you still very comfortable with where service is where we don't need to contemplate that yet?","Cindy Sanborn","Yes, Scott. I think where we are -- I think we are stable, when you look at network performance and when we break it down into our customer see it in the customer facing view our service sensitive business, intermodal automotive is running extremely well. First Mile Last Mile service is also running extremely well. So Fredrik and I are very, very comfortable with where we have service and there is always room to improve, don't get me wrong. And as you look across some of the different measurements there are opportunities there.","I don't see resource adds as a lever that needs to be pulled relative to the measurements, you're looking at. I mean you can get into velocity and it's kind of a mix issue when you think about the growth we have seen in the fourth quarter in colo and grains. Those are little bit slower speed services than the other. So there's a little bit of mix there but we keep our eye on it. We make sure we're looking at payable days per load and other measures that we're still being very efficient and when we need to bring back resources we absolutely will.","Scott Group","Okay. Thank you. If I can just ask one, last one for Frank on CapEx. So I think the $2.2 billion in my model is closer to 19% of revenue. I thought you said 16% or 17% of revenue. I guess I'm just surprised that it's not coming down more, if you I think 2016 you had $300 million of catch-up from 2015 and then you pulled forward $300 million from 2017 into 2016. So I would have thought it would have been down, I know $800 million or $900 million but maybe I'm missing something there?","Frank Lonegro","Yes so when we calculate the percentage of revenue and we give you that guidance, we do what we call it core basis. In other words the PTC expense or the PTC CapEx is an overlay because at some point in time it's going to go way and it's really going to be just part of the -- the replacement cycle that we have on our assets.","In terms of the year-over-year, you're right there was about $600 million in the $2.7 billion for 2016 which was locomotive specific, some of that was deferred from 2015 and some of that was foregoing with seller financing to push it into 2017. So you do have that impact. And I think the biggest driver that you have there is really looking at the inflection of the strategic investment towards the CSX of Tomorrow and that's where you're seeing in on a categorical basis anyway the increase we are being very judicious in terms of how we're investing in the infrastructure.","We're looking very hard at equipment and obviously the longer we can go without buying new locomotives based on all the work you have been doing and all the locomotives that we have taken delivery up in the last couple of years should help us down that path. But you are going to see us on a sustained basis through this planning cycle, make sure that we are transforming this company and transforming the network into what we need long-term.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Jason Seidl with Cowen & Company. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Jay.","Jason Seidl","Thank you. Good morning, guys. I want to focus the first question here on the CSX of Tomorrow and talk about headcount a little bit. Now your headcount has come down drastically, and I don't want to underplay the real-life impacts that has on some people, but looking out, as you guys have adjusted your network and as new technologies come into play, where do you see the headcount going on the railroad?","Cindy Sanborn","I think this is a great question and when we think about some of the structural changes that we've made in train length and in the investments that we're making in sidings on the route from Chicago to Jacksonville allow us to further enhance those efficiencies and reduced headcount.","Another big piece of it the CSX of Tomorrow with the highly automated railroad components around technology deployment. And when I think about that, there are several ways to break that down into predictive analytics which makes us more reliable and more efficient with repairs that we need to make. Automated inspections even machine vision we have some of that deployed in our intermodal business now and looking in some other areas where we can deploy that. And then also when I think about mobility and being able to interact in a more for employees interact globally as opposed to having be to fixed location as well as our customers being able to benefit from mobility technology. So those investments as we make them and they come in, we should see additional reductions in headcount while still maintaining safety and service to our customers.","Frank Lonegro","Jason one other piece of color, I will give you on that, it's Frank is within the guidance that we gave you on headcount, so for example, down slightly on a sequential basis, you would actually if you look at the details, see some uptick in technology hiring as we do things necessary to support highly automated railroad down the road.","Jason Seidl","Okay guys. That's great color. I guess the next one is going to probably bump back to Fredrik, let me ask this a different way. I know you guys aren't going to forecast pricing but given what you know about the current market and sort of the outlook for truck competition, which I think everyone just assumes will naturally tighten as we get closer to the LD mandate, would you be surprised to see CSX pricing below rail inflation anytime this year?","Fredrik Eliasson","Yes we try to stay away from pinpointing exactly rail inflation because first of all rail has been very low over the last couple of years. So clearly, we like to be above that. We think long-term; we have a lot of inflationary pressures that doesn't seem to be working out consistent with what the rail inflation numbers is. We have set 3%, 3.5% is what our rail inflation has been and probably will continue to be depending on what happens with the labor negotiations but hopefully will be lower as we move forward.","But overall, I think the key thing for us is to make sure that we continue to deliver excellent service to our customers, provide innovative solutions, and find a sweet spot where we can also reinvest in the business. And I think you know that pricing is a key value driver for us and it will continue to be as we move forward and where that's going to fall out is depending on where the economy is, where the capacity utilization is we will get, we have to price the market and the market changes from time to time. And as you can see our pricing and if the market tightens that give us an opportunity to capitalize on that as we move forward.","Jason Seidl","Well, I tried; can't blame me. Guys, I appreciate the time, as always.","Michael Ward","Good try, Jason.","Operator","Thanks. Your next question comes from Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Cherilyn.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Thanks very much and good morning. So productivity clearly a highlight of 2016, can you talk about how much of the $430 million was structural and give us some color on where you manage to find opportunities to exceed the target that was updated as recently as Q3?","Cindy Sanborn","Good morning, Cherilyn. Thanks. Yes so when you look at 2016, think of productivity of the $430 million and above in two -- in three buckets. The first bucket about $100 million was structural that was primarily in the coalfields but we did also find some structural changes we can make in our merchandise areas.","Then when I look at the next bucket of about $150 million, it was in train length and being able to be more efficient it's structural in nature, but to be able to be more efficient with train size and other initiatives along those lines. And then the last $150 million, if you will, would be about relative to traditional productivity and initiative based type actions that we're going to take including technology and other enhancements and probably that's a little bit higher than $150 million to get to the $430 million.","You asked a question about the fourth quarter, specifically. Could you re-ask that one again to make sure I got that right?","Cherilyn Radbourne","Well if I memory serves, the productivity target as of Q3 was $400 million, so to finish up with $430 million is kind of nice performance relative to that most recent targets.","Cindy Sanborn","Yes I think there as we were coming into fourth quarter, we actually were able to enjoy some volume that we did not have to replace one for one on in terms of any resources, we did actually pull out some locomotives out of storage in the fourth quarter but the volume helped us be able to continue to perform with productivity.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Great. And then just a quick one on the revenue side. I'd be curious about your thoughts on the new shipping alliances due to start up this spring. Does that impact visibility on the international intermodal side at all?","Fredrik Eliasson","We obviously follow very closely what is going on right now in the steamship line business, it is -- it is a very difficult time the lot of realignment. We do have our customers that we are aligned to very fortunate that most of them are very strong. But we will see how this plays out there is additional rumors out there, but it's variety of different potential transactions and as they fold out -- as they're developing we will have a better sense of what the impact is on CSX.","Operator","Thanks. Your next question comes from David Vernon with Bernstein. You may ask your question.","David Vernon","Hey, good morning everybody. Thanks for taking the time. First question is around the moderation or deceleration in earnings growth towards the back half, is that just the lapping of some of the productivity in the train length initiatives or is there something else going on there in the cost side that we should be we thinking about?","Frank Lonegro","I think it's simply the costs that we have, when you look at the quarterly EPS from 2016 and you think about how that would normally adjust throughout the year. That's really what we said. But obviously we're going to give you; we gave you good guidance on Q1. And as we did throughout 2016 given the dynamic environment that we're in, we are going to keep you updated and obviously if we can update those numbers for you as we get through the quarter we will do that.","David Vernon","All right. And then maybe just thinking longer term, obviously, the -- I'm just wondering if you guys are thinking any more optimistically about the possibility of moving from two- to one-man crews in some of the operations. And if you've done any work to scope out what it would cost to implement that and what some of the benefits could be, or if maybe it's just still too early on the regulatory front.","Michael Ward","Well clearly as you look out technology is evolving David, there is going to be autonomous vehicles out there. There is no question, the only question is when and how much they will be deployed. And if you think about us putting the Positive Train Control system in place, which we will have in place as required by law. One does have to question why there needs to be two people on the crew when you have that kind of safety overlay in there. So over time, I think that will be an issue. I don't think it's in the near-term, but longer-term, that's certainly something we're going to have to address.","Frank Lonegro","And David from a model parity think about sort of policy perspective here and you think about the dollars that are being provided into the autonomous vehicle space whether it's governmental or private investment, I mean we're looking for that same concept to prevail as Washington re-looks at policy decisions going forward.","David Vernon","Yes, that's kind of the heart of what I'm trying to get at. When you think about a modal competition standpoint and intermodal, obviously truck price will get a huge benefit from autonomous vehicles. I'm just wondering if you think you can offset that in the same way or if you think there is some sort of longer-term disadvantage that may accrue from that.","Fredrik Eliasson","I think it's something obviously will have to be negotiated with our Unions that will be a challenge -- challenging negotiation. But I think if you look inevitably as the competition dictates the need to do that and there is a safety overlay called PTC in place, we have to make sure that the public is protected. I think it's inevitable; it is just a question of when.","Operator","Thanks. Your next question comes from Jeff Kauffman with Aegis Capital. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Jeff.","Operator","One moment please and Jeff your line is open. You may ask your question.","Jeff Kauffman","Okay, thanks. Good morning, Mike. How are you?","Michael Ward","Jeff, thank you.","Jeff Kauffman","Thank you. Congratulations. A lot of my questions have been asked, so I want to kind of circle back to coal and how that mix is going to move around a little bit. With nat gas up where it is, we are getting a lot closer to Eastern coal being in the money. I know you mentioned the utility short-haul loss. So when I sort all through it, we've got some met coal that's coming online and that should be more favorable, despite some of the international prices retreating. Outside of the utility customer loss, it feels like utility coal inventory is coming down, shaping up a little bit, and it feels like there should be a positive mix effect in coal, because you're losing some short-haul business, you're gaining some met. Can you talk about how you're seeing the coal business? And normally, you guys give an idea of where customer utilities are, so your northern region versus your southern region. Just kind of update us on how to think about the yields in the mix and where the inventory levels are in your service area.","Fredrik Eliasson","Sure Jeff. There's a couple of different questions in your question but let me see if I can address most of them. So as we -- I've seen here over the last couple of months, the summer months were very hard and allowed for a beginning of drawdown of some very high inventory levels. And as we look at them right now, they are down significantly year-over-year probably slightly above target both in the North and in the South but have made significant progress over the last few months. So that is helpful.","In terms of natural gas prices, you're right we're seeing significantly higher than what we saw last year. So that's a good thing. We, I think we've said publicly many times that we need about 350 or so for the first half of our portfolio to be in the money that that is being sourced from Illinois Basin and Western Sources and so we're getting, we are pretty close to that and utilities are making rational economic decision on a daily basis in terms of which utilities they are going to dispatch and we're seeing the impact of that year-over-year.","We got off to pretty cold winter in December, it has moderated here the first few weeks in January, but based on the preliminary numbers that we have seen so far this year, we are being dispatched little bit higher than we were last year which I think is a reflection of the natural gas prices. So we do feel much, much better than what we felt going into previous years about our coal businesses, as Michael alluded to close to $2 billion of revenue loss over five-year period. We do think our domestic business; with the exception of the short-haul loss will be pretty close to flat. Clearly that can change as we go throughout the year, if we have a mild summer that could change to the downside and if we have a hot summer that can certainly change to the upside, which is also one of the reasons why as we think about the second half of the year. So it's too early right now to give you too much more guidance that we provided. But we are just trying to give you the best guess based on normalized summer.","And then on the export side, we are, I have seen an incredible uptick here over the last six months, the forward curve is pretty clear that indicates that things will come back down as we move through the second quarter and into the second half and the spot market has already reflected that versus the very high benchmark that we saw. But there is no doubt that the coal business is in a much different place as we enter into 2017 than it has been the previous couple of years.","Jeff Kauffman","Okay, and just one follow-up and I'm done, because I know we're running over. On the yield side, could you help us think about how to look at or think about modeling yields given some of the mix changes going on in your coal base?","Fredrik Eliasson","Yes I think that as you said the short-haul business will obviously help RPU as we go in to 2017. The fact that we don't have that anymore. We did have some pretty significant uptick in the yield there in the fourth quarter. Part of that is the fact that there was some sourcing changes that actually added to the length of haul and also the fact that some of the utilities started to rebuild inventories a little bit more aggressively than they've done before. While on average, they're above there are certain utilities that needed additional coal and that helps the yields as well.","And then on the export coal side, clearly as we've said when the benchmark is high, that helps our RPU but as we go through the year it is not impossible that that help will go the other way and will actually RPU as we move through the year. But that really depends on where the benchmark ultimately ends up.","Operator","Thanks. Your next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks; good morning. In the chemicals segment, could you please discuss the expected drivers of non-energy growth in 2017? And then also the potential for growth in crude volumes and how you think about the cadence of growth in the segment over this coming year? Thanks.","Fredrik Eliasson","Sure. So the good markets to begin with that piece which isn't our chemical business, we have seen a nice run up and now a nice run down and we are at the point now, we are running into fourth quarter less than a train a day of crude-by-rail. So it's going down significantly and as we it's hard to predict what is going to be in 2017 but it's also very difficult to see that it's actually going to move up meaning that if anything I think the bias is towards less crude based on where we see the crude prices and the spreads.","If we look at the non-crude piece of our core so to speak, our core chemical business, I think we continue to see that industry doing very well based on the feedstock advantage that they have versus the rest of the world. So lot of investments have been made over the last couple of years and from our perspective we expect slow modest growth in that space as we move through 2017 and may be 1% or 2% I think is the official forecast.","And then the other piece that we of course have is the input side to the energy side, the frac span and LPG and that also depends a little bit on where natural gas prices will be, if they stay strong that usually leads to additional input, if they go down that also could put pressure on that. But as we said right now we seem to be in a little different place than we would be in the last couple of years.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks very much. And then real quick, Cindy, with regard to the products or the efficiency savings, how should we think about the cadence for the year? Consistent with the EPS cadence or maybe something different? Thanks.","Cindy Sanborn","It will be fairly ratable across the whole quarters, it won't be any one, any one quarter or any one area or time that you will see higher.","Operator","Thanks. Your next question comes from Justin Long with Stephens. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Justin.","Justin Long","Thanks, good morning. So I wanted to ask about export coal first. Could you give some more color on the split between contracted volumes and spot volumes that you're assuming within that full-year tonnage guidance? And in addition, could you talk about the split you expect between met and thermal?","Fredrik Eliasson","Sure. Essentially because of the volatility in the marketplace over the last couple of years, everything is spot. There is a few pieces of business that is on more than a quarterly basis, so it could be up to annual basis but essentially all of it is quarterly. So when we give you that guidance it's best in our best case based on what the customers are telling us and the visibility that they have and we obviously triangulate that with some other sources.","In terms of the split traditionally it has been around 70:30 in favor of met over the last couple of years to fourth quarter, we did have some opportunities to move some thermal into Europe because of nuclear shutdowns in France specifically that was very helpful. We'll see how much vibrancy we haven't in 2017 but the split came to 60:40 in the fourth quarter and as we but as a the best prediction right now, I would probably say it's close to that 70:30 as we think about 2017.","Justin Long","Okay, great. That's helpful. And secondly, I was curious if you could comment on how much of your book of business for 2017 is already repriced at this point. And I know you don't give specific guidance on pricing, but just to get a sense for your high-level directional thought, given the visibility you have, does it feel like the pricing environment has likely hit the bottom and the rate of increases should improve over the course of the year? I think earlier you referenced the second half potentially being a bit stronger.","Fredrik Eliasson","Sure, let me just tell you on an average, we probably have about a third of our book of business that we can touch. If you think about auto intermodal to generally three to five years coal and exports are obviously, we set a spot but the utility side, two to four years something like that. And then on the merchandise business probably little bit over half and annual and the rest are two to three year contracts, generally. So that gives you about a third of the business that you can touch each and every year.","The significant portion of that is either coming up at the beginning of the year or the mid part of the year and with the majority of that coming in the beginning of the year or I guess the end of the year technically. And so we've done a fair amount of that third already. And as I said I'm not going to get into specific details on it, but we're going to continue to price to the market and we alluded to before, we think that the truck market will get into better place as we move through the year for the right of fact, if you mentioned earlier driver wages should have a pretty significant pressure on it.","We do think that the ELD mandate will have an impact as we get through the second half and we also think the economy is going to grow new construction or new build of trucks is down, I think about 35% to 40% year-over-year. So that is also helpful in terms of the fleet itself and then so absolutely throughout the year we hope that after having been a little bit of tougher period here for the last 18 months or so, that will get to better place.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Walter Spracklin with RBC. You may ask your question.","Walter Spracklin","Hi, thanks very much. Two quick questions, both for Cindy here. One on CapEx. I know, Cindy, you talked about the evolving mix change in your CapEx, where it's coming down, yes, but it's also -- the constitution of that CapEx is changing significantly as you convert some of your PTC and perhaps some of your coal spend into new technology. You alluded to a few predictive analytics, mechanical division and so on. My question is how soon could we see the benefit of those? And if you were to rank a couple that are expected to bring in the highest return, what would they be in and, again, how quickly could you see that impact your earnings in the next few years?","Cindy Sanborn","I think, Walter I think when we look at these investments and particularly the one around longer sidings for longer trains. It's going to be 2018 before we really see that. So that is the long route that we need to re-sequence how we operate it based on longer trains in either sighting extensions or actual additional sightings. So that's a pretty good one that we see upcoming.","On the technology side, there's investments we're making now for this year that we'll see the benefits that are already in our plan are part of our -- our initiatives that we -- that we have in 2017. And of course we're building a longer and more broader sheet of longer-term benefits that we have to build core infrastructure processes within the technology space to then build on and layer on additional opportunity. So and it is across the board, both from a customer facing piece as well the productivity piece and I cannot underemphasize overemphasize safety and not this is all helping us to be a safer railroad. So that's probably that the best color I can give you, Walter.","Walter Spracklin","And would you characterize any of these investments as purely CSX developed are these kind of supplier things that suppliers are brought into you as opportunities that might be available to your competitors as well.","Cindy Sanborn","I think it's a mix when I look at, for example in fuel, when I look at fuel management technology which is supplier driven, it certainly open to the rest of the industry.","We've implemented that and are continuing to see benefits from that. And then there's other technology that will be in-house that are part of our own core systems that will help us be more efficient, that will be more CSX centric so difficult to put a split on that , but it is -- it is a mix.","Walter Spracklin","Okay. And then my last question here is on capacity, certainly you have been growing your revenue well in excess of your growth in expenses and part of that productivity certainly some of it may be some use of available capacity. If you look at the capacity in general on your network I guess the question comes, how much more growth, can you achieve where expenses will lag that growth before you get to the level where really the expenses catch-up, is there, is there any sense you have of that run rate of growth ahead of you that can comment that obviously expanding margins before you run into some capacity constraints.","Cindy Sanborn","Walter if I say when you think about on a carload basis and our scheduled network, we have plenty of room to grow, particularly between Chicago in the northeast in the Northeast and Florida. A little bit of a cha -- more challenge because of the siding impacts or siding constraints between Chicago and Florida although I will tell you that our variable training schedule concept when we built the longer -- larger train by running changing from a 24-hour dispatch to a 28-hour dispatch.","We can now go back to 24-hour dispatch and at a train a week as opposed to a train a day as we run against additional volume. So there are great levers on that side that we can pull, no matter what route we would use.","On the unit train side, there would be more that we would have to bring on to support the unit train growth but those are very favorable margins that we would -- that you would want us to do and so it's a bit of a mix based on how traffic comes on. But I feel really comfortable with looking out into 2017 and thinking about volume growth again that we will be able to be very, very efficient with our resource intensity to support volume.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research Partners. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning Brian.","Brian Konigsberg","Yes, hi guys, good morning, thanks for taking the question. I know this is running long here so just a couple quick ones. Just on -- so on intermodal, maybe can you just give us an update and characterize the level of competition you're seeing? Obviously, it's been a tough 12 to 18 months there. With the prospect of firming conditions, at the margin at least and perhaps getting even better later in the year, has the competitive dynamic softened a little bit or is it still very tough out there?","Fredrik Eliasson","Yes so, I would say that in the fourth quarter, we did see the spot market tighten a little bit, certainly not where it needs to be, but we did see a little bit of a reversal there from the previous few quarters and that's an encouraging sign. I don't think that you're going to get to a significantly better place until you get into that second half of 2017 and probably into 2018.","Now having said that, we've been able to grow our domestic intermodal business for over a decade about 7% clip each and every year. Last year was a little bit lower than that, partly because of the market, but also because of the competitive loss. As we think about 2017, I think we're comfortable to say that we're going to return to that kind of 5% to 10% domestic intermodal growth despite the fact that the environment is a little bit more challenged and we would like to see long-term and I think as a testament to the investments we made, the service improvements that Cindy and team has done new terminals opening up continue to work with alignment with some of our channel partners, and so we feel pretty good about where domestic intermodal businesses going into 2017 as well.","Brian Konigsberg","Great. That's helpful. And secondly just coming back to the commentary about labor costs and the majority of the inflation related specifically to health and welfare may be this is a little bit hard to answer, but obviously there is a lot of debate right now with the Affordable Care Act. If that does in fact get adjusted could that have potential impacts on the outlook for inflation or is that not applicable.","Frank Lonegro","In our context it's not applicable, given the way that our industry, industry trust is set up to handle health and welfare claims from the Union employees.","Brian Konigsberg","Understood, great. And if I -- one last quick one. Are there any potential property gains that we could expect in 2017?","Frank Lonegro","We always have real estate owned market. Nothing that would compare to the last two years, one was an operating property gain this year and non-operating property gain last year. We try to provide visibility to the bigger ones. There is always going to be a little bit here there that we have on the market and happens. But we will certainly keep you posted, if we have anything big.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Donald Broughton with Avondale Partners. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning.","Donald Broughton","Good morning, good morning gentlemen. Let me ask the CapEx question a completely different way. Help me think about how you strategically think about the ebb and flow of CapEx. I mean, in my mind, isn't it in the long term strategically isn't it long term cheaper to spend more money on CapEx during periods of lighter or less traffic? And isn't it -- doesn't a more well-invested, better maintained infrastructure make achieving a lower OR on a sustained basis more achievable? And if so, why aren't you taking the current lull in demand as an opportunity to increase CapEx instead of decelerating it?","Frank Lonegro","Well let me try to tackle the question in a couple of different ways. In terms of the CapEx that's deployed in any given year, the amount of work associated with that CapEx can change depending on how much volume is on the railroad. When you look at 2015 and 2016, we got a lot of work done for the money that we had especially on the infrastructure side. In addition to the volume levels, all the work that we did on train length and reducing the number of active trains that we had out there gives our engineering forces the ability to get more work done. We saw some good work by procurement department and really looking at how they can leverage lower cost environment that drives CapEx savings on the materials which again allows us to get more work done.","So beneath the coverage there, there actually is a recipe that is really aligned with what you're talking about. On the equipment side of the house, it really is going to depend on what types of traffic we have, what are our storage levels on equipment and both on the locomotive side and the freight car side. But what you're seeing us do is really strategically invest to transform the company and the network and the service products much more aligned with revenue portfolio that we expect in the future, which is very different than the revenue portfolio we've had for the last 10 years.","Michael Ward","And Donald we don't dramatically disagree with your theory, if you look back to the recession of 2008 and 2009, we kept our capital spend up during that period for the very reason as you have noted which is not defer maintenance, it is continue to maintain and be ready for upswings. So I think theoretically you have a valid point there.","Donald Broughton","So if maybe sure I heard what you just said, I think I just heard you say yes you're right to a certain degree, you have already done that over the last year or so.","Michael Ward","We have had a very consistent capital program especially during downturns, which is a change in the past many times when there is a downturn, you would cut back on your capital, we don't think that's the right thing to do. We think maintaining a pace, both in good times and bad times allows us to better utilize deploy the capital or see we are changing some of our orientation towards more strategic now to try to improve the return on assets. But theoretically we try to keep a fairly constant 16% to 17% of our revenues as a measure.","Michael Ward","Thanks everyone. We appreciate your attention. We will see you next quarter.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation in today's call.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. During the call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode.","For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. David Baggs, Vice President of Capital Markets and Investor Relations for CSX Corporation.","David Baggs","Thank you, Marianne, and good morning, everyone, and again, welcome to CSX Corporation's first quarter 2013 earnings presentation. The presentation material that we will review this morning along with our quarterly financial report and our safety and service measurements are available on our website at csx.com under the Investors section. In addition, following the presentation this morning, a webcast and podcast replay will be available on that same website.","Here, representing CSX Corporation this morning are Michael Ward, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Clarence Gooden, Chief Sales and Marketing Officer, Oscar Munoz, Chief Operating Officer, and Fredrik Eliasson, Chief Financial Officer.","Now before we begin the formal part of our program, let me remind everyone that the presentation and other statements made by the company contain forward-looking statements. You are encouraged to review the company's disclosure in the accompanying presentation on slide two. This disclosure identifies forward-looking statements as well as risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance to differ materially from the results anticipated by these statements.","In addition, let me also remind everyone that at the end of the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session with the research analysts. With 30 analysts covering the CSX, I would ask as a courtesy for everyone to please limit your enquiries to one primary and one follow-up question.","With that, let me turn the presentation over to CSX Corporation's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Michael Ward. Michael?","Michael Ward","Well, thank you, David and good morning everyone. Last evening CSX reported record first-quarter earnings per share of $0.45 with another excellent productivity performance by the team and a couple of unique items that helped the quarter. The underlying strength of our business continues even with the transition that is taking place in the domestic coal market.","Looking at the top line, revenue was $3 billion essentially flat versus last year with gains in merchandise, intermodal and other revenue offsetting the declines in coal. The operating team is producing industry-leading results in safety and is driving excellent service and efficiency for our customers and you, our shareholders. Bottom line we set record first-quarter for operating income at $875 million and for operating ratio at 70.4%.","We also issued new financial guidance reflecting our confidence in the future and rewarded shareholders with another increase in the quarterly dividend and a new share repurchase program. As the team walks you through the results this morning, I think you will see evidence of a company that is doing very well in the current environment and is well-positioned to achieve even greater results longer-term as the economy eventually accelerates, the domestic coal market begins to stabilize and the industry fundamentals continue to evolve.","With that let me turn the presentation over to Clarence to review what we are seeing in the broader economy, how this relates to our top line results and more importantly what this means for the outlook ahead. Clarence?","Clarence Gooden","Thank you, Michael, and good morning. Looking at the key economic indicators that continue to point to a slow steady growth in the U.S. economy. Starting on the left side of the chart, the purchasing manager's index registered a rating of 51.3 in March reflecting a modest expansion of U.S. manufacturing. At the same time, the customer's inventories index registered a rating of 47.5 indicating respondents believe their inventories are still slightly below normal levels.","Looking at the right side of the chart, both GDP and IDP rates reflected expansion in the quarter. Forward projection show continued slow growth in the near-term with improved growth rates later in the year. Overall, transportation demand in the markets we serve was mixed in the first quarter, consistent with the broader economic environment.","Now, let's look at overall revenue. Total first quarter revenue of nearly $3 billion was essentially flat compared to the prior year. Starting to the left, the combination of rate and mix was favorable by $28 million in the quarter. Here, core pricing gains and liquidated damages, which increased $32 million year-over-year, were partially offset by the unfavorable mix impact related to the growth in intermodal versus the decline in coal.","Moving to the right, volume had an unfavorable impact of $39 million in the quarter as volume growth in chemicals and intermodal was more than offset by declines in coal and agricultural products. Finally, fuel recovery increased $3 million in the quarter as diesel fuel prices were relatively stable year-over-year.","Now, let's turn to pricing. Core pricing on a same-store sales basis remained solid across nearly all markets. Recall that same-store sales are defined as shipments with the same customer, commodity and car type, and the same origin and destination. These shipments represented 76% of CSX's traffic base for the quarter.","Looking at the chart, overall pricing shown on the blue bars, increased 0.3% in the first quarter which reflects the more challenging export coal market. The gold bars, which exclude export coal, show pricing gains of 4.1% in the quarter exceeding rail inflation and consistent with the performance in prior quarters. Looking forward, a strong service product provides a solid foundation for pricing above rail inflation over the long-term. Given our confidence in the value of our product offering and the need for the ongoing reinvestment in the business, we remain focused on profitable growth.","Let's turn to the next slide and take a closer look at the volume. Total volume declined 2% in the quarter versus the same period last year, the mixed performance across the diverse markets we serve. Intermodal and the industrial sector delivered solid growth in the quarter. High service levels helped generate growth in domestic intermodal markets and capture opportunities in domestic manufacturing in the growing oil and gas industry. Growth in these sectors was more than offset by declines in the construction, agricultural and coal sectors, where market fundamentals remain challenged.","Now, let's look at the individual markets in more detail starting with coal. Coal revenue declined 13% to $726 million. Although the demand for electricity grew and natural gas prices rose at the end of the quarter, domestic volume declined 14% as inventory levels at the utilities remained high. Export coal volume declined 3% as demand for thermal coal softened, particularly in Europe, where broader economic conditions remained weak. Total revenue per unit was down 3% as lower export pricing more than offset core pricing gains in the domestic markets.","Looking ahead, domestic coal headwinds persist, although we expect volume to be relatively stable on a sequential basis. For the full year, we continue to anticipate domestic volume will decline about 5% to 10%. At the same time, our best estimate for 2013 export coal volume remains about 40 million tons and year-over-year pricing decline should moderate throughout the year.","Next, let's look at merchandise. Overall merchandise revenue increased 2% to over $1.7 billion. Chemicals was the key driver in the industrial sector growing 11% on strength and energy related products, including crude oil, liquefied petroleum gas and frac sand. In the agricultural sector, feed grain shipments to the Southeast were lower as a result of last year's severe drought in the Midwest. In addition, ethanol shipments declined as a result of lower production, increased competition from imports and lower gasoline demand.","Regarding the construction sector, building products and aggregates increased on the strength of a slowly improving housing environment. However, this was partially offset by lower shipments of paper products as the use of electronic media continues to replace paper. Looking at the second quarter, in the industrial sector, we continue to see growth opportunities in chemicals, particularly in commodities related to the oil and gas drilling.","The automotive market will remain strong although we are now cycling tougher comparables. We expect the agricultural sector to remain soft with lower grain shipments and continued weakness in ethanol, more than offsetting increased fertilizer demand. Finally we anticipate a slow steady recovery in the construction sector will drive growth in building products and aggregates.","Moving to the next page, let's review intermodal. Intermodal revenue increased 4% to $404 million. Domestic volume was up 5% driven by growth with our existing customers and highway to rail conversions. International volume was essentially flat as growth with existing customers and from new service offering was offset by volume lost due to a carrier port shift. Total intermodal revenue per unit increased 1% due to core pricing gains.","Looking forward, we continue to make strategic investments in our network that drive profitable growth. During the first quarter, we began work on a new terminal in Valleyfield near Montr\u00e9al. This terminal will expand our network reach and when combined with the capabilities of our Northwest Ohio hub, will allow these service offerings to drive growth. In addition we began an expansion of our Fairburn terminal in Atlanta to support robust growth in this key market.","At the same time, we continued to generate growth opportunities through our highway to rail or H2R initiative. We are working jointly with our channel partners to market the compelling value of intermodal rail transportation to targeted customers and further tap into an estimated 9 million truckload opportunity.","Let's turn to the outlook for the second quarter. Looking forward, we expect stable to favorable conditions for 86% of our markets. Although the overall volume outlook for the second quarter is neutral, we expect continued growth in chemicals as we capture opportunities created by the expanding domestic oil and gas industry. Intermodal growth will continue at a similar rate in the second quarter as our strategic network investments and service reliability continue to support highway to rail conversions. In forest products and minerals, we expect a continued recovery and demand for construction and building materials.","Automobile and light truck production will remain strong but year-over-year comparisons are now more difficult. Although headwinds persist, the outlook for domestic coal volume in the second quarter is neutral due to easier year-over-year costs. We still expect the full year volume will be 5% to 10% lower year-over-year. The overall outlook for agricultural products remains unfavorable with low corn supply and high prices caused by last year's drought impacting shipments to feed mills and ethanol shipments impacted by lower demand and production. Finally export coal volumes will be lower on softer demand for thermal coal.","Now I will wrap up on the next slide. Looking at the state of the economy, the indicators we follow point to a steady expansion. Overall the second quarter volume outlook is stable. While the outlook for 86% of our markets is neutral to favorable we anticipate total volume will be flat year-over-year with declines in unfavorable markets offsetting gains in favorable markets. Domestic and export coal markets still face challenges.","High stockpiles will continue to impact domestic shipments and softening demand for U.S. thermal coal will have an unfavorable impact on the export market. At the same time, we expect our merchandise in intermodal markets to grow at a rate that is above the general economy as we continue to deliver high levels of service which creates compelling value for customers and will drive long-term profitable volume and revenue growth for shareholders.","Thank you and now I will turn the presentation over to Oscar to review our operating results.","Oscar Munoz","Thank you, Clarence, and good morning everyone. I am pleased to please report again that CSX's operating results for the first quarter are very strong. Safety results remain at or near all-time record levels and service continues to improve and set new records. Additionally, resource adjustments and improved asset utilization in the first quarter provided a great start and we are now on a path to exceed $150 million of efficiency gains in 2013. Bottom line, with sustained high level of operating performance, CSX remains very well positioned to deliver a compelling service product for customers while ensuring value for shareowners.","Now let's review the operating results for the first quarter. On the safety side, I am happy to report that CSX once again produced industry-leading results. Reviewing those measures on the left, the FRA personal injury rate was at a record first quarter level of 0.66, representing an 18% improvement year-over-year. The chart on the right shows the FRA train accident rate which improved 31% to 1.54% and represents a record level. Now, before moving on, and I think it's important to note that, and to thank our employees in the field at all levels for their truly outstanding and continued commitment to safety and that is evidenced by these great results.","So, let's turn to next slide and review on-time performance. Here you can see on-time originations on the left and on-time arrivals on the right. Both measures were all-time high in the first quarter with on-time originations at 91% and on-time arrivals at 85%. Both on-time measures also represent sequential improvement, which is particularly meaningful given first quarter volumes higher and weather was more challenging than it was in the fourth quarter. These results represent strong collaboration between our customers, sales and marketing and the operating team. Setting new records for service demonstrates employee commitment to a share purpose both, found on service actions.","Turning to system performance on the next slide, as we all know a capital-intensive industry like ours requires a strong focus on maximizing the productive use of our assets, the result that has been top priority as we look to further improve shareowner return.","Looking to the chart on the left, CSX drove an 8% improvement in terminal dwell for the quarter at a record low 22.2 hours. This means cars are spending less time sitting in terminals and thus more time in productive freight service. Velocity also showed improvement up 5% to 23.4 miles per hour with improvement across all three networks, coal, merchandise and intermodal. Record on-time performance, dwell and velocity mean customers are receiving great service. And as a result, return on asset is improving.","Now, turning to slide 20, let's turn our attention to operating efficiency, which is we are proving and not mutually exclusive great service. Looking at crew efficiency in merchandise and intermodal markets, overall volume was up 1% with 3% fewer crew starts. Growth is largely been absorbed onto existing trains, meaning there is no need to add locomotives and crews to handle increasing volume. In coal, crew start reductions have more than kept up with volume decline. By actively managing the workforce and increasing coal tons per car and cars per train, the company has been able to continue to drive crew efficiency in the coal market.","Now let's turn to the next slide and discuss employment levels. The chart on the left represents the total active train and engine workforce with the blue portion of the bars representing full-time employees and the gold portion representing employees on furlough retention boards. On a year-over-year basis active T&E employees was down 4% with volume down 2%. In addition to lower T&E employment, the company continue to deliver strong operating efficiency. Here, overtime hours were down 11% and relief crews were down 9% for the quarter.","Across all our operating graphs, employment levels were down 5%, reflecting reductions in the mechanical and engineering departments as we drove further efficiencies in these areas as well. Next, looking at where we stand with furlough and furlough retention boards, at the end of the quarter there were over 600 T&E employees on full furlough and approximately 150 on furlough retention boards. The furlough retention board count came down over the course of the first quarter as CSX put employees back to work to replace attrition and handle modest sequential business growth.","Let me now turn to locomotives on the next slide. Looking at the chart on the left, you can see that the active locomotive count is down 8% versus the first quarter of 2012, so up modestly on a sequential basis to accomplish seasonal increases in volume. Locomotive efficiency as measured by gross ton miles per horsepower hour improved 8% on a year-over-year basis. The team has been working diligently to minimize the time it takes to put locomotives into or take them out of storage resulting in the ability to react more dynamically to customer demand, thus driving greater operating efficiency.","Now let me quickly wrap up on the next slide. The outstanding first quarter personal injury and train accident results demonstrate company's commitment to keep our employees and the communities we work in safe. This commitment is why CSX is a leader in one of the nation's safest industries. The operating team continues to sustain record service in 2013, serving customers efficiently with fewer resources.","The sustained service improvement is evidenced by both, what we are hearing directly from customers as well as the record levels of satisfaction reported by our customers and third-party surveys. Given the strong start for the year, we expect to deliver over $150 million efficiency savings through improved service, growing with your assets and spinning those assets more quickly to maximize return. In this dynamic environment, CSX remains committed to providing flexible solutions for customers to enable growth and drive significant long-term value for shareowners.","With that let me turn the presentation over to Fredrik to review the financials.","Fredrik Eliasson","Thank you, Oscar, and good morning everyone. Looking at the top of the chart, revenue was essentially flat for the first quarter as declines in coal revenue were offset by gains in merchandise, intermodal and other revenue including the $32 million of liquidated damages year-over-year that Clarence mentioned earlier. Expenses improved 1% aided by a $20 million deferred gain, which I will speak to in a coming slide. Excluding this gain, expenses were slightly down versus last year as CSX was able to more than offset inflation and higher depreciation through improved efficiency. Operating income was $875 million, up 2%, versus the prior year.","Looking below the line, interest expense was $147 million reflecting slightly higher debt levels year-over-year. Other income was negative $3 million and income taxes were $256 million in the quarter. While the effective tax rate was 36.7%, we continue to expect a 38% tax rate going forward. Overall, net earnings was $459 million, up 2%, versus last year and EPS was $0.45 per share, up 5%, reflecting growth in net earnings and the impact of last year's share repurchase program.","As we turn to the next slide, let's briefly discuss how fuel lag benefited the quarter. On a year-over-year basis the effect of the lag in our fuel surcharge program was $10 million favorable. This reflects $5 million of negative in quarter lag during the first quarter of this year versus $50 million of negative in quarter lag for the same period last year.","Turning to the next slide, let's review our expenses. Overall expenses were down 1% in the quarter. I will talk about the top three expense items in more detail on the next few slides but let me briefly speak to the last two on the chart. Depreciation was up 5% to $270 million due to the increase in the net asset base. Going forward we continue to expect depreciation to increase sequentially a few million dollars each quarter reflecting the ongoing investment in our business. Lastly, equipment rent was down 2% to $95 million as a result of improved utilization and fewer leased locomotives.","Now let's discuss labor and fringe in more detail. Labor and fringe expense was down $3 million versus last year. Looking at the chart on the left, total headcount was down 4% versus last year and down 1% sequentially, reflecting favorable crews starts to our performance and reductions in mechanical and engineering that Oscar discussed earlier.","Moving to the table on the right. The table on the right. Efficiency and volume related cost savings of $20 million reflects the financial benefit of the year-over-year improvement in crew starts in overtime as well as lower mechanical, engineering and training expenses.","Moving down the table, labor inflation was up $30 million favorable to our guidance as lower cost of health and welfare programs partially offset wage inflation but remained above 3%. Rounding out the table, other costs were $4 million higher primarily driven by higher incentive compensation. Looking at the second quarter, headcount should remain relatively constant on a sequential basis although as we have demonstrated over the past several quarters, to continue driving efficiency we will adjust accordingly as business conditions warrants. In addition we expect labor inflation will rise approximately $15 million to $20 million year-over-year for the remaining quarters and incentive compensation will become more material headwind with the year-over-year variance of about $15 million in the second quarter.","Next, we will review MS&O expenses on slide 29. AS&O expenses decreased 6% or $35 million versus last year with the key driver shown in the table on the right. Total deferred gains reduced MS&O expenses by $30 million reflecting two items. The first relates to $20 million deferred gain associated with a five-year conveyance of a formerly owned company, the details of which can be found in the quarterly financial report. The second related to continuing SunRail gain, which was $29 million in the period, or $10 million favorable year-over-year. Looking at the second quarter, we expect to recognize another $14 million of SunRail, which will be down from the $20 million we recorded in the second quarter of last year. For the balance of 2013, no further gains are expected to be realized.","Turning to the operating activities, efficiency in volume related cost savings reduced MS&O expenses by $22 million compared to last year. This was driven by materials and repair cost savings enabled by an 8% reduction in active locomotive count as well as other initiatives. Moving down the table, inflation increased by $11 million while other MS&O costs increased by $6 million.","Moving to the next slide, let's discuss the impact of fuel. Total fuel cost remained flat versus last year. Looking at the table to the right, fuel efficiency was favorable by $10 million reflecting a 2% year-over-year improvement in gallons consumed per gross ton mile. Next, as shown in the chart on the left, CSX average cost per gallon for locomotive fuel increased to $3.26, up 3% versus last year and driving increase of $40 million as seen in the chart on the right. Rounding out the table, lower volume drove $4 million decrease in volume and other expenses with gross ton miles down 1%. That concludes the expense review for the first quarter.","Now, let's turn to slide 31 and review our new financial targets along with our dividend and share repurchases announcements. You may recall that I mentioned last quarter that we would update you on our longer term financial expectations after we completed a detailed review of our strategic plan with our board. With this review complete and taken into account, the new coal environment we are updating our financial targets to reflect the expectations for our business.","As I stated before, we expect 2013 to be another transition year for CSX as utilities work off, work to reduce inventories to adjust to the new environment where natural gas remains cheap and abundant. That said, we continue to expect domestic coal headwind to sit side by the end of 2013, setting the stage for both earnings growth and operating ratio improvement in 2014 and 2015. Over those two years, we are targeting average annual earnings per share growth of 10% to 15% of the 2013 base. Including our first quarter earnings per share of $0.45, we now expect full-year EPS to be flat to slightly down from 2012 as we continue to face headwinds in coal and cycle one-time favorable items from the prior year.","Looking at the company's operating ratio for this year, we expect to regain the momentum we had prior to the recent transition in coal driven by our continued focus on pricing above inflation, profitable volume growth and efficiency. As a result, we now expect to achieve high 60s operating ratio by 2015, and we continue to target the mid-60s longer-term. Because of our continued confidence in the company's core earning power, we remain committed to deploying cash within a balanced framework that prioritizes investment in the businesses drive long-term value creation along with dividends and share repurchases that also provide value for shareholders.","First, our capital investment remains unchanged for 2013, a $2.3 billion. Long-term, we continue to expect to invest 16% to 17% of revenue in our business plus an overlay for PTC. We view capital investment as a key driver of long-term shareholder value as infrastructure and rolling stock investment allows CSX to sustained high safety and service levels, enhance the efficiency and capitalize on strategic growth opportunities that produce superior returns.","Second, CSX remains committed to a dividend payout range of 30% to 35% of trailing 12-months earnings. In accordance with this policy, we have announced that 7% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.15 per share reflecting a payout at the high end of our target range.","Third, CSX remains committed to utilize the share buybacks as an important tool to return cash to investors. As such, we announced a new $1 billion buyback program, which is expected to be completed over the next 24 months. This new program is expected to be primarily funded by excess cash and free cash flow.","Finally, within the context of these announcements, we continue to target an improving credit profile that balances between financial flexibility and cost of capital through a full business cycle. In summary, CSX's business remains fundamentally strong. Our recent financial performance and future free cash flow prospects continue to provide the basis for increased shareholder distributions. Through prudent capital investment and executing well on the things more in our control CSX will be able to continue to create long-term value for our shareholders.","With that let me turn the presentation back to Michael for his closing remarks.","Michael Ward","Thank you, Fredrik. Over the last several years, CSX has consistently delivered strong results over a wide range of economic conditions. Producing record first-quarter earnings after experiencing yet another sharp decrease in coal revenue is emblematic of our ability and our resolve. While we know that our stakeholders are more interested in tomorrow than yesterday and the guidance in shareholder actions we outlined show our confidence in both the near and long-term.","Over the next several months we envision a transition period where coal begins to stabilize at a lower level and more importantly where the 80% plus of our business that is not related coal provides opportunities for the team to deliver vibrant results. Our diverse portfolio, far-reaching network and dynamic operating platform will allow the company to optimize its performance and any momentum that would occur in the economy with increased opportunities further.","Put another way, we believe that CSX has emerged from yet another period of multiple challenges even stronger than before just as it did after the global recession and in the quarter just completed. These achievements add to our confidence in this team's ability to produce double-digit earnings growth and a high 60s operating ratio by 2015 and a mid 60s operating ratio longer-term. CSX stands for how tomorrow moves and the employees of this company have once again quietly and diligently backed up that promise with excellent service product and consistently strong financial results.","Thank you for your interest in CSX and we look forward to answering your questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Ken Hoexter of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning. Fredrik, if we could just follow-up on that outlook a bit, or Michael, looking at that 10% to 15% growth, the midpoint, it looks like a bit slower, if you include the full $0.45, as you mentioned. So maybe just talk about what are in the assumptions there? Are you looking at coal, maybe, being worse than targeted? Is the profit\/loss from that just too great to overcome? Is pricing on export coal getting more aggressive? Maybe if you can just give us some parameters around what's in that 10% to 15% thought process?","Fredrik Eliasson","Sure, Ken. So, well obviously now we have a detailed plan after we have reviewed it with our board that is behind this guidance. Clearly, as you know, seldom does long-term plan exactly end up as the way that you expect them to when you put them in place. So we are going to have to continue to be flexible and adapt, just like we have over the last couple years to produce these sort of results through whatever economic environment that we are seeing.","I would say, overall, underlying those assumptions, is essentially a flat coal environment versus what we are seeing basically between export and domestic an overall flat environment. On the overall economy, I would say the same thing we are going to see slowly a recovering economy. Nothing more than what we have seen here over the last year or so. You couple that with continued inflation plus pricing and the productivity focus that we have shown here over the last two years, that is really the foundation for our long-term guidance.","So we know that we are going to continue to be flexible and adapt to whatever environment we have and then continue to push the same sort of leverage that we have over the last few years.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski of Barclays Capital.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital","Fredrik, maybe if I can just follow-up on that. So just to be clear, you guys are assuming that coal demand flattens out in the 2014, 2015 period?","Fredrik Eliasson","Over this period of time, between domestic and export, clearly there could be periods where one is up but one is down but overall, I would say that our view is that between the two it will be flattish during this period of time","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital","And that's coming off of the negative guidance you have for '13, right?","Fredrik Eliasson","That's correct.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital","Okay. Then if I just ask one on the energy markets for Clarence. What are some of the opportunities or where do you have facilities on your network today that can accept crude oil, and are you willing to put out some growth targets potentially for this segment of business?","Clarence Gooden","Well, thanks, Brandon. We have about four different facilities right now in the East that we have the capability of serving directly, and we are currently doing that through the average of about seven and nine trains a week. The limiting factor on what the long-term growth of that will be as you are aware is the production capabilities, particularly in the Bakken in the eastern market. So it's, for us is going to be driven by what the production capabilities are, not by what the demand is.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Wetherbee of Citi Research.","Chris Wetherbee - Citi Research","Thanks. It's a question on coal yield as I think sequentially in the second quarter through the fourth quarter, Clarence, how should we be thinking about the coal yield. Are you still looking for kind of flattish yields on a full year basis for 2013? Should they be getting better I guess sequentially?","Clarence Gooden","Chris, we are looking for those coal yields to be flat on a basis going forward and that's subject to any fluctuation that we could have in the fuel surcharge application that\u2019s' coming in.","Chris Wetherbee - Citi Research","Okay. Then just a quick follow-up to that, when you think about the met coal settlements for the second quarter coming in a little bit higher than where they were in the first quarter, does that give you some support to potentially bring that number up a little bit or does it at least provide you some downside support, so there is no further decline. Just want to get a sense of kind of how much flexibility you have within that.","Clarence Gooden","I think it's the latter. It provides us support against any further downward movement. Those prices that it's just been announced at Queensland, an effort by the producers to push the rates up what actually settles in the market traditionally has been slightly lower number.","Chris Wetherbee - Citi Research","Okay. That that's helpful thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Ceraso of Credit Suisse.","Chris Ceraso - Credit Suisse","Thank you. Good morning. There was a comment on slide number 10 about stronger domestic pricing coal. Was that just from inflation adjustment on existing contracts or we are successful in getting price increases on anything that may have turned over in the quarter?","Clarence Gooden","It's both.","Chris Ceraso - Credit Suisse","Okay. Then just as a follow-up, I think you have kind of spoken to this. The guidance for domestic coal for the rest of the year of down 5 to 10 suggest that things are down only small single-digit for the rest of the year. Is that just the effect of comps getting easier or are you actually seeing increased demand because of where gas prices are?","Clarence Gooden","The comps in the second quarter are actually better, because we had a terrible second quarter last year in domestic coal. The third and fourth quarters tend to even out a little bit more.","Chris Ceraso - Credit Suisse","But are you seeing any sort of response, any kind of demand response to where gas prices are or are you still eating into existing inventories?","Clarence Gooden","In the North, we've seen some response to the gas prices, particularly where Powder River basin and Northern Appalachian coals are being used. In the South, the inventory levels are still at persistently high levels, and so that's going to be determined mainly by the weather and by the price of natural gas, but we expect those stockpiles to stay fairly high throughout the year.","Operator","Our next question is from Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank.","Robert Salmon - Deutsche Bank","Good morning, guys. It's Rob on for Justin. Clarence, you had sounded little more cautious on the export thermal coal outlook on coal. Are you implying that that 2013 outlook is now below that the 20 million tons you've been talking to in Q4, or are you just highlight that year-over-year comps are growing more challenging as we move out to the second quarter?","Clarence Gooden","It's the latter that the year-over-year comps are growing a little bit more challenging as we go forward. It is a fact that the API 2 index numbers as you are aware come down, but we think they are starting to stabilize and actually the forward curve on the API 2 through the second, third, fourth quarters and through 2014 is actually increasing.","Robert Salmon - Deutsche Bank","I guess, Clarence, while we are talking about the API 2, could you discuss a little bit in more detail about your export thermal coal contracts? How much of that book of business is linked to metrics like the API 2 in terms of the contracts and I guess you know what percentage of that book again is tied to a take-or-pay commitment volume?","Clarence Gooden","Well not all, but a [part of is] [ph] of the thermal exports, particularly in to Europe, are tied to the API 2 index. Our rates don't go up as fast nor do they go down as fast as the API 2 index does. A large percentage of our contracts would be on a take-or-pay basis although there is a certain amount of those thermal contracts that are on a spot market basis.","Operator","Our next question is from Thomas Kim of Goldman Sachs.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs","If I could ask Clarence just with regards to the intermodal side, you mentioned that there is a 9 million truckload opportunity. I was wondering if you could perhaps give us the path towards that's opportunity being realized?","Clarence Gooden","Well, we have the highway initiative called highway to rail conversion, in which we go out with a specialized sales force that we have to the beneficial cargo owners and through our other intermediary channels and we discuss with him our profits, our opportunities. We have an optimizer that can take their freight and determine what is best suited for either long-term, short-term, rail - term being to find the distance. So we are doing that initiative.","We are opening up new markets, the Montr\u00e9al market that we discussed on the call, will be we think a very lucrative market for us on the domestic side serving over 7 million people. Our expansion at Fairburn has been indicative of what we see happening in our domestic growth. We will be opening a new terminal in Winter Haven, Florida, here before long that will expand further in that central and lower central Florida market which is very fast-growing.","We have got new construction happening now in Baltimore, as we speak. We have expansions in Columbus that we just completed. New terminal in Louisville, Kentucky that we just completed, which I am pleased to announce is almost at capacity and has been wildly successful for us. So a combination of all those factors leads us to believe that we are going to have a good continued growth in our intermodal market.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs","Great, and if I can just ask a separate question. Thus far, we have only heard a few companies talk about the sequester impacting transport companies and they happen to be within the airline space. But I noticed in your outlook that you had commented that this sequester could have some impact. Now I was just wondering if you might be able to provide a little bit of color in terms of what the impact might be?","Clarence Gooden","I don\u2019t remember saying anything about the sequestration. We haven't seen any impact from it that I am aware of.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs","Okay, sorry I guess I should clarify. It was on page 13 where you said comments with regard to budget uncertainty impacting military shipments. I apologize with the terminology.","Clarence Gooden","Our military shipments have been down. This is second, almost third year in row, that our military shipments have been down. They are mainly being impacted, on a year-over-year basis, by the war material that we were sending overseas. Unfortunately because of the, say fortunately, it depends on your perspective, but from mine, as an American, bringing down our troops abroad has been a positive thing for the country and but negatively impacted our numbers. ","Michael Ward","So it's not much a sequestration as to a war. ","Clarence Gooden","As the war effort.","Operator","Your next question is from Thomas Wadewitz of JPMorgan.","Thomas Wadewitz - JPMorgan","Clarence, I have got one for you, and then one Fredrik as well. You mentioned, four terminals that you are now can serve in the East that are online or coming online for crude by rail and you are doing about seven to nine trains a day. What do you think is the most realistic expectation for second half? Would you think that you can get to two rails a day versus roughly one now? How do you view as the likely ramping crude by rail in second half of this year?","Clarence Gooden","Tom, first, good morning. It is good to talk with you. Number two is, we are not having seven to nine a day. Its seven to nine a week.","Thomas Wadewitz - JPMorgan","Sorry about that. That\u2019s yes.","Clarence Gooden","I would like to handle seven to nine a day.","Thomas Wadewitz - JPMorgan","I misspoke, right, clearly. So roughly one train a day. But how would that look in second half, you think?","Clarence Gooden","I think that it will increase in the second half. We feel very positive about it with the discussions that we have but as I pointed out earlier, at the end of the day, the production levels in the Williston basin the Bakken is going to determine what we have. And the sort of a joke we have internally if everybody got to two trains a day that they won't. I mean, the numbers will be out the roof and it's just unrealistic to expect, so I would think of it more in terms of the Bakken producing the 700,000 barrels a day that they producing is 70,000 barrels a day the train itself can hull sort of back into what you think the potential numbers are going to be given the fact that all of that oil is not going to come east. That makes sense to you?","Thomas Wadewitz - JPMorgan","Yes. It does. I mean, I guess, we will see as it plays out there will be some meaningful growth and we will kind of see as it happen how large it is and what production does. So, thank you for that.","Then Fredrik, your share buyback essentially $500 million a year for the next two years, if I look at that in historical context, so if I take out 2009 and look at the prior five years you did on average $1.5 billion a year of buyback, and I am just trying to get my arms around why the number you have the next two years is quite a bit smaller than that.","Obviously your coal franchises is very different today than it was, but it also seems like you are seeing some stability in that and especially when you look beyond 2013. So, is that temporarily conservative and improved credit little bit or is it just the capability for share buyback a lot less than it was in the past? How would you frame that and why such a conservative approach on buyback?","Fredrik Eliasson","Thomas, you know that our prioritization is pretty straight forward. First it's about investing in our business. Second is the dividend and third is our share repurchase program. And based on available cash flow that we have, we think we are going to have coupled with some use of our balance sheet within the context of improving credit profile. That's how we determine the amount of share buyback that we will do. When we look at the next few years, we see two things that is impacting the sizing of the program specifically, first of all is the fact that our PTC spending is ramping up a little bit more and that is impacting the size of the program and then second we are also are seeing the reversal starting to happen, because the last couple of years for bonus depreciation.","So, bonus depreciation has been a wonderful tailwind for the last couple years in terms of free cash flow and we are now getting to the point where we are starting to see that minimizing the impact of the positive impact of that. In fact as we get into '14 and '15 are going to see the negative impact from that, so that is considered in that sizing of that program.","Thomas Wadewitz - JPMorgan","Okay. Great. Thanks for the time.","Operator","Our next question is from Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley.","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley","Hi, there. Good morning. I just wanted to back to some of the underlying assumptions on the long-term guidance and I want to sort of ask Oscar about the cost side of it, because you've done a great job in the last few quarters on getting these costs out particularly on looking at the labor numbers, but even MS&O and stuff like this. It's been very impressive, so what we've seen at some of the other rails over time is they sort of come at the cost in a very aggressive way and they have gotten them out in a way that essentially says no matter what the macro hands us, we are going to get these operating ratios lower, and I was wondering if you can sort of talk about your ability to flex up on that if these macro assumptions that Fredrick outlined don't payout like that. Is a lot of this is in your control even beyond the macro that we get these numbers through cost alone if we need to?","Oscar Munoz","Bill, so you've said a lot and I think that the heart of your question is that are we going to increase our productivity targets by year?","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley","Yes. And really like I guess I kind of look at this and say you've demonstrated an ability to get out a lot when the macro is not helpful. Fredrik outlined the macro that's kind of neutral. But it's not that good, can you still get at these numbers through productivity anyway?","Oscar Munoz","Absolutely. I mean if you think of the way we've been getting at these numbers, I mean we get them through asset utilization, technology improvements, resource planning sort of dynamic communication tools that allow us to sort of literally use a lot less resources in the critical first and last mile with our customers and we think there is ample opportunity there within our existing structure regardless of what happens in the macro environment, so that our future view on our productivity targets is very solid and will continue.","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley","All right, and then just one follow-up for Clarence on the competitive dynamics, can you help us understand sort of how it's playing out right now in the East? It feels a little bit like the growth rates by you and your competitor are a little bit different on volume. Is that because there is some much more aggressive pricing environment that you seem to be seeing in recent years or do you feel like that\u2019s just some of the geographies playing out and not too much to pay attention to?","Clarence Gooden","Well, first I think it's great to see that the rail industry in general is doing well. That's a positive thing for all of us. If you look in the East, what you will essentially see between the two carriers is that we have some issues in our coal franchise versus NS and their intermodal growth rates have been higher than ours. As I outlined to you earlier, we have terminal expansions in place. We will have over 90% of our network doublestack cleared here very soon. So we feel very positive about what our growth rates are. I think with the 9 million truckload opportunity in the East, there is a lot of business out there for everybody.","Operator","Our next question is from Scott Group of Wolfe Trahan.","Scott Group - Wolfe Trahan","So just want to clarify a couple of things on the export side, particularly met. So the guidance of a 40 million tons, I think if I remember from last quarter, it was split relatively pretty equally between met and thermal on the export side. So we were a good amount above that run rate for met in first quarter. Does that suggest that there is upside to the 40 million tons or that that 7 million run rate for med in first quarter isn\u2019t sustainable? Then just longer-term, the high 60s OR target for '15, do we need export to stay above 40, at or above 40 million tons or is there some cushion if that starts dropping below 40? I know there are a couple of things there.","Clarence Gooden","Okay, Scott, I will go first and Fredrik will go second. On the export tons, as we mentioned earlier, we expect it still to be about 40 million. We told you originally, that the split will be about 50-50. It came in this quarter about 57-43. As we forecast throughout the year, we expect it to be somewhere in the 50-50 range, if its anything it could tend towards being more favorable to the met.","Fredrik Eliasson","Scott, in regards to coal and what expectations are, I outlined earlier that we think that it's going to be flattish overall, clearly, from where we are here in 2013 and the guidance we have provided. But we also said seldom do the plans actually work out exactly that you expect. So we are going to continue to be flexible and if one of those markets are a little bit weaker, we will have to find other opportunities either on the top line or on the cost side to try to offset that.","Scott Group - Wolfe Trahan","Okay, that\u2019s great and just one follow-up on crude by rail. As the business really starts to ramp up on the next year or so, should we be thinking about a big positive mix impact on yields, like we have seen with some of the other rails. I guess I am just not sure how to think about the pricing necessarily in the East and some of the refineries are a little bit more competitive between the rails. How do we think that and just the impact of that maybe the brent and WTI spread tightening a bit on pricing?","Clarence Gooden","I would tell you, first off on the brent and WTI and the Bakken spreads that are all pretty tightening up. That\u2019s a commodity-based number that\u2019s going to do what its going to do on a worldwide global basis. So its just very difficult to predict that that\u2019s going to be. On the profit margins for the crude, it is very profitable for us. It's probably not what a lot of people think. Its not coal, if that's the question that you're asking but it is a very profitable part of our business for us.","Operator","Our next question is from Jason Seidl of Cowen Securities.","Jason Seidl - Cowen Securities","A couple of questions. I guess I will focus on the pricing side. One, you obviously mentioned a little bit of weakness on the export side. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s of any surprise. I don\u2019t know if you could split out some comments between thermal and met. Two, just to clarify one of the question, I think Bill asked about some of the pricing dynamic in the East. It just doesn't seem, at least from your results, that there is any aggressive pricing between you and the NS going along right now. I just wanted to make sure that that is the case.","Clarence Gooden","What do you mean by aggressive pricing between us and the NS?","Jason Seidl - Cowen Securities","I am saying aggressive, are you guys getting more one aggressive with trying to steal freight from one and other. I think that was sort of the crux of those questions.","Clarence Gooden","Absolutely not. As we've told you earlier, we're going to price above rail inflation. We're going to going to price above it, because, one, we think we've got a product that offers a significant value and secondly because it's necessary for us to invest in our infrastructure we've had a solid plan and worked over the last two years now nearly in which we've wanted to work on our pricing and that's what we are going to continue to do. What was the second part of your question? Met versus thermal?","Jason Seidl - Cowen Securities","Met versus thermal in terms of export pricing, I mean, you talked about pricing in general. I was wondering if you could parse out both of them.","Clarence Gooden","Well, the met obviously goes at a higher rate than the thermal does, pricing right? Because the commodity type and what demand in the marketplace in there. As you know, we've seen downward pressure on both and I would say that downward pressure has been equally between the two markets just at a different level.","Jason Seidl - Cowen Securities","Okay. And my follow up question, you talked about sort of your new intermodal program. It sounds like that's going more direct marketing. Is that the case?","Clarence Gooden","Now, it's not going more direct marketing, but is going more direct to the customers themselves. We do that jointly with our intermediaries, but we want to make sure that the bit ultimate beneficial cargo owners are very cognizant of what our capabilities are, or values that we could offer to those customers and how we can best serve them and in what markets.","Jason Seidl - Cowen Securities","Okay. I appreciate the clarifications. Thanks for the time as always, guys.","Operator","Our next question is from Ben Hartford of Robert W. Baird.","Ben Hartford - Robert W. Baird","Good morning, guys. Fredrik, can you clarify or remind us what the incentive comp headwind by quarter for the next three quarters is going to be?","Fredrik Eliasson","So here, in the first quarter incentive comp headwind was about $7 million year-over-year. And as outlined in my comments, we think it's going to be about 15 in the second quarter to reset the targets and we now have the broader application of the bonuses to include a larger portion of our union employees as well. As we look at the second half, they will be probably little bit more than that, probably closer to the 20 on average.","Ben Hartford - Robert W. Baird","Okay. That's helpful. Then a follow-up related to crew starts were down 16% in coal with volume were down 10%-ish. What's driving, I guess, the longer train length? Is it just mix of greater percentage of export coal volumes or are you seeing more activity from bigger customers at the expense of smaller customers that that may not be generating at full capacity? Can you talk a little bit about that dynamic?","Oscar Munoz","Yes. This is Oscar, Ben. I think it's a mixture of several things. Our southern utility coal normal longer haul is where our volume declined or as you think that would be shrinking, but we've got increases in export coal in Newport News, which is affecting that mix, we've got a high percentage of stuff coming from the Illinois basin which has a little bit longer haul and then in the Northeast where we are growing we have lesser declines in the Northeast in the mid-Atlantic utilities which kind of contribute to the longer haul. So, mix of all of those factors it's just traffic mix. It's nothing more sort of broader oriented development.","Ben Hartford - Robert W. Baird","That's helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Vernon of Sanford Bernstein.","David Vernon - Sanford Bernstein","Good morning. With the liquidated damages of $32 million in the quarter is that the number we should expect more [board] or is this kind of dated as far as what's on the radar screen right now?","Fredrik Eliasson","This is Fredrik. I think that we have seen the vast majority of the liquidated damage that we expect for the year in the first quarter, so I wouldn't expect to or there's no need to really build in a lot more after this. We will certainly update you and being transparent as we do get them going forward just as we have in the past.","David Vernon - Sanford Bernstein","And on the revenue, would that be sort of in that $80 million, $70 million to $80 million range then?","Fredrik Eliasson","Yes. I think that's the best place. If you look back over the last few years that seems to be the place where it normal normalizes.","David Vernon - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. Great. Then just one last follow-up for Clarence, are you guys starting to see any type of pickup in demand for drilling materials into the Marcellus with gas prices start coming back up?","Clarence Gooden","So far we have not seen any additional pickup for the drill count and sales. We are seeing an increase in the amount frac sand that we are moving into the Marcellus.","Operator","Our next question is from John Larkin with Stifel, Nicolaus.","John Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just on the broader issue of seasonality, for many decades, usually the first quarter is your weakest quarter in transportation across most modes. Your guidance kind of implies that maybe there's less seasonality this year than there might be in a normal year or is it just the way that the one-time items flows. Could you perhaps illuminate us on that point?","Oscar Munoz","Well, I am not going to get into quarterly guidance but based on what we said here earlier, we had about $52 million between the liquidated damages and the close agreement associated with the conveyance of our formerly owned subsidiary that impacted us favorably this quarter. So if you adjust for that, you get to a different run rate and then as you have seen, I guess, a little bit in regards to what you are alluding to, the seasonality is perhaps not as strong as it has been in the past, but there is still seasonality especially in the second quarter and the third quarter. We know third quarter with the automotive shut down and some of the coal holidays and so forth. So there is still seasonality there but I do think you need to change the starting point and once you do that I think it makes more sense versus the historical pattern.","John Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus","Thank you for that, and then maybe as a second question, one of the other hot topics amongst investors has been activity into and out of Mexico and while you don't touch Mexico directly, with your partner railroads, you can do business into and out of that country. Do you see that as a major opportunity that might ultimately be as big crude by rail?","Clarence Gooden","Well, John, one, we see it as a major opportunity for us. We do a lot of business today in and out of Mexico, both container riseable as well as a boxcar freight and automotive businesses in and out of the Mexico. I haven\u2019t really thought about it terms of comparables but as crude by rail, the Mexican market, for us, is a very large market and I hope that crude by rail grows as fast as Mexico has.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeff Kauffman of Sterne, Agee.","Jeff Kauffman - Sterne, Agee & Leach","Just wanted to follow up on Tom Wadewitz' question. I see the point where you paid down about $400 million of debt in the first quarter, no share repurchases. I hear what's Fred saying as we want to keep our cash level and neutral and that's what the share repurchase is based on but it seems like you are delevering here and I would guess share repurchase would be more accretive to earnings than a debt pay down at these levels of interest rates. Can you guide me through the thinking on that?","Fredrik Eliasson","Just a very brief answer to that. Our intent is not to delever during this period of time.","Jeff Kauffman - Sterne, Agee & Leach","Okay, so in other words, we are open-ended but we are just being conservative given the environment and matching our cash flows?","Fredrik Eliasson","Well, we are going to continue to make sure that we approach it the same way we have approached it the last couple years in regards to the balanced approach and we are going to size the share repurchase program based on whatever free cash flow that we have available including using whatever debt capacity we have and clearly as you know we also had to go into the year a significant amount of pre-funding done on our balance sheet because of taking advantage of some attractive rates last fall. So our cash balances are relatively high going into the year.","Jeff Kauffman - Sterne, Agee & Leach","Okay, and one detail question. Fred, you said the bonus depreciation traversing, does that mean that your GAAP depreciation expense levels out in 2014, 2015? Or am I thinking about that wrong?","Fredrik Eliasson","I think you should really just think about it from the relationship between deferred taxes and our GAAP taxes. So it doesn\u2019t really impact whatever you see on the P&L side. It really does impacts the ability to continue to defer some of our taxes.","Operator","Our next question is from Anthony Gallo of Wells Fargo.","Anthony Gallo - Wells Fargo","As I understand, the export coal pricing from you is going to vary with the underlying commodity price change. Are there any other commodities on your network that had a similar dynamic? And I guess more specifically could you clarify the comment on crude? So will crude pricing by you vary as the differentials vary?","Clarence Gooden","Anthony, this is Clarence. We don\u2019t have any other commodities that we specifically tied in other lines of business. We specifically have tied to commodity prices. And on the crude pricing it will not follow the spreads.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Nesvold of Jefferies.","Peter Nesvold - Jefferies","Good morning. Just a follow-up on liquidated damages, can you just maybe talk a little about how the liquidated damages provision are changing with coal industry given the underlying changes within the industry itself? Are these becoming harder to implement? Are there different ways that these provisions are being put into contracts etcetera?","Clarence Gooden","Well, I think that clearly the liquidated damages that we have in context today are different than they were a few years ago when we essentially had both min and max as sort of in contrast and that the liquidated damages today are a lot smaller than they used to be. I think that's a trend that we expect to continue going forward as well.","Peter Nesvold - Jefferies","Okay. Is that sort of a gradual evolution or is it given the significant downturn that we saw in coal volumes in 2012? Are there sort of step changes that are occurring in those provisions as you implement them now?","Clarence Gooden","This has been occurring over last couple years. We expect that to continue going forward.","Operator","Our next question is from Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar","I think, to ask about coal inventory, you indicated utility inventories are high. Can you compare the levels in the past year and related just comment on maybe unique attribute of your franchise? Do you consider your ground storage capability more advantageous during periods like the present?","Clarence Gooden","Keith, this is Clarence. The coal inventories as I mentioned earlier in the North had pretty much gotten down to what would be considered historically normal levels. That's been driven by the colder winter I think we had like six more weeks colder weather than we normally had. It's also been driven by natural gas prices slightly going up and a lot of that coal that moves into that area, which is both, Powder River basin and Northern App has a lower ratio right between coal and natural gas than it does in the South.","In the South, the utilities have the tendency to burn a lot more gas. Even though electrical consumption is have a lot more gas capacity and as a result of that they went into the year again with excessively high inventories and they have stayed fairly high throughout this period. Now there are isolated cases where some utilities actually dropped and there's also isolated cases where in utilities have increased.","What was the second part of your question? Ground storage related to export?","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar","Yes.","Clarence Gooden","We think it gives CSX a competitive advantage. We have ground storage at all three of our major exporting terminals that allows our customers to blend the coal if they have the coal there available for immediate loading as well as the asset utilization.","Operator","Our final question comes from Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital Markets","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets","I guess my question is on the intermodal. I know Fredrik, you gave some color on coal assumptions going up there, but on the little brighter note here your truck-to-rail conversion is probably a more systemic and longer-term evolution and I am just curious as to what level of intermodal volumes are you assuming above your average levels for the rest of your business for intermodal going out to your target?","Fredrik Eliasson","I think as you've seen here over the last few years, we continue to have great success in intermodal conversion in intermodal space and we certainly expect that during this period as well.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets","At a rate above the average, I guess","Fredrik Eliasson","I would say above average. Yes.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets","When you look at the profitability of your intermodal, I know all the railroads was sort of termed the profitability of intermodal as average with the group, but clearly as you get growth in that segment your you train lengths become more optimal. Intuitively it would lead you to want to assume that this will be an above average growth level. Is there a certain level of volumes that you see as being a key volume level you can term that in with regards to your market share versus the truck, so the $9 million talking about or is there volume level you can point to within your own [kernel] statistics that would say, okay at this level we really start to get some good economies of scale here and get profitability above the average.","Fredrik Eliasson","Well, I do think that you're right. I think that as we continue to grow that business we do see a economies of scale that is going to be helpful. At the same time though, intermodal also is the toughest part of the business because of pricing. So you are very much dependent on making sure that you create that leverage as you move forward. As we said, intermodal is a profitable business to us. It is with par with most of our merchandise market and we want to grow as much as we possibly can. So we are excited about the opportunity. We are excited by the 9 million loads and we are going to continue to grow that market at a faster rate than the overall economy.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets","That\u2019s great. Thank you. I just have a housekeeping question for Oscar. Your employee base has come down quite a bit quite nicely here. How should we look at employee count going forward in terms a more flattish volume growth after the decline in coal volumes. Is this something that stabilizes or starts ticking back up now as you see that stability in coal and perhaps some growth in your merchandise in the intermodal business?","Fredrik Eliasson","This is Fredrik. We are going to continue to make sure that we are responsive to whatever market conditions we are seeing. So in a flattish environment, we expect our headcount to remain flattish. Obviously, we are going to see what we can do on the productivity side but then if we see a ramp up in volume here in the second and third and fourth quarter we are going to see some adjustments to our headcount but hopefully not a one-to-one ratio.","Operator","I will now turn it back to the speakers for closing remarks.","Michael Ward","Thank you for your attention and we will look forward to seeing you next quarter.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. During this call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Boone, Chief Investor Relations Officer for CSX Corporation. Thank you sir, please begin.","Kevin Boone","Thank you and good afternoon everyone. Joining me on today\u2019s call is Jim Foote, Chief Executive Officer, Ed Harris, Executive Vice-President of Operations and Frank Lonegro Chief Financial Officer","On slide two with our forward-looking disclosure followed by our non-GAAP disclosure on slide three. I would also like to highlight our upcoming investor conference scheduled for March 1st in New York. Registration information will be found on the CSX Investor Relations page. With that, it is a pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Foote.","James Foote","Thank you very much Kevin. It\u2019s great to have the opportunity to speak with you again today. Before we get started and going through the presentation, I\u2019d like to thank all of you out there who sent their condolences concerning Hunter\u2019s passing. Hunter was a true legend and CSX would not be in a position it is today without the tremendous changes that he was able to make during his time here. I am committed to seeing his vision through and making CSX the best railroad of North America.","Before I get started, let me say again that as I said in the conference call on the morning of December 15 when I was named acting President and CEO. I am committed to follow through on implementing the scheduled railroad business model at CSX.","After spending my entire career in the railroad business, I have experienced firsthand the benefits that are realized by customers and shareholders and changing to the scheduled railroad way of doing business. To reinforce my commitment to driving this change, I took steps quickly to emphasize this message. Just a few hours after assuming the position in my first official act as CEO, I advised the head of engineering to bulldoze one of the hump yards that Hunter had closed.","Atlanta hump yard today is flat. There is no turning back. I did make changes to the sales and marketing structure to simplify the organization by collapsing the leadership group into three business units and aligning certain functions into other departments.","I made changes in the operating department to bring clarity to the key responsibilities. The operating department both at the staff and field levels obviously has the most responsibility to execute and deliver the efficiencies and service improvements from schedule railroading.","While we now have more accountability within the operating department to ensure the hard work to implement schedule railroading gift to the bottom line.","And the biggest change is to bring in Ed Harris to help me. Ed is a rock solid railroad operations executive with over 44 years of experience. He and I were part of the leadership team that transformed Canadian National.","He worked for years with Hunter at both Illinois Central and CN developing and implementing scheduled railroading. He understands what we are trying to accomplish here at CSX and I trust with Ed\u2019s help we can deliver on the plan. We have a ton of opportunity to harvest.","We are aggressively developing more trip plans that have a essence to operating the railroad to schedule. Plans that set specific wealth and time parameters and dictate how to move our customer\u2019s products across the network, but also tell us when we don\u2019t which highlights inefficiencies. We are on the right path to making CSX the best run railroad in North America.","I\u2019d like to go into the presentation now and am going to start with slide four, the fourth quarter highlights. We continued where we delivered solid results in the fourth quarter. We continue to show a sequential improvement on key service metrics including train velocity and terminal dwell.","Here are the highlights. Adjusted revenue on a 13-week basis was roughly flat year-over-year with volume down 2%. Our adjusted operating ratio came in at 64.8%, a 220 basis point improvement versus the fourth quarter of 2016. Earnings per share were up 31% to $0.64.","Moving onto the next page, where we can take a quick look at the revenue in the fourth quarter. Again in the quarter revenue was flat and a 2% decline in volume, this reflects higher prices which were offset somewhat by negative mix. A few comments on the larger commodity goods.","In Chemicals, revenue growth was up 3% despite lower industrial waste moves due to a large project which concluded earlier in 2017 but was still active in the fourth quarter of 2016. Crude by rail moves were also down in the period. Auto was down 10% about in line with a 7% lower U.S. and 15% lower Canadian vehicle production rate.","Ag and Food products revenues were down 5% driven by lower export grain which was down about 50%. Feed ingredients which were down \u2013 which was again offset somewhat by increases in feed grains.","Coal revenues were up 4%, export coal volumes finished out a strong year up 37% for the quarter. Shipments through our Northern utilities were down substantially, but shipments through southern utilities were up 5%.","Intermodal revenues grew 4%. International volumes increased as Eastern port volumes continue to grow. Our domestic business was down as a business rationalization program shed about 7% of total intermodal volumes, which were offset somewhat by strong peak season volumes.","Again moving to slide seven and take a quick look at our operating highlights. Again, as I mentioned previously train velocity and dwell continue to see sequential improvement. Compared to the fourth quarter last year, train velocity was 15% better and Dwell was 10% better. While there remains to be a tremendous amount of opportunity ahead of us, I\u2019m encouraged by our progress. Train length continues to be a focus by our team and I would expect future improvements there.","Finally, total employees continue to fall this quarter as we improve efficiency which requires fewer assets. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Frank.","Frank Lonegro","Thanks Jim and good afternoon everyone. Turning to slide nine, we are encouraged by the fourth quarter\u2019s financial performance. The service and efficiency improvements Jim just laid out on the previous slide have generated momentum on the financial side as well.","Reported revenue declined 6% but was flat on a comparable 13-week basis despite some gains across all markets and higher fuel recoveries were offset by the impact of lower volume and negative mix.","Total expenses were 14% lower in the quarter, driven primarily by significant efficiency gains that benefit the tax reform on the company\u2019s equity affiliates and cycling $116 million of cost [indiscernible] last years extra fiscal week. While I don\u2019t plan to call out the impact of the extra week as I walk through the expense line items, we have provided that level of detail in our quarterly financial report.","Labor and Fringe savings were driven by a 12% reduction in average headcount, incentive compensation was also lower driven in part by the reversal [Ph] about $28 million in former CEO stock option expense accrued in quarters one through three.","MS&O expense increased by 5%. As a reminder though, fourth quarter 2016 MS&O benefitted in a $115 million real estate gain which was partly offset by real estate gains in this year\u2019s fourth quarter as well as $70 million of efficiency savings.","Fuel expense was up primarily due to the 23% increase in the per gallon price despite continued gains in fuel efficiency. The $29 million restructuring charge in the quarter and legislature [ph] departures of seven executives in early 2017 and those more recently.","Equity earnings of affiliates is the new line item on the income statement, necessitated by the impact of tax reform on non-consolidated subsidiaries in the quarter. As we have done at the CSX consolidated level, the subsidiaries also will be valued their differed tax liabilities to reflect the new federal way. Given the size of the impact this quarter, SEC rules require us to add these line items to the P&L.","Moving forward, this item should be an expense credit of about $10 million to $15 million per quarter four. These contra expenses were previously for MS&O and rents.","Looking below the operating income line, 2016 results were impacted by a debt refinancing which lowered ongoing interest expense and were accompanied by onetime $115 million debt repurchase charge.","Shifting to the income tax line, in 2017 we received a $3.5 billion non-cash benefit due to the revaluation of our deferred tax liability. Adjusting for this and for the restructuring charge our effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 34%. This is lower than usual due to the previously mentioned stock option expense reversal and multiple state tax items and favourably impacted EPS collectively by about $0.03.","The deferred tax revaluation and the restructuring charges are significant and we believe are not indicative of CSX\u2019s future financial churns, therefore on slide ten and in that quarterly financial reports we provide adjusted non-GAAP measures for the fourth quarter and full year.","The fourth quarter adjusted operating ratio was 64.8% and adjusted EPS grew to about 31% to $0.64 per share. In the full year, we achieved a 66.3% adjusted operating ratio an improvement of 310 basis points from 2016, the improved operating and financial performance and the benefit of share repurchases bring full year adjusted EPS to $2.30 a 27% increase over the last years reported EPS.","Looking at slide 11, adjusting for the restructuring charge, CSX generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow before dividends doubling the free cash flow performance of 2016, improves cash generation as driven by a $665 million reduction in capital expenditures as well as solid top line gains and significant operating efficiency savings. 2017\u2019s initial capital investment plan was $2.2 billion.","With Hunter\u2019s guidance during the year we\u2019ve reduced that to $2.1 billion and ultimately finished closer to $2 billion for the year, a 25% decrease year-over-year. Continuing with this capital efficiency theme, Jim will provide his thoughts on 2018 capital investment in a few moments.","Our strong free cash flow performance enabled us to reward our shareholders with a two [Indiscernible] share dividend increase over to this year of nearly $2 billion of share repurchases.","In total, we returned nearly $2.7 billion to our shareholders in 2017, an increase of over $900 million compared to 2016.","Wrapping up on slide 12, a strong finish to the year enabled us to meet or exceed all of the financial targets we reaffirmed on last quarter\u2019s earnings call delivering on our commitments will be a hallmark of this team and this company.","In addition to growing adjusted EPS by 27% doubling free cash flow to $1.7 billion and driving the adjusted operating ratio down to 66.3% our successful transition to persistent schedule railroad helped the company generate record efficiency savings of $460 million in 2017.","With 2017 now into books, I\u2019m delighted to turn the presentation back to Jim to highlight our initial expectations for 2018.","James Foote","Thanks, Frank. For 2018 on the concluding slide here we expect revenue in 2018 to be up slightly with merchandising intermodal services offerings much better than last year. I expect to see more favourable results in the second half of the year.","In the first half of the year, we will face tough comparisons on export coal rates which are linked to the price of the commodity. However, we see the coal markets continuing to remain healthy from a volume perspective.","As we continue to improve our service, I believe we will begin to see increasing new opportunities as we look beyond 2018. I continue to expect improvement from a cross perspective. I reiterate we will continue to implement the scheduling railroading model and I see no reason to believe we can\u2019t deliver the results that Hunter thought we could.","We should see a solid step-down in the operating ratio every year for the next three years. I expect CapEx to be $1.6 billion down significantly from 2017; this is bang on where Hunter said we should be. I am committed to investing and maintaining a safe and reliable railroad. As we become more efficient, we are able to achieve more with each dollar we spend.","As Kevin said, we have scheduled our investor day for March 1. We will provide additional details in our financial outlook at that time. I hope all of you can attend and look forward to meeting with you and discussing our plans in much greater detail at that time. And with that, I\u2019ll hand it back to Kevin and we can have question and answers.","Kevin Boone","Thank you, Jim. In the interest of trying to get to everyone in the queue, I\u2019ll ask our analysts to limit themselves to one question and a follow up if needed. Operator, we\u2019ll now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Your line is open.","Tom Wadewitz","Yes, good afternoon. I had some questions for Ed. Is Ed on the call today, Ed Harris, sir?","Edward Harris","Yes, I am Tom.","Tom Wadewitz","Okay, great. Good to hear your voice Ed and you know look forward to I guess hearing from you as part of the team. I know you haven\u2019t been there long so it\u2019s probably tough to have a strong read on things but I just wanted to hear your thoughts on what do you think is important to big changes in the network last year, the metric seemed to be very good at the present time, but what do you think are the most important things for you and the team to focus on the operating side to continue that momentum and to see the further improvement in financial result?","Edward Harris","Well Tom, I think it\u2019s obvious what Jim said. We are going to continue to follow Hunter\u2019s plan of pursuing a scheduled railroad environment that in turn will lead to less train starts, more engines and storage, less equipment and a more fluid network and the table has been set. I read in one of Jim\u2019s earlier reports that the heavy lifting has been done and I really agree that it has been done. I\u2019ve been very impressed with the staff here at CSX, the field forces I\u2019ve had a chance to meet all my direct reports and now I am spending time with their staffs and just get the handle on the railroad. I\u2019ll start hitting the field here probably within the next two weeks and follow through on the plan, but the plan is intact as it stands right now but I think we\u2019ll dig a lot deeper than now where we are at today.","Tom Wadewitz","Okay, that\u2019s great. And Jim, if I can ask you to give your thoughts on just what the top priorities for execution in 2018 would be for you as well.","James Foote","You know Ed and I are in complete alignment. We both think alike and we both think and speak Hunter. This is the way we learn how to run the railroad so we are going to do the same things. Train length, velocity, terminal dwell continue to focus on driving down our fuel expenditure and you know running our trains with fewer locomotives. Car miles per car day, you know we just \u2013 we live and eat and breathe these metrics and that\u2019s how you deliver the financial performance that we did at CN and Hunter did at CP. So it might sound boring Tom, but it\u2019s the same old, same old that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019ve heard all along and we are well on the way to accomplishing that.","Tom Wadewitz","Okay, great. All right thank you for the time.","Operator","The next question will come from Brian Ossenbeck of JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Brian Ossenbeck","Hi guys thanks for taking my question. Jim, just wanted to start where we ended up, I think if you could just give a little bit more framework around the 2018 financial outlook knowing you are going to discuss a lot more for the long term at the coming investor day but if you can just breakout what you think will be the major components of the revenue up slightly, you are going to continue to it sounds like churns in the intermodal volumes. You\u2019re looking for perhaps some volume headwinds and then just more specifically on the OR guidance looking for another solid step-down this year and every year for the next several years if you can give us a little bit more detail on that, you know what that looks like if it\u2019s similar year to this year or is it going to kind of continue but at a slower rate from 2017?","James Foote","Well Kevin will shoot me if I give away all of the details that he\u2019s got planned for New York. But just again a little more flavour on what I said in my concluding slide. It is not the topline growth up slightly. It is kind of similar to what we\u2019ve been through at CN and CP when you implement a new operating plan and you implement it as quickly and aggressively as Hunter did here. Clearly there was disruption in the network and if some business clearly went away.","Then there was the intentional [indiscernible] marketing of the 7% of the intermodal traffic when we deviated and pivoted away from the hub-and-spoke system and closed the Northwest Ohio facility. I do not envision those kinds of disruptive changes occurring in the future in 2018 and so our goal right now on the merchandise side of the business is to earn back the trust of our customers and to begin to grow that business and so because it was only a few months ago, we were in gridlock and fighting with the customers and the [STB] [Ph] you know it would be naive to me to assume that all that business is going to come back to us in the second week of February. So as I said later in the year I think we\u2019ll begin to have more success in growing our merchandise business segment but I\u2019m being cautious in our forecast.","Intermodal side of the house, again as our service metrics improve, I expect to see that comeback, we were successful in offsetting that 7% decline with a very strong fourth quarter especially the service that we deliver during peak season. So I would hope that intermodal will continue to do well and I personally have been meeting with a lot of the major intermodal customers and confident that we can see some topline growth. The kind of odd ball in the equation here is what\u2019s going to happen with coal.","Coal is very strong here for us, the outlook for export Met and Steam coal right now continues to be favourable despite everyone predicting earlier that it was not going to be, and so the question is how long is that going to hang in there and the challenges that we have with our domestic steam co-franchise especially the northern utilities where they are being displaced by natural gas gives us concern there. So again, we\u2019ll get into all of that topline in much greater detail with the business unit leaders at our investor conference, so there\u2019s a little flavour there.","On the operating side, as I said you know I see no reason and Ed agrees with me as he said, I see no reason that we cannot drive our cost structure lower and improve the efficiencies of the network in line with what Hunter had visioned and as I said again I see step-downs, I can see step-downs in that operating ratio over the year and next three years. The details in which how we get there from a train operating standpoint, from an engineering standpoint to the mechanical standpoint, the timing of those in a little more, in much greater detail with more flavour will roll out again so Kevin won\u2019t shoot me if I just blurted out the plan right now.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay, thanks for all the details Jim. A really quick one for Frank, if he could just tell us where you expect cash taxes to go relative to last year and then versus the 25 effective rates I would appreciate it? Thank you.","Frank Lonegro","Thanks Brian. We gave you the effective rate obviously in Jim\u2019s prepared remarks, remember obviously as you step down into the cash tax way from there you are going to have the essentially equivalent to 100% bonus depreciation and then you\u2019ve got your state accommodation of cash and deferred. I think if you implied the same level of slip if you saw previously on a lower base you\u2019ll get to the right answer. It\u2019s going to fluctuate as it always does quarter-to-quarter, and year-to-year but that will give you a good place to start.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay, appreciate the time. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Allison Landry","Good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. Jim, I was hoping I could ask a follow up question on Intermodal and you know given that you are essentially awarded the credit for building the CN intermodal franchise as we know it today. Do you see anything at CSX you know understanding the fact that it\u2019s at a different spot and you know where CN was years ago. Is there any opportunity to build out CSX\u2019s franchise in a similar way or do you plan to take it in a different direction altogether?","James Foote","Well there is a lot more people in New York and Pennsylvania then there are into schedules and so I think we have an opportunity to move a lot more intermodal or right across the network. I see it\u2019s just like we see in the rest of the business I see a lot of opportunity in terms of changing business processes, working at improving terminal fluidity, the same steps that we took at CN to improve the quality of the network and then the quality of the revenue stream associated with that.","I also see a somewhat uniquely and opportunity here to really take a hard look at the input international track that\u2019s coming in on the east coast and begin to determine ways in which we can market that business more effectively on east to west move and be more competitive there, and I believe my experience in growing the traffic flows on the CN out of Vancouver as well as the development, Prince Rupert will give me a little bit more insight into where to take the business. But first and foremost what we did at CN where we rolled out intermodal excellence and created an unbelievably sought-after service in Canada, that\u2019s our first focus and I think we\u2019re making great progress in delivering on that.","Allison Landry","Okay, great. And then, I apologize if I missed this, but did you guys provide the core pricing figure for the quarter?","James Foote","Not in the specifics. What I said was that on a network basis clearly their volume was down 2%, our revenues were flat. We achieved greater than net 2% differential in price and that was offset to a degree by mix.","Allison Landry","Okay. So, will you not be providing the similar like the same disclosure that you guys previously did?","James Foote","I think we\u2019re going to providing disclosure at the same way I use to do at CN.","Allison Landry","Okay.","James Foote","And that\u2019s kind of how we \u2013 that\u2019s the guidance level that we\u2019re comfortable with.","Allison Landry","Okay. Sounds good. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Scott Group","Hey, thanks afternoon. Just a couple of follow-ups on the 2018 earnings framework, so Jim can you just clarify, I mean, fuel surcharge is probably a two, maybe a three-point help to revenue this year. Are you including that in your commentary about revenue up slightly or you sort of talking ex-fuel? And then maybe Jim or Ed can you give some sort of directional color on headcount for either the first quarter or for the year?","Frank Lonegro","Hey, Scott. It\u2019s Frank. I\u2019ll jump in and then Jim and Ed can go. The revenue guidance that Jim gave is all in revenue, total revenue. And then headcount revenue comes on a Q1 basis, although I believe it will be sequentially down every quarter. You\u2019re going to see us step down pretty much every year 17 to 18, 8 to 19, 19 to 20 etcetera. We\u2019ll have a lot more commentary on that one as we get to the investor day, but clearly that\u2019s part of equation to get to some of the outcomes that we\u2019re aiming for.","Scott Group","And Frank, do you\u2026","Frank Lonegro","Go ahead, I\u2019m sorry.","Scott Group","No. Go ahead. Sorry to interrupt.","Frank Lonegro","On the headcount question, you know as we \u2013 as this is our quarterly information, well I should say, what\u2019s in our quarterly information is a employee headcount, but in addition to the employee headcount reduction we also had a significant reduction in the number of pay consultants that were here at CSX and you add the consultants together with the employee number that\u2019s in there. We took out over 4,700 employees here and consultants last year.","Looking at next year if you take a look at what the ongoing attrition rate is around the company, of around say, on remaining headcount around 1,400 employees and then you add in again an aggressive look at getting the consultants non-employees out of here, you would think that we would come up with an annual number of around another 2,000 employee reduction in 2018. That\u2019s our thoughts right now. We are grinding that \u2013 again grinding that plan right now and expect to have the details of that mix between employees, consultants, timing based upon attrition etcetera when we are in New York in six weeks.","Scott Group","Very helpful. I just want to make sure I understand, Frank, the way you answered my first question is about the surcharge revenue. So obviously your revenue includes you surcharge revenue. Do you think I\u2019m right that there\u2019s a two to three-point potential help to revenue this year from that? So you sort of saying x fuel that core revenue is potentially down this year? Is that sort of what we should take from your guidance?","Frank Lonegro","Your two to three percentage point seems high to me, I mean, we\u2019re tracking the forward curve and obviously have a good handle on what surcharge revenue would be on a year-over-year basis, but Jim\u2019s comment was obviously on a total revenue basis as we get to the investor conference we can get the more around CAGRs in terms of longer term revenue growth etcetera, but now Jim commentary result.","James Foote","Yes. That numbers is high based upon our assumption of what we expect a fuel price to be.","Scott Group","Okay. Fair enough.","James Foote","As Frank said, it\u2019s all and it includes fuel surcharges included in that number, but we\u2019re no where near any kind of fuel price assumption increase that would drive that kind of increase in revenue.","Scott Group","Okay. Fair enough. And then my just last question. I don\u2019t know if this is for Jim or for Frank. So as we think about the CapEx reduction and the earnings improvement and taxes, obviously much more free cash flow this year than we'd ever seen. So, how you would prioritize that free cash flow between buyback and dividend? And do you think just this new level of free cash flow let you revisit leverage targets? I know we\u2019re not going to get those hard numbers today. We\u2019ll get them at the Analyst Day. But we right in thinking that more free cash flow let you think about leverage ratios differently?","Edward Harris","Well, it certainly gives you more coverage in terms of interest ratios and things like that. Its an input obviously that we\u2019re having with the more as we look it up to capital structure and leverage conversations with the rating agencies coming up as well to understand the relative importance of debt to EBITDA versus et cetera to that, which clearly be an input to that as well . But clearly when you look at the abilities that you have to distribute cash there are only a handful of ways that you can utilize it. We\u2019ve given you CapEx number. That would be acquisitive in the near term on small basis. So then you\u2019re really talking about shareholder distribution, and the question is what the relative proportion now between dividends and buybacks. But it\u2019s an active conversation right now. Obviously Jim is our new CEO, its perspectives will be discussing those with the board and look forward to sharing those with you in March.","Scott Group","Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.","Operator","The next question comes from Chris Wetherbee of Citi Research. Your line is open.","Chris Wetherbee","Hey. Thanks very much. I wanted to come back to your comments on pricing, Jim, specifically you discontinuing sort of the metric you\u2019ve given us, but maybe you can help us with some comparability to the previous quarters, how you saw pricing specifically in the fourth quarter and maybe a little bit of sort of how you\u2019re thinking about the outlook into 2018 particularly on the merchandise and intermodal side where there is some comparability versus truck. We\u2019re seeing that market tight. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense as you sort of think out in the fourth quarter than you look out to 2018 with those revenue targets, how we should be thinking about sort of the price lever within that mix?","Frank Lonegro","I don\u2019t know what \u2013 I have some idea what the guidance was given to you in the last in the third quarter in terms of price for merchandise. I believe that number was about 2.2% increase.","Chris Wetherbee","Not much in enrolled was 2.2 in Q3.","Frank Lonegro","Yes. So our price in merchandise, again in the fourth quarter was higher than that. So we continue to trend upward and trust me we continue to focus on price. The proper mix of volume in price, but clearly a focus on price and that\u2019s one of the thing probably that I\u2019m most proud of in my career was while the rates in the railroad industry and a cent per revenue per mile dropped every year after year after year starting with the deregulation in the 80s, it was what we did at the Canadian national that put a brakes on the continual decline in rate and started to move prices up.","So I\u2019m a big advocate here and as we work so hard to improve the quality of the product that we have to get the sales team focus that what we\u2019re selling is a service not a commodity that we go after as much of a price increase as we possibly can under the restrictions in our existing contracts, that contracts might in place.","So, in terms of guidance other then for me to tell you what we\u2019ve done, I\u2019m not going to get any more specific in that. And in terms of explaining on a quarter by quarter basis what our price was, we\u2019ll tell you the overall topline breakdown in terms of volume and volume and price to get to what the revenue stream is.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate that context. Couple of weeks ago, few weeks ago there is a letter to the STB, I think kind of highlighted that from service perspective there\u2019s not to be a lot of meaning or really any meaningful changes kind of going forward you know, you just execute kind of on the plan that stands right now, essentially that suggest that Hunter got through essentially everything he wanted to get through and now it's kind of more of a just executing on the plan as you move into 2018. I guess if you could just maybe give us a little bit of color around that when you think about the various business, merchandise, intermodal maybe coal, is there really anything else left to do from your perspective? And if so, kind of how much and maybe how that could kind of progress out? Understanding we\u2019re going to get more color on this in March, just kind of get a sense on maybe that comment specifically? Thank you.","James Foote","Well, in terms of the order of magnitude, deciding on one data shut down eight major hump yards across your network is pretty dramatic and disruptive and deciding to kind of blow up a thought-out strategy, hub-and-spoke intermodal network overnight, again, it was pretty disruptive and dramatic. I do not see us having anything like that. Luckily Ed and I have talked about that. Luckily we inherited a very hard that work in difficult decisions that Hunter made for us early, when he was here last year. I think we would have come to the same conclusion that those things needed to be done. I just don't think I would have decided that we\u2019re going to do all in one day on a Tuesday.","And so we are the beneficiaries of that very, very difficult work that was done by him and the team here. That is not to say that what we have here is a walk in the park. We are going to continue to grind. Now comes the difficult part of getting this trains to continually to run at \u2013 I mean, we\u2019re already hitting both velocities now that are ever near record speeds in the history of CSX. So when I came here I think you have to go back to the steam engine passenger days to kind of figure out when you had train velocities that were all what we\u2019re at today.","So the velocity of taking out intermediate stops is improving the deficiencies of the terminals, grinding out on these trip plans now in order to improve both the origin, the pickup at the customer location, deliver a delivery of the product and the car at the destination, driving train length, improving fuel efficiency, optimizing the use of distributed power, all these initiatives are what drives the cost down, improves the quality of the product. And at the end of the day in more simplistic terms is what you want to measure and what we\u2019re doing by or having lower operating ratios drives the operating ratio down. Day-in, day-out, seven day a week we work in process change and now that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. That\u2019s exactly what I brought in Ed Harris. Nobody is more of a bulldog when it comes to getting a hold of these initiatives and getting them done. So the organization spend three hours this morning with all of the vice presidents going through each and everyone of these initiatives and assigning accountability and responsibility not to get it done some time in the second week of June, but to come to me and Ed, in about 10 or 12 days with the plans and how we\u2019re going to implement everyone\u2019s initiative.","So, again, Kevin has given me the \"Don't give the story away\" but in the 1st of March we\u2019ll have our transportation people there, our engineering people there, our mechanical people there to go through these strategies in detail and show you what we\u2019re doing to make, to bring home these initiatives, and most importantly get the results to the bottomline.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate the color. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Russell of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Matt Russell","Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Just first to start off on labor and that potential for additional headcount reductions, just want to make sure I understand that correctly. It sounds like you still see quite a bit of opportunity to take out labor costs on the existing volume base. Can you talk about how much of that is tied to management and consulting type labor and in any context around that? And how much is tied to just swing in volumes?","Frank Lonegro","In terms of the breakdown between management and various different crafts, as I said we\u2019re grinding this up right now and it will be a little more detailed on that in about six weeks. So I just \u2013 that plan, again, that we\u2019re looking at -- we\u2019re looking at the attrition rates, the attrition by craft, that kind of thing, as well as how aggressive we can get on some of the consultants. So again, when that plan is complete by the New York Times we\u2019ll be able to give you some set of view on that.","James Foote","But overtime, Matt, just to chime in all three categories of resource-based whether its management union or contractors and consultants, you should expect all of those to be lower overtime.","Matt Russell","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And just one follow-up on tax, in regards to the STB revenue adequacy determination, is there any potential change there with what's going on? Tax rate is coming down that would impede your ability to base rates, raise pricing? Have you thought through or having conversations there?","James Foote","Yes. We\u2019re starting to take, look at that obviously the question around revenue adequacy in both specific to railroads and then across the industry it is through the cycle analysis rather than any particular year. And the other thing obviously that we always look at is whether if there\u2019s a placement cost not that the historical book value that was used also by the regulators determining what's revenue adequate to. Nothing in the near terms that causes new concern.","Matt Russell","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Ken Hoexter","Hey, Jim, tough as to why, but good luck to you Ed and Frank and moving forward, maybe you can talk a little about what has caught you off guard or things that are maybe a little different? And how things have changed at the rail, I don\u2019t know maybe it's technology more advance, PTC something you have to learn maybe kind of the learning steps for you Ed as you kind of get back in and start tackling the precision railroad model at a different rail?","Edward Harris","Well, I\u2019ll you and that I\u2019ve never been drawn to be honest about it even when I retired from CN or moved on, I have consulted almost consistently helping global infrastructure partners by a railroad in Australia. We went after Seattle [ph] one time and then we ended up with Pacific national. Later then that I\u2019ve also consulted with the Rio Tinto in Australia as well as RUMO in Brazil, and quite frankly being part of the Chicago study group, the study group that was sponsored by six retired chief operating officers, Hunter was kind enough to put me on that committee. And we learned a lot about Chicago.","Unfortunately the report which belongs to Brigadier, sits on a shelf somewhere in the AR headquarters like, yes, there are still a lot of good ideas there. So I can\u2019t say, I\u2019ve been surprised about anything operationally. I will tell you this. We have to take advantage of the technology that\u2019s out there. Jim mentioned the strategy of power and we\u2019re already starting our coal service more effectively with distributed power. I\u2019m also big component of run-through interchange, especially in a terminal like Chicago. I'd like to look in and I\u2019ve got the group looking into running directly back into the UP and BM and trying in all of our efforts to stay out f the belt, only because we\u2019re given up two days worth of cycle when we do that. And I certainly would like to avoid that.","And I want to rule out use of short lines. I\u2019ve been Chairman of OmniTRAX board for the last four years and I\u2019ve also been on the board of the TRAX Maintenance Company up at Canada. Both positions resigned when Jim and the board were nice enough to give me an opportunity at this job again. And you know lot of people say, and well I will jus I\u2019m experienced and I\u2019m certainly really excited about opportunity. I\u2019m excited about the staff here at CSX. And I'm telling you this group is focused and will be even more so focused. I won\u2019t rule out the short lines for a short term route.","I would rule out the use of partnering with our other Class 1 partner certain carriers just to take advantage of maybe an opportunity to do some directional running and\/or running long trains and directionally with our network we\u2019ve got a lot of options, maybe too many options, but we\u2019ll look at that as well too. So, thanks for the question. And it\u2019s an honor to be part of Jim\u2019s team and certainly an honor to be back in the Class 1 fold again.","James Foote","He hasn't missed a beat. He forgotten \u2013 he\u2019s forgotten in his \u2013 what do you call yourself? Golden age or whatever you are now. He's in the league of extraordinary gentlemen now. He\u2019s forgotten more of our railroad and the most guys ever knew. So, we\u2019re not in here at this role and his responsibility under some extremely difficult circumstances, the first person that I thought of that could come in here is to make sure that I was able to keep an eyes on the property to make sure we didn't skip keep a beat with Ed Harris. And so he's lived up to all expectations that team from the first day on the property on a conference call. He jumps in the middle of the call to start challenging people about why they're weighing chemical cars in the hump yard. And so it\u2019s great to have Ed here and he\u2019s doing a super job.","Ken Hoexter","Great. Thanks for that both of you. Appreciate. And I guess just my follow-up would be any reason for on-time arrivals still down in the 50s while originations have stepped up? And I guess just as you think about that. And then I guess follow-on to that is, do you kind of follow-on with the Hunter camps and the whiteboard session in terms of working on the culture change at the company as you do that?","Edward Harris","I would probably say, Ken, originations, you're right, we\u2019re doing very well there and really doing very well on the intermodal train side. I think in an effort to keep that business service-oriented closer on time the other trains may take a bit of a hit. It's wintertime, too, as well. This is a tough quarter to operate in. And the focus today will be as it is when I walk in the door is to reduce train starts, take some of that congestion out of the network, allow us to operate across the network on an on-time basis and Jim mentioned earlier seven days a week full filled trains I mean, from one end to other we want to fill the train out and certainly go with the tonnage.","We got enough power, we've got more power than what we need right now and we\u2019ve already start to put the power this year in regard to it. It\u2019s not a power question at all. Its probably more weather-related than anything else. And the effort is on service and we\u2019ll always be on service where I come from.","Frank Lonegro","Yes. Both the origin, when we change \u2013 we did the service that design plan for the network, we improved, again, train fluidity, train velocity from terminal to terminal. Going back at origin and destination terminals is where our challenges were which is not unexpected and we have done a great strives in improving train originations. Now, we need to get the final \u2013 the final piece of the puzzle are put together here and everybody is focused on that. Clearly I am not, and I don\u2019t think in this company is here with us and telling our customers we\u2019re running this schedule railroad that being on-time 50% is acceptable. That's not the goal. That's going to get fixed. I told the customers that\u2019s going to get fixed and it\u2019s going to get fixed as quickly as we can. Unfortunately we\u2019ve been hit by some pretty tough weather over the last couple of weeks, but we\u2019re all eyes are on the problem.","Ken Hoexter","Great. Thanks for the answer. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski of Barclays Capital. Your line is open.","Brandon Oglenski","Hey, good evening to everyone. And Jim and Frank, congrats on the new team here. I guess just wish it was under different circumstances, but life happens fast. We look forward to you guys carrying on Hunter\u2019s legacy here. I just want to follow-up on the revenue question Jim, about just looking out at the industrial landscape here it seems like core growth might even be accelerating in North America and obviously we haven\u2019t even seen what\u2019s going to happen with the likely cash infusion we\u2019ll see from tax reform. So is there is something about lingering, you know just with that discussion on your on-time arrivals, is there lingering service issues that just give you pause on the topline out for 2018? Or is it more strategic customer changes or a bigger focus on pricing of a volume. How do interpret that guidance?","James Foote","I think no, there\u2019s nothing wrong. Clearly we need to continue to focus on improving the service product. Again short answer is when we have the serious service issues in the middle of the year, we lost the business. If you followed Carlos, you could see that we lost the business. And then later in the year when it came to intermodal we demarketed a significant portion of our business. So and then we had a measure a plant shutdown in Florida, fertilizer plant, that is short-haul but a lot of volume. We had some big significant moves industrial waste last year that we don\u2019t have this year.","So, yes, I believe and I speak with the head of our merchandize business unit every day, because everybody is talking about we\u2019re going to have 4% GDP run rate for the next four years or whatever is we\u2019re talking about, why isn\u2019t the business growing. The underlying base business in our chemicals, in our paperboard is solid and stable. We need to dig our way out of some of these holes from the last eight, nine months. And again as I said earlier instrumentation of this business has an historically maybe again it was implementation of this plant is doing it the Hunter way, what disruptive because he was very aggressive in making the changes caused business to go elsewhere.","My experience is and looking around and talking to other people that business comes back when we smooth things out and we are focused and working very, very hard to make the improvements in our service that just going to take a little time and then its going to take a little time for the people to trust it and come back. But we are seeing some of those customers that have returned already.","Edward Harris","Brandon, one other thing just to remind everybody, we\u2019re about the cycle of the height of the net benchmark. We\u2019re probably closed to 100 bucks per ton below where we were in the first quarter of last year. So even though gets some mutual volumes you\u2019re going to move it up to lower RPU. So just keep that in mind as you think of things.","Brandon Oglenski","Okay. Appreciate the feedback. It\u2019s been a long call. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Long of Stephens. Your line is open.","Justin Long","Thanks and good afternoon. So I wanted to start with a question on CapEx. You gave the guidance for 1.6 billion in 2018. Is that a good annual run rate to think about going forward? I was just wondering if you could talk in more detail about what's driving the reduction relative to last year and the sustainability of those cuts?","Frank Lonegro","Hi, Justin, on the CapEx, so remembering the 1.6 that Jim gave, you got about 200 million of positive train control as part of that what we call core CapEx is more in the 1.4 range, what\u2019s driving that reduction is a handful of pretty significant things obviously a bit of rolling stock holiday on both engines and freight cars for the foreseeable future. So I think that\u2019s sustainable. Then you look at sidings and technology and things of that nature that we\u2019re going to depend on how Jim looks at the railroad and how we unlock productivity going forward.","So clearly the rolling stuff is going to hold. We\u2019re going to see a step down in positive train control from 2018 to 2019 and 2019 to 2020. We\u2019ll give you a lot more color on this as we get into the Investor Day, but at a high level I think you could probably figure out we\u2019re headed.","Justin Long","Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. And maybe as a quick follow-up on PTC, could you share your latest plans as it relates to the timing of that rollout and I\u2019m also curious what you\u2019re expecting for the PTC operating cost this year and how that compares to what you saw last year?","Frank Lonegro","Sure. So on where we are. We are at about half of the PTC footprint is operational. We will hit the compliance milestone at the end of 2018 which is that we\u2019ll be hardware-compliant and over half of the subdivisions that are requiring PTC will be implemented. So we\u2019re on-track to do that. And then we will be on-track to hit the final milestones in 2020. Your OpEx question, obviously the OpEx has been ramping up since we started the project in 2008 in 2017 within our results there\u2019s about 150 million of operating expenses part of our results. Ultimately that could ramp up somewhere in the $200 million to $250 million range in say, 2020, 2021 or 2022 as the things roll off warranty etcetera.","And remember there\u2019s a big split there between what is cash and what\u2019s non-cash. About two-thirds of the numbers have given you our own depreciation line and then rest are generally on the MS&O.","Justin Long","Okay, great. That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks so much for the time.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Vernon of Stanford Bernstein. Your line is open.","David Vernon","Hey, good afternoon guys and thanks for taking the questions. Frank, I want to ask the CapEx question in a slightly different way. Two years you signed off a budget at about 2.7 billion, this year\u2019s 2 billion next year\u2019s 1.6 billion. How do you get comfortable communicating to the board that we\u2019re not spending below sort of renewal CapEx, I mean, this is a pretty aggressive cut in the capital budget on a 40-year asset. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense for where you think maintenance CapEx levels are in the railroad and how do you get comfortable you\u2019re not getting below that level?","Frank Lonegro","Yes. I think good question. And I\u2019d like to open in paragraph for your note to put up. But anyway, how do we comfortable with it? It\u2019s because we\u2019re cutting in the right places and not cutting in the wrong places. When we look at what we\u2019re doing from the number of track miles of new rail, the amount of balance that we\u2019re putting down, the number of ties that we\u2019re putting down, the number of bridges that we\u2019re working through, I mean, all that in the core CapEx is largely we\u2019re saying that it has been $2.7 billion budget.","Remember when you look at the $2.7 billion budget about 600 million of that was engine. We also had a $2 million of freight cars in there. We had a big siding budget and the big technology budget as part of that. So when you look at where we\u2019re going to be in the next few again, the rolling stock, I don\u2019t its needing to invest any significant amount of money. Now we may expect money disturbed of power and things like that, but we\u2019re not going to spend money on new engines for new freight cars in the near term. We have over 20,000 freight cars in storage and we\u2019ve had 850 engines [Indiscernible] scrap.","Edward Harris","Almost over 900.","James Foote","900 locomotives serviceable, usable, ready to go locomotives and we're already putting 100 \u2013 we put a 133 that includes the 133 that we\u2019re going to put in this year as we include -- improved fluidity. I do not envision us needing to spend any significant money in the next few years at least in the foreseeable future as far as I\u2019m concern on things like expanding intermodal terminals and doing things like that. We can improve the productivity in all of our facilities to the point where they should be functional as the way they see in today. And it\u2019s actually free up facilities for maybe use for other purposes, and if we can find other use form, they are for sale.","So in terms of the -- you look at kind of the last five-year run rate in terms of rail, in terms of turnouts, in terms of turn rail, in terms of size installed, in terms of balance, we are spending the same amount of money that\u2019s historically been spent by CSX to make sure they are safe and reliable network. When Hunter came in he had many engineering firms come in as anyone would do and the reason I know that was my second day on the job, I went to the engineering department, that\u2019s a first thing you want to know, what kind of railroad we\u2019ve got and this is a very, very well maintained, not gold plated physical plant. And we intend to spend the same amount of money and keep his plant in excellent working shape in the foreseeable future and \u2013 but we don\u2019t need to spent money on the things that have been spend in the past and won\u2019t do that unless there's some huge compelling reason for us to do that.","Edward Harris","But right now, my only think to add to that is, if I see any capital spend and maybe in some siding extensions that would be \u2013 but quite frankly our average train length is less than our siding length as it is today, we still need to be pushing train length, train capacity and then we start watching delays if we get into that.","James Foote","And if we need to extend that we\u2019ll do it smart and we\u2019ll use rail from other locations to rely that, to use rail in other location. So we\u2019ll do it smart, but we\u2019re not in any way shape or form not keeping this railroad in a fantastic condition.","David Vernon","And just maybe as a quick follow-up, do you feel comfortable that that the network as it\u2019s been invested did they could handle the longer trains and running a little bit faster? Or do you think there\u2019s a risk that you might see some CapEx creep back into the outlook a year or two down the road?","James Foote","We\u2019re not planning on doing anything in terms of train length and distributed power that hasn\u2019t been done on another railroad for a decade. So this is just a question of implementing strategies that have been tried and proven effectively across North America and clearly we have the physical plants in the assets to be able to do it.","David Vernon","Alright. Thanks for the time.","Operator","The next question comes from Fadi Chamoun of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Fadi Chamoun","Yes. Good evening and thanks for taking my question. Jim, I just wanted to kind of circle back on the culture a little and what\u2019s going on with CSX. A number of the former CSX leaders have left and now the leadership transition to you and you brought on a very capable operator and that Harris and that's all great. Just wonder if can talk a little bit about the morale of the rank-and-file, do feel that you are supported? Do you feel that the vision that you've laid out -- that Hunter laid out and you are continuing on with precision railroading regarding is kind of supported across the organization?","James Foote","Yes. My belief and I said this from the very beginning, extremely impressed just Ed said, it\u2019s been here a week not even and as Ed said, the people here are very impressive. These are great railroaders. They are hard workers. And they want to do a good job. They just -- they\u2019re looking for a little guidance and they want to be a success. Everybody in the life wants to be a success. And this model \u2013 the scheduled railroad model is the way to turn CSX around and make it as I keep telling everyone that the best railroad in North America.","So, I have a high degree of confidence that the people here are bought in to what is we\u2019re trying to accomplish. You got to understand it wasn\u2019t that long ago. There was a lot of kiosk going on and as I said with a lot of changes that were being made in for Hunter has done what he did in the past eight months, what we did at CN in about three years, I can only imagine the pace of change and how chaotic that was for the team here. Since that point of time everybody has been focussed on what it is that needs to be accomplished, unfortunately under the circumstances I have not had enough time to get out into the field but Ed\u2019s going to go out in the field, I have plans already in place for me to get up and basically visit every location on the railroad and meet with every management personnel on the company and talk to them and tell them and make sure t hey understand what it is we are trying to accomplish and including the feedback that I\u2019ve gotten from the unsolicited emails from just some of the boys all over the network is that they wanted and let me know that they support me and they are welcoming me to the company, whether it\u2019s mechanical people in Pennsylvania to just people and they are always here in the headquarters office. So I\u2019m confident that we are going to be able to get up and Ed and I are going to be able to get out with the rest of the people, the management team and talk to people over the summer.","Fadi Chamoun","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ravi Shankar of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ravi Shankar","Thanks guys, just a couple of follow ups here. Sorry if I missed this earlier but did you give your expectations of cost inflation and productivity gains target for 2018?","Frank Lonegro","Hey Rob, it\u2019s Frank. No, we did not. You should expect significant efficiency gains obviously we\u2019ve been in connection with the revenue guidance that Jim gave and the OR expansion guidance that he gave. In terms of inflation you ought to see a pretty significant reduction and inflation year-over-year, obviously we got a real big inflation here in 2017 and if you see that step down quite nicely in 2018 the help and welfare above you that was up there in 2017 you know we sort of gotten full value in the health care trust and [Indiscernible] back to the fully funded to kind of that catch up like we did in 2017. So we ought to be in better shape in terms of the inflation going forward in 2017 or 2018, but we did not get specific dollar guidance.","Ravi Shankar","Got it. So in 2017 you said that you would do your record year of productivity, will you do another record year in 2018?","Frank Lonegro","[Indiscernible]","Ravi Shankar","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna International. Your line is open.","Bascome Majors","Thanks for taking my question. For Jim or Frank, can you help us with how middle management is intensified to deliver the financial outcomes and investors are expecting from you guys. And how if at all that has changed since Hunter joined almost a year ago?","James Foote","The incentives in terms of annual cash bonus for management and actually get some unions on it as well are 100% aligned with the types of targets we\u2019ve set in the past and the types of targets that were set in the future specifically operating income and operating ratios. And then as we go forward for multiyear incentives those will be operating income and free cash flow.","Bascome Majors","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Walter Spracklin","Thanks very much, good afternoon everyone. Frank, you talked about inflation, how it was going to step down. Are you indicating that your overall costs or rail inflation is expected to go negative or just step down from the higher rates that?","Frank Lonegro","Less of a hurdle.","Walter Spracklin","Less of a hurdle, okay. Makes sense, okay. And so on that basis I know Jim you are not guiding on price but is there any reason why you wouldn\u2019t be able to continue to exceed the inflation, the real inflation that you are seeing in the market wise with your pricing?","James Foote","Well I think as I told you before, I think that the \u2013 again what I said about the prices earlier in terms of merchandise what they were and what they were in the quarter you know not \u2013 I can\u2019t really talk about future prices but as you know if you kind of look at what we\u2019ve done and then you don\u2019t make your own assessment as if you know look well that will be next year and the year after. ","Frank Lonegro","Bascom\u2019s question, one second, on the multi-year trajectory and the incentives, its operating ratio and free cash flow not operating income of free cash flow on the one year incentives it is operating income and operating ratio.","Walter Spracklin","On the volume side then if we look at your price mix and volume as your component to your revenue up slightly, if we make the assumption that your pricing is going to exceed inflation it would suggest that your part \u2013 your volume will be negative for next year, if that\u2019s the wrong read let me know but is there \u2013 is this just a function of some of the what you mentioned about the prior volatility in some of your end markets with regards to coal or other or am I you know are we not to take that view of negative volume and a negative volume environment and perhaps associate it with mix?","Frank Lonegro","So yes, that\u2019s a good and fairly complicated question given the moving parts. Remember, a couple of things. Jim mentioned what we are doing on the intermodal side and what we\u2019ve done in 2017 that\u2019s got to cycle through from a volume perspective. Now we did have some plant closures and project completions and things that Jim mentioned, so those have to roll through.","Even if you look at export coal and say its volume neutral and you do have a fairly significant step down in the benchmarks, so you have to have all of those things as part of your equation. When you look at merchant intermodal there is going to be obviously one level of pricing that we are assuming that when you cycle a big RPU difference in the export coal your headline may not be impressive but you know that\u2019s far over what we are dealing within 2018. And then if you obviously should -- to Scott's earlier question, should be up next year given what the price of fuel is.","Walter Spracklin","Okay. And last question just generally kind of on guidance in general, I mean you\u2019ve obviously in the past been quite transparent and very good with providing that guidance and I\u2019ve just noticed a lot of repeated questions here as we try to understand some of what you are seeing in terms of your outlook here. Are we just in this kind of interim period before your March investor day and are we going to move back towards or a little bit more of clarity with regards to what your 2000 or your next year guidance is or is this kind of more of demonstrative of the new norm in terms of what disclosure you have been providing on a go-forward basis?","Frank Lonegro","Specifically as it just relates to price?","Walter Spracklin","No, your volume outlooks used to delineate on a kind of category by category basis. You gave tonnage with regards to export coal, your earnings guidance was kind of intermodal explicit range...","Frank Lonegro","Again, yes, in terms of price as I said earlier, I mean this is the kind of discussion that I\u2019ve historically done in other lives in the industry. So, this is probably the new norm in terms of just price discussion. In terms of everything else I expect that we will continue to be as transparent as the company has been in the past and I think yes, your conclusion that are we hedging until we get to the investor meeting is accurate. We\u2019ll be a little more forthcoming on some of these topics in New York and again we have \u2013 be in a position there to answer the questions at that time.","Walter Spracklin","Okay, that\u2019s fantastic. Looking forward to it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Seidl of Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Jason Seidl","Thank you operator. Hey gentlemen, thanks for taking the question. Quickly, can you talk a little bit about the cadence of the volume expectations for next year? Do you expect to get some of that business that you guys lost in 2017 back as your service levels improve?","Frank Lonegro","You know again yes, some of it might not come back so we might not want back, and some of it is already beginning to return. So it\u2019s going to be kind of a mix bag if you assume that when a company makes a decision to go to a different transportation service provider they are probably going to do it for a couple of weeks, mainly they commit for a year.","And so as we look our way through this issue, if you assume that the service problems began last year around June, July that\u2019s probably when we saw some of the business begin to move away and so I would \u2013 I am optimistic and we are working with our sales team to have a very good understanding there \u2013 if I need to go and talk to the customers there and if we change things and things were better. I've told the sales guys \u2013 and they can do that. I know they are willing to do that.","I know they are willing to out and meet the customers, I have already met with a lot of customers, they want assurances that you know scheduled railroad does not mean disruption and we are able to explain that and how they want to say show me. And as we\u2019ve said throughout the call today, their number one goal right now is to show them and I believe and history repeats itself towards the experience has been fast and we show people that we are better and we are substantially better than we were and substantially better than the competition that the business will begin to come back. But it\u2019s not something we can just flip a switch on, in some cases you\u2019ve got to win back across to the customer and that\u2019s the plan going into 2018.","And just I mean you know that the comps are harder in the first quarter.","Jason Seidl","It sounds like you guys will at least get a chance to win back that \u2013 you have a few months to win back that confidence here before some of these maybe your long commitments renew. Follow up question real quick, you guys got back into the Baltimore tunnel project after getting out of it, just wondering the thought process by now.","James Foote","No, my commitment was you know again there was a lot of dialogue with the city, the state, the federal representatives, the ports and literally I mean I was out of job about two and a half weeks and with years [ph] to go and in the U.S. Senate building and discuss the Baltimore tunnel project with those people and what I told them was that we would \u2013 Hunter had said no, we are not taking federal money to double stack this tunnel, we don\u2019t need it. And that we don\u2019t need the double stack tunnel. And what I told the individuals that I met with was I would undertake to take in my own look at this project and run the numbers again in terms of where we saw growth where if we needed to double stack the tunnel and also look at whether or not there are alternatives to double stacking the tunnel that meets the needs of the growing port, meet the needs of our customers and meet the needs of the government officials in terms of moving the public works projects forward. And we are in the process of both working our way through that, have not reached a conclusion. When we reach a conclusion I will go back personally and I will go back and meet with those groups and tell them what our decision is. But we haven\u2019t completed the work yet to be able to do that.","Jason Seidl","Oh, that\u2019s good color. I appreciate the time as always gentlemen.","James Foote","Thank you very much.","Kevin Boone","Operator that ends the call.","James Foote","Thank you so much everyone. Look forward to seeing you in New York in about I guess six weeks or whatever it is and again having a great dialogue with you at that time.","Operator","Thank you. And this concludes today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call. And you may disconnect your lines."],"6206":["CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) Q3 2016 Earnings Conference Call October 13, 2016  8:30 AM ET","Executives","David Baggs - VP, Treasurer and IR Officer","Michael Ward - Chairman and CEO","Frank Lonegro - CFO","Cindy Sanborn - COO","Fredrik Eliasson - Chief Sales and Marketing Officer","Analysts","Tom Wadewitz - UBS","Danny Schuster - Credit Suisse","Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley","Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays","Brian Ossenbeck - JP Morgan","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","Jason Seidl - Cowen","Ben Hartford - Robert W.

As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. During this call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode.","For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call to Mr. David Baggs, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations Officer for CSX Corporation.","David Baggs","Thank you, Sherlyn, and good morning, everyone and again welcome to CSX Corporation\u2019s third quarter 2016 earnings presentation. The presentation material that we\u2019ll reviewing this morning along with our expanded quarterly financial report and our safety and service measurements, are available on our website at CSX.com under the Investor section. In addition, following the presentation, the webcast replay will be available on that same website.","This morning, our presentation will be led by Michael Ward, the company\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Frank Lonegro, our Chief Financial Officer. In addition, Cindy Sanborn, our Chief Operating Officer; and Fredrik Eliasson, our Chief Sales and Marketing Officer will be available during the question-and-answer session.","Now, before I turn the presentation over to Michael, let me remind everyone that the presentation and other statements made by the company contain forward-looking statements. You are encouraged to review the company\u2019s disclosure and the accompanying presentation on slide two. This disclosure identifies forward-looking statements, as well as the uncertainties and risks that could cause actual performance to differ materially from the results anticipated by these statements. In addition, at the end of the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session with the research analysts.","With nearly 30 analysts covering CSX and out of respect for everyone\u2019s time, including our investors, I would ask as a courtesy for you to limit your questions to one primary question and one follow-up question.","And with that, let me turn the presentation over to CSX Corporation\u2019s Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer, Michael Ward. Michael?","Michael Ward","Thank you, David. Good morning everyone. Yesterday CSX reported third quarter earnings per share of $0.48, compared to $0.52 per share in the same period last year. Revenue declined 8% in the quarter, consistent with an overall volume decline of 8% which included a 21% decline in coal volume.","Turning to operations, safety performance remained strong and service levels continue to meet or exceed customer expectations driving further network efficiency improvements. In addition, CSX further reduced structural cost in the quarter and aligned resources levels to lower volume while retaining the ability to flex those resources with demand. Continuing to match resources to demand, combined with our ongoing initiatives to support network fluidity forming the foundation to maximize future merchandise and intermodal growth opportunities.","As significant cost savings partially offset the impact of lower volume and the changing business mix, operating income declined $92 million year-over-year to $841 million. At the same time the operating ratio increased 70 basis points year-over-year to 69.0%.","Before I hand the presentation over to Frank, let me thank our employees, customer and suppliers for their skillful planning and tireless efforts working together to manage the effects of Hurricane Matthew over the weekend and through this week. Times like this remind us of the paramount importance of safety for our employees, customers and the communities we serve, as well as the critical importance of the service we provide for American businesses.","Now I'll turn the presentation over to Frank who will take us through the third quarter results and fourth quarter outlook in more detail, Frank?","Frank Lonegro","Thank you, Michael and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by providing more detail on our third quarter results. As Michael mentioned, revenue was down 8% or $229 million versus the prior year, driven primarily by lower volumes. Total volume decreased 8%, which impacted revenue by about $220 million. In addition, fuel recoveries declined $63 million in the quarter, but was offset by strong coal pricing from an improved service product. Same store sales pricing for the third quarter was up 2.3% overall and 3.6% excluding coal.","Other revenue decreased $9 million driven mainly by lower incidental charges versus the prior year. Expenses decreased to 7% versus the prior year, driven mainly by $112 million in efficiency gains and $53 million in lower volume related cost.","Operating income was $841 million in the third quarter, down 10% from last year. Looking below the line, interest expense was up slightly from last year with higher debt levels partially offset by lower rates, while other income increased $11 million. And finally, income taxes were $260 million in the quarter, with an effective tax rate of about 36%. Overall net earnings were $455 million, down 10% versus the prior year and EPS was $0.48 per share, down 8% versus last year.","Now let me turn to the market outlook for the fourth quarter. Looking forward you will notice that the outlook reflects our adjusted market alignments. As released in our third quarter earnings, we are now referring to our markets as shown on this slide, which is consistent with how we are managing the business. The previous food and consumer market is now part of agricultural and food products, waste in the fly ash business have moved to chemicals and the equipment business now resides in the renamed metals and equipment market. Reclass volume, revenue and RPU information for the last three years are available on our Investor Relations webpage.","In 2016, CSX's fiscal calendar includes a 53rd week. And as such we will be reporting a 14 week fourth quarter. When taking the full quarter into account with an extra week versus the same period last year, we expect volume to be roughly flat. However, on a 13-week comparable quarter basis, we continue to see a soft but stabilizing industrial economy with volume down year-over-year.","In addition to the standard view we provide each quarter, which on the slide shows expectations for the 13 week comparable period, we have included a red, yellow, green designation to the far right, which shows the full quarter impact of the extra week on volume expectations. That said the market comments to follow reflect expectations on a 13 week comparable basis.","Automotive is again expected to grow as light vehicle production remained strong and new business continues to ramp up. Agricultural and food products is expected to be neutral, the record grain harvest will drive year-over-year gains. However market dynamics for ethanol remained challenged near-term for CSX due to increased movements in storage in the Gulf region. Export coal is also neutral as we are seeing some near-term increase in meteorological demand, driven by reduced Chinese supply such that volume should be similar to last year's levels.","We expect our full year export coal tonnage to be around 25 million tons. Chemicals will be down with continued weakness in drilling related products, especially crude oil due to low crude oil prices and unfavorable spreads. This impact more than offsets growth in core chemicals and the continued ramp up of new fly ash business. Domestic coal will again be down however, in the fourth quarter we will cycle the start of the pronounced market weakness, which took hold in the fourth quarter last year.","While the excess supply of natural gas continues to provide a price point that favors gas burn over coal, the easier comparables will moderate the rate of decline we have seen over the last several quarters.","We expect domestic coal tonnage to be relatively stable to what we saw in the third quarter. Intermodal will decline as we continue to cycle comparative losses in international in the fourth quarter. Additionally as we previously reported, we will continue to cycle some short-haul traffic loss in the domestic market, which began in the third quarter.","Absent to this we continue to experience strength in the domestic segment driven by our strategic network investments that support highway-to-rail conversions. Minerals will be down in the quarter as we cycle a strong period last year that benefited from an extended aggregate shipping season in the north due to mild weather late into the year.","Overall on a comparable 13 week basis, we expect volume to be down mid-single digits. Low crude oil, natural gas and other commodity prices, as well as strength in the U.S. dollar continue to challenge the rail marketplace. Although the impact of these factors is beginning to moderate as we move through a full year of this external climate. When we report earnings in the fourth quarter our GAAP numbers will include the full 14 weeks of volume in revenue. Again a preview of 14 week volume expectations has reflected to the far right of the slide, which in total represents about flat volume year-over-year.","When we report next quarter, we will provide a breakout of volume and revenue for the final week of fiscal year, which is a holiday week to facilitate year-over-year comparisons.","Turning to the next slide, let me talk about our expectations for expenses in the fourth quarter. As a result of aggressive cost actions we have achieved over $340 million of efficiency gains year-to-date and now expect full year productivity savings to be about $400 million.","Looking at the fourth quarter, the drivers for each expense category are shown on a comparable 13 week bases versus the prior year. Separately at the bottom of the slide we have provided guidance for the incremental cost associate with the 53rd week this year.","In addition, we will be cycling $48 million of restructuring cost in the fourth quarter, which impacted labor and fringe by $37 million and MS&O by $11 million in the prior year. Looking first at labor and fringe, we expect fourth quarter average headcount to be down slightly on a sequential basis. Although not to the same level we saw in the third quarter.","Labor inflation is expected to be around $30 million in the fourth quarter, which we expect to be more than offset by continued efficiency and volume related cost savings. Similar to this quarter, we expect a headwind in the fourth quarter of about $40 million versus the prior year, driven by higher incentive compensation. As a reminder, in 2015 we saw incentive compensation decrease in the second half of the year. As sharp declines in the energy markets coupled with broad based commodity and dollar impact drove CSX\u2019s financial results will below our initial expectations.","MS&O expenses expected to be relatively flat to the prior year with continued efficiency gains offsetting inflation. We expect fuel expense to decline the fourth quarter, with the higher cost per gallon year-over-year reflecting the current forward curve being more than offset by volume related savings and continued focus on fuel efficiency. We expect depreciation in the fourth quarter to increase around $15 million versus the prior year, reflecting the ongoing investment in the business, partially offset by the favorable impact of an equipment life study.","Equipment and other rents in the fourth quarter are expected to be relatively flat to the prior year with the benefit of improved car cycle times offsetting higher freight car rates and the increase in volume related cost associated with automotive growth.","Finally, fourth quarter expense will also be impacted by the extra week. And when we report earnings in the fourth quarter, we will provide detail to help you better understand the impact of the 53rd week.","Now, let me wrap up on the next slide. With macroeconomic and energy headwinds impacting most market, CSX once again delivered solid financial results in the third quarter. This success is driven by pricing for the relative value of rail service, driving efficiency gains and aligning resources to the softer demand environment, which partially offset an 8% volume decline this quarter.","To mitigate the weak demand we have taken significant cost actions this year, resulting in year-to-date efficiency savings of about $340 million and right sizing savings of around $200 million. We continue to pursue structural cost opportunity across the network and now expect full year efficiency savings to be about $400 million.","Looking at our expectations for the fourth quarter, as I mentioned previously we expect volume to be relatively flat to last year, which includes the impact of the extra week. We remain intensely focused on pricing to the value of our service and expect our strong cost performance to continue into the fourth quarter.","We will also be cycling an $80 million property gain from the prior year, which was below the line in other income in addition to cycling the $48 million in restructuring costs. As a result we expect fourth quarter earnings per share on a reported basis, including the impact of the extra week to be flat to slightly down versus the earnings we reported last year.","With that let me turn the presentation back to Michael for his closing remarks.","Michael Ward","Thank you, Frank. As you heard today CSX is continue to drive results for shareholders in this dynamic business climate by aggressively managing cost and delivering record efficiency savings. The men and women of CSX are working relentlessly to safely, efficiently and successfully serve our customers.","As we continue to manage through the current macroeconomic and energy environment we are simultaneously focused on positioning CSX to maximize opportunities going forward. The transformation into the CSX of tomorrow requires growth and increased profitability at our merchandise and intermodal businesses, while preserving the business value of coal as it becomes a smaller part of CSX going forward.","With that focus we\u2019ll continue to drive earnings growth and margin expansion for our shareholders as we redeploy capital to further improve the network, support new technology solutions and automation and enhance merchandise and intermodal operations. With continued population growth as well as the challenges facing the trucking industry, we remain confident in the long-term secular growth prospects for domestic intermodal.","In support of that vision we continue our multi-year strategy to add network capabilities and new service offerings. This strategy supports improved profitability and the ability to serve ever more service sensitive freight.","As we look to the future our core earnings power remained strong and the CSX of tomorrow will continue delivering compelling shareholder value as we further progress towards the target of a mid-60s operating ratio longer term.","And now we\u2019ll be pleased to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Your line is open you may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning Tom.","Tom Wadewitz","Good morning, Michael, good morning everyone and congratulations on the really strong results on the cost side obviously good execution. Wanted to -- on that topic just wanted to see if you could offer some thoughts about the run rate the $400 million you\u2019re talking about this year is very strong and see stay well what is the pipeline look like and what is the run rate look like going forward is that something that you can potentially sustain at $300 million or $400 million in 2017? How would you -- can you offer some thoughts on the pipeline and how much is already done and what you can offer looking forward? Thanks.","Cindy Sanborn","Okay, Tom good morning this is Cindy. Here\u2019s how I think about this year and going into next year. So when we as a company started looking at how coal was becoming less and less of our product mix or service product mix, we took a real hard look at how we needed to use our network differently to drive efficiencies, to drive margin expansion from the cost perspective.","So a big portion of what you have seen here this year is looking at structural changes in the coal fields and we\u2019re lapping those this month actually when we shut down Erwin and Corbin and so those would not obviously repeat going into future years.","But we\u2019re also have looked at driving density both on our routes, on our coal routes and density on our trains in terms of train link and while we are lapping some of the big steps that we were able to take with train links. We do see other opportunities for that it does require investments so the timing of it becomes contingent upon those investments being coming to provision.","And then there is a traditional productivity that we look at and have over many, many years and technology is a huge part of that so we\u2019re streamlining, streamlining to align with our core network, our network of tomorrow. And so when I think about that type of technology or that type of productivity. I see next year looking a little bit more normalized in terms of run-rate around offsetting inflation around $150 million.","But we don't put any upper limits on productivity. We are going to address and bring in everything we possibly can. And I think particularly technology lever is an exciting one for us both in terms of mobility and utilizing machine vision. And then other areas around predictive analytics to help us be more liable with our assets.","So I think you'll see us we pulled a lot forward into this year, which is part of what you're pulling on. I think we'll see a more normal year next year, but we are not leaving anything on the table.","Tom Wadewitz","So the 150 you mentioned that\u2019s a reasonable number to look at or that's kind of the core and you would expected to be beyond that?","Cindy Sanborn","That\u2019s a reasonable number to look at based on the investments we're going to make coming to provision.","Tom Wadewitz","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And next question comes from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Allison.","Danny Schuster","Hi, good morning this is Danny Schuster on for Allison. How are you doing this morning?","Michael Ward","Good.","Danny Schuster","So last year you had on a net basis a couple of pennies of one time benefits. So I guess I was just trying to understand if earnings are flat to slightly down in 4Q this year. Does that imply that core earnings are actually starting to grow? And should we see that trend accelerate with continued cost reductions, moderated coal volumes, export coal pricing for the next few quarters? Thank you.","Frank Lonegro","Hey, Danny it's Frank. We try to do this some insight into Q4 on a reported against a reported basis, so flat to slightly down to try to give you a sense of some normal seasonality in the business quarter-over-quarter, as well as perhaps a little bit of conservatism around what the impacts of the hurricane are ultimately going to be. So we try to give you some clarity there.","And I think what you're going to continue to see us do, as Cindy mentioned is continue to focus on a great service product and the productivity as well as strong pricing for the value of the service we provide. So the thesis will remain the same going forward. So I think we will try to give you some sense of where we'll end up the quarter and obviously that gives you some implication for the year and thinking about next year as well.","Danny Schuster","Great, thank you Frank.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. You may ask your question.","Rob Salmon","Hey, good morning, guys. Frank with your prior comments you alluded to incorporating some of a hurricane impact on the fourth quarter. Can you give us a sense of what's baked into the model? And then aside related -- actually different question, but we saw some really nice improvement in the intermodal RPU last quarter. Could you talk about your pricing initiatives within that segment and how much of that improvement was kind of the lapping out of some of the shorter length default business?","Frank Lonegro","Right so really three parts there I'll tackle the financial piece of the hurricane and kick it over to Cindy and let her talk about the hurricane impacts and then obviously Fredrick on the intermodal side.","We're still early in the process of understanding the impact of the hurricane. Cindy will talk about where we are operationally. We do have something modelled in there, but it's really just an early estimate until we get everything back up and running. And we do the tally and we really don't have a good number for you this morning. We'll be out in early November and we'll certainly have all of the things tied up by then and we'll give you sense of the impact then. But let me let Cindy talk about the operational piece.","Cindy Sanborn","Yeah as far as Hurricane Matthew, I think both from a preparation and recovery, our employees have done an outstanding job managing through a storm that was highly impactful in terms of the amount of territory that was affected. And so as of this morning, we are open on our core route on 995 albeit with the use of generators to provide power to our assets that require electricity crossings, and signalling systems with generators. And commercial power still not back we'll still be nursing those generators until we can get commercial power back.","But opening that route is very, very important to us, it's part of triangle of core operations. We do have yet still some branch lines that are out. So unable to serve those customers as of this point, but we see good equipment availability and energy around getting those routes restored as well.","And I think our impacts are going to be some will be capital, some will be operating expense. And then within that operating expense we'll see some cycle time impacts from the storm. But truthfully I am extremely pleased with where we are considering, where the hurricane affected us and how quickly we've been able to come back.","Michael Ward","And Cindy on some of those secondary lines the water has not even peaked yet. So until it does it's hard to even get in there and assess the damage really.","Cindy Sanborn","Yeah specifically in and around Lumberton North Carolina, we still have our railroad under several feet of water. And it's going to be days before those flood waters recede and obviously is affecting the community as well. And restoring service in all of these areas we feel like helps the communities recover as we bring in supply. So there is still quite a bit of work to do.","Fredrik Eliasson","And then in terms of the intermodal question we are continuing to get some price in intermodal obviously not as much as we have in the past because of the excess capacity that's out in the marketplace that is offset by what we're seeing on a fuel side. But we are also seeing some positive mix in the portfolio. Part of that is some of the short haul business that has shifted over. So overall we're pretty pleased with the performance we\u2019ve seen from an RPU perspective in intermodal business.","Rob Salmon","Well thanks so much for all the color and congrats on a great quarter and managing through really tough backdrop as well as even navigating the hurricane.","Michael Ward","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Ravi.","Ravi Shanker","Thanks good morning, everyone. So as a follow-up to that pricing question, your all in same-store pricing continues to remain above inflation which is great, but it has been sequentially declining a little bit. So how do we think about that in the fourth quarter and beyond? I mean what's the floor for that number, is at this level is that inflation? And does the bounce in export coal help you at all starting next quarter?","Fredrik Eliasson","Sure so in terms of overall same store sale pricing we're obviously very transparent. What we're doing there each and every quarter you'll have an opportunity to see that in the fourth quarter. There is clearly more difficult sale environment and it's been there for a period of time as we see a significant amount of excess capacity. Our focus continues to be to price the value that we provide our customer to be able to continue to reinvest. We have an improved service product year-over-year that is very helpful. And what we are trying to do is to sell through this trough so to speak and sale that kind of the long-term access to a network and the capacity that we have.","Specifically to export coal, I think we've been very transparent over the last couple of year that as the market has gone tougher since 2012 we have been taking our prices down to obviously optimize our own portfolio, but also to help strategically with some of the producers. We do have the ability to touch those contracts on essentially quarterly basis or some of those are index. And so with the uptick and the benchmark that we've seen here which obviously gives us an opportunity to leverage that uptick which is good news.","Ravi Shanker","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Hoexter","Great, good morning, thanks Michael. Just wanted to talk, you mentioned to Tom earlier about increasing car lengths and maybe more investments. Cindy is this something you need to make additional CapEx and spending on to be able to get even longer train lengths, is that something that you're starting to peak out or is there still additional room for productivity improvement?","Cindy Sanborn","Yeah, Ken. So I would say that we are making investments I've been talking the last couple of quarters about our route from Nashville to Cincinnati that we were investing in this year, that that would be in service as if the third quarter. So it is in service and we have seen some good improvement in link there. We were restricted to based on sidings to about 6,500 feet on that corridor. So it's that type of investment that we will continue across there about 12,000 feet.","So moving forward, we have identified locations to continue those types of investments. But as you relieve the pressure on the corridor that we just did, then you now find that you're meeting up against some other impacts on other corridor. So that's where we'll be looking and are looking in the process of assessing and or building to continue to improving train length.","Frank Lonegro","And Ken one other thing on CapEx, what Cindy is referring to is absolutely what we're going to do going forward it's a reallocation of capital within that longer term guidance that we've spoken about previously. So as you go into 2017 the things that are strategically aligned in terms of the network of the tomorrow highly automated railroads, service excellence, et cetera. Those are going to be within the compliance of the normal capital process. And as you size that next year I wouldn't think of that as being incremental investment versus reallocated investment within that portfolio.","Ken Hoexter","That\u2019s really helpful, thanks, Frank. Just Fred a follow-up if I may, on coal your thoughts on utility on where inventory levels are this is really interesting just given I don\u2019t know maybe the extended heat that we had here, but is there stabilization going on a domestic side and your thoughts are we at an inflection points perhaps where I don\u2019t know if inventory levels have come down far enough far enough or if net gas pricing is high enough you maybe just throw us some thoughts on the domestic side?","Fredrik Eliasson","Sure so clearly the hot summer has been helpful the cooling degree days has been very helpful especially in the South we\u2019ve seen significant reduction in the inventory levels, I think in the South in terms of days burn we\u2019re down to from 150 a year ago to somewhere around 100 now. And even in North we have come down a little bit, I would say though overall that they\u2019re probably still slightly above where they would like for them to be, in certain places they are less, certain places they are more, but they\u2019re probably still a little bit above where they would like it for them to be.","But it is good news that we\u2019re starting to see that and also to your point about natural gas prices they have come up a little bit, that\u2019s also helpful. But generally though we do need to see those natural gas prices closer to 350 or above to make really meaningful impact and we\u2019re excited where we\u2019re heading we\u2019ll have a much better view I think as we get into the fourth quarter and early next year in terms of what coal will do for 2017 not just on the domestic side, but also on the export side.","Ken Hoexter","Thanks for the thoughts. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Brandon.","Brandon Oglenski","Hey good morning, Michael and thanks for taking my questions. So when I look at these efficiency numbers, they are pretty big. When we\u2019re talking [indiscernible] $300 million to $400 million in efficiency this year, that would equate I don\u2019t know maybe greater than 3% on the operating ratio to 300 basis points. So I mean is that the type of improvement that investors should be thinking about as we look into \u201817 and beyond can we start to see 100-200 basis points improvement annually and the operating ratio if these efficiency targets hold and you get to a more stable or maybe even a growth environment?","Cindy Sanborn","So I think as I said before we had a pretty extraordinary year this year, which you\u2019re referring to which is part of our views on how our business mix has changed with a less reliance upon coal. And so there are some structural takeout that we put in place that can\u2019t repeat because it is structural around the coal markets. But going forward we have lapsed for this year some of our train link initiatives.","But as I mentioned in the last question we see opportunities going forward, we see productivity available to us that we traditionally have around streamlining again around our core network, which is part of our network of tomorrow. But I think run rate wise looking into 2017 it would be more of a $150 million offsetting inflation kind of number to face off of after having such a strong year this year.","But we don\u2019t stop thinking about ways to improve our efficiencies we understand that as our business mix changes, have to make our merchandise and intermodal our service products more profitable and from a cost -- and the operating department has a huge lever we have to pull on the cost side to make that happen.","So we\u2019re going to continue to look for those opportunities and drive it forward and I will say adding to that that we also are going to serve our customers effectively to provide a very good service for them that allows Fredrik to grow the business and price the business.","Michael Ward","Brandon one other thought is in terms of your allusion to growth there as we grow especially if we grow in class merchandise business in automotive and intermodal I mean you are going to see incremental margins that really pull on the operating leverage point. So in addition to the productivity line you should see the benefit of that again if the economy is cooperative for us longer term.","Cindy Sanborn","Yeah I should add we do see capability of adding growth in pretty much any market without adding cost back one for one. So we do see great leverage there.","Brandon Oglenski","Well I guess I don\u2019t want to be too critical here, but if what you\u2019re doing is offsetting inflation next year let\u2019s say on the productivity side this is going to come off as critical but how is the CSX of tomorrow any different than grow to 65 by 2015, which we heard in 2011? It just sounds like it\u2019s going to be a struggle to get a lot of operating ratio improvement unless something changes on the demand side or am I thinking about that wrong?","Cindy Sanborn","I mean, I think there is no -- everything on the table has been for as long as I've worked here. And we are continuing to make sure that there is any opportunity we have we're going to take advantage of.","So I think to your point it may seem not as strong as this year, but our objectives are to not just look at 2017 by itself, but also continuing into the future and drive operating margins on the cost side. And we're coming off a strong year. We think we can offset inflation next year, but we are not going to leave any opportunity out there on the cost side.","Michael Ward","Brandon this Michael, I mean obviously productivity is going to be key and as Cindy said always strive to do more than what she is talking about. But growth does have to be a critical component as we move to the mid-60s operating ratio. We've got already tempered economy here for the last two years and clearly growth has to be part of that equation. And we think with the service partners we have Fredrick's team can grow it once we see any signs of vibrant in the economy, but that is part of the equation.","Fredrik Eliasson","Yeah I mean Brandon we're confident in our ability to get to the mid-60s operating ratio. The timing of that is going to depend on the rate of decline in coal obviously. But continuing to focus on value pricing for the service product that we provide to our customers continuing to have productivity offset inflation. I mean you do get margin expansion by doing that year-over-year.","Brandon Oglenski","Okay, appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMC. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Ossenbeck","Hey, good morning thanks for getting me on the call here. So question on the coal network and rationalizing that further, obviously you made some actions with Erwin and Corbin that you're going to lap here pretty soon into next year. So what are you looking at when it comes to being able to take the next steps? Is it just coal volumes getting to a certain level, density is perhaps getting a little bit higher when you factor in some of the point-to-point pricing. So just kind of your thought process in how you -- what will you think just generally on timing for some of these initiatives to keep initiatives to keep moving in the coal fields?","Cindy Sanborn","Well I think we are going to serve our coal customers well. And that is Fredrick and I work and our teams work on that to make sure that we are available and capable of providing service to our coal customers. As things changed within the coal field even more than they already have, we will take the steps that we need to take to structurally change along with those changes. So we are prepared to continue to look there, but it's a profitable business for us and we intend to stay in that business where the customers are for as long as they are there.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay, thanks Cindy. Just Michael one follow-up on the growth that you mentioned. Port of Savannah was out maybe a couple of weeks ago now announcing a large expansion of the rail terminal there. It looks like they're going to double the capacity longer trains to facility. Is that volume starting to be spoken for attracting customers or do you really need to see the Port finish the complete expansion sometime in 2020 before that we really start to drive some more volume on your network? Thanks.","Fredrik Eliasson","Sure this is Fredrick, so what we're seeing and have been seeing is a continued shift towards more East Coast internationally intermodal coming in versus West Coast. And as a result the ports are clearly making investment not just Savannah, but other ports as well. And we are as well to make sure we can serve that. And that is attractive business that we want to get more of. And as we see additional investments come online we'll have an opportunity.","In the Savannah case we certainly have grown our business significantly there already. And we expect to continue to see that going forward. But that is true for the other ports as well.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay, thanks Fredrick.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Christian Wetherbee with Citigroup. Your line is open. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Christian.","Christian Wetherbee","Good morning, guys. My question is on CapEx, just kind of wondering as we look at the year-to-date progress so far towards the $2.7 billion number. There is still a lot left to go here, but I don't think you're kind a taking that 2.7 number down. I'm guessing that locomotive pull forward from 2017 might that will be backend weighted and might be part of that sort of $1 billion plus that I think you're targeting for the fourth quarter.","But just wanted to get a rough sense of maybe how we think about this number? And maybe thinking a little bit longer term to a previous question Frank you said it's sort of a reallocation and sort of where you're spending the capital. What is the right number to be thinking about of that reallocated capital is it a percent of revenue, is it an absolute number in the mid $2 billion type of range? I just want to get a rough sense of maybe how to think about that?","Frank Lonegro","Sure, hey Chris, Frank. So, on the 2.7, that is what we call our managed capital number, as part of that you\u2019ll have two things in there, you\u2019ll have the $300 million that we pulled forward from the seller financing of next year into this year and paying off locomotives as delivered. The other piece which will show up in other financing activities so not in the property additions line will be $300 million for paying off engines that we took delivery of last year.","So, your 2.7 is again, we\u2019re trying to be very transparent with you in terms of the capital dollars that we\u2019re spending this year, although you do have some geography differences on the cash flow statement. In terms of 2017, when you think about where we are, we are looking very hard at infrastructure and equipment given the environment that we\u2019re in and given the network of tomorrow strategy that we have.","What we have been talking about is normalized five or ten year view in retrospect for CapEx we generally spend somewhere between 12% and 15% of that capital portfolio on return seeking investments. But we\u2019re looking forward to doing on a going forward basis is to increase that allocation to more like 20% or 25% of the capital portfolio. So, not looking to necessarily increase capital based on the strategy, really looking to reallocate to make sure that we\u2019re focused on the things that are going to drive the value in the future.","Christian Wetherbee","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I appreciate that color and then the follow-up just sort of in the context of capital allocation across sort of the spectrum. When you think about next year, debt levels relative to share buybacks how does share buyback kind of pay into the long-term plan?","Frank Lonegro","Sure. It\u2019s part of the balanced deployment of capital certainly the primary focus of capital is going to be to reinvest in the business for a reliable railroad in accretive type investments. Secondarily would be the dividend piece and obviously we are looking hard at that since we took a break this year on the dividend, but we\u2019re going to look hard at that next year. And then looking at where we are on operating cash flow next year and sizing buyback program that generally we talk to you about in the end of the first quarter of the given year.","So, I think that order is important for the investors to keep in mind, and realizing that the environment that we are in now is perhaps quite a bit different than the environment that we were in 2015 when we increased the dividend by $0.02 and announced the two year $2 billion program that will complete by April of next year.","Christian Wetherbee","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you for the time, I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Your line is open, go ahead with your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Bas.","Bascome Majors","Hey, thank you, good morning. Frank, I want to drill down on another answer on the margins and cost side. Given the cost take out that you have achieved over the last several quarters, that\u2019s been a while sense since we\u2019ve had a year where you went from a big revenue decline to potentially return to growth and your best incrementals of the resent years have been around 50% on the margin side. I am just curious not necessarily saying that revenue will return next year, but when it does return given the takeout you\u2019ve done what kind of incremental ballpark are you thinking about in the business?","Frank Lonegro","When you look at what we\u2019ve done on the cost side, certainly that sets up incremental margins that are probably better than what they have been historically, but as I\u2019ve alluded to in the answer to the earlier question it really depends on how the business comes back. If it comes back in areas where you\u2019re adding a box car on to an existing train, an intermodal container on to an existing train, an auto rack on to an existing train that\u2019s really where you\u2019re going to get the incremental margins and the operating leverage that you\u2019re referring to if it\u2019s something that\u2019s on the box side of the business, which is going to be a new train start.","The incremental margins are going to essentially be what the absolute margins are in that business by and large. So, I do think we\u2019ve set ourselves up for a good run as the economic improves and as volumes comes back especially on the class side of the business.","Bascome Majors","Thank you for that. And just a bit of a housekeeping on your cost guidance for 4Q, the MS&O guide of flat year-over-year that signaling a pretty significant Q-over-Q growth maybe 12% or so. And I know you have the extra week but that\u2019s maybe 10 points or so above the typical sequential growth there. Can you just help us understand what\u2019s driving that beside above and beyond the extra week?","Frank Lonegro","Yeah, there is a few things on the sequential side to think through given that we have got some incremental bulk business on the export side, the grain side and the automotive side; we have got additional engines in freight cars in the mix relative to third quarter. So, clearly that\u2019s going to impact MS&O line on the materials and supply side.","We are expecting normal seasonality in terms of normal winter, we didn\u2019t see necessarily as much of that last year, but we\u2019re expecting this year just given what we understand the winter to hold, there is a normal seasonal shift between the third quarter and the fourth quarter as we stop the construction season as it gets too cold and too icy to work up North. So we do have that and then there\u2019s normally on the technology side as annual hardware software maintenance contracts come due so we have that just in terms of seasonality.","And then we\u2019re usually a little less fuel efficient as we get into the fourth quarter and we\u2019re going to pull on everything as you\u2019ve seen us do already this year, but as we set up a more normal fourth quarter that\u2019s how we see it going.","The other thing to think through is a lot of the hurricane side expenses to the extent that hit the OpEx line are going to hit here. So we got a little bit of piece in there. And then when you look at the productivity as we\u2019ve targeted about $400 million it implies about a $60 million run rate for the quarter and that\u2019s a little less than what we have seen in the third quarter. So you add all that up and it\u2019s going to be about flat on a year-over-year basis.","Bascome Majors","Thank you for your time.","Frank Lonegro","Thanks Bascome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Group","Hey, thanks good morning, guys. Wanted to just go back to coal for a second, Fredrick do you have the inventory levels for the North? And then on the met side how quickly do the export rates reset higher and can you just kind of frame what that opportunity is and maybe how much of the export rates dropped over the past five years? And kind of order of magnitude how much do you think that they can rebound?","Fredrik Eliasson","Sure in terms of the inventory levels we use Pyra data so in the North we went from about 95 days of burn, at this time last year we\u2019re down to 90 now and in the South 150 down to 102. So significant improvement, but as I said earlier still above what I would consider target level at this time of the year. But this target has obviously changed little bit more little more difficult these days because it depends on lot of where the utility is in the dispatch order, et cetera.","To your question about met obviously it\u2019s come down significantly and I don\u2019t have a number that I think we\u2019ve shared before, but it is a significant adjustment and you\u2019ve seen that play out in our RPU line since really since 2012. And as we now sit here and we\u2019ve seen the benchmark go up to 200 from 90 to 50 I think it was in the third quarter that is an opportunity for us to leverage. And our contract have evolved overtime to be essentially quarterly or based on an index that is tied to the benchmark.","Scott Group","Okay. And then just lastly for Frank I know we\u2019ve got big incentive comp headwind in fourth quarter, third quarter should we be thinking about a similar large headwind in the first half of next year too or do we kind of moved to more of a normalized incentive comp run rate on a year-over-year basis \u201817?","Frank Lonegro","Yeah, more normalized.","Scott Group","Okay perfect. All right thank you guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Seidl with Cowen. Your line is open.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Jason.","Jason Seidl","Thank you, operator. Good morning everyone, I guess I\u2019ll piggy back a little bit on that coal question, when you talk about more normalized target levels where would you put those target level in both your southern and northern regions?","Fredrik Eliasson","Well as I said in the past we have used the targeted days burn somewhere around 55 in the North, 70 in the South. However I do think that I could be a little bit misleading these days because of the fact that utilities are situated very differently in terms of where they are in the dispatch order. It was easier to give those target levels in the past when you were the base load.","Now it varies really by utility-by-utility, but the good news is we made significant in-roads especially in the South and we\u2019re getting closer to a more normalized level and there are utilities and we\u2019ve seen this year over the last three months that clearly are below where they want to be, but we still have several utilities that are significantly above.","Jason Seidl","Okay. And when you look at sort of that 350 bogie you brought up with natural gas, if we are well above that for a considerable amount of time what percent of the business do you think of your coal business is going to be positively affected by that?","Fredrik Eliasson","Yeah so if you look at where we were here this quarter we had about 58% of our business either came from Illinois Basin or Powder River Basis. We saw a pretty significant shift towards Illinois basin within that number. And we have said publically that when it is 350 or above that part of our portfolio so 58% of portfolio is essentially in the money. And that will allow for a significant increased utilization of those plants. Now there is a lot of other factors that plays into that. Clearly whether the plants are located makes a big difference.","As you all know that the natural gas prices are 350 is Henry Hub price. It is very different in certain parts of our service territory. But as a general rule I still think that holds pretty well in terms of indication over the plants that we serve become more competitive.","Jason Seidl","Thank you and that was very helpful. I guess my follow-up question is going to be on the pricing side, when you look at intermodal merchandise still well above your cost inflation, but it did decelerate on a sequential basis. How are you thinking about sort of that truck competitive market going forward? It looks like we've had a little bit of uptick on the spot side here and with ELDs coming up. What are you guys looking for in \u201817 on that market?","Fredrik Eliasson","Sure, I mean it is clear that we've had a tough market for an extended period of time now in terms of excess capacity. And it does impact not just intermodal business, but certain markets within our merchandise business as well. Generally shorter haul also generally lower contributory traffic that are more susceptible to being switched over to truck.","As the market turns and it will turn we see new orders of truck of Class A trucks have come down significantly 30% 40% year-over-year , year-to-date. We know ELDs will be coming in by sometime in the second half of next year. And if the economy continues to expand and unemployment stays low that should lead to a much better environment as we get into late \u201817 and that will be helpful.","So our challenge to our team right now is to sell that improved service product that we have sell through this kind of trough and sell the long-term access to our network that allows us to continue to reinvest in our business.","Jason Seidl","Fredrik thank you for all that color and everyone thank you for your time as always.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Hartford with Baird. Your line is open, go ahead with your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Ben.","Ben Hartford","Hey, good morning all. Cindy could you talk about when you would anticipate a trough in the employee count, is there any sort of visibility to that during the fourth quarter or in the early part of 2017?","Frank Lonegro","Hey it's Frank. What we did was we guided to down slightly sequentially, but also put a bit of a qualifier on that one given the fact that we were probably down more than slightly sequentially from Q2 to Q3. So we're continuing to look across the board at all areas of resources whether it's train and engine crews or folks in the rest of the operating department and folks on the G&A side, I mean which you\u2019ve seen is and across the board approach in terms of overall productivity as well as on the resource side and challenging the need for every dollar and every vacancy when it comes up we're taking a look at it and making sure whether or not we need to fill that.","So I think you're going to see us focused, although the magnitude of the decreases on a year-over-year basis are obviously going to get smaller and smaller as we go forward. But you'll continue to see us look very hard at resources. Cindy you want to add anything to that?","Cindy Sanborn","I think you hit it.","Ben Hartford","Good. And then Fredrick if I could ask you just more of a conceptual question on the volume side, volumes over the past 10 or 15 years have been flattish to even down, obviously coal the coal headwind have been noted. So as we look forward the economic environment uncertain if we use industrial production growth as a guide. Do you have confidence or any sort of visibility to volume growth more closely approximating even whatever U.S. IP growth ends up being as coal as we transition away from coal given the volume growth opportunities longer term on the intermodal side. Or is that 10 to 15 year trend of kind of flattish volumes in the business. Is that still a pretty appropriate bogie to think about over the three to five years?","Fredrik Eliasson","Yeah, I think absolutely. I think that if you look at long period of time if you take out the coal business you just look at the correlation between IDP in our merchandise business it has correlated pretty well where they probably with a slightly underperformed IDP over an extended period of time several decades.","As I think about 2017, right now and obviously we are in the middle of our planning season and getting a lot of feedback for our customer, if you take out our coal business and also the crude-by-rail business which is energy related, if you take that out and we look at the rest of the portfolio our merchandise and our intermodal business we feel pretty good about what the portfolio can do here after a very tough period of time.","And then we have pretty good confident that based on the economic indicators we\u2019re seeing right now based on the feedback from the customer that we can return to more normalized growth environment next year in our non-energy businesses. We will have a much better sense of the energy businesses as we get through the fourth quarter, but we are encouraged by what we are seeing in terms of our initial planning assumptions right now.","Ben Hartford","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Your line is open, you may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning Cherilyn.","Q - Cherilyn Radbourne","Thanks very much and good morning. One of the things that really stood out in the quarter for me was just the year-over-year improvement in labor efficiency, just given the volume decline that you were facing. Just wondering if you can give us some practical examples of how you are continuing to generate that labor productivity?","Cindy Sanborn","Hi, Cherilyn thanks. I think one of the better examples would be our longer train initiatives so looking at density of trains and being able to operate the same number of cars with in fewer chunks. I think we also are utilizing technology to help us as well and being able to automate processes. So those are probably two of the bigger examples I could give you.","Frank Lonegro","And make sure just in terms of sort of raw orders of magnitude the 3,900 or so positions that we were down year-over-year, the majority of those and this is both the efficiency side as well as the volume variable side come out of the train and engine mechanical and the op support side of the business, but engineering, intermodal, G&A are also down year-over-year I mean we are down across the board in terms of resources on a year-over-year basis.","And I think you are going to continue with perhaps the exception of technology as we really go into the highly automated railroad part of our strategy, I mean pretty much every group is trying to be as lean as they can.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Great, Thank you. That\u2019s all for me.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Vernon with Bernstein. Your line is open, go ahead with your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, David.","David Vernon","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Congratulations on the productivity here, this is obviously been the big part of the story this year. As we think about next year and the growth being a little bit more in the scheduled network businesses around merchandise and intermodal. Should we be thinking that the incremental fall through on that businesses could actually be a little bit better than maybe we have seen the incremental margins on average run in the past?","Frank Lonegro","Yeah I think with the expenses that we have taken out in the scheduled network and sort of across the board that obviously sets us up for incremental margins that are healthy and perhaps a little bit better than they have been in the past. So, yes, this is the answer to the question.","David Vernon","Excellent. And then maybe just kind of if we think about the business in the couple of years let\u2019s say if we\u2019re kind of flat in volume, obviously the productivity has been a big of it, but how should we be thinking about the sort of organic earnings potential in the business over the next couple years? Do you mean is it possible to continue to pull out cost and grow for a few years or do you think it\u2019s going to be a little bit more of kind of holding the line just in kind of a flat growth environment?","Frank Lonegro","I think you are flat on volume and don\u2019t have any mix impacts associated with it, it\u2019s really going to be what we\u2019ve been able to do in the past which is we\u2019ll continue to offset inflation with productivity, we\u2019ll continue to have value pricing that will fall to the bottom-line and the combination of those two things. We\u2019ll provide margin expansion on a year-over-year in the environment that you mentioned.","David Vernon","So you see, you actually expects a little bit of sustainable earnings power even if there was a little even we\u2019re in a flat volume environment?","Frank Lonegro","Correct.","David Vernon","Excellent. Thanks very much for your time guys and congratulations about the great quarter.","Frank Lonegro","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Your line is open, go ahead with your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks, good morning. Automotive remains an area of strength for you, just curious how sustainable do you think it is just from an end market perspective and also you sight new business ramp ups in the slide deck. What type of contribution should we think about over the coming quarters there? Thanks.","Fredrik Eliasson","Sure, so, obviously auto has been at a pretty high level here this year in terms of production I think the latest estimate that I've seen is about 79 in terms of production. We're more closely tied to production and the sales. And next year the latest estimate that I have is a slight increase to about 18 million vehicles and so that's helpful. We have onboard some new customers this year that has helped. And the contribution of that traffic is very attractive.","And it has been great journey for the automotive market overall coming out of recession. But it is probably fair to say that at the moment it looks like we're hitting that high watermark so to speak.","We don\u2019t see necessarily coming down significantly from that. We think we're going to move more inline what we're currently seeing. But obviously we're being nimble there as well and to adjust our resource level whether it's up or down. But right now the best estimate is for relatively flat environment for 2017.","Scott Schneeberger","Great, thanks. And then Cindy just following up on efficiency savings so we can infer here that you're looking for maybe a base level of 150 as we look out into \u201817 as we look at our models and think about kind of the cadence through next year. Is there anything special to keep in mind down that front or it's just a progressive build? Thanks.","Cindy Sanborn","Yeah, I don't think there is anything specific that would cause you to want to put different values and for the different quarters. It will be pretty much across the board even.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Long with Stephens. Go ahead with your question, your line is open.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Justin.","Justin Long","Thanks and good morning. So my first question was on coal. There are a lot of people that believe industry coal volumes will be up next year. I know you said 4Q whether it will be important in terms of how things play out in 2017. But just assuming normal weather patterns, do you have any high level directional thoughts on how your coal volumes could trend next year?","Fredrik Eliasson","Well I guess the only directional comment that I would say is that it looks like by the end of this year over a five year period we would have lost about $2 billion of coal revenue. And this year alone probably in excess of $0.5 billion. So based on what we're seeing right now, we think next year's decline will be significantly less than that.","But beyond that, I really do think I want to stick with what I said earlier which is that we'll have update for you when we do the fourth quarter earnings call both on a domestic side and on the export side. Because I think I think we'll be in a much better position as we are in the process of gathering our information from the utilities the 40 to 50 utilities that we serve. And I think that's the best way to give you guidance is to take the input that we get from them. So that it's a lot more accurate than trying to speculate at this point.","Justin Long","Got it. But you seem to imply with your commentary that directionally you think it will be down next year. You're just not willing at this point to quantify that?","Fredrik Eliasson","Yeah, I think that's probably directional what I'm trying to say. I think that clearly the fact that natural gas prices are come up is helpful, it is still not at 350. Inventory levels are still above what they should be. And we only have about 1 million tons or so that probably will come out next year in terms of plant closure. So that number is getting a lot smaller. But nevertheless I think as we look at the crystal ball right now, that is probably a safe place to be. But as I said a cold winter natural gas prices move up above the 350 mark. And that picture can change very rapidly.","Justin Long","Thanks, that's really helpful. And one quick follow-up I wanted to ask on pricing. Fredrick I believe you said you were still getting price in intermodal. But could you say if your intermodal pricing is above inflation or given the truck competition we're seeing. Are we seeing below inflation price increases in that intermodal business?","Fredrik Eliasson","We've historically given you the breakdown in the two categories that we have merchandise and intermodal combined in all end. I think we'll stay at that level. Pricing is a critical part for us in order to continue to reinvest in the business and especially in the intermodal since we put so much of our incremental capital towards intermodal.","So being able to have the traffic at contributory levels we continue to push prices is a critical part of that strategy. And we are getting positive price exactly where it is. I think we'll keep those buckets that we have in place today.","Justin Long","Okay, fair enough. I appreciate the time and congrats on the quarter.","Operator","Thank you. And next question comes from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open, go ahead with your question.","Suneel Manhas","Good morning, this is Suneel Manhas stepping in for Walter Spracklin. So just circling back you mentioned how your East Coast volumes are seeing a bit of a bump and just wondering how much of that volume bump is coming to the Panama Canal? And are you seeing shifting of buy patterns, and how should we think about that impact moving forward? Thanks so much.","Fredrik Eliasson","Sure, so this is Fredrik again. We have seen the shift for an extended period of time, that we see more of our international cargo coming in on the East Coast porch. We have not seen a significant change in the amount of volume coming in since the Panama Canal got widened.","What we are seeing that there are some bigger vessels coming in, but generally it is not necessarily adding capacity. They are reconfiguring the strengths, there are fewer vessels and we\u2019re also seeing some realignment with vessels that before came through the Suez Canal that is now coming through the Panama Canal instead.","But we are -- so there\u2019s not significant change, but the pattern has been there for a long time and we do expect that pattern to continue that we will be more and more of that volume come through the East Coast porch.","Suneel Manhas","Got it, okay thanks so much. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you our final question comes from Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open, go ahead with your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Konigsberg","Hey, good morning guys thanks for taking my question. You guys covered quite a bit of ground, just question on inflation it sounds just on the commentary in regards to efficiency, do you still expect it to remain pretty muted next year in the realm of 1.5%, but just looking at the labor, some cost incremental you\u2019re talking about for Q4 that\u2019s running around 4% probably includes a little bit extra from the extra week. And then just metal prices have been strong maybe rolling up a little bit now, but is the expectation you were still going to be living in a pretty muted environment into \u201817 despite some of the indicators that say it could be a little bit higher?","Frank Lonegro","Yeah I think on the inflation side we have been in a little bit of a muted environment here in the last couple of years. When you start thinking about the inflation more broadly, as well as GDP and IDP potentially going up there could be a little bit of a pressure on the upside, there is a little bit of nuance in the second half of the year before they were infringe inflation that you\u2019re picking up on which is wage accruals that came up starting in the middle of the year. So there\u2019s that in there rather than a sort of a core external inflation run rate that\u2019s out there.","But I think what you\u2019re hearing from us is regardless of what inflation is we\u2019re going to do our level best to more than offset that with productivity. So I think having something in that 150, 175 range for inflation next year is probably a good start in place and we\u2019ll offset that with productivity.","Brian Konigsberg","Great. If I could just follow a real quick one just on the intermodal and the expectation that I guess pricing does firm a little bit later next year has supply in trucking comes down and ELD go into place does that assumption -- does it require improving demand for you to see improving pricing in that business or if we ran it just kind of where we stand today does that make it a bit more challenging?","Fredrik Eliasson","Yeah, I mean it really is supply and demand picture so if you have ELDs and other regulatory constraints put pressure on the supply side clearly additional growth in economy is also helpful. And if you remove one or two of those it\u2019s going to prolong the period where we see this excess capacity. So we\u2019re obviously following this very closely and hoping for an economy that picks up more than we currently expect that could be very helpful both in terms of our volume initiatives, but also in terms of pricing.","Brian Konigsberg","Understood, great thanks guys.","Michael Ward","Thank you we\u2019ll see you all next time, next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call.

As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. During the call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode.","For opening remarks and introduction, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. David Baggs, Vice President of Capital Markets and Investor Relations for CSX Corporation. Sir, you may begin.","David Baggs","Thank you, [Glen], and good morning, everyone, and welcome again to CSX Corporation\u2019s second quarter 2013 earnings presentation. The presentation material that we will review this morning along with our quarterly financial report and our safety and service measurements, are available on our website at csx.com under the Investors Section. In addition, following the presentation this morning a webcast and podcast replay will be available on that same website.","Here, representing CSX Corporation this morning are Michael Ward, the Company\u2019s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Clarence Gooden, Chief Sales and Marketing Officer; Oscar Munoz, Chief Operating Officer; and Fredrik Eliasson, Chief Financial Officer.","Now before we begin the formal part of our program, let me remind everyone that the presentation and other statements made by the Company contain forward-looking statements. You\u2019re encouraged to review the Company\u2019s disclosure in the accompanying presentation on slide two. This disclosure identifies forward-looking statements as well as risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance to differ materially from the results anticipated by these statements.","In addition, let me also remind everyone that at the end of the presentation, we\u2019ll conduct a question-and-answer session with the research analysts. With now 31 analysts covering CSX, I\u2019d ask as a courtesy to everyone to please limit your enquiries to one primary and one follow-up question.","And with that, let me turn the presentation over to CSX Corporation\u2019s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Michael Ward. Michael?","Michael J. Ward","Well, thank you, David and good morning everyone. Last evening CSX reported second quarter earnings per share of $0.52, a 6% increase in the same period last year. The financials benefited from overall revenue growth, excellent operating results, and a few items that Fredrik will outline later in the presentation.","On the revenue side, we were encouraged by the solid growth across many of our markets, offsetting the ongoing challenges in coal. Overall revenue was up slightly on a 1% volume growth combined with the team\u2019s ability to drive solid core pricing for the service value CSX is providing. At the same time, we continue to deliver consistently high performances in safety, service, and efficiency in the pace of a broad range of economic and market conditions that continue to be dynamic.","Those results help to increase the operating income to a record $963 million for the quarter and improve the operating ratio to a record 68.6%. As you\u2019ve viewed the presentation today, you\u2019ll see a Company that is capable of consistently delivering value by leveraging the diversity and value of its product offering and maintaining a relentless focus on running an excellent railroad.","Now I\u2019ll turn my presentation over to Clarence Gooden, who will provide a more in-depth analysis of the topline results and a forward outlook. Clarence?","Clarence W. Gooden","Thank you, Michael, and good morning. Looking at the key economic indicators that continue to point to a slow steady growth in the U.S. economy. In June the Purchasing Managers Index registered a rating of 50.9, reflecting a modest expansion of U.S. manufacturing. At the same time, the Customers Inventory Index registered a rating of 45, indicating respondents believe their inventories are still below normal levels.","Looking at the right side of the chart, both GDP and IDP rates reflected modest expansion in the quarter. Although the second quarter growth estimates were below April expectations. Forward projection still show slow steady growth for the second half. Overall, demand across the diverse markets we serve was generally positive for the quarter, consistent with a broader economy.","Now let\u2019s take a look at the overall revenue. Total revenue increased $57 million year-over-year, approaching $3.1 billion in the quarter. Starting to the left, the combination of rate and mix was favorable by $32 million in the quarter. Here core pricing gains and liquidated damages, were partially offset by the unfavorable mix impact related to growth in intermodal and the decline in coal.","Moving to the right, volume had a favorable impact of $26 million in the quarter as volume declines in coal were more than offset by growth in the merchandise and intermodal markets. Finally, fuel recovery declined $1 million in the quarter.","Now, let\u2019s turn to pricing. Core pricing on a same-store sales basis remained solid across nearly all markets. Recall the same-store sales are identified as shipments with the same customer, commodity and car type, and the same origin and destination. These shipments represented nearly 80% of CSX\u2019s traffic base for the quarter.","Looking at the chart, overall pricing shown as the blue bars, improved 2.3% in the quarter, reflecting less difficult comparisons in the export coal market as we begin to cycle rate reductions put in place during 2012. The gold bars, which exclude export coal, show pricing gains of 4.1% in the quarter consistent with the performance in prior periods.","On either basis, pricing exceeded rail inflation, which was low this quarter. A strong service product provides a solid foundation for pricing above rail inflation, which supports reinvestment over the long-term. We are confident in the value of our service product to remain focused on driving profitable growth.","Let\u2019s turn to the next slide and take a closer look at the volume. Total volume was up 1% in the quarter versus the same period last year, with increases across most of the broad sectors we serve.","The intermodal, industrial and construction sectors delivered solid growth in the quarter. High service levels helped drive growth in the domestic intermodal market and captured opportunities in both the growing domestic and oil and gas industry and the recovering construction markets.","The agricultural sector was flat with growth in phosphates and fertilizer offset by the ongoing challenges in feed grains, soybeans and ethanol. The coal story was mixed. Domestic volume was up 5% against a very weak second quarter last year while export volume was down sharply.","Now let's look at the individual markets in more detail and starting with coal. Coal revenue declined 6% to $770 million. Domestic coal shipments benefited from higher natural gas prices on a year-over-year basis although domestic coal demand has stabilized, inventory levels at southern utilities still remain high.","Export coal volume declined 23% on soft demand for U.S. thermal coal particularly in Europe where broader economic conditions remain weak. Total revenue per unit was flat with strong domestic pricing gains offsetting lower export pricing.","Domestic pricing continued to benefit from the ongoing implementation of the utility contract structure that splits the conventional rate into two components; a fixed quarterly charge that does not vary with volume and a variable charge for each ton moved during the quarter. As a result, revenue per unit will vary more under this structure.","During periods of low volume, the revenue per unit will be higher as the fixed component will be spread across fewer units conversely. Revenue per unit will decline during periods of high volume. That said, these contracts continue to reinforce our overall philosophy of securing inflation plus pricing which imports reinvestment and reflects the value of the service we are providing to our customers.","Looking ahead we expect third quarter domestic volume to be relatively stable on a sequential basis although down 5% to 10% for the quarter and the full year. At the same time our best estimate for 2013 export coal volume remains about 40 million tons with a more unfavorable demand environment in the second half of the year.","Next, let's look at merchandize. Overall merchandize revenue increased 4% to nearly $1.8 billion. Chemicals was the key driver in the industrial sector growing 11% on strength and energy related products including crude oil, liquefied petroleum gas and frac sand. The agricultural sector was flat as increased phosphate and fertilizer shipments offset the continued weakness in the feed grain, soybean and ethanol shipments.","Regarding the construction sector, building products and aggregates increased due to higher construction activity and the continued recovery in the residential housing market. This was partially offset by lower military and machinery shipments.","Looking at the third quarter, growth is expected in the industrial sector driven by ongoing opportunities in chemicals particularly in the commodities related to oil and gas drilling. The automotive market will also remain strong although we continue cycling tough comparables.","We expect the agricultural sector to recover with the anticipated improvement in crop yields supporting growth in grain shipments primarily for animal feed. Finally we anticipate that steady recovery in the construction sector will drive growth in building products and aggregates.","Moving to the next page, let's review intermodal. Intermodal revenue increased 4% to $425 million. Record domestic volume was up 4% driven by growth with our existing customers and highway to rail conversions. International volume grew less than 1% as growth with existing customers and from new service offerings was partially offset by volume lost to a carrier port shift.","Total intermodal revenue per unit increased 2% on core pricing gains. Looking forward we continue to make strategic investments in our intermodal network to drive profitable growth. Over 90% of CSX's intermodal volume currently operates in double stacked lanes. That number will grow into the mid 90s by the end of 2015 further improving efficiency and expanding capacity.","New terminal construction is progressing as planned in Winter Haven, Florida and Montr\u00e9al. In addition, expansions are underway in Atlanta and Louisville and an expansion of our Northwest Ohio hub is already in the planning stages. These investments will expand our network reach, increase capacity and will allow the introduction of new service offerings that support profitable growth.","At the same time we continue to generate growth opportunities through our highway to rail or H2R initiative. We are working jointly with our channel partners to market the compelling value of intermodal rail transportation to targeted customers and further tap into an estimated 9 million truckload opportunity which aligns very well with our network.","Let's turn to the outlook for the third quarter. For the third quarter, we expect stable to favorable conditions for 83% of our markets and the overall volume is neutral to slightly positive. The outlook for agricultural products is favorable with the anticipated improvement in crop yields supporting growth in grain shipments.","Automobile or light truck production will remain strong with annual production estimates now exceeding 16 million vehicles. We expect growth in chemicals as we continue to capture opportunities created by the expanding domestic oil and gas industry. Intermodal growth will continue as our strategic network investments and service reliabilities support the highway to rail conversions.","Domestic coal volumes is expected to be stable sequentially but down 5% to 10% for the third quarter and the full year. Finally, export coal volume will again be lower on softer demand for U.S. thermal coals.","Thank you. I'll now turn the presentation over to Oscar to review our operating results.","Oscar Munoz","Thank you, Clarence, and good morning everybody. As is customary I discuss safety results at the beginning of each of these operations review to make it clear that safety is our first and foremost priority. Unfortunately, I need to make everyone aware the tragic loss of two CSX employees this past week in separate incidents. The overriding focus of our safety programs to avoid such catastrophic events and we are rapidly completing our investing of how these events unfolded and the lessons learned will promptly be applied to our operation. I want the colleagues, friends, family of these two gentlemen who might be listening to this call this morning to know that our hearts go out to them. At CSX we are all passionate about sending each person home safely every day and we must never ever lose sight of this goal.","Now if you'll allow me, let me review the company's overall safety results on this slide 15. The chart on the left shows FRA personal injury rate which was 0.93 for the quarter. This rate is higher than the prior period and underscores our need to remain focused on safety each and every day.","The chart on the right shows the FRA train accident rate which improved by 7% to 1.81 and reflects our continued commitment to accident reduction. We will remain diligent in our efforts to keeping our employees and the communities where we work and serve.","Now let's turn to the next slide and review the operating results for the quarter. Here on slide 16 you can see the on-time originations on the left and on-time arrivals on the right. Both measures improved in the second quarter with on-time originations at 91% and on-time arrivals at 82%. Both measures are at record levels.","I'm very pleased with these results that represent the culmination of hard work and dedication of all CSX's 31,000 employees during a quite challenging second quarter. Furthermore, these results demonstrate our commitment to a shared purpose founded on customer service.","Let's look at the system performance on the next slide. Terminal dwell and velocity provide a picture of how efficiently cars and locomotives are moving across the network. CSX's continued momentum in these two measures illustrates the company's ongoing commitment to improved asset utilization.","Look at the chart on the left; we drove a 6% improvement in terminal dwell for the quarter to a record low 21.9 hours. This means cars are spending less time sitting in terminals and thus more time in productive freight service.","Velocity also showed improvement once again, up 3% to 23 miles per hour with improvement across all three networks; coal, merchandize and intermodal. Strong on-time performance, dwell and velocity are win-win as our customers received great service and you our investors get ever improving ROA.","Now let me review with you the company's improvement in operating efficiency on slide 18 which complements the better service we are providing to our customers. Carloads were up 1% in the second quarter and gross ton miles, the best measure of our true workload, was up nearly 2%. CSX absorbed this additional workload in the quarter with fewer resources on a year-over-year basis. Moving down the chart you can see road crew starts were nearly 3% lower than last year as volume growth was largely incorporated into existing trains and we improved our train crew productivity. In fact both active locomotive count and total operations employment were lower by over 4% in the quarter reflecting our improved operating environment.","Now let me wrap up on the next slide. Safety remains a primary focus for us and we urge our employees every day to look out for and support one another in this endeavor. Service and customer satisfaction remain at high levels and we delivered these great operating results by simultaneously improving our resource utilization. As such we remain on track to deliver over $150 million in efficiency savings this year. CSX remains committed to providing flexible solutions for customers to enable sustainable growth driving significant long-term value for our shareholders.","With that let me turn the presentation over to Fredrik to review the financials.","Fredrik Eliasson","Thank you, Oscar, and good morning everyone. Looking at the top line revenue increased 2% in the second quarter, gains in merchandize and intermodal offset the declines in coal. At the same time other revenue which included a $16 million increase in liquidated damages also contributed to the year-over-year improvement. Expenses also increased 2% as wage and material inflation, higher depreciation and volume related costs more than offset savings from improved efficiency. Operating income was a record $963 million up 2% versus the prior-year.","Looking below the line, interest expense was $140 million, other income was $9 million and income taxes were $297 million reflecting $17 million or $0.02 per share of tax benefits in the quarter. While this resulted in an effective tax rate of 35.7% for the quarter we continue to expect a tax rate of approximately 38% going forward. Overall net earnings were $535 million up 4% versus last year and EPS was $0.52 per share up 16% versus last year reflecting growth in net earnings and the impact of share repurchases.","As we turn to the next slide, let's briefly discuss how fuel lag impacted the quarter. On a year-over-year basis the effect of the lag in our fuel surcharge program was $4 million unfavorable. This reflects $13 million of positive in quarter lag during the second quarter of 2013 versus $17 million of positive in quarter lag for the same period last year. Based on the current forward curve the fuel lag impact would be slightly favorable next quarter primarily driven by the cycling of $16 million of unfavorable in quarter lag in the third quarter of last year.","Turning to the next slide, let's review our expenses. Overall expenses increased 2% in the quarter. I will talk about the top three expense items in more detail over the next few slides, but let me briefly speak to the bottom two on this chart. Depreciation was up 5% to $276 million due to the increase in the net asset base. Going forward, we continue to expect depreciation to increase sequentially by few million dollars each quarter reflecting the ongoing investment in our business. Lastly, equipment rent was down 6% to $96 million driven by a reduction in locomotive leases and car hire expense.","Now let's discuss labor and fringe in more detail. Labor and fringe expense increased 4% or $33 million versus last year. Looking at the chart on the left, total headcount was down 3% versus last year and up 1% sequentially to report a seasonal increase in demand and hiring ahead of attrition. Moving to the table on the right, improved efficiencies more than offset high workload in the quarter to drive $19 million in net efficiencies and volume cost savings. Moving down the table, incentive compensation expense was up $24 million versus last year and labor inflation was up $18 million with core wage inflation remaining below 4%. Rounding out the table, other costs were $10 million higher for items that are not expected to reoccur.","Looking at the second half, headcount should be roughly flat on a sequential basis although as we\u2019ve demonstrated over the past several quarters, we will continue to adjust our resources to reflect the current volume levels and drive efficiency. In addition we expect labor inflation to continue to increase by $15 million to $20 million year-over-year for the remaining quarters and the quarterly incentive compensation headwind to be similar to what we experienced in the second quarter.","Next, let\u2019s review MS&O expenses on slide 25. MS&O expense increased 2% or $10 million versus last year with the key driver shown in the table on the right. Total real estate gains reduced MS&O expenses by $16 million reflecting two items. The first one relates to $22 million gain on rail assets and easements. The second one relates to SunRail gain, which was $14 million in the period, or $6 million unfavorable year-over-year. As a remainder there will be no further material gains related to the SunRail transaction going forward. Moving down the table inflation increased by $10 million and train accidents and other increased by $16 million primarily driven by cost related to a few derailments including the accident in Rosedale, Maryland.","Moving to the next slide, let's discuss the impact of fuel. Total fuel cost decreased 3% or $13 million versus last year. Looking at the table to the right, fuel efficiency was favorable by $10 million reflecting a 3% year-over-year improvement in gallons consumed per gross ton mile. Next, as shown in the chart on the left, CSX average cost per gallon for locomotive fuel decreased to $3.08, down 2% versus last year driving a decrease of $7 million as seen in the chart on the right. Rounding out the table, higher volume drove the $4 million increase in volume and other expenses with gross ton miles up 2%.","Now let me wrap up on the next slide. Through the first half CSX has displayed the benefits of its diversified portfolio business by overcoming over $155 million of coal headwinds to achieve record financial results. This was achieved by ongoing strength in our merchandize and intermodal businesses and helped by $46 million in the year-over-year gains from real estate transactions and nearly $50 million of year-over-year favorability related to liquidated damages. Looking to the second half coal will continue to be a challenge driven by depressed global coal environment and high domestic inventories.","In addition the year-over-year impact from real estate transactions which was positive in the first half would be negative by greater amount in the second half. At the same time liquidated damage\u2019s which was positive in the first half are expected to be flat to slightly down on a year-over-year basis in the second half. Taking all together we\u2019re modifying our full-year earnings per share guidance slightly to now be roughly flat with 2012.","Looking longer term CSX will continue to focus on the same core elements that have driven the Company to record financial results by focusing on safety, service, pricing inflation and profitable volume growth CSX will emerge from this two year transition to a new coal environment as an even stronger company and remains on track to sustain high 60s operating ratio by 2015 and a mid 60s operating ratio longer-term.","With that let me turn the presentation back to Michael for his closing remarks.","Michael J. Ward","Well, thank you Fredrik. It's been a pleasure to represent the great efforts of our 31,000 employees this morning. In addition to their positive results this past quarter this team has delivered earnings growth in five of the past six years and improved the operating ratio in each of the past six years. This in spite of the fact that CSX has launched over half of its domestic coal business over this period and its merchandise business is still down from pre-recession levels.","As I alluded to in my opening remarks, this team is all about consistency and execution making the right adjustment at the right time and focusing on the areas where we know we can make a difference. When we do these things well, the Company stands the best chance of making the most of its opportunities and leading its challenges. At the same time we\u2019re able to return substantial value to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while also investing in our network which holds great opportunity for well documented reasons including population growth, highway and trucking challenges and the value of sustainability needs of our customers and the nation.","In short we like what we see, relentless consistent performance and a promising future. The company's well positioned to drive strong earnings growth and margin expansion long term as the economy continues its slow recovery and the energy environment evolves.","With that, we'll be glad to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). The first question comes from Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch.","Michael J. Ward","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, Michael. Thank you for taking my question. Just let me stick on Clarence with the export coal here. What gives you the confidence in the 40 million tons just given that API2 is now at just over 86, Aussie coal in the low 100s, just it sounded like you were a bit more negative on thermal coal. I thought you were almost more positive with that given contracts and just surprised now a little bit more negative on met coal given that's more than half of the export side. So if you can just kind of run up on that. Thanks.","Clarence W. Gooden","Okay. Ken, most of the thermal coal that we'll have for the second half of the year was put under contracts in prior periods, so it was either done earlier in this year before the API2 index dropped so dramatically or was done last year. So we feel pretty confident about being able to achieve those thermal numbers. And our met numbers as you can already see they've been declining on a sequential basis here from the first quarter to second quarter and we expect that there are pretty much going to stabilize at the level that they are now for the rest of the year. There's a lot of steel companies, particularly in Europe, who can't afford to buy some of the high vol A. They're buying a lot of the high vol B coals which CSX has been blessed with abundance of and that gives us some confidence in that market.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","No, it makes sense. I just thought you said in your presentation that you were more negative on thermal exports?","Clarence W. Gooden","And going forward into the 2014 timeframe we would be.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks for the time.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brandon Oglenski of Barclays Capital.","Michael J. Ward","Good morning, Brandon.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital","Hi. Good morning, Michael. I wanted to address an issue that we've been hearing a little bit more about and seeing in the results here between you and your peer. It seems that some of these pricing discipline that's created so much value for this industry might be, I want to say slipping a little bit, but it looks like your competitor might be trading a little bit more volume per price. Can you talk about how that's impacting outcomes for CSX and what your view is going forward?","Michael J. Ward","Well, where we've lost business, Brandon, we're confident that wasn't because of our service issues and consistent with our long-term strategy we rank \u2013 we remain committed here to pricing above rail inflation which is imperative for us if we are to continue to invest in the business.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital","Right. But I guess it seems especially in the intermodal business that there might be a little bit more aggressive behavior from the competitor. Is that creating problems for CSX and do you view this as long-term issues that shareholders should be looking at?","Michael J. Ward","No, I certainly can't address what other competitors are doing. I would tell you that most of our conversions are highway to rail. We have a very positive program in our highway to rail program. We've added sales personnel in order to do that with the beneficial cargo owners. We have a proprietary business model that we can use that will take the customers book of business into consideration and where it makes strategic fits for CSX, we think we offer a good product and where it doesn't we are very abrupt with the customer in that regard.","Clarence W. Gooden","Domestic grew 4% this year to record levels, so we're continuing to see the growth, Brandon, in the intermodal.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Wetherbee, Citi.","Michael J. Ward","Good morning, Chris.","Chris Wetherbee - Citi Research","Good morning, guys. Here's a question back on the thermal export coal side. Clarence, just kind of curious about the pricing dynamic, it sounds like most of the business is under contracts. So is it fair to assume that the pricing on that specific piece of the exports is going to remain relatively stable sequentially?","Clarence W. Gooden","I think yes. I think you'll see it relatively stable sequentially.","Chris Wetherbee - Citi Research","Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just a follow-up on the utility side, you mentioned that the southern utility stockpiles were still kind of above average. When you think about the overall utility complex that you serve in the U.S., how do you think about stockpiles in general?","Clarence W. Gooden","Stockpiles in the north are pretty much at normal levels. Stockpiles in the south are about where they were and they've sort of continued along that line. That's based on both the rate of burn as well as the rate of re-supply that the utilities are taking on an ongoing basis.","Chris Wetherbee - Citi Research","Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Allison Landry of Credit Suisse.","Michael J. Ward","Good morning, Allison.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse","Good morning. I was wondering if you could help us bridge the roughly flat earnings in 2013 with the 10% to 15% growth in 2014. And from a high level are there specific business segments that you see getting materially better next year? And I guess what\u2019s the risk to this guidance based on the very weak fundamentals that we're now seeing in the export coal markets?","Fredrik Eliasson","Well, I think what we've said is the underlying guidance are two basic macro assumptions that coal overall will be flat as we get through 2013. But between domestic and export, we think it's going to be flat. It was also said that underlying guidance was 10% to 15% CAGR and earnings is going to be an economy that is going to grow but albeit in a continuous modest pace. Clearly export coal has gone weaker but inherent in the inventory overhang that we're dealing with on the domestic side, there's an opportunity perhaps for pickup as we get into 2014 as well. So I think overall that's the macro assumptions that we have talked about and I think as we stand here today a quarter into the new guidance that we've talked about, we still feel very comfortable with that guidance for 2014 and 2015.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse","Okay. And just as a follow-up switching gears to crude by rail, just given the recent narrowing in spreads, have your discussions with customers do you get the sense that the eastern refineries have or will possibly switch back to coastal imports if the economic from the Bakken by rail don't necessarily work or is there generally a bias or a commitment to source domestically?","Clarence W. Gooden","Allison, this is Clarence Gooden. When we talk to our customers as recently as this week about that, what they're telling us is they don't see any significant need to change. Number one, they have commitment to the Bakken. Number two, a lot of the East Coast refineries get their oil off of the West African coast and that is what's really the driving factor for these guys. So we don't see any change right now in their behavior as a result of the narrowing of the spread.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse","Fantastic. Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank.","Michael J. Ward","Good morning, Justin.","Justin Yagerman - Deutsche Bank","Hi. Good morning, guys. A couple questions on coal shockingly enough. Where does Illinois Basin go over time as a percentage of utility coal for you guys from a sourcing standpoint? Where is it now and how much of a positive RPU impact did that have in the quarter, because when I look at RPU versus revenue per gross ton mile, it looks like maybe some of that longer haul had an influence on the RPU side for domestic utility?","Clarence W. Gooden","Justin, Clarence again. About two years ago, three years ago 2010, about 12% of our coal originations on CSX were coming out of the Illinois Basin and this most recent quarter about 28%. And most of that coal has displaced Central Appalachian coal which is down fairly significantly. So we see the Illinois Basin continuing to grow over time, number one. Number two, for our southern utilities, Illinois Basin is a longer haul, therefore will tend to carry a higher RPU.","Justin Yagerman - Deutsche Bank","Got it. That makes sense. So part of this mix shift, I mean where do you see that going over time, Clarence? Do you have an idea? 28%, is that kind of what you think the max would be or can it go higher than that?","Clarence W. Gooden","It's going to go a lot higher than that.","Justin Yagerman - Deutsche Bank","All right. And then as I think about the domestic coal franchise, you guys in the past have talked about the fact that you had a lot of contracts in Q4 and 20% to 25% of the book was expiring. As that gets closer, I'm kind of curious because it sounds like you've had some of these conversations already and maybe the contracts are already built in. How much of that's already been addressed and how much of your book is left to repricing? How is that conversation going in terms of putting in the more variable cost structure or pricing structure that you guys have been talking to for a while now?","Michael J. Ward","Well, I think the same amount of contracts still have to be finalized because you\u2019re correct in your assumption that we\u2019re in pretty serious negotiations with people. But we\u2019ve had a lot of receptivity from a lot of the utilities for the fixed variable pricing. So, it\u2019s a learning experience for some to have it used as much as anything.","Justin Yagerman - Deutsche Bank","So, would that mean less liquidated damages on a go-forward basis and probably just more variability in terms of your overall pricing schematic?","Michael J. Ward","Well, it\u2019s obvious that the fixed variable would obviate some of the need for liquidated damages.","Justin Yagerman - Deutsche Bank","All right. Well, thanks for the color. I appreciate the time.","Operator","The next question comes from Thomas Kim of Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Ward","Thomas, good morning.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs","Good morning. I want just ask you with \u2013 regard to the long-term outlook and how are you growing the various markets or verticals strategically? Where do you think coal sort of fits in terms of the overall contribution to the mix, let\u2019s say in 2015 as the OR basically stabilizes as you say in a similar set of range of 69% or so or high \u2013 high 60% range? Thank you.","Michael J. Ward","Well, 2015 which I guess is two years from now, I think coal now as we said earlier has \u2013 is stabilized on a sequential basis. I think as utility stock piles draw down in the South, you can see some growth occurring over that period of time and I think its just too soon to assess what any further EPA regulations are be, because they will certainly have court considerations in those.","Clarence W. Gooden","But in the mean time, we will be growing our other businesses. So as a percentage, coal will probably be at somewhat smaller percentage because we\u2019ll continue to grow the intermodal, the crude by rail in the other markets where we have initiatives to grow the revenues. That\u2019s correct.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs","Right. I mean, I think \u2013 and the reason why I asked you is because clearly part of the valuation differential between your good sales and some of your peers it has to a good extent related to the coal side and so, and I\u2019m just curious as to what some of your targets or internal set of goals would be to try to mitigate or I should say narrow that differential by addressing some of the market concerns around the coal as you think about the business, much more strategically and longer term?","Clarence W. Gooden","I think just clarifying the \u2013 my answer to the guidance before overall as we work off to 2013 base for the \u201914 and \u201915 years, we expect our coal business to be flat between domestic and export. I think that gives you a sense of what the coal picture will look like. And then you add on to Michael\u2019s comment around the fact that we do see good growth prospects in many of the other markets. So, that\u2019s the underlying assumption of our guidance.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tom Wadewitz of JPMC.","Michael J. Ward","Good morning, Tom.","Thomas Wadewitz - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah, good morning, Michael. Good morning, everyone. A question on export coal, on the thermal side, Clarence, what level of API-II pricing, European thermal pricing do you think is necessary for your customers to really make money and be sustainably in business? And if you stay at current pricing, which is pretty depressed, you think it\u2019s reasonable to imply that you would have a pretty significant step down in your thermal exports in 2014?","Clarence W. Gooden","Well, let me give you two answers to that, Tom. The first answer is the number as a rule of thumb that we use with what is necessary just to participate in the market is going to be in the mid 80s, somewhere in that number. But to make it sustainable over a long period of time, some of our customers would probably needs to be in the mid to upper 80s.","Thomas Wadewitz - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Okay. So then if you, I guess, we can just assume what we want on pricing and then if you\u2019re not at that level and you would have some impact from the customers in your tonnage?","Clarence W. Gooden","Right. That\u2019s correct.","Thomas Wadewitz - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Okay. One more question for you, a follow-up question I guess on the crude by rail and you were asked this once, but I wanted to see if you could kind of talk about, I think you\u2019ve got a couple of facilities, may be two facilities that are scheduled to come online in second half of the year in the receiving side and I\u2019m wondering if those facilities have been \u2013 are still on track to start-up for receiving crude by rail trains or whether there has been a delay in those facilities and in your volume expectation related to this spread compression its been pretty significant? Thanks.","Michael J. Ward","No Tom, both facilities are still scheduled to come online during the third quarter.","Thomas Wadewitz - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from William Greene of Morgan Stanley.","Michael J. Ward","Good morning, William.","William Greene - Morgan Stanley & Co.","Hi, there. Good morning. Michael or even Oscar, I\u2019m just wondering if I can ask you a little bit about productivity and cost. So if we look at the second half outlook, obviously still a bit challenged to longer term outlook on coal questionable. So, does it make sense to become now more aggressive on cost sort of do almost a inflation plus productivity gain in addition to the inflation plus pricing? Because it would seem to me that, that\u2019s the way to almost ensure outside the macro that you continue to see these goals on the longer term basis that you\u2019re targeting?","Oscar Munoz","Bill its Oscar. I couldn\u2019t agree with you more and I think that\u2019s the path and initiative you\u2019ve seen us take over many years.","Michael J. Ward","And we started the year thinking we gave 130 in productivity, we\u2019re now saying in excess of 150. So, we\u2019re constantly striving to find ways to drive down the cost and I think the most interesting thing we\u2019re seeing as we provide this better service to the customers, it also has very favorable impacts on our cost structure. So, we\u2019re going to continue refining those resources and pulling them when they\u2019re not required and adding when they\u2019re required. But I think Oscar and his team are very focused on the productivity side.","William Greene - Morgan Stanley & Co.","Yeah. I guess, I was getting is there a world where you could say cost cutting could become a much bigger part and element to growing the actual earnings of the company as opposed to just kind of waiting for coal and macro to come back.","Oscar Munoz","I think I would reiterate what Michael said. I think there is a delicate balance between the service we\u2019re providing to our customers. Clearly the safety of our employees and the valuation impact that you \u2013 which you discussed. And I think we balance all of those very well and I think there is on a good use front, there is a lot of efficiency to be gained in our industry and so in our business and we will pursue that.","William Greene - Morgan Stanley & Co.","Yes. Is there any element on CapEx that could come down then, given what the outlook on coal is?","Clarence W. Gooden","I think that our CapEx guidance has an inherent ability to flex depending on what we think the gross ton miles is going to be within our coal business. So, we have a revenue target out there. Substantial revenue in terms of what our CapEx is and depending on what we see with coal that CapEx as you get into \u201914 or \u201915 is going to flex, whatever we think that the underlying work load will be.","Oscar Munoz","And Bill its Oscar again. I can\u2019t underscore the amount of effort and work inside the Company with regards to asset utilization; we term it enterprise asset management about ensuring that the efficiency of our operating network creates such a more fluid environment where it does obviate the need for additional CapEx.","William Greene - Morgan Stanley & Co.","Okay, great. Thank you for the time.","Operator","Your next question comes from Scott Group of Wolfe Research.","Michael J. Ward","Good morning, Scott.","Ed Wolfe & Scott Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Hey, thanks. Good morning guys. So, I wanted to ask first on export met. How much of the business right now is getting replaced on a quarterly basis? So we saw that the benchmark wins and rates dropped 15%, 17% sequentially from second to third. Does your pricing go down that much? I think historically it goes down a little bit less, I just want to get some color there and may be at a high level if you think you can sustain flattish year-over-year overall coal yields in the back half of the year, given kind of the renewed pressure on met rates?","Michael J. Ward","Well, the answer to both questions is yes. Our coal as we\u2019ve said before, met coal and the export coal does move with the market, but it doesn\u2019t move as much in either the upward direction or in the lower direction as the coal pricing itself does.","Ed Wolfe & Scott Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay. And that was a yes also to you think coal yields can be flattish in the back half of the year?","Michael J. Ward","Yes.","Ed Wolfe & Scott Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay, great. And then just one on crude by rail, I understand the \u2013 your commentary that you\u2019re not seeing any kind of signs of changes in the demand environment. Are you seeing any changes in the pricing environment from you or the rail industry overall where you need to give up a little bit of price given the lower spreads or can you envision a scenario where pricing starts to become a little bit more flexible or get adjusted based on that spread on a quarterly or some period basis?","Michael J. Ward","I cannot see such a scenario as that happened and we think we\u2019ve got our product fairly priced. We think that the \u2013 particularly with the tightness that's in the tank car fleets that the things Oscar mentioned about the asset turns become a selling point and become very important and critical to keep the overall cost structure to the end user now.","Ed Wolfe & Scott Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay, great. Thanks for the time guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason Seidl of Cowen.","Michael J. Ward","Good morning, Jason.","Jason Seidl - Cowen Securities","Good morning, guys. I guess I'll shift gears and talk a little bit about the intermodal business. The hours of service obviously changes just upon a truckload industry and I think all people agree it's going to have some level of degradation of utilization therefore impacting capacity. In terms of domestic intermodal, what is CSX seeing going forward and what do you expect in terms of a potential volume pickup because of HOS?","Michael J. Ward","Jason, I met with two truckers last week and they're not seeing as much impact as some of the people have forecasted. So they're looking at some numbers around 5%. At times as I'm sure you know 5% loss of productivity and as I'm sure you know there has been a lot of projections about much larger impacts on productivity than those numbers. I think it's too early to tell and so people settle down some type of working pattern of exactly what the impacts going to be. I think the more important thing in intermodal is the value that's been offered to the customers both in terms of service and in terms of price that's available to them now and a better awareness of the beneficial cargos of what those values are.","Jason Seidl - Cowen Securities","And in terms of the pricing, I mean are you guys going to sort of take a balanced approach to this going forward if there is some impact and some spillover between price and volume?","Michael J. Ward","I don't understand what you're asking.","Jason Seidl - Cowen Securities","If you had the opportunity to gain more market share especially in some of the lanes that you can increase your [indiscernible]. Is this going to be a situation where you're going to go for more volume initially or is this going to be more of a balanced approach and making sure you get properly compensated?","Michael J. Ward","It's going to be a more balanced approached. The big thing I hope if we've made any one point here is we're about profitable growth.","Jason Seidl - Cowen Securities","Okay. My follow-up question just so I can understand sort of the longer term guidance. When you said that you're expecting sort of flattish coal, so we should assume that the export coal assumptions in the out years are for 40 million tons?","Oscar Munoz","No, I said overall between domestic and export and obviously as we're looking at the market right now, there is more downward pressure on export and perhaps more upward opportunities on domestic. But we got 2.5 years until that endpoint, so a lot of things will change. There's one thing you know when you put guidance together and underlying assumptions most likely you're going to get there a different way than you originally assumed. So, we're going to continue to do what we do best which is focus on things that we control; safety service, efficiency and inflation plus pricing and we feel very comfortable with the guidance that we put in place.","Jason Seidl - Cowen Securities","When you talk about sort of an upward bias to domestic coal when you look at sort of the southern utility stockpiles, how long do you think it's going to take for them to sort of get where the southern utility starts seeing a decent amount of growth in domestic coal?","Oscar Munoz","Well, as we said, on the northern part we feel that we're where we need to be in terms of stockpiles. In the southern end we think that by the end of the year thereabouts, we think we should be at a more normalized level.","Michael J. Ward","And we would just like [indiscernible] to send their heat down south.","Jason Seidl - Cowen Securities","I'll gladly send it, guys. It's going to be a brutal one here in New York. Thanks for the time as always.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ben Hartford of Baird.","Michael J. Ward","Good morning, Ben.","Ben Hartford - Robert W. Baird","Good morning. If I could just build on that point, can you remind us what you had assumed in terms of met and thermal within that 40 million tons target at the beginning of the year and where do you sit today? And then maybe if you could provide some context as well, a lot of discussion about the weakness in both thermal and met coal prices in the export market year-to-date. Can you give us any order of magnitude of where that 40 million tons run rate might be presently if it weren't for the contracts that were struck late last year or early this year? Thanks.","Fredrik Eliasson","I'm going to leave the second part of the question to Clarence. This is Fredrik. I would say in terms of the mix between met and steam in our long-term guidance, we have not given any sort of indication where we think that is because there's one thing we do know that it's very difficult to forecast exactly where export coal is going to be and even more difficult is to forecast what the split is going to be between the two.","Clarence W. Gooden","In the current quarter and in the first half has been -- 57\/43 has been the split. And I think our coal team and the export team did nothing short of a brilliant job in getting a lot of these thermal contracts particularly in place before this API index has collapsed so much. The met was much more difficult to predict. The Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar dropped 9% in the second quarter and that severely impacted the met imports along with the fact that the growth in China and the recessionary tendencies we've had in Europe have impacted those steel making industries. So it's a little hard for us to tell you what it's going to be doing here in the second half other than what we \u2013 we're confident that we've got committed now.","Ben Hartford - Robert W. Baird","Yeah. And is there any context I guess in terms of the order of magnitude of where \u2013 of how lower that export coal number would be in total at present prices? I mean is it a 10% reduction, a 50% reduction, I mean anything within that context might be helpful?","Clarence W. Gooden","I just don't know. The Australians, they're going to control what happens to that met market in any event and their probably as about as low as they want to go.","Ben Hartford - Robert W. Baird","Okay, that's good. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Cherilyn Radbourne of TD Securities.","Michael J. Ward","Hello, Cherilyn.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities","Thank you very much and good morning. I was just wondering if you could give us a bit more color on the impact of mix in an overall sense in the quarter, clearly but still negative but it did seem that maybe it was a little bit less negative than it has been because you did have some decent growth in some of your higher yielding merchandize segments?","Fredrik Eliasson","As we outlined in our presentation, RPU was up about 1%. Overall pricing when you include everything was a little bit above 2% on a same-store sale basis. That would indicate about 1% of so negative mix and that is to be expected as our coal business continues to decline as a percentage of our portfolio and intermodal which is significantly lower RPU continues to grow. So the overall pricing, as you saw, if you take out export coal because that continues to be a drag of course on our pricing overall continues to be very solid right around 4%. So mix is going to be something that we're going to be dealing with for a long period of time, a negative mix as the intermodal business continues to become a bigger and bigger percentage of our portfolio.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities","Okay. And Clarence just wondering if you could offer some thoughts on the peak season and just whether you're seeing the housing recovery translate into any kind of a ripple effect into things like furniture?","Clarence W. Gooden","Actually what we've seen in the housing impacts has not been an impact on furniture recently. There was a lot of inventory, for example, for appliances, a couple of the major manufacturers and we've seen that inventory actually drop as the housing starts have increased. What was your first part of your question? The phone went out.","Michael J. Ward","Peak season.","Peak season. I'm not sure I know if we're going to have a good peak season or just an average peak season and average being defined as what peak has been over the last few years. We'll certainly start to get an indication of that toward the end of this month, July, because a lot of the shipments that will be in the back to school area that will get ready for the holiday seasons and all stock here in early August, so we'll be able to tell by the lift in the vessels coming out of Asia what that peak is going to look like.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities","Okay, thanks. That's it for me.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Vernon of Bernstein.","Michael J. Ward","Good morning, David.","David Vernon - Sanford Bernstein","Hi. Good morning. Can we talk a little bit about the strength in domestic coal pricing, how much is that due to the move to fixed and variable pricing with utility equities right now?","Michael J. Ward","Well, I would say that not a lot. It's been mostly impacted by the overall pricing to lost fee that we had about 20% of our revenue right now is covered by the fixed variable. So most of it has come off of either the escalators or renegotiated contracts.","David Vernon - Sanford Bernstein","So that 20% of the revenues move in on the fixed and variable, would that be including a bunch of fixed charge or was that sort of an average rate? I'm just trying to get a sense for how the RPU should move as volume flexes?","Michael J. Ward","In this quarter, there's been no real material impact.","David Vernon - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. And then just one last question, Clarence, the IP numbers you guys put out on the macro side look like they're down a little bit, about 60 bips. And the general balance of the commodity outlook seems a little bit more favorable, is that just ag or are you hearing some more on the industrial side that would you to believe the cut in forward IP numbers is probably unwarranted?","Clarence W. Gooden","Are you saying \u2013 ask me that again. I didn\u2019t understand that.","David Vernon - Sanford Bernstein","Sorry \u2013 sorry. I looked at the industrial production growth rate that you guys had in the first quarter and the second quarter and they looked they\u2019re down about 60 bips?","Clarence W. Gooden","Industrial products?","David Vernon - Sanford Bernstein","Yeah, industrial production.","Clarence W. Gooden","Just IDP.","David Vernon - Sanford Bernstein","Sort of a macro outlook, right.","Clarence W. Gooden","Well those numbers are coming out of global insights and it's interesting to list as I do all the time about the IDP and the GDP numbers. Whatever some of these agencies predict they\u2019re going to be, I know they\u2019re not going to be that. I think the industrial growth has been a little bit stronger than what some of these numbers have indicated here for our business. It's certainly showing up in some of the construction materials that we had as opposed to the paper side of the business. It's strong in our automotive business, it\u2019s not as strong in our steel business as we think it should be, but it looks to me that we\u2019re going to continue to have growth in the IDP numbers as we move forward.","Fredrik Eliasson","And I guess, Clarence what housing starts last year were about 780 or I think they might be in the [9950] range so.","Clarence W. Gooden","That\u2019s right.","Fredrik Eliasson","It is growing but from a very low base because our normalized rate is more like a $1.5 million, at the peak it was $2.5 million. So we\u2019re seeing some growth there but from a real small base. And I guess secondly at least at this point there\u2019s a good planting of crop. So we\u2019re hopeful that towards the end of the third quarter we\u2019re going to see some very good growth in our ag shipments which have been down for the first half.","David Vernon - Sanford Bernstein","All right, great. That\u2019s what I was trying to get at. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Larkin of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Fredrik Eliasson","Good morning, John.","John Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus","Hey, good morning gentlemen, thanks for taking my call. By the way there\u2019s some disappointing housing numbers out this morning you may want to check on that down 9.9% in June, just this information that was a surprise to many people I think. First question, the incentive comp I think Fredrik you said it was up $24 million year-over-year. How do you reconcile that with the outlook for a flattish year in terms of EPS year-over-year?","Fredrik Eliasson","Yeah, I think really you got to go back to last year when we set our plan for 2012 was really done in December. We had obviously anticipated 2012 to turn out to be very different than -- especially 2012 that was a very different coal environment, and as we moved through 2012 we took down our incentive compensation quite significantly and we also now have a much larger part of our unions participating in that incentive comp plan. So as you get into 2013 and you reset the targets to properly motivate and incentivize our employees that headwind becomes a lot more significant and that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing this year.","John Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus","Roughly how much of that incentive is related to the unionized labor force?","Fredrik Eliasson","It is relatively a large percent, but I don\u2019t have that here.","John Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus","Okay.","Fredrik Eliasson","But there\u2019s something that\u2019s been going on over the last couple of years.","John Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus","And then just on the large accident that unfortunately happened up in Quebec involving a crude by rail train, often regulators will if nothing else in a knee jerk reaction put in place some pretty onerous regulations, we saw that with the PTC mandate. Did you see anything like that coming out of that accident across North America and will that make it more expensive to move crude by rail and therefore what's attractive vis \u00e0 vis say a pipeline.","Michael J. Ward","John, this is Michael and first off we just want to express our condolences to the people there at Quebec, I mean that was a terrible accident and the first responders did a great job of responding to that horrible accident. As you know they\u2019re still investigating what the cause of it is. And I think until the cause is known it's a little hard to speculate whether there would be additional regulations or not. As you\u2019re well aware we moved these because we\u2019re a common carrier and we have a very good record of safety in handling these products. So I\u2019m hopefully that as they determine the cause of this if there\u2019s something to be learnt to make us safer we want to learn from that because our ultimate goal is zero. We have a great record now we want it to be better. So I think until there is a causation here, it's going to be a little difficult to see whether there will be a push for further regulation or not.","John Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt Troy of Susquehanna International.","Fredrik Eliasson","Good morning, Matt","Matthew Troy - Susquehanna International","Good morning. I think there\u2019s a question on coal economics, obviously exports have been kind of the perceptual albatross if you will for your story, and now for about two years they have been poised to drop, now that we\u2019re seeing that I was just wondering you implied flat guidance next year in terms of volumes but there\u2019s negative mix. What's the profitability relationship between exports and domestic? Some folks will say 2, 3X is profitable, but an export move versus domestic I think that\u2019s crazy, but if you can just help us in terms of what that negative mix shift might mean for profitability of coal as a whole that might help to alleviate some concerns in the market about the decline in export tonnage.","Fredrik Eliasson","Yeah, I would say that in the past prior to us taking, and this Fredrik by the way, prior to us taking some of these rate reductions in our export portfolio we would have said if you combine the met and the steam together on the export side and you compare with domestic they\u2019re relatively similar. Now with some of the reductions that we\u2019re had to make on the export side, I would say that perhaps the domestic portfolio is slightly more profitable. So, from that perspective at this point it's not a bad thing. Overall obviously coal is a profitable business for us because it's a very efficient way of moving things unit train that\u2019s a conveyor belt, so it is not as big of a deal as perhaps some people might think.","Matthew Troy - Susquehanna International","I agree, and good to hear. The second question I had simply relates to intermodal capacity. You talked about the percentage of your traffic that\u2019s falling into double stack trains moving up into 2015. In terms of train length in some of the yard and asset productivity initiatives what's the capacity to grow just average train length where we know those incremental margins for the last cars you\u2019re adding are pretty significant? Thank you.","Clarence W. Gooden","Well this is Clarence. Matt, I think it's fairly significant. We still have plenty of capacities; it\u2019s a lift in the trains and to fill them up in the air. So it's a positive thing for us.","Matthew Troy - Susquehanna International","All right, more to come. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Kauffman of Buckingham Research.","Fredrik Eliasson","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey Kauffman \u2013 Buckingham Research","Good morning. Thank you very much and congratulations. Thank you for taking my question, I\u2019ll keep it short. Given the weaker global outlook on API-2 and you had mentioned the Australian exchange, these aren\u2019t things likely to turn on a dime, yet you maintained the 2013 to 2015 guidance, so something else I\u2019m assuming got a little bit better to offset this, what would that have been?","Fredrik Eliasson","Well, Jeff this Fredrik. Overall I would say that the reason why we took the guidance up for 2013 was really what happened here in the second quarter. We had several onetime events that got a little a bit better than we expected and that\u2019s the foundation obviously then also for our long-term guidance. So, clearly the export coal market has gone a little bit weaker, but we continue to execute very well on the things that we do control which is where we\u2019re focusing on once again, safety, service, efficiency and inflation plus pricing and that\u2019s what gives us confidence to take up that in slightly and it really is reflecting more of what happened here in the second quarter than anything that\u2019s going to happen in the second half. The second half is still going to be very challenging consistent with the points that I had in my prepared remarks.","Jeffrey Kauffman \u2013 Buckingham Research","Okay, I am sorry Fredrik. What I meant was not 2013, but kind of the 2014, 2015 view. If we\u2019re thinking the export markets could be weaker in 2014 what else got better to kind of keep the consistent 10% to 15% to 2015 view?","Fredrik Eliasson","So, two things; first of all what we have said here is that overall coal we expect to be flat, and so I\u2019m not sure the domestic coal necessarily has gone stronger during this last quarter since we issued the guidance virtually. But where we're comfortable with is the fact that we're continuing to execute well and then second, in our guidance is a range of 10% to 15%. So within that range we\u2019re definitely more feel comfortable that we would be able to deliver our earnings growth according to that guidance.","Michael J. Ward","And Jeff, this is Michael. The only thing I would add to that, is we have especially on the last couple of years, I\u2019ve seen there\u2019s a lot of volatility in the market place out there but with the economy, the energy environment and it starts to feel like two and half years is a long time and many things happen. So where we\u2019re trying to position ourselves for whenever there is opportunities we\u2019re making sure we\u2019re flexible there. I mean if you think back three years ago, who would even been talking about crude by rail. So there is a lot of things that can move around in a two and half year period.","Jeffrey Kauffman \u2013 Buckingham Research","All right. Michael, Fredrik thank you and congratulations.","Michael J. Ward","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Justin Long of Stephens.","Fredrik Eliasson","Good morning, Justin.","Justin Long \u2013 Stephens Inc.","Good morning. A quick question. Outside of export coal, would you say that core pricing gains right now are pretty consistent among your different end markets or are you seeing any particular areas of strength or weakness? And you've touched on intermodal a little bit earlier but right now what would you say the pricing dynamics are in the market given some of the capacity expansions we have going on in the east?","Clarence W. Gooden","Justin, this is Clarence Gooden. Our pricing has been pretty consistent across all of our lives of businesses. There's been a couple that obviously have one point or so better than others. Our intermodal pricing is always under a lot of intense pressure not only from other rail competition but the real competitor is the highway and is the trucker. And there's still a lot of trucking capacity out there, there's still a lot of unused trucking capacity that we see, so the pricing pressures that remain in intermodal remain from the highway and is probably one of our more difficult markets in which to price in. But the others are pretty consistent across the board. We feel very confident that we can get the inflation plus pricing.","Justin Long - Stephens Inc","Okay, great. And as a quick follow-up, on your guidance for 2013 EPS to be roughly flat year-over-year. There have been some gains and one-time items over the last year. So I was just wondering if you could clarify what your using as both the base EPS number for 2012 as well as what your using for the first two quarters this year?","Fredrik Eliasson","So the base that we have is $1.79 is what we had in 2012, so that's really what we're seeing. Roughly flat, that's what we're expecting. And you're right, we've had a portion of several one-time items on our expense side and also of course had the liquidated damages for the top line that's helped us in the first half which is why the second half is going to be more difficult than the first half, but the base is $1.79.","Justin Long - Stephens Inc","And for the first half of 2013, what EPS numbers are you using? Are you using the GAAP numbers?","Fredrik Eliasson","We're using the reported numbers.","Justin Long - Stephens Inc","Okay, great. I appreciate the time.","Operator","Your next question comes from Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar.","Michael J. Ward","Good morning, Keith.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar","Good morning. Thanks. You mentioned the proportion of domestic coal originating in Illinois Basin I think has doubled from 2010 levels other than a longer length of hauler, the aspects of this business that either benefit or constrain productivity or price, for example train length, car type, lower grade, et cetera?","Clarence W. Gooden","Keith, this is Clarence Gooden. No, there are no other constraints. It's a good move for us.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar","And are there more fixed\/variable contracts structured in this region or is there no structural pricing difference?","Clarence W. Gooden","The fixed\/variable is with the end receivers, so it's depending entirely on where they've received their coal from.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar","Great, thank you.","Michael J. Ward","So it's Illinois Basin or Central App\u2026","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar","Thank you.","Clarence W. Gooden","Thank you.","Operator","Your last question comes from Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital.","Michael J. Ward","Good morning, Walter.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question here. Just a quick question on intermodal, I know that's been a very big part of your underlying growth driver and I think it perhaps is getting a little dropped off in terms of context given coal. So, you invested a lot in your intermodal network. You've talked a lot about that 9 million loads that are available in truck. When you look at your 4% domestic growth this year, is there any way to segregate where you're getting that growth in terms of success of converting? And then the follow-up to that is let's just say it starts coming on line a lot quicker than you expect. Where is the next bottleneck? I know you've done a great job double stacking. You got plenty of capacity on an average train length basis. If it really starts coming on line, where will we see the next bench point?","Michael J. Ward","Walter, I would say the biggest growth has come vis-\u00e0-vis our channel partners from the beneficial cargo owners themselves being able to say what the value of intermodal is and we have a pretty good handle around who those customers are and what some of their needs and all are. I think we've looked at in terms of where we could have potential capacity problems in the future going forward, so you've heard us mention in the prepared remarks number one, we've already got in the planning to expand our Northwest Ohio hub. We're looking at where we could have potential bottlenecks in the Southeast because there's a lot of growth both in terms of population as well as in terms of highway conversions in the Southeast.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets","We are expanding Atlanta now, right?","Michael J. Ward","We are expanding Atlanta as we speak. As you know, we've built our Louisville terminal with way over capacity \u2013 over the capacity that terminal Louisville fairly quickly and so we had to get in and expand that pretty quick. As the Florida market continues to grow, we had the foresight to get into the Winter Haven market on an early basis, so we feel like we're pretty well positioned in terms of capacity for intermodal growth.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets","And segregating that 4% growth, how much would you attribute to that \u2013 to conversion or are your customers winning market share and how much is it just simple growth or gaining market share against your real competitor?","Michael J. Ward","It'd be difficult for me to segregate that to be honest with you.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Well, that's it. Thank you very much.","Michael J. Ward","Thank you, Walter. Thank you all for your attendance today. See you next quarter.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation in today's call.

(Operator Instructions). For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. David Baggs, Vice President of Capital Markets and Investor Relations for CSX Corporation.David Baggs","Thank you Pat and good morning everyone and again welcome to CSX Corporation\u2019s fourth quarter 2012 earnings presentation. The presentation material that we\u2019ll review this morning along with our quarter financial report and our safety and service measurements are available on our website at csx.com under the investor section. In addition, following the presentation, a webcast and podcast replay will be available on the same website.Here, representing CSX this morning are Michael Ward, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Clarence Gooden, Chief Sales and Marketing Officer; Oscar Munoz, Chief Operating Officer; and Fredrik Eliasson, Chief Financial Officer. ","Now, before we begin the formal part of our program, let me remind everyone that the presentation and other statements made by the company contain forward-looking statements. You are encouraged to review the company\u2019s disclosure in the accompanying presentation on slide two. This disclosure identifies forward-looking statements and risks and uncertainties that could cause performance to differ materially from the results anticipated by these statements. In addition, because of the number of analysts covering our company as they approached 30 at this point, we would encourage everyone during the question-and-answer session to limit their questions to one primary and one follow-up question.And with that, let me turn the presentation over to Michael Ward, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Michael?Michael WardWell, thank you David and good morning everyone. Last evening, CSX reported financial results that further illustrate the underlying strength of our business, the ability of our team to manage and execute through very challenging conditions and a steadfast commitment to preparing for the long-term growth we see. Fourth quarter earnings per share were $0.43, which included a $0.03 benefit from a sale of a non-operating property.From a revenue perspective, significant declines in coal more than offset the increases we drove in merchandise and intermodal, gains that were solid in light of the overall uncertainty in the economy. Operationally, the CSX team delivered a powerful combination of safety, service, and productivity gains resulting in an operating income of $804 million and an operating ratio of 72.1% despite the lower revenues.Turning to slide five, for the full year, you can see that CSX continued to produce gains in its financial results. During 2012, our employees remained relentlessly focused in tough external conditions, making even more fundamental improvement in operations while responding quickly to changing market conditions. At the same time, they delivered steady gains in operating income at $3.46 billion, the operating ratio at 70.6%, and earnings per share at $1.79. The team\u2019s many achievements in 2012 are a reflection of the initiatives we continued to drive, but are even more so the outcome of a culture that remained steadfastly committed to its customers and to excellence. This focus allows us to perform well in tough conditions while positioning our business to create substantial shareholder value when the economy picks up more momentum and the renaissance of the industry resumes.With that, I would like to turn the presentation over to Clarence to discuss our top line results in more detail. Clarence?Clarence GoodenThank you, Michael and then good morning everyone. Turning to slide seven, key economic indicators moderated in the fourth quarter. Looking at the left side of the chart, projected GDP and IDP rates both reflected a softer economic environment in the quarter. On the right, the Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index registered a rating of 50.7 in December, reflecting a slight expansion of U.S. manufacturing. After indicating solid expansion in the earlier part of the year, the index clearly fell back providing further evidence of slowing activity. At the same time, the Customers Inventories Index registered a rating of 47 indicating respondents believe their inventories are still slightly below normal levels. As confidence in the U.S. economy improves, the rebuilding of inventories will support future growth. Overall, transportation demand in the markets we serve was mixed in the fourth quarter consistent with the broader economic environment.And now, let\u2019s take a look at the overall revenue. Total fourth quarter revenue of nearly $2.9 billion was 2% lower compared to the prior year. Starting at the left of the chart, volume-related revenue had an unfavorable impact of $84 million in the quarter as volume growth in automotive and intermodal was more than offset by the decline in domestic and export coal. Moving to the right when combined, the impact of rate and mix net to zero in the quarter with the benefit of core pricing gains offset by the unfavorable mix associated with intermodal growth and lower coal volume. Finally, fuel recovery increased $17 million in the quarter.Now, let\u2019s turn to pricing. Core pricing, on a same-store sales basis, remained solid across nearly all the markets. Recall that the same-store sales are defined as shipments with the same customer, commodity and car type, and the same origin and destination. These shipments represented approximately 80% of CSX\u2019s traffic base for the quarter. Looking at the chart, overall pricing, shown as the blue bars, increased 1.6% in the fourth quarter. Lower overall pricing is attributed to the more dynamic export coal market, where pricing is impacted by changing global conditions. The gold bars, which exclude export coal show pricing gains of 4% in the quarter exceeding rail inflation and consistent with the performance in the second and third quarters. Looking forward delivering a strong product that creates relative value for our customers provides a solid foundation for pricing above rail inflation over the long term. Given our confidence and the value of our product offering and the need for ongoing investment in the business, we will not sacrifice price for short term volume gains. ","Let\u2019s turn to the next slide and take a closer look at the volume. Total volume declined 3% in the quarter versus the same period last year and performance across the markets we serve was mixed. Export coal volume fell 10% after growing in previous quarters. Both Intermodal and the Industrial sector continued to grow in the quarter but at lower rates than we saw in the first half.The agricultural and construction sector remained challenged while these sectors declining 4% each. Finally domestic coal declined 21% although the rate of decline moderated somewhat from what we saw earlier in the year. Now let\u2019s take a closer look at some of the individual markets in more detail and let\u2019s start with coal. Coal revenue declined 18% to $747 million. Domestic volume declined 21% as natural gas prices remain low leading to the continued displacement of coal and high stockpiles at many utilities. In addition, electrical generation declined in the Eastern United States. Export coal volume declined 10% as demand for metallurgical coal softened particularly in the Asian markets. Total revenue per unit was flat as core pricing gains in domestic markets offset lower export rates. Looking ahead at this point export coal volume is expected to decline in the first quarter and our best estimate of full year volume is about 40 million tons.Furthermore we anticipate our rates to be pressured as we work with producers to keep U.S. coal competitive globally in an environment where underlying commodity process for thermal and metallurgical coal are low. At the same time domestic coal headwinds will persist but we expect them to continue to moderate throughout 2013. As a result we anticipate domestic volume will decline in the 5% to 10% range for the full year.Next let\u2019s look at merchandize; overall merchandize revenue increased 4% to $1.66 billion. Automotive was the key driver in the industrial sector growing 10% as North American light vehicle production increased 8% in the quarter. In addition, the chemicals market grew 6% on strength and energy related petroleum products. In the agricultural sector ethanol shipments declined as a result of lower production, increased competition from imports and lower gasoline demand. In addition, FEED grain shipments to the South-East were lower as a result of the severe drought in the mid-west. Regarding the construction sector, building products rebounded on the strength of a slowly improving housing environment. However this was more than offset by lower aggregate shipments associated with lower infrastructure spending and lower salt shipments due to the high inventories from 2012 winter. Looking to the first quarter of 2013 in the industrial we continue to see growth opportunities in chemicals particularly in commodities related to the oil and gas industry. The automotive market will remain strong although we\u2019re now cycling tougher comparable.We expect the agricultural sector to remain soft with lower grain shipments and continued weakness in ethanol, more than offsetting the increased fertilizer demand. Finally, we anticipate a slow steady recovery in the construction sector that will drive growth and building products and aggregates. Moving to the next page, let\u2019s review intermodal. Intermodal revenue increased 6% to $398 million; domestic volume was up 2% driven by highway to rail conversions which continued despite a softening economic environment and the impact of Hurricane Sandy. International volume grew 6% on growth related to the Maersk business. Total intermodal revenue per unit increased 2% due to core pricing gains in higher fuel recovery. Looking forward our strategic network investments such as the double-stack clearing have routed to New England, the terminal expansions in Wister and Columbus, Ohio will help increase our capacity and network fluidity while improving service for our customers. At the same time as we maintain our focus on profitable growth, we\u2019re excited about our highway to rail or H2R initiative. We\u2019re working collaboratively with our channel partners to market the compelling value of the intermodal rail transportation to targeted customers and its new initiative, which will be a key driver for CSX in tapping an estimated $9 million truckload opportunity.Let\u2019s turn to the outlook for the first quarter. Looking forward, we have recognized the economic environment has moderated and uncertainty remains. While we expect stable to favorable conditions for 71% of our markets, we expect an unfavorable environment for the remaining markets and an overall neutral outlook for the first quarter. Intermodal growth will leave the way as our strategic network investments and strong service delivery will continue to support highway-to-rail conversions. In addition, the chemicals market will grow as we capture opportunities created by the expanding domestic oil and gas industry.Automobile and light truck production will remain strong, but year-over-year comparisons become more difficult in 2013. In emerging markets, we expect a continued recovery in demand for construction and building materials while waste shipments will remain challenging. The overall outlook for agricultural products remains unfavorable with low corn supply and high prices caused by last year\u2019s drought impacting shipments to feed mills and ethanol shipments impacted by lower demand and higher corn prices. Finally, export coal volume will be lower on softer demand for thermal coal and domestic coal volume is expected to remain below prior year levels, although the headwinds will moderate throughout the year.Now, I am wrapping up. Looking at the state of the economy, the indicators we follow generally point to continued expansion, but at a more modest pace. Overall, the first quarter volume outlook is neutral, while the outlook for 71% of our markets is neutral to favorable. We anticipate total volume will be flat to slightly down year-over-year with declines in unfavorable markets offsetting the gains in the favorable markets. Utility coal volume will continue to be challenged by low gas prices and high utility stockpiles. Although we expect these headwinds to moderate somewhat through the balance of the year, we anticipate they will continue well into 2013.At the same time, much like we saw in 2012, we expect our merchandise and intermodal markets to continue to grow at a rate that is above the general economy. Finally, we continue to deliver high levels of service, which creates compelling value for our customers and will drive long-term profitable volume and revenue growth for the shareholders.Thank you. And now, I will turn the presentation over to Oscar to review our operating results.Oscar MunozThank you, Mr. Gooden, and good morning to everybody. Well, I am pleased to report that CSX\u2019s operating performance for the fourth quarter was again strong across the board. Safety results continued to be at or near all-time best levels reflecting our strong safety culture that has driven sustained improvement over the last nine years. Customer satisfaction is also at record levels reflecting the team\u2019s ongoing focus on service excellence. At the same time, resource adjustments and asset utilization produced nearly $200 million of productivity for last year. And as we look long-term, our operational strategy is based on providing safe, efficient, and reliable freight transportation solutions for our customer. This also positions us well to deliver strong value for shareowners.So, let\u2019s review the results for the quarter and let\u2019s start with safety. As you know, safety remains a consistent focus at our company and in the industry. Strong results in safety demonstrate not only adherence to operating rules, but our reflection of employees\u2019 engagement. Looking at the FRA personal injury rate on the chart on the top left, our employees operated safer than ever and CSX produced a record low rate of 0.5 or representing an astonishing 42% improvement year-over-year. The chart on the bottom left shows a consistent pattern of improvement over the last four years in personal injury results another illustration of the company\u2019s strong safety culture.The chart on the top right shows the FRA train accident rate, which improved 38% to 1.70. The full year results on the bottom right show a similar improvement with a 2012 train accident rate of 1.98. Before moving on, let me pause and thank our employees for their outstanding effort in this area. As the FRA recently noted, railroad safety is at record levels and I am especially proud that CSX led the entire industry in 2012. These results are a testament to our employees\u2019 commitment to each other and to the communities we serve.Now, on the next slide, let\u2019s review on-time performance. Here you can see on-time originations on left, on-time arrivals on the right. You may recall during the fourth quarter, CSX was impacted by Hurricane Sandy, although the storm caused a temporary shutdown, washed out segments of the network, and impacted port operations, our employees once again responded valiantly and service was restored quickly. During the quarter, CSX matched the record high of 90% in on-time originations and achieved a record in on-time arrivals at 84%.","Now from a system performance let\u2019s turn to the next slide, terminal dwell is a strong indicator of how well we are utilizing our assets. Looking at the chart on the left, you see dwell improved 4% to 24.3 hours. Looking at the chart on the right, velocity again showed improvement up 7% to 23.3 miles per hour. This is the clear example of where great customer service builds great shareholder value. Assets moving through the network quickly and reliably, handling the customers receiving outstanding service and over the long term allows for more efficient capital deployment.Let\u2019s go to velocity on the next slide, as a further reflection of the operating improvement, velocity was once again up against across all three networks. In coal we\u2019re driving improvements and service and efficiency, with volume down 19% CSX adjusted operating plans and maximize loadings to increase both train length and tons per car.Turning to intermodal, velocity continued to reach high levels with a record fourth quarter volume. Higher velocity in the intermodal network gives us the ability to reach end market more quickly and to meet or exceed customer expectations. Across the network container and trailer availability to the customer in the terminal was at 86% and in the high 90s for our expedited product. Finally the merchandize network also continues to perform well with velocity up 5% to 21.9 miles per hour, car cycle times improved 8%. This means we\u2019re making more final deliveries to customers on time requiring fewer local motives, cars and crew starts.Over the course of the year service has improved significantly in all the markets we serve including those that we have absorbed strong growth. Turn to the next slide, we will look at productivity. Over the past five years, CSX has delivered nearly $850 million of productivity savings including nearly 200 million in 2012. Efficiencies last year were driven by overall car cycle times they were 15% shorter, lower estimate, lower overtime across all operating departments and increased fuel efficiency. In 2013, we expect to build up the success by delivering another $130 million in productivity gains.We will continue to focus on improved asset utilization, using a combination of plan, process and technology enhancements to continue to gain traction. We\u2019ll also adjust resources up or down based on customer demand and remain flexible to insure we\u2019re operating as efficiently as possible. We\u2019re moving locomotives in and out of store more efficiently now and we\u2019re leveraging furlough retention boards when it makes sense. So let\u2019s talk more specifically about the resource adjustments we made in 2013 on the next slide. The chart at left represents the total active T&E workforce with the blue portion of the bars representing fulltime employees and the gold portion representing those employees of furlough retention boards.On a year-over-year basis the active T&E count was down 1% with volume down 3%, at year end CSX had over 600 employees on full furlough and approximately 300 on furlough retention board. As you know furlough retention boards are useful in areas of the network or we would otherwise need to hire new employees to meet attrition or customer demand within a relatively short period of time. It's easier and quicker to bring an employee off one of these retention boards in the longer process of bringing an employee back from a traditional furlough. For those currently on full furlough we have offered a voluntary transfer program. The intent of this program is to meet employee demand and other geographic locations without incurring the hiring and training cost associated with most new employees.In addition to lower T&E headcount overtime hours were down 17% with 26% few relief crews in the quarter. Now let\u2019s look at locomotives, looking at this chart on the left you can see that the act of locomotive count peaked during the first quarter of 2012 since then we\u2019ve been storing access power and had 8% fewer locomotives in the fourth quarter of 2012 than a year ago with nearly 400 units currently stored. We measure our locomotive efficiency based on gross ton miles per horsepower hour using this measure locomotive efficiency improved by 7% on a year-over-year basis.The decision to store locomotive is aimed at saving cost but not at the price of service or flexibility. As such we\u2019re constantly monitoring locomotive levels and are currently bringing some units out of storage to prepare for seasonal volume needs. As we make changes to the locomotive count that is critical that we monitor the impact on service recognizing that locomotives are generally a fluid asset and we can put in or take out a storage on a relatively short notice to meet demand or service need. ","Let me turn my attention to customer satisfaction on the next slide. Every quarter, CSX uses an independent firm to survey our customers on a wide range of factors that influence customer satisfaction. These factors include things like speed and consistency of service, problem resolution, and ease-of-order placement. In 2012, we received our highest score ever from customers highlighting the operating success we have sustained. When we look at the makeup of the overall customer satisfaction score, the most significant driver of the increase is our total score \u2013 the most significant driver of the increase in our total score is the progress we have made in local service delivery. By focusing on service excellence across all operating departments, we have been able to proactively address customer issues and respond quickly to their concerns. Over the long-term, consistent service translates into sustained high levels of satisfaction and in turn is a key enabler for CSX to capture future growth.So, let me wrap up. CSX\u2019s record personal injury and near-record train accident results demonstrate the company\u2019s commitment to keep our employees and the communities we work in safe. Our operating team had an outstanding year in 2012 operating as safely as we ever have and serving customers efficiently while generating nearly $200 million of productivity. And as we look forward, we expect a sustained momentum on service and asset utilization and are targeting an additional $130 million of savings in productivity.In addition, customers are experienced service reliability at sustainably high levels, which helps CSX achieve record levels of customer satisfaction. This service product drives long-term value for customers, which in turn drives growth and long-term value for owners. We recognize there is uncertainty in the marketplace and CSX remains committed to providing flexible solutions for customers to enable growth and drive significant long-term value for shareowners.So, with that, let me turn the presentation over to Fredrik to review the financials.Fredrik EliassonThank you, Oscar and good morning everyone. Looking at the top of this slide, revenue was down 2% for the fourth quarter. At the same time, expenses improved 1% driven primarily by lower volume, productivity, and efficiency gains related to resource adjustments made in response to changing market conditions.Operating income was $804 million, down 4% versus the prior year. Looking below the line, interest expense was up slightly year-over-year reflecting debt that was issued in the fourth quarter to pre-fund most of the 2013 maturities. Other income rose $59 million primarily driven by a $57 million pre-tax gain on the sale of a non-operating property. The income taxes were $275 million in the quarter for an effective tax rate of 38.3%. Overall, net earnings was $443 million, down 3% versus last year and EPS was $0.43 per share unchanged from last year, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program.As we turn to the next slide, let\u2019s briefly discuss how fuel lag benefited the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, the effect of the lag in our fuel surcharge program was $14 million favorable. This reflects the $5 million positive in-quarter lag during the fourth quarter of 2012 and a $9 million unfavorable in-quarter lag for the same period last year.Turning to the next slide, let\u2019s discuss expenses in more detail. Overall expenses were down 1% in the quarter. I will talk about the top three expense items in more detail on the next few slides, but let me briefly speak to the last two on the chart. Depreciation was up 15% to $271 million due to the increase in the net asset base and the cycling of the prior year favorable adjustments related to asset retirements. On a sequential basis, the increase in depreciation was $3 million in line with the guidance we gave last quarter. Going forward, we continue to expect depreciation to increase a few million dollars each quarter, reflecting the ongoing investment in our business. Equipment rent was up 5% to $97 million as improved cycle time of our car fleet was more than offset by higher cost associated with automotive volume growth.Now, let\u2019s discus labor and fringe in more detail. Labor and fringe expense was down 3% versus last year, or $27 million. Looking at the chart on the left, headcount, which includes employees on retention boards, was down 2% both versus last year and sequentially. Last quarter, we gave guidance that our headcount will remain relatively constant, but also noted that we would adjust it quarterly as market conditions warranted. Accordingly, as we saw business conditions slowed throughout the quarter, we reduced our headcount.Moving to the table on the right, efficiency and volume related cost savings drove $35 million of cost favorability compared to the last year, primarily driven by a 6% reduction in crew starts and lower employee headcount. Moving down the table labor inflation was up $9 million in line with our expectations which were for labor inflation to rise modestly from the third quarter. While wage inflation was above 3% lower costs on health and welfare programs as well as the impact of the lower railroad unemployment tax rate continue to provide favorability. Rounding out the table other costs were $1 million lower. ","Looking at the first quarter headcount should remain relatively constant on a sequential basis because we demonstrated this quarter we will adjust the quarterly as business conditions warrant. In addition as we move into 2013 we expect the labor inflation will rise to around $20 million a quarter. Next we will review MS&O expenses on slide 32. MS&O expenses decreased 7% or $41 million versus last year. Looking at the table on the right the change in real estate gains reduced MS&O expense by $21 million versus 2011.The details which are provided in the quarterly financial report. Next efficiency in volume related cost savings reduced our MS&O expenses by $19 million compared to last year. The impact of running 8% fuel locomotives coupled with material cost savings initiatives had a favorable impact on our materials usage. Moving down the table inflation increased by $12 million well net causality and another decreased $13 million as continuing favorable adjustments or cash held in reserves as well as other favorable cost were partially offset by the railroad cost.Moving to the next slide, let\u2019s discuss the impact of fuel. Total fuel cost decreased $2 million versus last year, looking at the table to the right; fuel efficiency was favorable by $15 million reflecting a 4% year-over-year improvement in gallons consumed for gross ton mile. Lower volume also reduce fuel expense by $15 million with gross ton miles down 4%. Next, as shown in the chart on the left CSX\u2019s average cost per gallon for locomotive fuel increased to $3.28 up 8% versus last year and driving an increase of $28 million as seen on the chart on the right. That concludes the detail expense review for the fourth quarter now let\u2019s turn to the full year results on slide 34.On a full year basis revenue was up slightly to $11.8 billion as volume growth in merchandize and intermodal pricing gains and higher fuel recovery was offset by coal volume declines. Total expense for the year was slightly down as productivity savings were offset by higher depreciation and inflation. As a result full year operating income was up 1% and operating ratio improved to 70.6% despite the substantial coal headwinds in a moderate economy. Finally, our earnings per share increased 7% due to earnest growth and the impact of our share repurchase program.Moving to the next slide, I would like to take a moment to review CSX\u2019s full year performance in more detail. 2012 was a year in which CSX lost over $500 million of coal revenue year-over-year as utilities on our network accelerated this switch from coal to natural gas. It was also a year clouded by a global economic uncertainty as Europe grabbled with recession for both the U.S. and Chinese economies decelerated over the course of the year. Despite these obstacles CSX delivered on this guidance to grow earnings and improve operating margins.By focusing on delivering a superior service product, CSX was able to grow non-coal volume by 4% in a moderate economic environment. This volume growth combined with continued inflation plus pricing resulted in more than $500 million of additional merchandize and intermodal revenue in 2012. In addition, our focus on providing a superior service product for our customers was also key driving improving asset utilization as a result CSX was able to generate nearly $200 million in productivity savings. At the same time CSX also benefited in 2012 from two items which we will cycle in 2013. First we had $55 million of lower incentive compensation in 2012 versus the prior year.Second, gains on the SunRail transaction comprised a majority of the $90 million of favorability in 2012 real estate interactions. Looking at 2013 we expect SunRail to be much smaller contributor to our operating income of the remaining deferred gains we expect to realize about $40 million in the first half of 2013 with a balance to be recognized in future years. Now let\u2019s turn to the next slide to discuss 2012 capital investment dividends and share buybacks.On the left hand side of the page, full year capital investment was $2.2 billion, excluding public\/private reimbursable projects unchanged from last year. Our 2012 investment reflects our continued commitment to improving our infrastructure and equipment sustained high safety and service levels. Enhanced productivity and leveraged strategic growth opportunities that can produce superior returns. Moving to the right, CSX paid dividends of $0.54 per share in 2012, up 20% versus last year. Going forward, CSX remains committed to a dividend payout range of 30% to 35% of trailing 12 months earnings and this will be reviewed annually after the first quarter.Finally, in 2012, CSX fulfilled its commitment to complete its 2 billion share repurchase program by repurchasing $734 million during the course of the year. Collectively, CSX has repurchased $7.9 billion of shares since 2006, representing approximately one-third of total shares outstanding today. Looking forward, CSX remains committed to share buybacks as an important tool to return free cash flows to investors. We will update you on our plans for future share buybacks in the coming months.Moving to the next slide, let\u2019s discuss capital investment plans for 2013. In 2013, CSX plans to invest $2.3 billion in our business with the increase versus 2012 almost entirely driven by Positive Train Control. On the chart on the left, you can see that the bulk of the capital spending in 2013 will again be used to maintain the infrastructure in invest in equipment to help ensure a fluid network for our customers and to enhance productivity. We will also could then just focus on strategic investment that support long-term profitable growth. The intermodal highway-to-rail moment in the east continues to be one of the best long-term growth opportunities. We will invest accordingly to ensure that we are positioned to capture this profitable growth and generate attractive incremental returns. Finally, Positive Train Control which in total is expected to cost $1.7 billion, represents $325 million of spending in 2013 leaving approximately $800 million to be spent in the coming years to complete the project.Now, let me wrap up on the next slide. Recapping the year, CSX achieved earnings growth and margin expansion in 2012 despite substantial declines in our domestic coal market and moderating economic environment. We accomplished that by executing well on the things we control the most providing a superior service product, maintaining inflation-plus pricing, driving productivity to more than offset the cost inflation, and most importantly remaining focused on providing the safest work environment for employees and the communities we serve.Looking forward, we expect broad-based merchandise growth in 2013 to be led by our markets that support the oil and gas industry. We also see continued strong growth in intermodal on further highway-to-rail conversion. However, we still expect coal to remain challenged well into 2013. On the domestic side, volume will continue to be affected by high inventories and low natural gas prices. On the export side, we expect volume to moderate from the record levels achieved in 2012. In addition, we anticipate transportation pricing for export coal to be pressured as we work with the producers to keep U.S. coal competitive globally in an environment where the underlying commodity price for thermal and metallurgical coal is lower.As mentioned earlier, CSX will also be cycling the expense favorability we experienced in 2012 from real estate transaction and incentive compensation. While CSX has realized margin expansion for nine consecutive years and earnings growth, the eight out of the last nine years, it is too early to project margin expansion and earnings growth for 2013 at this time due to the evolving coal market, the cycling of the 2012 benefits, and a still uncertain economy.While 2013 will be a transitional year, our business remains fundamentally strong. Looking longer term even with the evolution in energy that has occurred our business prospects continued to point to the future of sustainable growth enabled by superior service product, that supports inflation-plus pricing, productivity gains, and a broad-based volume growth that tracks above the broader economy.With that, let me turn the presentation back to Michael for his closing remarks.Michael Ward","Thank you, Fredrik. At this time last year, we had just completed eight straight years of operating ratio improvement with earnings growth in seven of those years, both occurred in a period that included one of the most severe economic periods in our nation\u2019s history. In 2012, we again grew earnings while facing a major drop in the key market. One of the slowest economic recoveries on record and a political environment that has added even more uncertainty to the mix. Through all of this we have remained a vibrant healthy company with a compelling long term value proposition for investors. That remains true today; we still see the inevitable movement of freight to rails as the population and consumption increase. Global trade leads need to move more products between ports and people. The highways continue to become more congested. The reindustrialization of our nation gains momentum and the nation becomes more aware of the environmental benefits we offer. CSX stands ready to bring real solutions to these problems for its primary transportation network, a network that serves a broad portfolio of products and some of the biggest and most robust consumer markets in the world.In the near term as we outlined earlier 2013 will be another challenging year as the evolution and the energy market continues but begins to stabilize. Regardless of the conditions we are going to focus relentlessly on the things that are most in our control of which our employees do extraordinarily well while capitalizing market opportunities available in energy and other markets. By doing so we will optimize our performance in the near term and prepare for the bright future we see for our business and for you our shareholders. In the meantime, CSX like the customers we serve across many industries is advocating for Washington to remain diligent about reduction, restore certainty and stability to the economy and unleash the expansion that can and ultimately will take place.Thank you for your time this morning and we now look forward to answering your questions.Question-and-Answer Session","Operator(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Trahan and Company.Scott Group - Wolfe Trahan and CompanySo I kind of start on the export coal side, I think the guidance for 40 million tons implies about an 8 million ton reduction and wondering how you think about breaking that down between the met and thermal side and then on the pricing side. I know you talked about pressure on export pricing, we saw pressure on pricing in \u201912 do you think the pressure on pricing in \u201913 is bigger or less worse than what we saw in \u201912?Clarence GoodenHey Scott as we told you we expect the export coal to be about 40 million tons, it's a little early in the year to get much more precise than that as you know by the end of the first quarter a lot of the metallurgical contracts will for the quarter will start firming up and we\u2019ll see what it looks like on that and in regards to the pricing I would tell you that the metallurgical coal appears to us to be firming up in terms of pricing. The metallurgical coal that\u2019s selling at Queensland now which is the benchmark in Australia is about a $170 a ton and it appears to have stabilized there over the last few months. Where we could have some potential headwinds on the export coal pricing will be in the thermal coals with the API index now running about $92 but having said that we have about half of that 40 million or so tons of coal already under contract on the thermal side of the business. So we\u2019re pretty positive about where that pricing will be. Did that answer your question?Scott Group - Wolfe Trahan and CompanyIt certainly does on pricing side, I guess on the volume side you\u2019re saying within that 40 million tons of, it\u2019s tough to know how much of it's going to be met and thermal it's just too early to say, is that what you\u2019re\u2026?Clarence GoodenYeah, I know that 20 million of it is going to be thermal but I don\u2019t know how much more of that will be thermal. It's going to be about the same mix we have had this year for 2012 our mix was 50-50 met and thermal and for the fourth quarter it was 56, 44 in favor of met.Scott Group - Wolfe Trahan and CompanyAnd the second question I guess for Fredrik or Michael you guys started the 65 [OR] [ph] target longer term and I know you\u2019ve been talking about how it's a lot tougher to get to but you still see a chance for, I\u2019m wondering given your view on \u201913, if you still even see any chance of that or is that now really getting very tough to do.Fredrik EliassonWell I think we\u2019re in a process right now of going through a really detailed bottoms up review of our strategic plan just like we do every year and that plan is going to be reflective of the new coal environment that we find ourselves, there is some pluses and minuses. I am sure this is going to come out in that plan. There are certain markets that probably are stronger than we thought when we originally laid out that guidance, but obviously the big driver here is going to be what has occurred to our utility coal business. So, we are going to work through that and review it with our Board here in the spring. And once we have gone through that, we are going to be communicating that appropriately sometime after that session.Scott Group - Wolfe Trahan and CompanyOkay, great. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.Michael Ward","Thank you.Operator","Thank you. Mr. Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan.Michael Ward","Good morning Tom.Tom Wadewitz - JPMorganYeah, good morning Michael. Good morning everyone. Clarence, I wanted to ask a little bit of following up on the export pricing, I thought that given some of the pressures in fourth quarter on export pricing, your revenue per car and coal might be down sequentially and was actually flat. I think you talked about, I don\u2019t know if you are referring to a utility contract that maybe got priced up in the quarter or what it was, it would have provided an offset, can you give a little more thought on that sequential price in coal?Clarence GoodenYes, Tom, I can. There are several factors of why that RPU and that coal remained relatively flat. One was the escalators that we have built in to our utility contracts had kicked in. Second was we have a positive mix both in our southern utilities, which have a longer length of haul as well as positive impact from northern utilities picking up. So, it was a mixture of both the mix and the length of haul that we were handling as well as the escalators.Tom Wadewitz - JPMorganOkay. So, how would you \u2013 obviously, you took some significant pressure on export pricing and your commentary is appropriately cautious I think on export looking at 2013, how would you think the revenue per car and coal would look if you compare it off kind of a fourth quarter base, do you think that escalators re-pricing whatever in utility offsets weakness in export and you kind of have flattish coal yields or how would you think about coal yields in total kind of up or down in 2013?Clarence GoodenWell, I think in 2013 Tom you can sort of look at it be in the relatively flat on a year-over-year type basis with the yields there. As I have mentioned earlier, we have got the thermal coal under a contract, so we are pretty comfortable with those numbers. I think export is about bottomed out in terms of the price there. And we will just don\u2019t have the escalators in our current utility contracts.Tom Wadewitz - JPMorganOkay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks for the time.Operator","Thank you. Mr. Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley.Michael Ward","Good morning Bill.Bill Greene - Morgan StanleyHi, there. Good morning. Can I just ask a one follow-up there just on coal, was there take or pay at all a big deal this quarter or will it be next year that we have to think about that when we model the coal revenue?Michael WardNo Bill, it was not an issue at all.Bill Greene - Morgan StanleyOkay. And then Oscar I know obviously some very impressive productivity metrics, but given what\u2019s going on with the coal side of the business, is there a case for taking a more aggressive sort of approach and sort of saying like I know you are talking about 130 and that\u2019s aggressive, but just to say like we have got to do even more and maybe this number could get ratcheted up over the course of the year. How sort of flexible is the cost structure?Oscar MunozLet me answer in a couple of ways, Bill, I think there is almost infinite possibilities over the long run. I think it\u2019s important to give our team credit for that great delivery in 2012. And as you know, our 130 is a long-term guidance that we have given for quite some time. And it is a difficult thing. Having said that, as we have exhibited over the many years, and I think we do it acutely through the plus method on those numbers. Give us this first quarter to see how the weather turns out and see how we see business demand, and I think we\u2019ll give you a better update, but our numbers are not \u2013 or our published guidance number is not reflective of our long-term commitment to continued success there. So, you will see more from us over the long run.Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley","Okay, fair enough. Thanks for the time.Operator","Thank you. Mr. Kevin Crissey with UBS.Michael Ward","Good morning Kevin.Kevin Crissey - UBSHey, good morning. I was just wondering what you are changing coal pricing to keep that commodity competitive in the world market, understood, why is that not appropriate for all kind of commoditized products, why? You talked about getting rail price, rail inflation-plus pricing overall, why wouldn\u2019t you have that same effect in other commodities, where you see world prices decline or weakness in overall volumes such that your customers are struggling? Thanks.Clarence GoodenWell, Kevin I think it varies in those commodity basis literally from commodity to commodity. So, let\u2019s take corn and soybeans, for example. Although those are world traded commodities, because of the sheer volumes of the United States produces in both those markets what\u2019s going to govern that in my view is going to be what the domestic market is for the U.S. whereas in this export coal market is truly a global type of commodity and the same thing applies in our phosphate and fertilizer business most of our phosphates and fertilizers are either domestically produced or North America produced, meaning Canada is an example. Although some phosphates do come in from Morocco and Saudi Arabia but they really don\u2019t tend to be market makers if you will, does that answer your question?Kevin Crissey - UBSYes, I understand the global aspect of it but in general if the customer is struggling to make money or have it them end the market demand will that have you know what affect would that have on your overall ability to, I mean you\u2019re adding a certain amount of value but if their customers product isn\u2019t adding as much value it's difficult to see why they would want to pay higher or be able to pay higher rate.Fredrik EliassonKevin this Fredrik, we always look at our rate structure to make sure that we maximize whatever value we can create for CSX. So if there are opportunities to lower the rate to create more bottom line value for CSX we would do that, export coal is very extreme example of where we can create potentially incremental demand by lowering our rates to make sure that the produces are competitive worldwide. If there are other opportunities like that we would do that but you also know that at the same time we\u2019re very focused on inflation plus pricing and so that\u2019s a trade-off that we do in combination between what the sales and marketing team does and what we in finance works through in each and every contract to make sure we set the price at the right place to maximize the bottom line for CSX.Operator","Thank you. Mr. Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill LynchCan you talk through on the coal side as you look at repricing some of those contracts, what percent come up? Is it about a I guess just give me a range of what you\u2019re looking at renewing in 2013 and how do those terms change now that the utilities have gone through this downturn, are they guaranteeing lower minimums? Are they looking for rate relief? Can you kind of just walk us through how some of those negotiations are proceeding?Michael WardI assume that in the contracts you\u2019re talking about domestic utilities.Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill LynchYes.Michael WardWe don\u2019t have any major domestic utility contracts immediately coming up in 2013. We have some toward the end of the fourth quarter so that\u2019s number one. Number two, I really don\u2019t want to get into how we price individual utility contracts because that tends to be between us and utility and there are some market implications there.Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill LynchOkay but can you at least follow-up in general, are you seeing just given the high inventory levels, are you seeing lower demand levels on those take portions of that guarantee?Michael WardWe\u2019re not having a lot if you\u2019re asking about liquidated damages, we\u2019re not seeing a lot of liquidated damages. There is not a material that are showing up right now.Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill LynchOkay and then just a follow-up question on the operating ratio target your long term, obviously Fredrik he reiterated that only a couple of months ago and I guess I just wanted to understand you know have things deteriorated more rapidly since your last couple of conference call, just trying to ascertain what the incremental moves is since you have last reiterated I guess looking at the Florida gains those have been schedule to disappear for a while and presume there is only maybe two or three quarters left on that. Just when you think about that what scale does that target begin to change? Are you talking basis points or are things significantly difference since you have last talked about it?Fredrik EliassonReally since the last earnings release and some of those public events we have since then nothing has really changed, it's become more and more challenging and we have said repeatedly we\u2019re going through the same process that we go through every year which is to develop a strategic plan and then that gets approved by a board during the spring. So nothing has really changed beyond the fact that we do have now firmer understanding of 2013 and the challenges that we\u2019re facing that we have outlined today. So as I said well clearly the coal environment is different and has continued to be a negative drag. We are also seeing some other opportunities that are potentially stronger or better than we thought previously but net-net we got to work through and see what the impact is on that for our long term guidance.Operator","Thank you. Mr. Tom Kim with Goldman Sachs.Tom Kim - Goldman SachsI was interested in the intermodal side of the business, would you be able to articulate what the growth would have been without (inaudible) so can just get an idea of what the year-on-year comparisons might look like going forward once the comp, sort of not cycled through? Thank you.Clarence GoodenMaersk was the preponderant driver of our international growth. So, when you look on that flash report and you see those numbers there for the international segment that was all driven primarily by Maersk.Tom Kim - Goldman SachsAnd the domestic is growing at 5%, 6%...Clarence Gooden5% to 6% and we would have had, our growth would have been about 2% higher in the quarter than it actually was, but we were impacted by Hurricane Sandy that really disrupted the entire New York, Port Authority of New York and New Jersey therefore of nearly a couple of weeks.Operator","Thank you. Mr. Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.Michael Ward","Good morning Brandon.Brandon Oglenski - Barclays","Hey, good morning everyone. Maybe I will follow up on that question then is domestic intermodal growth of 5% to 6% then a fair target for 2013, especially after you have on-boarded the Maersk business now?Michael WardI think that 5% to 6% of our domestic business in the 2013 to be in the range.Brandon Oglenski - BarclaysOkay. And how much of that is going to be utilizing existing capacity to think about the incremental benefits from growing that business?Michael WardThe majority of it will be in the current capacity that we have in the network both in the train network as well as the terminal network.Brandon Oglenski - BarclaysOkay, thank you.Michael Ward","Thank you, Brandon.Operator","Thank you. Chris Wetherbee with Citi Investment Research.Michael Ward","Good morning Chris.Chris Wetherbee - Citi Investment ResearchGood morning guys. Thank you for taking the question. Just a quick question just to clarify on the export pricing, Clarence you mentioned on the thermal side you said about 20 million tons of the outlook for \u201813 is thermal, is it fair to say that, that is under a contract that does not come up for renewal in 2013 or is already locked in from a price perspective?Clarence GoodenIt\u2019s already locked in from a price perspective.Chris Wetherbee - Citi Investment ResearchOkay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Then maybe switching gears back to intermodal, just want to get an understanding of kind of how lapping Maersk may impact kind of intermodal yield it seems like you got a bit of a reacceleration in total yields in the intermodal in the fourth quarter not only does that has any impact by, the Port of New York being shut down for a couple of weeks and maybe seeing a little bit more domestic growth and international growth, but just maybe want to get a sense of what the puts and takes to yields are as you lap that Maersk contract this year?Michael WardWell, I think the big driver has been the value that we are creating. And what we have mentioned earlier about that we are not pricing for volume, we are pricing to make a profit here. And with the service that Oscar mentioned that he is providing here where we are in the 90 plus and percent on-time is defined as available to our customers in both our premium intermodal products and approaching that in our regular intermodal products has made a difference in the marketplace. I think the third thing that\u2019s happened for us is where in our highway-to-rail conversions, we have a proprietary model that we can use with our customers to model what their transportation flows are and can demonstrate how we can save money and create value for the customers and that\u2019s been a very positive experience for us.Chris Wetherbee - Citi Investment ResearchOkay. So, you are getting that benefit from a lot of different factors, okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks for the time guys. I appreciate it.Operator","Mr. Chris Ceraso with Credit Suisse.Michael Ward","Good morning Chris.Chris Ceraso - Credit SuisseNot to harp on this, but just to clarify one last thing on the coal pricing you said that the book of export thermal now is priced if I am remembering this right that re-priced on Jan 1, so maybe we haven\u2019t seen the effect of that in the numbers yet. Is there going to be any kind of a step down in the RPU form the Q4 yield that we saw in coal to Q1?Michael WardWell, the thermal coal did not re-price on January 1, as thermal coal had been that I am speaking of has been under contract for some period of time. What you may end up saying though and the overall coal is export side of the business is slightly down in the first quarter.Chris Ceraso - Credit SuisseOkay. Yes, I apologize I was referring to the export book, so there will be some step down in export thermal for Q1?Michael WardCould be yes.Chris Ceraso - Credit SuisseOkay. And then just as a follow-up you mentioned a few times in your breakdown of the outlook in the positive side of the ledger, the crude and energy related, can you just help us size that maybe give us an idea of what the total revenue was in crude and drilling-related equipment and materials in 2012 and what you think that goes to roughly in 2013?Michael WardI don\u2019t want to give you a specific number on that, because you can pick up the volume from AAR data and then divide it into it, know our revenue is between us and our customers and that wouldn\u2019t be right for them. I would tell you that we are averaging between seven and nine trains of crude a week. We expect that that will increase in 2013, those numbers I gave you there were what was happening in the fourth quarter toward the end of fourth quarter. I will tell you that in the energy and petroleum related products frac sand business is up. We\u2019ve an announcement of one ethylene cracker been located on CSX and possibly a second one. We have two fractionators that will because coming online in the first quarter in West Virginia. So you know petroleum related products for us in 2013 I think is going to be a very positive number.Chris Ceraso - Credit SuisseFor the 7 and 9 trains per week is that something that doubles in 2013 or not that big of an increase?Michael WardDon\u2019t want to go there.Operator","Thank you. Mr. John Larkin with Stifel Nicolaus.John Larkin - Stifel NicolausSeems like CSX is doing a better job than perhaps some of the other class ones and matching resources with changes in traffic and changes in traffic mix and I\u2019m just wondering how organizationally you approach that, do you have a SWAT team in the operating department that focuses on that and is constantly monitoring events and tweaking resource allocations to different divisions and so forth, how does that work internally so well.Oscar Munoz Hey John it's Oscar, it is really a novel item and you might be surprised and shocked to hear that but I think the way we do it is a combined group of our senior leaders in both the sales and marketing organization and an operations meeting on a regular basis discussing the trends and making the appropriate adjustments very quickly. It's as simple as that frankly and they are doing a great job of it.Michael WardAnd we want to take some risk if we look and see the thing might be moving in a negative direction in a given market we tend to move quickly on it rather than wait to see it evolve.Oscar MunozWe can always get better forecast from sales and marketing I just got to say that.John Larkin - Stifel NicolausAs far as the balance sheet is concerned you have got a debt to total cap ratio somewhere just a tad over 52% or so that\u2019s a little bit higher than some of the other railroads, do you feel comfortable with that and is that a range that you can live with this year, next year and beyond and do you think with that kind of leverage the board is in a position to reauthorize another share repurchase?Clarence GoodenI\u2019ll start with the share repurchase question. We\u2019re in conjunction with a strategic plan also going to review the board our share repurchase plans going forward and we\u2019ll update you once we have a decision around that. In regards to the debt level I think what we have said that we\u2019re targeting kind of an upper spectrum of a BBB in a BBB area and I think and also right now from where we have been and improving credit profile so we might be perhaps a little bit leveraged than the other railroads but we think that being in that upper end of BBB is the right place to be. We think we generally trade our debt general trade a little bit higher than what our rating. So we think we\u2019re in a pretty good place and as we think about the share repurchase program and sizing of that I think predominantly we want to use free cash flow but if there is balance sheet capacity that we can use within the context of an improving credit profile we\u2019re certainly going to do that as well.Operator","Thank you. Mr. Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities.Cherilyn Radbourne - TD SecuritiesNobody has asked about stockpiles so I wondered if you can just kind of give us an update on where are those stand in your service territory.Clarence GoodenYou know in the past we\u2019ve been given days per (inaudible) and that\u2019s all over the place because you know have it figured. In the south the utility stockpiles are continued to be high, in fact they are growing to some extent. It has been driven by electrical demand and the South Eastern United States is down about 1.2%. Second factor is driving is low natural gas prices they are staying low and therefore gas is been dispatched ahead of coal. In the North our utilities have slightly higher than normal stockpiles and in the mid-Atlantic there are about where they need to be in terms of the size of stockpiles did that help you?Cherilyn Radbourne - TD SecuritiesAnd I was just curious in terms of the 5% to 10% decline in thermal coal guidance that you provided, what are you assuming in terms of underlying generation demand?Michael WardUnderlying generation demand will be the assumption in our plan is flat.Cherilyn Radbourne - TD SecuritiesOkay, thank you.

And then in terms of pricing is sort of the pricing in line with the truck expectations more on like the 2% to 3% range or do you think that you can sort of recapture some of that historical discount?Michael WardWell, the historical discount over the past few years has become smaller and smaller as a percent of the total transportation cost, but I think you can expect to see our pricing for intermodal staying at 2% to 3%.Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thanks guys.Operator","Mr. Jason Seidl with Dahlman Rose.Michael Ward","Good morning Jason.Jason Seidl - Dahlman Rose","Hey, good morning everyone. First off, Oscar great job on the safety front, that was impressive for the quarter. My question is really for Fred, Fred just as I go with the sort of puts and takes 2012 versus 2013, if I am reading it right from what you guys said, it looks like you got $50 million of incentive comp headwind, you got about a $50 million differential from SunRail and you mentioned about you are going to see $20 million of labor per quarter plus we lay on top of that year looking at about $130 million in productivity savings. Am I missing anything in the puts or takes for the cost side?Fredrik EliassonI think those are the key things that we have outlined obviously with also the headwind that we are facing on the cost line in terms of both the utility coal side and we were facing both on the volume side on export and the fact that we have had to reduce our rates on the export side as well. So, I think you got the cost side, the key drivers on the cost side right, but then also I have the top line.Jason Seidl - Dahlman RoseOkay. So, there is a modest negative cost headwind as I calculated and then whatever the top line does it does?Fredrik EliassonRight, correct.Jason Seidl - Dahlman Rose","Okay, perfect.

And so our frac sand, as a whole, is holding up reasonably well.David Vernon - Sanford BernsteinOkay. And just as a quick follow-up with the length of haul increase on the domestic, is that a change in type of coal is it the Illinois Basin coming in perhaps going into a plant that used to be taking PRB or is it just the ebbs and flows across the network?Michael WardSome of it is Illinois Basin coal, but it\u2019s not going into plants that took PRB, it was going into plants that took Central App. And the rest of it has just been the ordering patterns of the utilities fulfilling their coal contracts.David Vernon - Sanford BernsteinJust fulfilling the coal contracts.

Sal Vitale on for Jeff. Just had a quick question just a clarification. On you mentioned that some of the reasons why RPU for coal was flat in 4Q was number one you mentioned the escalator and then you mentioned the positive mix impact of longer haul. Can you isolate excluding those two factors what would RPU have been?Michael WardI can\u2019t right now, no.Sal Vitale - Sterne AgeeOkay. I was just thinking just by order of magnitude is it really significant or is it just couple of 100 basis points perhaps?Michael WardYeah, I don\u2019t know.Sal Vitale - Sterne AgeeOkay. And then just looking forward to 2013, you also mentioned that export coal pricing is still weak and yet you mentioned that coal RPU for 2013 could be relatively flat. The main offsets there are what the escalators and the fact that you have thermal coal under contract?Michael WardWell, what I hope I said was is that export coal pricing we think for the full year is going to be flat. The first quarter you may find it down slightly mainly, because we had a very strong first quarter last year in our coal pricing and you won't see that total reflected in the first quarter this year.Sal Vitale - Sterne AgeeOkay so just to clarify you didn\u2019t intend to say that coal RPU, overall coal RPU for \u201913 would be relatively flat?Michael WardYes. He didn\u2019t had to, I did.Sal Vitale - Sterne AgeeYou did. Okay thank you, thank you for the clarification.Operator","Mr. Peter Nesvold with Jefferies and Company.Peter Nesvold - Jefferies and CompanyI guess first just a clarification, so your outlook for export volumes are 40 million tons, they will be down about 16% from 47.8 for the year. You also said you\u2019re going to hold the line on pricing. So do you think the market is down 16 or do you is there some sort of temporary market share losses in there based on price?Clarence GoodenI think the U.S. market is down. It's difficult to assess what the Chinese will do here particularly after the Communist Congress Party\u2019s meeting in March but the export coal number is just reflecting what the U.S. is.Peter Nesvold - Jefferies and CompanyUnderstood, okay. And then this is my follow-up question. So longer term and we look at domestic coal volumes down maybe [50%] [ph] from the peak is some of that clearly is permanent changes in Central App, Northern App, any sense for longer term as we sort of get back to a normalized environment on industrial production, electricity consumption, natural gas prices how much of those losses do you think eventually come back as we get into a normalized environment?Clarence Gooden I think it is going to be difficult to assess for multiple reasons. First there is going to be some impacts that you know there is a lot of different guesses now exactly what they are going to be as 2015 kicks in. Secondly, as long as we have gas prices in this $3 plus range it's going to be difficult for coal to recover back to the levels that you and I are talking about are going to.Peter Nesvold - Jefferies and CompanyOkay but I mean if the longer term curve were implying $4, so what I\u2019m trying to do is separate gas prices from EPA regulations and other sort of structural changes in the market. One could argue obviously argue the nat gas is structural but if we\u2019re to separate nat gas from it, is there any kind of perspective on that.Michael WardWe think a lot of the plants that would have been shut down in 2015 due to EPA regulations have largely been shut down by the low gas prices. So really accelerated what we expected would happen three years from now. On a longer term basis I think there is an issue of how do we make sure we turn the lights on so we think some of those remaining coal fire plants are going to be part of the energy mix in the Eastern half of the United States.Operator","Mr. Matt Troy with Susquehanna International.Matt Troy - Susquehanna InternationalQuestion on intermodal, a bright spot to move away from coal. (Inaudible) incrementals are good if you had a couple of boxes on a double-stack or if you, you make the train longer. I was just wondering structurally over the next two, three, four years as you begin to harvest investments you\u2019ve made in building out the network is it reasonable to assume when I think about segment margins that intermodal could begin to approach and one day surpass corporate average. I know this is a business historically where your margins have been thinner but obviously given the critical mass the industry and your folks have achieved (inaudible) is it reasonable to assume that kind of inflection kind of turning the barge if you will is something that we could expect let\u2019s call it in the next couple of years.Fredrik EliassonLet me take this, this is Fredrik, I think overall as we look at the contribution of different business segments, we tried to stay away from talking too much about it but I do think that as we think about incrementally the margins on intermodal they are attractive and from an average - plus or minus versus average I think they are pretty close to it. I think the issue generally intermodal that you need lot of boxes to make up for a carload because the RPU is a third or so of a carload but the margins on the traffic that we\u2019re getting because we\u2019re so focused on the pricing and making sure that every load that we carry carries its own weight, it's attractive. Just that you need a lot of boxes to make up for the carload decline.Matt Troy - Susquehanna InternationalRight I guess my follow-up would be just more tactically near term for Clarence, ex-Maersk international intermodal running closer to flat by my calculations. We have been destocking for some time now in the U.S. economy, the numbers that you disclosed earlier certainly bear that out and inventories remain on the lower side of what we will consider historically normal. Given that we have run down for so long in the international business is somewhat, but I\u2019m just curious what are you hearing from your customers about first quarter their intentions around shipping for Chinese New Year as things slow down in a couple of weeks here and there is not much time left thereafter in the first quarter. What are your conversations indicating about import intentions and what folks might be planning from an inventory perspective? Thank you.Clarence GoodenWell, I thought our steamship customers, they are singing the blues. I mean, it\u2019s a tough business for them to be in right now. They have to keep these vessels full, the fuel cost, the bunker fuel is still a problem for them. The largest trade lane in the world is down now which is Asia to Europe. So, steamship business is tough right now. As far as the Lunar New Year goes, it\u2019s early this year and we should have that behind us here by sometime in March I think it is, it will be behind us. I think you will see the business, the international business start picking up for the spring.Matt Troy - Susquehanna InternationalOkay, I look forward to that. Thank you.Operator","Mr. Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets.Michael Ward","Good morning Walter.Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital MarketsGood morning. Just a follow-up here on for Clarence, when I look at your Q1 outlook, you mentioned the 57% that\u2019s positive, then I listened to Fredrik when he is talking a little bit on the full year talking a bit more of broad-based growth. I guess am I to infer that you do see the second half or even Q2 onwards sequentially improving versus your Q1 outlook? And if that\u2019s the case, Clarence, which areas do you think where you might be a little bit negative on right now, would you see being more positive as we get through the year?Clarence GoodenWell, my own view of the economy is not dissimilar than what Michael has said publicly and that is we should have slow, steady, continuous growth. There are some models, economic models that point to a much stronger second half. Now, I am an optimist and I\u2019d like to believe those models, but I am going to stick with slow, steady growth here. I think some of the markets where you could see possible improvements for us would be in the metals market. I think you could see some improvement for us in our chemicals, particularly the petroleum side of our business going forward. I think there is could be opportunities in the construction sector to see more growth. Housing starts could approach 850, maybe a lot higher than that, 850,000 or maybe a lot higher than that here in the year. And until we get housing back and automotive back at the same time I think it\u2019s going to be difficult to see the economy growing much faster than the 2% plus.Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital MarketsWell, Clarence, regardless of what the economy does if you take all of our non-coal businesses as a group, we expect we will outperform carload growth against whatever the economy turns out to be, is that correct?Clarence GoodenThat is correct.Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital MarketsRight, okay. And just a second follow-up question here for you, Oscar, obviously when we exclude some of the, let\u2019s call that the non-recurring items that occurred in 2012, it looked at the OR given on a year-over-year basis we did see a decline in the OR as a result of the significant decline you saw in coal. Arguably, some of that coal was unexpected in nature and didn\u2019t give you, Oscar the opportunity that you might have had, had you had a crystal ball to really reengineer your network to accommodate that? Clarence is not giving you heads up that thermal is going to be down 5% to 10% and export is going to be down 18%. Given that outlook on coal again for this year, can you protect the OR versus this, now that you might have a little bit more certainty around it or would we see another drag on the OR excluding those non-recurring items in 2013?Oscar MunozI am trying to understand it whether you are asking an OR guidance question, which I want to pass over to Fredrik quickly or if you are asking about our intent to continue our very productive and efficient way. So, the answer to the latter is clearly within the coal fields by the way we have done and have taken a lot of action already. And over the past couple of years, we have anticipated some of the decline and have planned accordingly. And again, but you got the export coal growth, which is offsetting some of that and then you got the Illinois Basin coal movement, which is helping us, so a lot of our expenses kind of moving in those areas. So, I think we have taken quite a bit of action. We\u2019ll continue to do that. But again with regards to long-term OR, I think that\u2019s something for Fred to.Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital MarketsSo, yeah for Fred is what Oscar is telling you when you pull that in, do you think that\u2019s enough to protect the OR this year?Fredrik EliassonWell, I think that\u2019s what we, the guidance that we gave in the prepared remarks is that a little too early to tell where we are going to come out for the year on the OR. We certainly are used to as we also said we have done it for nine years in a row to improve our OR but it's just too early at this point but we certainly like to see it and we certainly overcame a lot of challenges in 2012 to be able to produce and improved OR but we will see as we go long here to see how things materialize.Operator","Mr. Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar.Keith Schoonmaker \u2013 MorningstarI would like to growth initiatives of 2013 CapEx about 16% for strategic growth initiatives with an emphasis called on intermodal growth. Is this yards or double stack clearance still but non-containers? Could you add some detail to this investment please.Clarence GoodenThe growth essentially yards for intermodal terminals and some double-stack clearance there is a small amount I think for boxes as well but is a relatively small amount so it's really a support the long term opportunities that we see intermodal and (inaudible) of capital for intermodal goes into expanding the terminal capacity but we\u2019re in the amidst of a national gateway initiatives where we do have to spend some capital to finalize the double-stack clearance that we need on our network but after next two or three years that will be completed.Keith Schoonmaker \u2013 MorningstarAnd at this time how much is left not yet cleared for double-stack than it used to be?Clarence GoodenI think if you look on a volume basis I think we\u2019re closed to little bit over 80%, I think as you complete couple of more areas over the next few years you will be closer to 90 and as really I think we\u2019re going to stay because I think the remaining obstacles are big enough, we\u2019re not going to do that.Michael WardWe just cleared this year at fourth quarter of this year at Massachusetts and we\u2019re is double-stack cleared from Cambridge, Pennsylvania over to Chicago will be double-stack cleared here in the first quarter. The only real link we have to get is the ports in Virginia and Baltimore and Wilmington over two chambers are cleared yet.Keith Schoonmaker \u2013 MorningstarAnd then second is any material investment needed to serve the new energy markets or is that pretty low cost to serve?Clarence GoodenIt's pretty low cost to get it to that, no significant investments.Operator","Mr. Justin Yagerman with Deutsche Bank.Justin Yagerman - Deutsche BankWanted to dig in for a second clearance, you gave us some good color around the export coal side and was curious what the duration of those contracts we\u2019re going to be on the thermal side, the 20 million tons and when they were signed, was that a Q4 or an early Q1 event?Clarence GoodenJustin some of those contracts were actually signed in 2011, some were signed throughout the year in 2012. They are constantly rolling over if you will. We were fortunate enough to get some back in the first part of 2012 when the pricing was much better than what it is now. But it's a cost rolling over of those thermal contracts.Justin Yagerman - Deutsche BankOkay I guess I was under the impression that most of them were coming up at the end of \u201912 but maybe it was a bit more spread out and is met still on a quarterly basis as we look out or are you doing most of that now on a spot basis, are you looking at the met side of the export business.Clarence GoodenIt's mostly on a quarterly basis with some on a spot basis but mostly quarterly.Justin Yagerman - Deutsche BankOkay and then intermodal you talked a little bit on the yield side on the international but just curious you gave some volume expectations around domestic. You\u2019re lapping the win of the Maersk business, what do you expect that growth rate to look like as we move through \u201913 on the international intermodal side volumes?Clarence GoodenI think that the last FTR data that I saw showed the imports around was 3% to 4%, yes it's about 3% to 4%.Justin Yagerman - Deutsche BankOkay so trying to in-line with market growth on imports?Clarence GoodenYes.Justin Yagerman - Deutsche BankAll right and then I guess last one was curious Michael we haven\u2019t heard much on the regulatory side but I think our newly reelected President has been kind of vocal on the coal side of things in terms of how he views energy in the world. How does that factor into your view and then how does that inform the regulatory atmosphere on Washington as you think about your relationship to those businesses?Michael WardWell I know the President said the climate change is an issue and he does want to address. As you well know the EPA has been fairly aggressive with its regulatory actions that are limiting the usage of coal. My belief is we would not see any legislation that would further inhibit coal being passed with this Congress, because I don\u2019t think the appetite in the Congress will be to put any kind of a carbon tax or other type of legislation like that.Justin Yagerman - Deutsche BankOkay, I appreciate the time guys. Thanks so much for taking my calls.Michael WardWell, thank you everybody for joining us and we look forward to seeing you next quarter.OperatorThis concludes today\u2019s teleconference.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. During this call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Following today's presentation we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","For opening remarks and introduction I'd like to turn the call to Mr. David Baggs, Vice President, Treasurer, and Investor Relations Officer for CSX Corporation.","David Baggs","Thank you, Shirley, and good morning everyone. And on behalf of the management team here at CSX Corporation I'd like to welcome you to our quarterly earnings call, and also thank you for your interest in our company. Our presentation, our quarterly finance reports, and our press release, which conveyed our results and reaffirmed our 2017 guidance, are all available on our Web site at csx.com in the investor section. In addition, a webcast replay of this presentation will be available later today, and the 10-Q will be posted tomorrow on that same Web site.","This morning, CSX is being represented by our Chief Executive Officer, Hunter Harrison; our Chief Operating Officer; Cindy Sanborn; our Chief Sales and Marketing Officer, Fredrik Eliasson; and our Chief Financial Officer, Frank Lonegro.","On Slide 2 is our forward-looking disclosure. Any statements about the future made during the course of this presentation or during the question-and-answer session should be taken in the full context of this disclosure.","Turning to Slide 3, is our non-GAAP disclosure. While CSX files all of our financials in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we're providing certain non-GAAP measures to give you a more wholesome understanding of the business. These measures should be taken in the full context of this disclosure and with the understanding that they are not a substitute for GAAP. Finally, with our investor conference less than two weeks away, and with close to 30 analysts covering CSX, I would encourage everyone today to limit their questions to one.","With that, it is my great pleasure and privilege to introduce our President and Chief Executive Officer, Hunter Harrison. Hunter?","Hunter Harrison","Thank you, David, and good morning to everyone, and thanks for joining us. As David said, we've got a lot to discuss today, and my remarks are going to be a little different than they normally might be. I'm going to allow Frank to run do the numbers, there's no use in us both doing it. And to try to give you some explanation or at least our read on the quarter, which some could characterize as mixed results. There were a lot of dynamics going on and taking place in the third quarter, which was a carryover to some degree from the second quarter, and was a challenging start.","So, let me start here. I think that we went through obviously some slippage service-wise in the third quarter, which we're not proud of, which we had a listening session last week with the Surface Transportation Board, with their team members. I think some of you were present. I think there was some mixed reporting there, but I can tell you this, I've been in this business a long time, and this company is back to where it was -- it's back to where it was, and it's better, and it's climbing, and I see those issues, generally speaking, behind us, which I'm very proud of that. It reflects to some degree the resiliency of this organization, to go through what this organization has been through, and to be able to come out of an eight-nine-week, a little setback.","And I didn't really \u2013 I considered initially as we went into this transaction; I didn't want to spend a lot of time reflecting that. But I do think it will to some degree add some context that this was not a failure of the model, a failure [indiscernible] railroading. Some of the historians aren't very good historians, this is not a new operating plan. This is an operating plan that's been in existence for 20 years plus. It's had a pretty good track record. In fact, I would -- it's a little hard for me to be objective, but an excellent track record. And so I think, as we reflect, it was more of an execution issue. We didn't execute at a lot of levels, and we learned that. And as a result, we had to make some, what I would describe as painful changes, that's never pleasant to do, but we had to do that.","We had two derailments that were a real concern to me. One was a pretty horrific derailment on the side of a mountain that you read a lot about, that we have changed some procedures as a result, and I would say also to the local people there that we were dealing with who were extremely, extremely cooperative to our efforts trying to get that derailment under control. And then we had a -- and still I have under investigation a derailment in South Carolina that I'm convinced from a personal standpoint is clearly a case of sabotage where we had a bulldozer flipped on the track covered by [indiscernible]. And we came around, and that's not unusual in that territory to have that. And we hit the bulldozer, derailed the cars. Thankfully nobody was hurt. We've got rewards out.","But those things, the derailments, the personnel changes that had to be made, I think to some degree we had reflected and understood that there's resistance to change, and we were going to have to deal with that, and we've had to in a little more difficult way than I thought it might be. But having said that, I think the most significant issue that came out here is we learned a lot about some of our people. We've made some personnel changes and we've developed some real, what I would describe as, rock stars, both in-house, from other rails, from the free market, and [indiscernible] line as well. I am very pleased that I think the organization is ready to go forward at what I might describe as breakneck speed.","The operating plan that we had talked about, I think just the last week or the week before, we brought in our first dispatchers from the field, which takes us from -- we will make this first move to take us from nine offices to one here in Jacksonville. It's a big step. I think -- and these things are dynamic, and the markets change, but I think that we have pretty well settled in with the hump yard, I think we started off with 12 or wherever we were in [indiscernible], and we are down now to four, I think, core yards, which are effectively in in Selkirk, New York; and Waycross, Georgia. Also, Indianapolis Avon yard, and I guess Willard is the last one that will probably be closed soon. So that hump yard work is mostly behind us. Dispatcher work is behind us. Personnel moves are in place. The learning curve is going up. And I am as excited as I ever had been or more so about the future of the organization going forward. So I will have some more remarks at the end.","At this point, let me catch my breath and let Frank help convert some of these things into our earnings results.","Frank Lonegro","Thank you, Hunter, and good morning everyone. I will briefly walk you through the quarter and touch on a few fourth quarter and full-year items. And then, we will take your questions. In the early part of the quarter, as Hunter mentioned, we rolled out significant changes to the network operating plan as a result of our rapid transition to Precision Scheduled Railroading. While our service took a step back in July and August, we are pleased to report that our velocity and dwell performance in September were favorable to Q1 levels. And we expect continued improvement going forward.","The changes we made to the operating plan helped drive significant train length improvements on a sequential basis. Balancing the train plan and consolidating train types drives efficiency saving through better asset and resource utilization. Cars and locomotives and service are down significantly year over year. And we are able to run our railroad and our company with fewer resources. Compared to year-end 2016 resource levels, our total workforce is lower by over 4000 FTEs, including over 1,000 contractors and consultants.","Turning to slide eight, from a financial perspective, we were encouraged by the results for the third quarter. While we took a direct hit from Irma, experienced a number of significant derailments, and transitioned to a new operating plan, we made good progress toward our 2017 and longer-term goals. Jumping into the details of the income statement, revenue was up 1% year-over-year, driven primarily by core pricing gains of 3.5% all in and 2.2% excluding coal as well as 1% volume growth at higher fuel recoveries, partially offset by unfavorable fix.","Total expenses were $2 million favorable with efficiency savings more than offsetting the impacts of inflation and higher fuel prices. Our quarterly financial report goes through the details of each operating expense line item. But I would like to quickly call your attention to a couple of key points. Our labor and fringe expense was down 6% on 10% fuel resources. Our MSNO was slightly unfavorable given the combined impact of several train accidents, relocation costs, and asset impairments which offset the favorable efficiency gains from better asset and resource utilization.","And while fuel expense was up, the increase was driven entirely by a 19% increase in the price of diesel. Top line stability plus our relentless focus on controlling costs drove the 4% improvement in operating income, a 4 point of operating ratio improvement and 6% EPS growth, reflecting both higher earnings and the completion of our $1.5 billion share repurchase program.","On slide nine, year-to-date free cash flow generation is strong at over $1.5 billion, reflecting solid top line gains, significant efficiency savings, and the reduced capital intensity of our business. Please note that our third quarter cash flow benefited from the deferral of tax payments allowed by the IRS for companies impacted the recent hurricanes. We expect to make the third and fourth quarter tax payments by year-end.","Free cash flow growth has enabled increased shareholder return including the $0.2 dividend increase earlier this year plus the completion of our expanded buyback program. CSX's improved financial performance is reflected in our improving ROIC which exceeds 10% on a trailing 12 months basis and a stable debt-to-EBITDA ratio even with higher debt levels.","Turning to slide 10, our fourth quarter volume outlook on a comparable [technical difficulty] basis is neutral, with nearly two-thirds of our business expected to be growing or stable year-over-year. The global benchmarks support continued strength in export coal with fourth quarter tonnage expected to be similar to what we saw in Q3. And intermodal is expected to continue to grow reflecting strong consumer sentiment, and a tighter truck market.","On the other side of ledger, several markets continue to be impacted by specific headwinds, mostly notably the anticipated decline in North American light vehicle production, the evaporation of unit train shipments of crude oil, and the secular challenges of domestic utility coal. Looking forward, as our service product continues to improve and we transition to a faster, more reliable service solution for our customers we will see growth prospects across a wider spectrum of our markets.","Wrapping up, on slide 11, we are on track to deliver on operating ratio around the high end of the mid-60s, with record productivity savings, EPS growth of 20% to 25%, and free cash flow of around $1.5 billion. We completed our buyback program in five short months. We look forward to seeing you at our investor conference in two weeks, and would now be delighted to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.","Ken Hoexter","Great. Good morning.","Hunter Harrison","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Hoexter","Hunter, maybe you can talk a little bit about your thoughts on kind of share loss and your ability to regain that given some of the service issues. Do you see that you've kind of lost some share, and is it -- would it be permanent and tougher to win back in that case or as you get the service improved do you think that starts to shift back?","Hunter Harrison","I think it's just about immediately. Well, that shippers who are out there, they are trying to get the bargain, best bargain they can get. And the safety for that, the competitive service at a competitive price [indiscernible] the business. This is not the old days of some kind of relationship sales. This is about who's got the best product, who's got the lowest price. We think we're going to be there. And so we think this speaks in our market share, and I'm not a big advocate of the market share data and accuracies [ph] that it reflects, but not to dwell on that, I'm convinced of this, all you\u2019ve got to do is get our service where we know it can be, where it is relative [ph] to improved to, and then have a competitive price out there, and you'll have your fair share of the business.","Ken Hoexter","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Your line is open; you may ask your question.","Brandon Oglenski","Hi, good morning everyone, and thanks for letting me ask a question. So Hunter, I mean, we've heard all the anecdotal evidence from the shippers about what went wrong and how service deteriorated on your network. But maybe can you just give us a little bit deeper lessons learned through this process, and why you feel that the organization is now in place to deliver better results coming forward?","Hunter Harrison","Yes, I can share this when we get back from the hearing with the Surface Transportation Board. We had three customers that we were having to embargo because they couldn't accept the shipments that were delayed. And now we are accused to be in a violation where we got [indiscernible] 60 cars on hand, and you take five plus weeks to unload them, you know, there\u2019s two sides of the story, [technical difficulty] change and the resistance that people give to you.","I have talked about that moving from a proxy side into a change is not the greatest environment, so we had some resistance. And look, I don't want to -- I'm not trying to point a finger to anyone, you know, some of our best railroaders, hardest workers, you know some of our labor union people, the last time I talked about that I was going to finger at them, I am not finger at them. The first tranche of people that left the organization were high percentage of management people. So I'm not pointing the fingers. Collectively, as a team, we didn't get the job done. And as a result of that, we made some personnel changes, we had some -- well, I'll just be frank; we had some embarrassing situations that we had to deal with and we dealt with them. Are they hard to deal with? Yes, they're hard to deal with. We\u2019ve had some \u2013 at one of our major gateways, we had a case where some people falsified records on car movements, so they wouldn't be criticized about cars being delayed. We can\u2019t tolerate this, and so, we've got maybe a little ahead of ourselves on the hump yard closures, , maybe I am pushing too hard.","But I think we've learned all the lessons there are to be learned. We've seen what we can do the last 6,8, 10 weeks. I think Cindy and her team have done a stellar job of recovering and putting us back where we need to be, and it's going to get even better. I mean that's the encouraging thing. And so, if you can just get out from under the anecdotal, and if you were there in some of those hearings last week, the hearings weren't about CSX service. In my view, the hearings were about more political issues of reciprocal [ph] switching and open access, and some of those things.","Now look, we're ready to participate in that dialog, but let's call a spade a spade. We had -- I participated in that session. I think there were 10 or 11 customers -- specific customers that testified. We had more positive responses from customers that weren't there at home. And some of the surveys that are going on out there, I don\u2019t put a lot of faith in, and if you look at what they're looking at, and then how many people are actually giving honest, frank feedback in discussing -- I guess the bottom line, there's no hurdle out there going forward that we can't get over.","Brandon Oglenski","Thank you.","Hunter Harrison","Shirley?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Ossenbeck with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Go ahead with your question.","Brian Ossenbeck","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So just touching on intermodal markets and the strategy, you were seeing some reports on Northwest Ohio's role in intermodal network, maybe some service offerings begin adjusted. So as you move past the initial stage of design with the hump yards and the flat switching. Is it the hub and spoke design for your intermodal something you're also considering to rework? And what does that have -- or what implications are there for Ohio and also the Carolina Connecter that was planned for North Carolina. Thank you.","Hunter Harrison","Yes, thanks. Let me just answer that in two words. Number one, we've got an investor conference coming up in two weeks now that we will talk thoroughly about that and other issues. But at the same time, I could answer that -- answered several other questions. Everything we're doing is under review. Now I can't tell you what the outcome is going to be. We don't go in there and look at an issue, and have an answer. We go in to look and to develop and answer. So we'll see what it brings.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. You may ask your question.","Chris Wetherbee","Hi, thanks. Good morning. I know you highlighted sort of what the derailments cost you specifically in the quarter. But I was wondering if you could maybe help us understand a little bit sort of how the service ran through the model and sort of what the expenses related specifically to that, and maybe a little bit of weather? Just wanted to kind of contextualize how much of the operating ratio improvement you could've gotten in addition to what you did if you had a sort of cleaner quarter.","Frank Lonegro","Hi, Chris; Frank. Yes, we obviously experienced some transitional issues in the first part of the quarter as we transitioned into operating plan over the July 4th holiday. And as you know, any time you've got a network-related set of changes to target quantify the dollar impact of that you do see on the revenue side the impacts of that transition really muted the top line growth if you compare us to our peers. We probably left some demand on the ground. We probably saw some temporal shifts of business to either truck or to other rails. We do expect, as you heard Hunter say in his opening, we do expect that to come back pretty quickly.","And then on the expense side, any time your network is a little sluggish you're going to see higher overtime, re-crews, fuel car hire that nature, but not something that we're able to put a pinpoint type of an estimate. But it certainly did impact us both from an operating income and operating ratio perspective in the quarter.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. You may ask your question.","Tom Wadewitz","Yes, good morning. Hunter, I know you've commented some on the -- kind of the network and how it's running. I wondered if you could give a bit more perspective in terms of is the car load schedule pretty much stable at this point? How would you think about the trajectory? I don't want to be overly focused on the metrics, velocity and dwell and so forth. But sometimes they help to see how the network is running. So is it stable at this point? Would you expect to see further momentum build, that the metrics improve and costs fall out further. Just kind of where you're at in terms of the network and the trajectory today?","Hunter Harrison","Sure. Tom, we have not completed -- if you remember back a little bit from our early experiences with installing these trip plans, that effort is not complete. Now we're much further along that I thought we'd be, but I would think that we're probably 85% there. And I think that by mid-year '18, it will have everything fully in place with the plans. And that means that the plans to some degree will be upgraded where it's required and necessary and the market is asking for it. As we develop the ability with our train speed and dwell time, our dwell time is, as we speak today, as I look at the [indiscernible] board, it is down to about 10 to 12 hours, which is pretty impressive overall. Our productivity cars per hour has improved even more so, which even further shows the ability we have, so the train speed, the true velocity has picked up pretty significantly.","So I guess what it does is it looks and says, the scouting report we did, we have even more [technical difficulty] than now that we're going to kind of be able to produce the results that have been talked about over the next four year. Now the timing within that four-year time frame might adjust a little bit up or down. But I think that -- I won\u2019t get ahead of myself for a couple of weeks. I just think that the opportunities are very bright going forward.","Tom Wadewitz","Okay, great. Thank you for the response.","Hunter Harrison","Thank you. Your next question comes from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Your line is open; you may ask your question.","Allison Landry","Thanks. Good morning. Hunter, I wanted to ask if you though the customer and employee response to the changes that you're implementing, and the resulting dislocation, has that led you to rethink any of the elements of precision railroading as it applies to the CSX network? And is there anything that you need to do differently or that we should be thinking about for CSX relative to what we observed at CP or CN?","Hunter Harrison","No, I don't think so. I think that the only one little caveat I would put there is this, look, this model in my view will work here as well as work -- or has worked anywhere and even more so. I do think that potentially maybe we learned a little bit that even here the personnel and the execution and the selection of people is even more important. And so, I think we are kind of fine-tuning that a little bit. If you look at -- I'm not - I don't say this critically; people think of all different ways, but we have a lot of people, a lot of operating supervisors that were hired have got seven to eight years of experience off the campus, put in the operating world as Assistant Train Master, and that's asking a whole lot of them to be able to do that.","And so, I think we are going back to do some retraining. We started back again last two weeks ago I think, Hunter Camp, [indiscernible] the Board asked me about Hunter Camp, and I said, \"You know, I am just not sure -- I'm going to have time to do this.\" And I learned it quickly. And they quickly told me you don't have time not to do it. And so, we had the first four sessions, I believe, they were a knockout success. And so, I guess the main thing Allison is the view of the personnel -- I think we talked about this term, but I think we\u2019ve got a lot of internal talent that's covered up with mud, and I think we've taken a hose, washed some people down, and we found some rock stars here. So, that's very encouraging.","Allison Landry","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. You may ask your question.","Amit Mehrotra","Thanks. Good morning. Hunter, I guess, there is really no one that implements precision railroading as quickly as effectively as you. There is a feeling that your ability to do this has been in large part due to the hands-on nature of your involvement sort of walking the track, so to speak, if you could just talk about that in the context of the turnaround at CSX in terms of your ability or inability to spend time with the rank and file and drive changes at a grassroots level to the extent you had in the past and previous turnaround, any insights there I think would be helpful. Thank you.","Hunter Harrison","Well, look, I'm not 45years old anymore. I wish I was, for a lot of reasons, but I cannot -- I have been a few years and probably not for me to say, but I mean hands-on. But I've written a lot of books and papers and case studies, and so forth. I receive a lot of correspondence from people trying to understand even more concepts. I think our team starts to get it. And I think one thing that we talked about with the camp was this, I'm not as much as I would like to be able to, I'm not able to get to everybody myself individually to sit with them, but I can hopefully be expecting that I am developing the cycles. Let's say, look this makes sense, this is not just some stone up on the wall, this has got a lot to it to make sense and it will work, and they will buy into it now, and so I need to be able to do that more so through my team and [indiscernible] team and lieutenants, they maybe have done in the past and maybe I should have done it more in the past, but if I can do it myself, I did it myself, and I didn't bring them in the fold. So, if you say I have to optimize it, maybe didn\u2019t optimize it, but I did this, we are going to get -- we'll get to the same type results. They might like to look a little different, but the results are going to be there.","Amit Mehrotra","Got it. Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you very much for answering my questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ravi Shankar with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. You may ask your question.","Ravi Shankar","Thanks. Good morning everyone. Hunter, in your slides, you pointed out that the, that the 4Q outlet has about 50% of your end markets of the favorable outlook versus I think those 66% last quarter. Not the still anyways under from the Analyst Day but just broadly speaking as you kind of look at your long term or an efficiency targets for CSX, how much do kind of end markets feature or kind of how much of role do they play and actually hitting that and end markets are slowing, what's the offset to that? Thanks.","Frank Lonegro","Hi, Ravi, it's Frank. Obviously we'll share lot more with you in a couple of weeks when we get to the Investor conference, the top line growth is certainly part of the future but on a proportional basis I would tell you that the expense lines really important to the future and if you go back and you look at what Hunter has done at CN and CP that's an important part of the future and making sure that we drive productivity saving the upper ratio lower but we certainly are focused on growing the top line as well.","Hunter Harrison","Yes, let me just give you outlook; I will just give you preview or segway here into their market to the Analyst Day. Gone through [indiscernible] wisdom, the results that we've achieved so-called those turnaround, well first of all, we weren't sensitive to the market which was wrong with improve revenue at opening places, but we were successful net, net in all three places and so like did, there is not in end markets that's stopped with the bottom line approach is here. We have never -- we have always gone into right wrong, we always gone into in everyone of the turnaround with the strength that concerned approach from the other illustrations, my life is always that we went there and they had a growth there of 11%. I didn't see it and I didn't understand it but they frankly did it. We had 3%. So, we had 3% on the bottom line they did with top line they got 11% that when all said and done our operating the ratio was 24 year per with four points then their number so but you have been implied with these numbers all you want the bottom line to bottom line.","Ravi Shankar","Great, thank you.","Hunter Harrison","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Hartford with Baird. Your line is open. You may ask your question.","Ben Hartford","Hi, good morning everyone. Just in the contact center everything you talked about with regard to the cadence of the operating plan want us to pull through when do you think you would be able to extract value in the former price from the service that you build into the network obviously as we're looking to 18 truckload capacity is tightened up away more favorable pricing environment is result of that across the market but when do you expect to be able to realize extracting value in the former price at CSX from these changes is that 1920 backend-loaded type of process.","Hunter Harrison","I think it's are in my view is more of a -- what the competition does, yes. Competition is adversely tough and if the competition does price and improve their service, it will have impact on us, so we can ignore, but not solve it, if you think -- what do you think is going to happen, I think that we will start to see 1918, okay necessarily to a degree that maybe we describe, but I think in 19', we will start to make nice reasonable pickups of price relatively service and that as we continue that and move into 20' and beyond. We will be rewarded for that good service and profit.","I mean, when -- if you got a good service or better, I think we will have better in the future, okay and you have the low cost carrier, you got a lot of average, you go after you get the same service level, okay if your cost is higher about 10%, it's tough, it's damn tough. I don't think this organization has the ability to try and do that, but I think we would be able [indiscernible] or whatever I will tell you that markets that I even built a lot, but that's just kind of an additional thought if you will.","Ben Hartford","That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","My next question comes from Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. You may ask your question.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Thanks very much and good morning. In looking at your volumes in the third quarter, I'm curious which segments you think were most impacted by some of the challenges that you encountered during the quarter and in particular, how much you think the intermodal network was impacted particularly as you were on boarding in new international intermodal customer during the quarter?","Fredrik Eliasson","Yes, this is Fredrik. I think we saw impact on all our markets in the third quarter from the challenge and of course also the hurricane impact of Irma, so I mean I think it was pretty wide spread, but it's hard to pinpoint clearly we had benefit of onboarding two new customers intermodal space and also continue to see opportunities to convert things off the highway system as the market has tightened and so we feel good about where it is and I think you are already seeing as Hunter alluded to you as Hunter - as service now return and it is much stronger you are seeing the kind of weaker number that comes out, that indicates that we are back and the customers are coming back to us very rapidly.","Frank Lonegro","Hi, Cherilyn; Frank, I will just add a little bit on the hurricane to make sure that it can be [indiscernible] for folks probably about $0.02 in the quarter, most that being top line or a lot of that was [technical difficulty] there we had some plan shutdown in the Southeast or in some cases a couple of them -- in one particular case a couple of weeks, so as you think about the transition impact service side, you also have to remember we also had hurricane in the middle of that.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Good.","Frank Lonegro","Some cost in the third quarter, which are part of that $0.02, the [indiscernible] and over time, everybody was pulling over time, we have some third-party contractors in there and we probably have a little bit of trickle over a cost into the fourth quarter, single digit millions when invoice is coming in October. But I just want to make sure, we dimensionalize that for everybody.","Cherilyn Radbourne","That's helpful and that's my one. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. You may ask your question.","Scott Group","Hi, thanks. Good morning guys. So why don't you ask coal yield spell, I think 7% sequentially, how much of that is sort of the mix of net and thermal and export and how much of that maybe is from just lower net export pricing? And then, if I can just ask as Hunter, we had a noisy third quarter. So can you maybe calibrate headcount and operating ratio expectations for the fourth quarter?","David Baggs","Scott, you are breaking the rules; one question.","Scott Group","So, let me tell you the first part in terms of the coal, it's clearly the second quarter was a very strong quarter as you saw on the indexes and so that certainly helped the net deals and yes there is a little bit of a mix change as well because the thermal market, the export market has gone stronger. So I think you are losing both of them and both of them are my drivers of that.","Frank Lonegro","On the operating ratio, Scott; Hunter could chime in on the headcount, but in terms of the operating ratio I mean year-to-date were 66.7, Q4 will be better than Q3 obviously and you know, what our guidance is and you can get pretty close on Q4.","Scott Group","Yes, and in fact the headcount number is I think projecting year-end will be 4500.","Hunter Harrison","Yes on a year-to-date basis full year against where we ended 2016 total headcount in that 4500 range you heard, let's talk about the 4000, I think the number at the end of Q3 was like 4200 and that's again that's all and that's management union plus contractors and consultants.","Frank Lonegro","I guess the only other thing I will ask is we'll talk at the Analyst Meeting, there has been a lot of noise and a lot of things happening but I'm not sure that they would fourth quarter is going to reflect, I think if you this is the long story in fourth quarter and it's the long story exciting and if you are sitting there on your seat waiting for fourth quarter results, you might fall off your chair for results.","David Baggs","Next question?","Operator","Next question comes from Jeff Kauffman of Aegis Capital; you may ask your question.","Jeff Kauffman","Thank you very much. Just a quick merchant or group question on auto, I think a lot of us were surprised to see an 18 auto SAR in the most recent months and we've heard stories that maybe 0.5 million cars plus might have been lost and the strong impacts of Houston and a little more in Florida, could we be underestimating auto and if there is a rebound or secularly, we've talked about how autos. The outlook is not right but I was really surprised by the most recent monthly SAR and I'm just talking some folks in Texas and they were saying a lot of autos need to be replaced.","Frank Lonegro","Yes I think that's a good question, we certainly have seen a fair amount of inventory drawdown and because it's back to kind of a more normalized level layer year-over-year, which hasn't benefit previously in the year, so that's a good sign. I think production numbers for next year indicates about 200,000 more vehicles, they were seeing this year. So I think there is some - there could be an opportunity there. I certainly know that our automotive network is running well and within a merchandize network and so we are seeing some pretty strong and write now we will see ultimately how much of a impact it has but it certainly has been helpful.","Jeff Kauffman","Okay. That's my one. See you guys in few weeks. Thanks.","Hunter Harrison","Well, the one number I thought here today that was in fact get your attention is that. I think certainly general motor is selling a steady old car 24% of the cars. The rest of the other type vehicles, so now I just talk about SUVs and the whole thing, it's one thing but if you talk about cars there is great slippage, which the implication start to be for that car [technical difficulty] if it's a new models and et cetera, but that's gets specifically not the case.","Jeff Kauffman","Thank you, Hunter.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Vernon with Bernstein. Your line is open. You may ask your question.","David Vernon","Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the time. Fredrik, maybe a question for you on the long-term in a motor dynamic, if you look at the business, the RPU today is kind of where it was in the 2005 timeframe, volumes have been grown quite a bit. As we look out of the next five or ten years, should we be expecting more of a volume growth story in intermodal or a little bit of pricing as well and what should drive the change in that market dynamic?","Fredrik Eliasson","Maybe I think as just the way Frank said earlier, we will address many of these questions specifically as part of the analyst conference. Clearly we think there is an opportunity to continue to convert traffic off the highway system and it's going to come in the form of either price or volume depending over the market is, how tight the market is and what the service offerings are but nothing has fundamentally changed in the premise that you see in over last decades, where we've been able to convert at a pace of 5% to 7% a year on average and as we look forward, we see no difference as we implement this operating model, we think we should have an even better chance of doing that.","David Vernon","As far as the rate of volume take versus share take, I mean in the long run the RPUs are still running kind of where they were a decade ago, should we expect that as a market I tell you exactly we will be able to get a little bit more price and power? Does this remain a competitive market where it's going to be more volume?","Frank Lonegro","I think this should have better pricing power as well as we continue to improve the service product. The one of the things with the model obviously as we have continued to drive train length and other productivity initiatives. The top line might not have reflected what you've seen in some other markets, the bottom line half as we have really significant increase in train length, terminal productivity, double stack clearance et cetera. And we are not just in motor but across all markets very, very focused on making sure that every car loaded [technical difficulty] unit pays for itself. And that's going to be the continued focus as well.","David Vernon","All right, thanks for the time.","Operator","Thanks. Your next question comes from John Larkin with Stifel. Your line is open. You may ask your question.","John Larkin","Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to dig into the utility coal volumes which took quite a haircut year-over-year, where do those stockpile stand? And when do you think that will stabilize? We will see perhaps more and more stability in utility coal volumes?","Frank Lonegro","Yes, I think as we think about the fourth quarter, I would say that we are going to be overall in domestic coal roughly flat. What we saw here in the third quarter is probably the best expectation. In terms of actual stockpile, I would say at this point, the stockpile in the North are probably higher than we would like to see. But in the south, they are probably little bit below. So it gives an opportunity to replenish some of those in the South, which is usually a longer length of haul high revenue because of the length of haul.","In addition to that just to remind you, at the beginning of the year, we had a very short haul business contract that we lost in utility coal. We indicated I think about 6 million tons are so and that's been with us for the full year and will be with us in the fourth quarter as well. But beyond that, I think we are seeing a market that is in pretty good safe. Clearly the summer was not helpful, but we are still seeing natural gas prices around three which is much \u2013-- very helpful -- like that we are in the higher, but it's certainly more helpful than what we saw in the last spring.","John Larkin","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. You may ask your question.","Bascome Majors","Yes, so from your longer-term shareholder succession planning is pretty important issue here as the situation is really very different from CP where you really had an heir apparent a few months into it. So Hunter, I was curious if you could comment a little bit on the timeline for the Board deciding who is going to lead CSX after you retire, and any signpost that we as investors should watch for on this front along the way?","Hunter Harrison","Well, I am -- that is something that the Board is very sensitive to, and as me and other working on -- and not something to worry, no worry, and I am hopeful that maybe we could give you more insight. Again, it's me but I am not sure, okay. But all I can say is this -- I am saying what you are saying. We share your concerns. I share your concerns both as CEO and a shareholder. And it's something that we will -- until we receive an answer, we will stay on top of [technical difficulty] in grand way.","Operator","Thanks. Are you ready for the next question? That comes from Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. You may ask your question.","Jason Seidl","Hey, thank you. Frank, real quick, when you talked a little bit about what the hurricane cost you in the quarter, you did a good job of parsing it off. Can you talk a little bit about potential rebuilding that you might benefit from in Q4 and maybe even possibly beyond?","Frank Lonegro","Sure. For the Chairman as well that obviously as Florida rebuilds, as Texas rebuilds, there can certainly be end markets that can benefit from additional volumes and types of products that we ultimately haul. So yes, I mean I think there are certainly some possibility of some demand uptick. It really depends on how quickly these folks are able to rebuild in those areas. But anything that helps the end markets is ultimately going to help CSX.","Fredrik Eliasson","I agree. And I mean I think we are also the impact on the trucking market itself. It allows us to participate in some of those that we -- otherwise, we wouldn't and also covert things [indiscernible] model solution and of course building products. And we talked earlier about vehicles being replenished. So I think there are some opportunities out there for us to capture.","Jason Seidl","And are you seeing that occur right now, Fredrik?","Fredrik Eliasson","I am clearing seeing that the truck market tightening. We're certainly seeing that. I think it's little bit early to see in terms of building products. But we have certainly seen some of the vehicle opportunities just based on the need to replant or see what inventory levels are and how quickly that come down. So that's been very helpful.","Jason Seidl","Okay, that's my one. Thanks for your time as always.","Operator","Thanks. Your next question comes from Walter Spracklin with RBC. Your line is open. You may ask your question.","Walter Spracklin","Thanks very much. Good morning everyone. My question is on Frank \u2013- on free cash flow for Frank and the buyback that's coming from it. You noted in your guidance you got 1.5 billion guidance, but you are kind of there already and three quarters in and you've made a quite a move on your buyback here this quarter. So are we just being conservative on this? And are you expecting kind of flat free cash flow through the back half? And how should we look at your share buyback momentum as a result of that free cash flow going forward?","Frank Lonegro","Sure. On your -- the last part of your question, we'll certainly have some more information for you as we get to the investor conference on shareholders returns and capital allocation in a couple of weeks. In terms of the free cash flow, obviously we had a nice benefit in the third quarter by deferring the tax payment. And we will make good on those payments in December. So the fourth quarter is generally a lighter free cash flow quarter. But at the same time we are already at 1.56 billion even if you look at the fourth quarter if I were betting then I'll take the over.","Walter Spracklin","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thanks. Your next question comes from Justin Long Stephens. You may ask your question.","Justin Long","Thanks and good morning. So I wanted to ask about export coals since it's recently held up a bit better than expected. Do you have any early thoughts about the export coal in 2018? And just looking longer term as you think about the structural positioning of your network, how are you thinking about the role export coal will play?","Frank Lonegro","We will certainly cover that as part of our investor conference. We feel we are very well-positioned strategically in terms of our ability to reach the port both on East Coast and in the gulf. And we think we have an excellent service, product, and good facility [technical difficulty] key export players. We feel good about it. We feel good about where we are for the remaining of this year. And obviously where the forward curve seems to be right now, it's a good opportunity for the U.S. producer to participate next year as well. But, we will give you more color as we get to the investor conference.","Justin Long","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And this does conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I turn the call over to the speakers for closing remarks.","Hunter Harrison","Well, thanks very much. I hope that we were able to fill in some blanks and at the same time not get ahead of ourselves with our Analyst Day coming up which we are -- the group here is working very hard on. There were some questions before the organization that you have framed very well for us. And those are things that we will be looking at and try to be responsive to. And look forward to seeing you again. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And this does conclude today's telephone conference. Thanks for your participation in today's call.

As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. During this call, all participants will be on listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Slater, Chief Investor Relations Officer for CSX Corporation.","Bill Slater","Thank you, Shirley and good afternoon everyone. Joining me on today\u2019s call is Jim Foote, President and Chief Executive Officer; Kevin Boone, Interim Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Wallace, Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing. On Slide 2 is our forward-looking disclosure, followed by our non-GAAP disclosure on Slide 3.","With that, it is my pleasure to introduce President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Foote.","Jim Foote","Good afternoon and thanks a lot Bill. Before we get started with the presentation, I'd like to first thank all CSX employees whose hard work once again drove the company to new record operating levels this quarter. These records include operating income, free cash flow, and operating efficiency in the form of an all-time low operating ratio for our U.S. Class I railroad.","Not only did we achieve record financial results, but we continued our industry leadership in safety with the best performance in terms of lowest personal injury rate and meaningfully reduced train accidents.","During this quarter, we successfully completed PTC installation and activation across our network. We now operate nearly 13,000 PTC-equipped track miles and are on pace to have the system fully tested and operational with our tenant railroads ahead of the required deadline.","Let's move on now to Slide 5 of the presentation and our financial results. Second quarter results were straightforward with only a few small and unique items that Kevin will discuss. Second quarter EPS increased 7% to $1.08 versus last year's figure of $1.01. Our second quarter operating ratio improved by 120 basis points to a record 57.4%.","Turning to Slide 6, we are delivering better service to our customers, which is reflected in our merchandise volume as our improved reliability is leading to customers trusting us with more of their freight. This led to broad-based growth across the merchandise segment as customers are recognizing the value of our best-in-class service offering. This growth was offset by declines in coal, intermodal, and other revenue resulting in a 1% decline in total revenue to $3.1 billion.","I remain encouraged by the performance of our core merchandise franchise during a softer-than-expected freight environment. We led Class I volume growth again this quarter, and grew volumes at all markets with the exception of metals and equipment and fertilizers.","Total merchandise revenue increased 2% as volume growth and pricing gains were partially offset by mixed headwinds. Intermodal revenue declined 11% on 10% lower volumes, primarily due to the impact of line rationalizations implemented last fall and early this year. We'll begin to lap those rationalizations at the end of the third quarter.","Coal revenue declined 2% on 2% higher volumes as growth in domestic industrial markets was more than offset by export and utility declines. Finally, lower other revenues was primarily due to decreases in demurrage markets at intermodal facilities.","Let's move to slide 7. Employee safety remains my top priority. We were again the best in the industry for FRA personal injury rates and set a new company record for the lowest number of FRA reportable train accidents this quarter. We are also finding new ways to utilize technology to further enhance safety. As one example, the use of automated track inspection cars helped reduce track caused mainline accidents by 85% year-to-date. While I'm pleased with this progress, there's always opportunity to operate more safely and we will work diligently to make our railroad as safe as it can be.","Let's turn to slide 8 and take a quick look at our operating performance. On the service side, Velocity and Dwell improved by 14% and 6%, respectively. We also set another U.S. Class I record this quarter by operating below one gallon of fuel per 1,000 gross ton miles as we continue to find new and incremental ways to improve efficiency and drive unproductive costs out of the system.","Most importantly, our improved operations are transferring to better outcomes for customers. We dramatically improved our trip plan compliance over the last year and are seeing strong momentum exiting the quarter. We continue to hit new records and have done so while tightening the schedule in the form of shortage trip plans. We plan to roll out our trip plan compliance data to our customers later this year and look forward to the opportunities the increased transparency will provide us to engage more deeply with them.","With that, I'll hand it over to Kevin, who will take you through the financials.","Kevin Boone","Thank you, Jim and good afternoon, everyone. Turning to slide 10. I'll walk you through the highlights of the summary income statement. As Jim mentioned, total revenue was down 1% in the second quarter, as the impact of lower volume, particularly in intermodal, more than offset pricing gains across most of our markets.","Moving to expenses. Total operating expenses were 3% lower in the second quarter, reflecting continued strong efficiency gains. Labor and fringe expense was 3% lower, driven by a 5% reduction in headcount combined with favorable incentive compensation expense. These savings were partially offset by inflation and other items.","The operating team continues to drive efficiencies in a number of areas highlighted by fewer crew starts, down 5%; and lower T&E over time. Re-crews were also down 77%, a significant improvement year-over-year. Active locomotive count declined more than 300 locomotives, down 11% year-over-year. Smaller fleet combined with fewer cars online and freight car repair efficiencies helped drive a 6% year-over-year reduction in our mechanical workforce.","MS&O expense improved 3% versus the prior year. Lower active locomotive count drove savings in materials and contracted services. Train accident costs were also favorable in the quarter as the FRA train accident rate fell over 50%.","Intermodal costs also saw year-over-year improvement with lower volumes combined with operating efficiencies, driving expense reductions. Partially offsetting these items was an unfavorable impact from casualty reserve adjustments unrelated to the improving trends and safety. Real estate and line sale gains were flat in the second quarter versus the prior year. We continue to see a strong pipeline of opportunities.","Looking at the other expense items. Depreciation increased 2% due to the impact of a larger net asset base. Record fuel efficiency and a 6% decrease in diesel prices helped drive a 30% [ph] decline in fuel expense. Our enhanced focus on distributed power utilization and energy management technology drove record second quarter fuel efficiency.","Equipment rent expense decreased 8%, driven by improved cycle times and lower volume-related costs in intermodal. Equity earnings decreased $9 billion in the quarter, primarily due to lower net earnings at our affiliates, including cycling an affiliate's property sale in the prior year.","Looking below the line. Interest expense decreased primarily due to higher debt balances. Income tax expense increased $9 million, primarily due to the benefit in 2018 related to State legislative changes. For the remainder of the year, we would expect an effective tax rate of approximately 24.5% absent unique items.","Closing out the P&L. As Jim highlighted in his opening remarks, CSX delivered operating income of $1.3 billion, record operating ratio of 57.4% and earnings per share of $1.08, representing improvements of 2%, 120 basis points and 7% respectively. We continue to see significant opportunities to drive efficiencies across every aspect of our business.","Just a few other key initiatives into the back half of the year include; ongoing train consolidations through continued expansion of distributed power and additional longer crew runs. This reduces the active locomotive fleet and associated maintenance and repair cost, as well as crew labor and related travel and balancing expenses.","Yard reductions enabled by train consolidations and longer runs will reduce labor and overhead costs. Overtime also remains a significant opportunity with a particular focus on its mechanical and engineering. There are multiple emphases across our business functions where overtime as a percentage of straight time is well over 20% and in some cases exceeding 40%.","While we hit a record this quarter, fuel efficiency remains a big opportunity for us. I expect the operating teams continue to deliver savings. Train speed in dwell continues to be opportunities as well the related cost benefits remains significant. Finally, we are finding new opportunities to become more efficient in our G&A costs. Recent initiatives should benefit us in the second half.","Turning to slide 11. Year-to-date capital investment is down $54 million or 7% year-over-year. At the same time, we have added 12% more rail and 25% more times, while doing it smarter. Overall, our improved asset utilization from locomotives to rolling stock has enabled us to sustain lower levels of capital investment without compromising safety or reliability. The level of PTC spending has also come down significantly in the last two years.","Growth in CSX's core operating cash flow, including improvements in working capital, drove a 22% increase in adjusted free cash flow to $1.6 billion through the second quarter. Year-to-date, we have returned approximately $2 billion to shareholders, including $1.6 billion in buybacks and $400 million in dividends. Dividend payments in the quarter reflect a 9% increase from $ 0.22 to $0.24 per share we announced in February of this year.","Our ability to convert earnings into cash remains the key differentiator for CSX and a significant driver of shareholder value.","With that, let met turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks.","Jim Foote","Thanks Kevin. Turning to Slide 13, I want to wrap things up by discussing our guidance for the year. We started this year expecting revenue to be up approximately 1% to 2%. Both global and U.S. economic conditions had been unusual this year to say the least and have impacted our volumes. You see it every week in our reported carloads. The present economic backdrop is one of the most puzzling I have experienced in my career.","With natural gas prices expected to continue to impact both domestic and export coal, intermodal is showing little seasonal recovery and many of our industrial customers volumes continuing to show weakness with no concrete signs of these trends changing; and adding in the impact on crude-by-rail shipment of last month\u2019s Philadelphia refiner explosion, we are now expecting revenues to be down 1% to 2% for the full year.","We are not necessarily being pessimistic about the second half of the year. But in these launches we need to adjust guidance, we're just setting out the obvious. This outlook is based on a current business levels and there is upside to this forecast as conditions improve in the second half.","We are seeing a range of conflicting data points and economic indicators and regularly speak with customers who despite the recent downtime -- slowdown, remain cautiously optimistic about the second half. Mark can add some color to this in the Q&A session.","We feel it is most prudent to actively manage expenses today -- to today's volumes rather than take a wait-and-see approach. We still expect a sub-60 operating ratio for the year. Our planned cost reduction initiatives will not impact safety, service, and will ensure the business is positioned to handle any additional volumes when things pick up. Lastly, we are maintaining our $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion CapEx outlook for the year.","Even though the year is off to a slower start than we had hoped, we still see significant opportunities ahead. We have a service product that is resonating with customers and a long list of opportunities to reduce expenses, decrease asset intensity, and improved efficiency by eliminating the unnecessary touches that had caused to slow us down. We are very proud of the progress to-date and there is still much more left to do.","With that, thank you, and I'll turn it back to Bill.","Bill Slater","Thank you, Jim. In the interest of time, I would ask everyone to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up only if necessary. Shirley, we\u2019ll now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.","Ken Hoexter","Great. Good afternoon and thanks for the discussion here. Jim, maybe just talk a little bit about the performance right. So, a phenomenal operating ratio. Yet when you show your data, the on-time arrivals continue to fall. Maybe just to understand how that's possible given -- are you tightening the timeframes to different levels or is that different than the improvements you're making on the performance?","Jim Foote","Great. Well, the difference between on-time originations and on-time arrivals versus trip plan compliance, which is measuring the boxes that moves through the network. Our on-time departures as we report to the STB, we're close to 100%, high 90s now. And arrivals is in kind of in the high 80s \u2013 mid-to-high 80s just most recently here now.","The trip plan compliance on the other hand, which is not measuring their train performance is measuring how the car moves through the network from the time we pick it up to the customer, and when we tell the customer, we'll have to his customer in 114 hours. How often do we make that 114-hour trip plan? And every time -- and when we started measuring this, we were maybe in the 30 -- high 30% of the time, we were making that trip plan to now we're in the high -- we're close to 90% in intermodal and high 70s for the carload business.","And yes to your -- to answer your question, every time we start getting where we're producing really good results, Jamie and the operating team get in there and tighten-up the schedule and make it more difficult for everyone, because ultimately that results in a much better product for the customer.","Kevin Boone","Ken to give you a little perspective, last year in the second quarter of 2018, we had on average less -- we had early departures of about 16 -- 76 minutes early, whereas, if you look at this year we're departing them only 20 minutes early. So, we gave ourselves a lot of cushion last year, which obviously would translate in a lot more costs. So, we're tightening the windows and you can see it in that differential, which helps us manage our assets a lot better.","Ken Hoexter","Helpful review. And for my second one or follow-up I guess is maybe just moving over to Mark and Jim, since you opened that up. Maybe Mark you can talk about given the shift of the outlook, are you seeing an accelerating decline in some of the economic indicators you're looking at? It just looks like carloads you're right have -- if we take out the intermodal, which stays around that down double-digit given your lane closures. It seems to -- are you seeing an underlying deceleration in some of the outlook -- I don\u2019t know if you want to go by commodity or just\u2026?","Mark Wallace","Thanks, Ken for that good opportunity. I think exclusive of the PES refinery explosion that Jim just talked about in Philadelphia that just happened a couple of weeks ago, our change in our revenue guidance is largely evenly attributable between our three segments of coal, merchandise, and intermodal. On the coal, export coal has been below our expectations, mostly driven by thermal and lower API2 benchmarks, which we think will likely continue into the second half.","On the domestic utility side, our volumes are down relative to our expectations driven by continued lower natural gas prices. Going into the year, we were -- we thought Henry Hub was going to be somewhere around in our guidance, which for Henry Hub to be somewhere around 285. Now we're hovering between 240 and 250, which is now reflected in our guidance.","On the merchandise, clearly as Jim mentioned, clearly there are signs of slowing economic conditions in both IDP and GDP for Q3 and Q4 pointing to a less robust economy in the second half. We've, obviously, seen evidence of this in our own business and now see a softer industrial environment with signs in our automotive, chemicals, and metals segment. But we're calling it as we see it, and the run rates we're seeing are based on the trends that we saw in June and coming into Q3.","On the intermodal side, listen, we've clearly hoped for a more of a recovery, particularly in the fourth quarter of the year. But we're not immune from some of the pressures that the entire U.S. intermodal industry is facing right now with the weak trucking market coming off an exceptionally strong 2018.","There's a lot of excess capacity in this market, and as a result of what we saw in 2018, a lot of trucks came into the market. That needs to be worked out. But listen, we\u2019re staying disciplined on serving our customers and providing everyone with, as Jim mentioned, great service.","Now what would help? Obviously, what would help in the back half would be a resolution or clarity on trade tariffs would obviously help, but that is obviously beyond our control. But what is within our control is providing a high-quality service product to our customers and covering new opportunities to use that service product for both new and existing customers and to make sure that we are extracting a fair value for the service that we provide. So, hopefully, that covers the \u2013 a little bit of the explanation on what we're seeing.","Ken Hoexter","No. Truly appreciate it. Thanks Jim, Mark, Kevin, Bill, thank you for the time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.","Allison Landry","Thanks. So, Jim, earlier you outlined a number of concerns in the freight environment and what you heard from customers. It sounds like maybe the risk is to the downside instead of an upside recovery. But, I guess, my question is, how much of a volume or revenue decline can the business model withstand, and you\u2019ve still grown EBIT on a year-over-year basis in 2019?","Jim Foote","I don't know that we've ever model how much we can actually take out. I think, we're doing \u2013 we think, this is not something we woke up yesterday and said, well, guess what; the things are going a little bit softer than we had expected. We've been watching this throughout the first half, hoping as everyone did that things would turn around and the business levels would start to pick up, instead of just kind of slow, lazy malaise-type drift down across, which, as Mark said, kind of then accelerated as we got into June.","And -- but we've been planning for this and watching it and taking steps for months now to, first of all, obviously, focus on G&A, because like the one of the things we don't want to do in these situations is reduce cost in the transportation side of the business that could impact service. Then you impact service and then your business can get softer. And then it gets softer, so you cut more and then you impact service and you start this downward trend.","It would be much easier for us to respond if suddenly business just dropped 10% today, because then we would know exactly how to right-size the business for it and we'd know exactly where we could and could not take out the expenses to be -- in order to handle the volumes.","So, we are doing the best we can and have done -- I think, the team did an amazing job in the second quarter of getting a lot of things done, getting a lot of things right-sized based upon what we were anticipating, what we were seeing and not really going into any kind of cost reductions on the transportation side of the business where the majority of our expenses are. If we see or if we saw -- and hopefully we don't, but if we saw a significant decline in our business levels, we would respond quickly and aggressively and do everything we could to try and maintain our cost structure and our advantage.","At some point in time, I mean, there's just no way that we can take out the order of magnitude of the amount of cost that are necessary, if there were significant decline in revenues, but we'll continue to do our best and monitor it.","So, far so good. I mean, things are not -- this is not doom and gloom, this is not end of days kind of thing. This has been a very slow drift from the beginning of the year. And as aggravating as it is under the current rules of engagement with the investment community, once we put guidance out when things start to look like we're not going to be able to achieve that guidance, we're obligated to give a new guidance.","And so we've thought hard about it and said based upon where we are today if this is kind of the new run rate from today, then we'll probably be down 1% or 2%, especially when we just blew up an oil refinery there was a big customer of ours and -- which is by itself on an annualized basis 1% of our volumes.","So, factored into this number that we've taken down is a one-time -- 1% hit in volumes, which we'll recognize this year associated with the refinery explosion. So, -- but to get back to your question, we can do a lot if we know directly what it is we're trying to achieve. In this environment, it's just a lot more challenging.","Allison Landry","Okay, that's really helpful. Maybe just piggybacking on that a little bit. So, obviously, the volume declines accelerated and maybe in Q2 you try to do a little bit of right-sizing. So, should that along with your comments you guys made about having plenty of opportunity going forward for efficiency gains, is that -- should we read that as a signal that the year-over-year improvement the OR could accelerate from the 130 bps in Q2? Now, so, that wasn't a good number just trying to understand the trajectory going forward and how you're thinking about that? Thank you.","Jim Foote","Alison, you're killing me. I mean, we do a fantastic job and then you want more. Come on. I think we'll just stick within this environment say going back to the original. We got -- this revenue topline view reflects a pretty significant reduction in revenue. And what we're seeing right now is we're going to achieve our goal of getting at an operating ratio of below 60%. And despite what everybody else does out there maintaining our leadership position as the most efficient railroad in North America.","Allison Landry","Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And next question comes from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.","Brian Ossenbeck","Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Mark, one for you on export coal. When do you think that -- you mentioned API2 -- wanted to ask about met coal? When do you think that window will start to maybe a little bit tighter as seaborne prices if come in a bit? And are there any other changes that we've seen this cycle that maybe some longer term contracts or reservation systems at the ports that or even restructuring of the coal producers in Appalachia. Anything that you think can actually help extend the cycle for a little bit longer?","Mark Wallace","Yeah. Brian thanks. I think on export coal, let me just start to a high level, I think we're still expecting export coal roughly around 40 million tons for the year. Thermal coal is as I talked about, obviously, some tough headwind there given the API2 numbers, but we're -- there's some tough things going on in Europe as Jim talked about with some low natural gas prices, the mild weather and low natural gas prices in Europe, so that's causing a little bit of headwind.","On the met side, again, the benchmarks remain strong. They're about $190. We reprice those contracts quarterly. We're working with -- we're working now with all our export coal producers to look into next year. I\u2019m not going to give you any guidance, but we're having some success there and trying to lock up some volumes and not anything hugely significant, but especially on the thermal side, which is encouraging. But we work with these guys everyday, our customers and everyone's incentivized to move a lot of coal and heading into -- getting into next year. And hopefully as we get closer to the end of next year, we'll give you maybe a little bit more clarity on what our expectations are for 2020.","Brian Ossenbeck","All right. Thanks. Thanks, Mark. Appreciate that. Maybe if you -- I have follow-up on that PS refinery. Jim gave us the rough magnitude of that. I was curious if maybe we\u2019ve seen some other headlines with U.S. Steel bringing down, I guess keeping down some blast furnaces. In the past you mentioned that the tariffs have actually helped domestic, steel production domestic met coal consumption, so I was wondering if that was or any other distinct advance reflected in the updated guidance?","Mark Wallace","Yeah. Certainly, we had a huge -- we had a big volume quarter in steel and industrial coal. Now what's happening with some of those announcements, unfortunately some of those producers -- rules changed a little bit. We just talked about the declining or the softening industrial environment, which is obviously impacting them.","Following the tariffs, they saw an increase in production. Unfortunately, now with the markets huge inventories went up and the markets going a little softer, prices are coming down. And so there's probably an excess in capacity there. And so, yeah, we expect that our metals and equipment volumes in the second half just because of the softer industrial environment will get a little bit softer unfortunately.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay. So it sounds like it's considered in your current update?","Mark Wallace","It is.","Brian Ossenbeck","All right. Okay. Thanks for your time, Mark. Appreciate it.","Mark Wallace","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.","Amit Mehrotra","Thanks, operator. Thanks, everybody, and congrats on the good operating performance. Jim, can you, I guess, maybe talk about the pricing environment. Is it harder to push pricing in the current volume and low-inflation environment? And can you just give us maybe a flavor of your ability to, just simply put, just charge a higher price for the better service that you guys are delivering?","Jim Foote","Well, if you look at the \u2013 again, let's focus on there, there's two different business segments, there's intermodal and there's carload. Intermodal, our obligation there is to deliver a product that's as close as truck-like and to do so at a price that's cheaper than a truck, because of the service differentiation between the fact that the lift or the time in transit is going to take long. So as there's a very soft truck market out there right now and really marks a lot of excess capacity based upon some recent historical changes in the marketplace. It's a little more difficult for us.","On the other hand, what we're really focusing on and as we talk a lot about, because it's two-thirds of our business and we \u2013 and very profitable long-term business for us is carload business. From a high-level perspective, in that situation we know that we're \u2013 that our customers are paying a 15% to 20% premium to move their product in a truck, because they want to buy service reliability.","As we become more reliable in that supply chain, we should be able to get more and more of that business, and we should be able to do so at a premium price, because the customer is actually saving money by putting \u2013 taking the business off to highway and put it in a railcar. So that's where we focus intently on, leveraging the service product. Mark, do you want to add to that?","Mark Wallace","No. I think that's exactly right and as we become more reliable and persistent and as the market soften and customers are holding onto product and just in time deliveries become more important. Our service comes at a premium and I think customers recognize that. We do a good job for them, we get it there when we say we're going to get it. Our deliveries \u2013 our tip plan compliance is very good, and so they're willing to pay for their premium service.","Amit Mehrotra","Well, just as a quick follow-up to that. Why wouldn't we see that then those market share gains show up in the revenue? I mean, the revenue revision is not surprising, given all the headwinds you've discussed. But what if that would be improvements to the network on the carload side is the market share opportunity you just talked about. The realignment of the sales organization, those could translate to some market share gains. And so, maybe, it just takes a little longer than I appreciate, if you can just talk about where you are in kind of the evolution of capturing that market share. Because \u2013 it doesn't seem like it's showing up in the revenue numbers this year at least?","Jim Foote","Well, again, as you -- I'd like to point out again, the carload is pretty -- the carload -- we are the most transparent industry in the world in as much as we report our sales volume on a weekly basis. And our merchandise business segment, even though everybody says, oh my god, something is wrong with CSX, the volumes are down 10%.","Well, it's all intermodal, and we already told everybody in the world why our intermodal business was going to be down, nobody focus on the fact that our merchandise franchise was outperforming everybody else in the industry. And this is what exactly what we're talking about.","So up until most recently, where we saw a couple of our industrial segments get much softer, we are very confident that the strategy of going -- having non-cyclical growth in our merchandise segment is achievable based upon our service product.","And unfortunately, as I said, half of this -- or a significant portion of this merchandise business that we've now taken our guidance down on was associated with this one-time customer event and the rest of it is just kind of basically market-driven where in certain segments with our industrial customers, again, our grain business is doing really great. A lot of our segments of our business are doing really great. Not all grain moves in train, a lot of grain move in a boxcar -- individual boxcar that were taken for the truck and put in a boxcar.","So, across the Board in this merchandise segment, we're seeing gains, we're seeing traffic come to us. And if you're a customer right now, it's kind of looking and saying like why maybe things are a little soft, maybe better where I continue to right-size my business to take control of my cost structure, how can I save money and one of my business.","As you know, I can reduce my transportation spend overnight by taking the traffic off the road and putting it in the boxcar. 10 years ago, I wouldn't have done that because -- the product would have never got to where it was supposed to be. Nowadays, I'm willing to do that and I can save much. So, we're pretty confident on that and I think -- and we think that the numbers are beginning to prove us correct.","Amit Mehrotra","If I can just ask one follow-up for Kevin with respect to the cost opportunities you laid out. Kevin, do you expect to see OR improvement in the second half versus the stellar results you guys put up in the second quarter? 3Q typically looks a lot like 2Q, but I'm not sure, if there's any further opportunity given the cost items that you laid out?","Kevin Boone","Yes, I think Jim addressed that previously. I don't think we're going to get into back half versus first half dynamics in terms of OR. What I can tell you is there's a number of initiatives that we've been working on over the last month that are new to our plan to react to this downward guidance in our topline.","So, yes, we're reacting quickly not only across G&A, it's across all aspects of our business. Jamie, Ed, Bob, and Brian are on Board and new ideas are coming to us everyday. And it\u2019s our job to identify those and go after them, but we're not going to get the nuance of second half versus first half.","Amit Mehrotra","Okay. I\u2019ll try, but I appreciate the response. Thanks everybody.","Jim Foote","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Your line is open. You may ask your question.","David Zazula","Hey, this is David Zazula on for Brandon. Thanks for taking my question. Just a little bit of drill down into the prior question about pricing getting in terms of merchandise versus intermodal. Some of the service metrics you showed on intermodal in terms of trip plan compliance show really good trip plan compliance on the intermodal side. Could that make you potentially a victim of your own success in that -- there's not as much room to grow positive on the service side and try to drive conversion from the truck? Or are there more nuanced aspects of the service that you can still provide that would be beneficial to shippers currently using truck?","Jim Foote","I mentioned intermodal versus carload business reflect the major of two different kinds of businesses. The intermodal is terminal-to-terminal, point-to-point and it's much easier to have those high trip plan compliance numbers versus carload. A lot of things we can do there on the terminal side in order to improve that customer experience and I'll have Mark tell you about some of the great stuff we're doing on the technology side on intermodal that we think is going to differentiate ourselves as well.","Mark Wallace","Yes. Well, I mean, again across the board I mean, we are -- lots of great things going on across the board with -- in terms of reservation systems all kinds of things that the terminals making it easier for customers to do business with us, whether it's on the website lots of opportunities. But clearly, when we talk about converting a lot of business, merchandise is really where we see the greatness of opportunity.","And driving that conversion from truck to our -- into our merchandise business lots of opportunity there. We're seeing some great results. We're converting a lot of business as we speak because of our services improved, so dramatically customers are responding to the reliability and the consistency that we're providing at a great price and so I think there's a lot of opportunities left. But clearly, both on the intermodal side and on the merchandise side there's opportunities for continued growth there.","David Zazula","Thanks Mark.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. You may ask your question.","Chris Wetherbee","Hey, thanks, good afternoon. Wanted to ask about the guidance and maybe specifically, can you help us break out what you think the volume expectations are for the back half of the year. I don't know if you want to sort of handle that on a merchandise versus intermodal type of dynamic is clearly there's some company specific initiatives on the intermodal side that are reducing volume, but just any help there to think about that mix of what's yields and what's volume in the back half?","Mark Wallace","Chris, I mean, we're expecting that the volume in the second half is going to -- at this point in time is probably -- we're going to have to work really hard to make the volume equal to or better than what we had in the first half. And that's the challenge as I said.","Again we came into the year expecting to be up 1% to 2% in the first quarter. But under the circumstances with a lot of noise going on, we still have a pretty good quarter. But there's a lot of the segments especially intermodal just didn't bounce back with the way everybody expected it to be. And so what we\u2019re seeing right now is kind of take today as the run rate.","And hopefully, we can do a little bit better than we did in the first half even with the pretty strong quarter. But that's -- we don't have a big hockey stick anymore here, anymore to work with relatively flat, we should get a tick up in the second -- in the fourth quarter of the year, just simply because of intermodal start to over -- we start to get out of some of this -- de-marketing of certain lands. But on an absolute numbers basis, this is pretty much a pretty good -- for planning purposes for our guidance right now and I'm pleased that I hope I'm proven wrong and we do see things that are turning stronger in the later part of the year, but we're just assuming that this is kind of the new norm for guidance purposes.","Jim Foote","Hey, Chris, with -- our first half of the year revenue was up 2%. We're now guiding for the full year down 1% to 2%. We still expect pricing to remain positive, so I think the math is pretty simple there.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate that. And then just on the pricing side and maybe just thinking about yields in general drilling down to the coal numbers, there are some puts and takes. And when export volumes move around a little bit, you tend to have fluctuation in the coal yields.","When you think about the back half, should we be looking at 2Q as a reasonably good benchmark to use for the back half or modeling out? Just trying to get a sense of is there other sort of movements between met and thermal that we should expect as we move into the back half of the year. It sounds like the guidance for 40 million tons is still holds, just want to get a sense of if there\u2019s any moving parts within that, is 2Q a good number to use for coal yields?","Jim Foote","I think so. I think so, Chris. Listen, again, as you look at the RPUs in coal, as you know in any given quarter always lots of moving parts there. Q2 coal RPUs was down obviously, but that was really a reflection of some gains that we got in shorter haul business and in our utilities business to the north, which is generating lower RPUs than the utility business to the south.","And then as I talked about in an earlier question, some of the steel industry growth that we saw, saw some strong volumes there, which is again some lower RPU than typically we see on the whole book of coal. But no, I think, going forward sort of what you see is what you get for and what you should probably think about as we plan out the back half of the year.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay, great. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. You may ask your question.","Tom Wadewitz","Yeah. Good afternoon. Wanted to ask you first on the -- just kind of broader approach on price and volume. I'm confident you'll show discipline, but how do we think about how you want to dial the -- how you want to approach the dial of the levers. Will you get more aggressive in terms of kind of competitive position to support the volumes as you see this less volume out there? Or is it something where you kind of let the volume flow with the market and you try to keep price that reflects what's good service and discipline and all that?","Mark Wallace","So, hey, Tom. We should be, again, Jim mentioned what we're going to do on the volume side and we're going to take it as it comes and we're going to be -- we've got a long pipeline of initiatives of things that I talked about in the past, whether it\u2019s on the marketing side, whether it's on the -- the business that we do with our short-line partners, whether it's stuff that we\u2019re doing on a regional sales, whether it's a whole host of industrial projects -- industrial development projects that we've got going on. I mean, clearly, a long list of initiatives that we're working on, and so we're going to convert that volume as it comes to us and we're working hard everyday to bring more volume under the railroad.","But let's be very clear, we're still achieving very strong value on the renewals and the momentum that I spoke about in Q1 on pricing continued into Q2. Every contract that we have it still needs to come across my desk for approval. And I can tell you that I'm extremely pleased with the discipline that our team is bringing. And so we're working hard to pull on both levers, and we're taking a disciplined approach.","Tom Wadewitz","Okay, great. That's helpful. Thanks Mark. One other question just how should we think about the operating ratio in an environment -- not necessarily second half of the year, I know you've given us kind of full year commentary. But perhaps, if we look to 2020 and you say well, you are in an environment where revenue is flat. Do you have enough kind of initiatives left? I know Kevin identified some. But do you have enough efficiency gains left to improve the OR if revenue is flat? How might we think about that perhaps from a kind of a broader perspective or 2020 or however you want to frame it?","Jim Foote","Well, I think what we just said is, we're going to improve the operating ratio more than a point with revenues down. So, we do -- if we're faced with the similar circumstances, that's the hand we're dealt. We'll do everything in our power to manage the business accordingly.","Tom Wadewitz","And you think that could be the case beyond just second half?","Jim Foote","Well, that I hoped. Like I said this is not end of days.","Tom Wadewitz","Yes, right, right.","Jim Foote","Yes. There's a -- again, there\u2019s a certain amount -- obviously, there is a certain amount -- the two variables that -- with two variables, that we obviously need to work with are volume and inflation on the operating side. And to the extent that -- to the extent that we do get some cost reduction associated with volume reductions or increases, if it goes the other way, our challenge each and every year is to offset whatever the inflation number is.","And hopefully, if we are providing a high-quality product as Mark said and we're pricing appropriately that should help us a lot to get us going in the right direction from the cost -- which would help on the operating ratio side in addition to keep finding ways to improve efficiency.","We have long ways to go and along with the initiatives this work on. We're far -- in all of these various categories, we're far from best-in-class. We like to brag, but we benchmark against it just about everything that everybody else does not even -- not just in the railroad industry to try and figure out where we can improve. But we have a long ways to go and just about every segment of the way we do business.","Tom Wadewitz","Okay, great. Thanks for the perspective, Jim. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Long with Stephens. You may ask your question.","Justin Long","Thanks and good afternoon. So, last quarter, I think you talked about headcount being down 6% to 7% this year which would roughly be in line with attrition. Based on the volume weakness you've seen year-to-date and it sounds like you'll see in the second half, what's your flexibility to reduce headcount further? And do you have any updated thoughts around what that percentage looks like in 2019?","Jim Foote","Yes. We're still well on-track to meet that forecast that we had the 6% to 8%. I think I mentioned in my opening comments that really overtime is a big focus of ours right now, significant cost and significant savings opportunity going forward.","Certainly, we're going to continue to look at headcount, but we're going to use attrition where we can. So, we have a great line of sight to what that number looks like and probably, we'll see -- go a little bit harder there depending on how the volumes come in the back half of the year.","Justin Long","Okay. And secondly, I wanted to circle back to domestic intermodal and your expectations for growth on that front. I know it's a little bit noisy with some of the lane rationalizations. But if you can kind of take that out of the equation, what do you see as the underlying growth rate for domestic intermodal as we get into the back half of this year and longer term?","Mark Wallace","Well, to tell you what the economy is going to do in the back half of the year, I'll tell you what intermodal is going to do. Listen, I think there's a lot of -- as we talked about the excess supply that's out there, truck supply, capacity, we hopefully are flattish intermodal. We think there's going to be a good peak, but it's probably going to be somewhat muted versus the extremely strong peak that we saw in 2018. So, I think, volume levels are going to pick up a little bit, but probably not as peak issues we saw -- as we have historically seen. Listen, longer term, domestic intermodal, my view is there's no reason why this franchise should not able to grow on an annualized basis whatever GDP gives us plus two or three points.","Justin Long","Okay. And just to clarify your comment on flat markets, is that flat domestic intermodal volumes excluding rationalizations in the back half? Is that what you're saying?","Jim Foote","No, including our rationalization. So, again, we lap -- officially lap the end of the rationalizations in January of next year. We took off again January of this year of 2019, a 5%. So overall, since we began this journey in December of 2017, we have rationalized over 15% of the intermodal network. Most of that -- a lot of that lapse in October and then the final bit lapse in December -- in January, excuse me.","Justin Long","Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate the time.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question.","Scott Group","Hey, thanks. Good afternoon guys. Kevin, I don't know if I missed it, but you guys usually give some guidance on the other revenue expectations. Any color you can give us there?","Kevin Boone","Yeah, I think you should expect about -- around the current levels that we did in the second quarter, continue through the back half of the year.","Scott Group","Okay, helpful. And then so with a more cautious volume revenue outlook, does this change the way you guys think about target leverage ratios? Does it change the way you think about CapEx? I mean, do you some flexibility on the $1.6 billion? And then, I guess just following up on that headcount piece, why not do more on headcount if the volumes are coming in worse?","Kevin Boone","I certainly think if we continue to see downward pressure on volumes, which is not our expectation that you probably see some more opportunity there. There is variable cost in our business and then we would take a look at some other things as well.","On the balance sheet right now, we're sitting on $1.6 billion in cash. We expect to generate a lot of cash in the second half of the year, kind of, give us significant flexibility to be proactive and opportunistic if the market gives us an opportunity.","We're well within our 2.5, 2.75 times leverage targets, debt to EBITDA. I think, we're comfortable living in that area. We're at the bottom end of that today. So it gives us a lot of flexibility going forward. But again, with our cash balance, just we even have today and what we expect to generate through the back half of the year gives a lot of opportunity to be opportunistic here.","Scott Group","Okay. Thank you for the time guys.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Ben Hartford with Baird. You may ask your question. Ben, please check your mute feature.","Ben Hartford","All right. Guys, sorry about that. Thanks for the time. Mark, I'm interested in your perspective on IMO 2020 and how customer conversations are shaping up in front of that. Do you expect it to have any sort of impact to either in terms of international intermodal pull-forward, anything along the crude or petroleum side of the equation? How are you guys thinking about that impact in the back half of the year and the early part of 2020?","Mark Wallace","Yes, a great question. We're obviously working and talking to our customers. I'll be visiting with a lot of the international steamship guys here in the next month or so, where I know that's going to be a huge topic of discussion. We're -- clearly early indications, we don't think it will have a material change for our business.","I know they're working on these issues as we speak. But where we stand right now and, again, maybe a little premature, maybe remind me to bring that question back up on the Q3 call and I'll give you maybe a little bit more color. But it's a topic of discussion coming up and -- but clearly, I think, right now we feel pretty comfortable that we're not going to see any material change.","Ben Hartford","Okay. That's helpful. And then, the revenue -- or the, excuse me, the outlook you gave on intermodal was helpful. I'm curious on the merchandise side as well. I mean, obviously, a lot of talk about the macro and the softness, but as you guys embark upon expanding the addressable market, what's the probability in 2020 that you can make enough progress, either selling service, developing some of the sales and marketing efforts to be able to drive to whatever U.S. industrial production growth number might be, plus some sort of multiplier within the merchandise category in 2020? Or is that simply too soon? Is it to near of a time horizon to be thinking about and offset yet from some of these initiatives?","Mark Wallace","Well, it's a great question. Listen; again, as Jim said earlier, we're outperforming the U.S. rail industry today on our merchandise volume growth. We're up after the second quarter, over 2%. The others are down for the year on merchandise. So, clearly, the initiatives that we're working on, the changes to our service plan and the service that we're delivering are clearly having a lot of big impact.","Now we're facing reality and the industrial economy is kind of slowing down here. And we've got a few headwinds going into the second half, which we have to live with. And obviously, PES explosion was a major factor to us revising this. But, as I said earlier, we have a number of initiatives going on and the team that Kevin used to lead in the marketing department before he became an interim CFO here is doing some great work analysis. Those are the -- we got a team of data analytic people downstairs that are doing some great research and exposing a lot of opportunities for this organization.","We're excited by that. There's some -- obviously, some big opportunities and we're going after everything methodically and we're looking to grow this organization. We're not just taking what we can get. We\u2019re going out there, we're being proactive and this is about growing CSX, it's not just taking what the customer gives us. We\u2019re going to find opportunities to grow convert truck traffic and we're doing just that.","Ben Hartford","Appreciate it. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. You may ask your question.","Bascome Majors","Yes. Thanks for taking my question here. You made a few changes in the C-suite in the second quarter. I'm not sure if Farrukh\u2019s in the call, but if he has I was hoping you could help us understand responsibilities of this new role of Strategy Officer and anything about the long-term or mid-term vision that might entail realizing he's six weeks into the job here. And Kevin, anything if you want to highlight your priorities for the finance organization your leadership that will be helpful? Thank you.","Kevin Boone","Sure. I've known Farrukh for many, many years, we go way, way back -- all the way back to the privatization of the Canadian National where we worked together on that initiative. At that time we kept up with his career as I moved around the industry as well.","So, I just felt that we're embarking on a significant transformation of CSX and a lot of things that we want to do differently, a lot of them in the area that Mark spoke of in terms of expanding our reach and our interface with our customers. And Farrukh instantly came to mind, because I felt that he had a great experience and working in that area.","So, it's all about what it is we can do to make our service offering, our core rail product offering better to our customers. And to me that involves a significant amount of new thought, a new direction, a new vision from what has historically been done in the railroad industry and that's what Farrukh is going to work on with me and make it happen.","And Kevin, Kevin's phenomenal is doing a great job. We all appreciate that he was here and his skill set and his ability to step right in. And pick up where Frank left off. Frank did an amazing job for CSX and we're all happy that Kevin was here to help as we worked through the transition. And we are -- I am in the process as Kevin well knows. He is looking at the kind of sheepishly as you all know, we\u2019re doing an external search to see if we can find the right person to fill this role and as part of that process, Kevin is going to be considered.","Bascome Majors","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","Jordan Alliger","Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks. Just a little pushing on the intermodal, the trip plan compliance looks really strong. And I'm just wondering the de-marketing is going to lap by the end of the third quarter. So let's just say the economy sort of gets back to a 2.5% GDP type number 2%, 2.5% as we move into 2020. Do you feel comfortable that at that point you\u2019ll be able to start more aggressively re-marketing the intermodal and do that GDP plus two to three points or is it premature?","Mark Wallace","As I said, longer term, I think that would be our goal. Clearly, I'm not going to sit here in July of 2019 and provide you 2020 guidance. But longer term, as we think about the intermodal business, yeah that would be my hope and expectation given our franchise, the strength of our franchise, and the service that we provide to customers, which we're pretty proud of, that we would able to do whatever the economy give us plus two to three points above that. So that's my wish, that's my goal, that's we're going to work on. We're settling in on our footprint. We\u2019re doing really well on the lanes that we -- that we're in now. We're showing our customers what we're made of, and when the growth comes we're ready to handle and got excess capacity and we're ready for the growth when it comes.","Jordan Alliger","Okay. And then the next question, fully understand the need to be prudent in the guidance with all the various cross currents going on, I think though you might have mentioned in the very opening remarks, Jim that customers remain cautiously optimistic. So, I'm just wondering, which areas might be where that optimism is? And if there optimism plays out and you run that through your system, could we get back to that 1% type of revenue growth if the cautious optimism plays out?","Jim Foote","Well, I think yesterday, Jamie once said, they were pretty excited about the second half of the year. I think it was about two weeks ago on the front page of the newspaper, General Motors was talking about how great things were and on and on and on.","Not necessarily our customers per se, but I think Jamie Dimon said this morning, it shouldn't stop being so pessimistic, things aren't that bad. All we're doing and saying that there's been -- as I said the slow drip since the beginning of the year, where everyone has expressed concern, I think all of our customers mark interfaces we've done more than I do on a daily basis, and maybe he wants to comment as well, but I think all of them have said from the very beginning, yes, 2019 is expected to be -- was expected to be a slower year than last year, and as he went into the year with all the confusion and chaos more driven by governmental issues than anything.","But if we didn't, once government shutdowns you name it on and on and on tariffs, this tariffs that, if we didn't bring the calmness noise down in the marketplace, we could begin to do things to damage the economy. So, and nothing really has changed to make everyone feel different over the first six months. And so, we're looking at, is this the new norm for the rest of the year. Now, we're talking about another government shutdown, maybe as early as September or October.","And so, as I said, unfortunately in this day and age, I'm obligated, we're obligated to update guidance when it changed. And we were trying to figure out where to put the peg in. And so we said, let's pretty much take -- let\u2019s assume that what we have today continues for the rest of the year. And let's hope that we're wrong and if things pick up as opposed to say, well, we don't really know, let\u2019s not take a realistic view.","We can always just take our guidance down again next quarter. You don't want to get into that situation. So, we think this is a realistic look at the state of the economy and where we fit in. And we're confident with that, plus it gives us the ability internally to say, hey guys, this is the new norm, let\u2019s tighten our shoes, let's get to work and we're going to achieve our targets.","Jordan Alliger","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Vernon with Bernstein. You may ask your question.","David Vernon","Hey, guys. So, the down 1% to 2% for the full year, I'm just trying to get a sense for what that should -- what we should be expecting for sort of operating income dollars, not necessarily the operating ratio. The Street's right now got you up 3% inclusive of land sales, up 6% ex land sales. What kind of EBIT growth on down, sort of, 3% to 4%-ish back half of the year should we be expecting?","Kevin Boone","David, as you know the math, if I give you EBIT growth, you would know the OR. So by default, we're going to give the OR ratio into the back half, but probably kind of\u2026","David Vernon","Is it reasonable to expect up a little, down a little, flat? Can you give us some directional guidance on where the EBIT number will be?","Kevin Boone","Look, I think we gave the revenue guidance, so we gave an OR target and I think we're going to stick with that for now. We'll obviously update as we get further through the year.","David Vernon","All right. And may be just a follow-up. If you look at the sequential downturn in other revenue, was that just like changing the rules on when you're charging demurrage, because the volume was sequentially flat in the intermodal now, which was called out in the report, I'm just trying to get a sense for what drove that sort of sequential move lower in the other revenue.","Kevin Boone","Well, the intermodal volumes are down 10%. There's a lot less boxes sitting in terminals and we're charging a lot less and certainly local as we told everybody before, accessorial charges are something that we're not looking to make a lot of money there. It's really changing customer behaviors and getting boxes to flow and assets to move throughout the network. And so, some of that is working and we're working with our customers and we're seeing some good dwell numbers. And so, we're happy with where that's trending. But obviously, a lot of that was driven by just lower intermodal volumes.","David Vernon","But the volumes from 1Q to 2Q were flat?","Kevin Boone","Pardon me?","David Vernon","The 1Q to 2Q, the sequential volume was kind of flattish and you\u2019re going from like 168 to 124, I was just trying to understand, did you see a really big pickup in the yard performance or was this just\u2026","Kevin Boone","This is -- most of this is international intermodal and this is where these kinds of the guys have said, they can't have offsite storage. They must store their box in our terminal. Well guess what, when you start charging them suddenly they find ways and they move their boxes to container storage facilities located near our intermodal terminals. That's just the nature of the beast. So, yeah, volume on the international side was -- overall volume was down in intermodal, volume on international side was relatively flat, but to be a customer behavior that Mark just alluded to, these are the first guy to take advantage of that and get him out of it.","David Vernon","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Seidl with Cowen. You may ask your question.","Jason Seidl","Thank you, operator. Jim and team thanks for squeezing me in here. I just got -- I have one question. Looking out in intermodal obviously you guys de-marketed some of the business, because there wasn't enough on some of the lines and the profitability just wasn't there. It's clearly important to raise the profitability of intermodal. How much of that is improving service and how much of that is going to be -- you guys going after higher prices?","Mark Wallace","Yes. A lot of the work that we're working on right now is changing the footprint and working on taking out all the unnecessary touches and switching that we used to do with intermodal that was crazy changing this hub and spoke system that we inherited when we joined the railroad, which caused a lot of inefficiencies in the -- in our intermodal product and in our service and drove up our intermodal cost significantly. And so, we have changed that model. We have gotten out of a lot of the lanes that were clearly very unprofitable for us.","We're focusing on what we do well and the lanes that we do well in our in our contracts, we have a longer term contract. So, it's not -- we're not susceptible to the very well sort of mid to high to single-digit exposure to the spot market. So, doesn't really affect us too much. But most of our pricing is under a long-term contracts with rate escalators, so annual rates escalator. But we're working there and we're doing a good job and we're going to see the profitability of that business segment improve over time.","Jason Seidl","Okay. Thanks for the time as always.","Jim Foote","All right.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question.","Walter Spracklin","Yes. Thanks very much. Good afternoon, everyone I'll keep it to one as well just again on the intermodal side and your effort. I think Mark you were saying targeting trucking your one of your peers obviously in Canada is taking a little different approach to that. They're not only targeting the trucking market, but investing in and buying intermodal assets within that market to kind of jump start and accelerate that conversion that truck-to-rail conversion. Is that something you would consider? Is that something you've looked at? What's your overall view on that strategy?","Mark Wallace","I think they're smart people. Jim and I know them really well. Obviously, it's got a lot of my career at the railroad. I admire what they're doing. We have a little bit of a different model here in the United States than up north. But we look at what they're doing and -- but I'm not just here with you on the call today strategies for the future.","But listen we as Jim alluded to we're looking for growth opportunities everywhere, whether that's in merchandise, whether that's an intermodal and you never say never to any opportunity that comes across your desk.","Jim Foote","Keep looking at it. We're watching what they're doing.","Mark Wallace","Yes.","Walter Spracklin","Fair enough. So, maybe if I could sneak one in there as well an extra one R&D, Mark again you mentioned that technology I think the rail industry is right for it. Can we see or do you expect to see perhaps -- this is better for Jim perhaps more of your CapEx dollars going toward potential investment in accelerating the R&D applicability to rail to get some of those extra efficiencies from that trend. Just curious your thoughts on that?","Kevin Boone","Hey, this is Kevin. First of all, tech dollars are up this year, so we are spending is more on CapEx technology, but I'll let Jim answer the rest of the question.","Jim Foote","Well, again, it\u2019s something we're always looking at ways to -- we're here to grow the business simple as that. This is not despite what a lot of people say, they're not -- you guys and a lot of people say, we're here to shrink the business to profitability. We're here to make the business to run better so that we can grow it and we'll look at every opportunity where we can make a buck and make in the process, and make the shareholders rich and famous. And that's what it's all about. So we're always studying every opportunity that we can pursue.","Walter Spracklin","Okay. That's it. Thank you very much.","Jim Foote","Great. Thank you very much for calling us.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I turn the call back over to the speakers.","Jim Foote","Thank you everyone for joining us. I think that concludes our call.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation in today's call. You may disconnect your lines."],"6312":["CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) Q4 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call January 16, 2019  4:30 PM ET","Company Participants","Bill Slater - Chief Investor Relations Officer","Jim Foote - President and CEO","Kevin Boone - EVP and CFO","Mark Wallace - EVP, Sales and Marketing","Jamie Boychuk - Executive Vice President, Operations","Conference Call Participants","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital","Tom Wadewitz - UBS","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse","Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank","Brian Ossenbeck - JPMorgan","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna International","Justin Long - Stephens","David Vernon - Sanford Bernstein","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities","Jordan Alliger - Goldman","Ben Hartford - Baird","Ravi Shankar - Morgan Stanley","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets","Allison Poliniak - Wells Fargo","Operator","Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the CSX Corporation Fourth Quarter 2019 Call. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. During this call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Slater, Chief Investor Relations Officer for CSX Corporation. You may begin.","Bill Slater","Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me on today\u2019s call are Jim Foote, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Wallace, Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing; Kevin Boone, Chief Financial Officer; and Jamie Boychuk, Executive Vice President of Operations. On slide two is our forward-looking disclosure, followed by our non-GAAP disclosure on slide three.","With that, it is my pleasure to introduce President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Foote.","Jim Foote","Thank you, Bill, and good afternoon. I want to begin by thanking all of our CSX employees for another great job this quarter. They continue to show that they are the best operators in the industry. For both the fourth quarter and full year, they once again broke their own records and set new all-time low operating ratios. Our service is the best it has ever been and getting better.","The key here is reliability. Our operating a simpler, more efficient network, we are able to offer rail users a service that is truck-like inconsistency, but with lower cost and more environmentally responsible. More shippers are selecting us for their shipping needs when we have tremendous opportunity for growth.","Let's now turn to Slide 5 of the presentation. Our financial results are straightforward with only a few unique items, which Kevin will point out in a few minutes. Fourth quarter EPS declined 2% to $0.99. The operating ratio improved by 30 basis points to a new record of 60% as continued operating momentum offset top line headwinds. For the full year, EPS increased 9% to $4.17, and the operating ratio improved by 190 basis points to 58.4%. These are truly great results considering the industrial economy's second half performance.","Turning to Slide 6. Fourth quarter revenue declined 8% year-over-year, due to the continued impact of the softer industrial economy, intermodal lane rationalizations and coal headwinds. Merchandise revenue and volume declined 3% as growth in Ag and Food & Minerals markets was more than offset by declines in chemicals, auto and other markets.","The Philadelphia refinery explosion and GM strike accounted for more than two-thirds of the volume declines in the quarter. Intermodal revenue declined 9% on 7% lower volume, primarily due to the impact of lane rationalizations implemented around the 2018 peak season. We have now lapped the impact of these changes. Coal revenue decreased 22% on 17% lower volumes with declines in both export and domestic markets, due to the impact of lower export demand and benchmark prices, as well as low natural gas prices. Lastly, other revenue declines resulted from lower storage revenue at intermodal facilities and lower demurrage charges.","Moving to Slide 7. Let's review our safety performance. The full-year personal injury rate declined 15%, and we reduced the full-year train accident rate by 41%, including setting another company record in the fourth quarter for the lowest accident rate. This progress is a result of concerted daily effort on the part of the employees performing the work. At the same time, we still see areas where additional improvement is needed.","In 2020, we will maintain our rigorous safety program focused on continuing education of our workforce, further strengthening rules compliance and empowering employees to have the courage to act if they see something unsafe. As I have said before, we will never be satisfied with our performance if just one of our employees gets injured while at work.","Moving to Slide 8. Let's review our operating performance for the quarter. CSX set new all-time Company records for both velocity and dwell achieving significant year-over-year improvements, as well as strong sequential momentum. The combination of these improved metrics helped significantly increase car miles per day as we continue to translate incremental operating efficiencies into higher asset utilization across the network. We also continue to set fuel efficiency records operating below 1 gallon of fuel per 1,000 GTM despite typical seasonal headwinds in this quarter.","CSX is the only US Class 1 railroad to have crossed this threshold. Fuel efficiency remains a key focus for the team, given the combination of financial as well as significant environmental benefits from reducing fuel consumption, and we believe opportunities remain to get even better going forward. Reducing emissions is important to us, our customers and the communities we serve. And we are proud to have been recognized by various institutions as leaders in sustainability for the transportation space.","On Slide 9, most importantly, we are translating these operational improvements into more reliable service for our customers. Trip plan performance set new records again this quarter with 83% of our merchandise cars and 95% of intermodal containers hitting their hourly trip plan targets. Additionally, we successfully completed the roll-out of individualized trip plan performance data to our merchandise and intermodal customers.

Turning to Slide 11 I'll walk you through the highlights of the summary income statement. As Jim mentioned total revenue was down 8% in the fourth quarter as the impact of lower intermodal and coal volume as well as reduced fuel recovery, lower other revenue and unfavorable mix more than offset the benefit of pricing gains and merchandise and intermodal.","Moving to expenses. Total operating expenses were 9% lower in the fourth quarter. A significant achievement that reflects CSX's ability to react to changing markets while delivering record service levels. Overall, these results reflect the company's sustained operating improvements and significant gains and labor and asset efficiency. Labor and trends expense was 3% lower with average headcount down 7% or nearly 1,600.","Efficiency gains were strong in the quarter partially offset by inflation, other costs and still in competition including accelerations of stock compensation related to certain retirement eligible employees.","Our ongoing refinement of the operating plan continues the drive savings from pure accrue starts enabling a 9% year-over-year reduction in the active train and engine employee base and driving is 7% improvement in crew utilization as measured by gross ton miles per active train and engine employee.","The workforce efficiency and management execution reduce over time across the operating department by nearly 15% sequentially or approximately 30% versus the fourth quarter 2018. Additionally, the average active locomotive count was down 10% year-over-year in the quarter.

MS&O expense improved 20% versus the prior year. Continued improvements to the train plan combined with increased network fluidity have enabled an 8% reduction in crew travel and repositioning expenses. On the mechanical side the lower locomotive counts also drove savings and MS&O including a 26% reduction in locomotive materials and contracted service expense versus the fourth quarter of 2018.","Real estate and line sales were 10 million lower in the quarter. We continue to see a pipeline of real estate opportunities and for planning purposes we currently expect gains in 2020 to be approximately $60 million while the impact of these transactions will remain uneven from quarter to quarter as you remember in March of 2018 at our investor conference we guided for $300 million in real estate sales proceeds over three years.

Let's turn to Slide 14 in our outlook for 2020. We expect underlying economic demand to remain relatively consistent with current levels. It took industrial activity awhile to cool off, and it will take a while to heat back up. Based on this, we expect full-year revenue to be flat to down 2% versus 2019. This forecast includes more than $300 million of top line headwinds from the coal business, driven primarily by lower export coal volumes and pricing. For the first half of the year, the merchandise business will continue to lap the higher economic level -- the higher level of economic activity from the first half of 2019, but we expect merchandise volume growth to turn positive in the second half of the year. We expect intermodal volumes to increase in 2020 as we have now fully lapped the lane rationalization impact and look to grow the reengineered network. As to the operating ratio, our goal is to operate as efficiently as possible while ensuring we maintain our reliable service product. Our focus is on growing the business and in that context, we are targeting cost efficiencies that will not inhibit service. There are additional cost levers out there for us to pull, but we must make sure we are well positioned to capture new business and respond to demand when industrial production moves up.","Looking at the 2019 operating ratio results, we again outperformed our real estate target of approximately $100 million a year. Adjusting for this outperformance implies a baseline operating ratio of 59%. Despite roughly $300 million of operating income headwinds in 2020 related to export coal and non-core items such as lower real estate gains, higher depreciation and lower other revenue, we still expect to realize enough incremental savings across the business to maintain or hopefully, even improve our margins.","For capital allocation, our first call on cash is maintaining the integrity and reliability of our railroad. As Kevin noted in 2019, we again significantly increased investments in rail infrastructure, spending more on rail, ties, ballasts and signals, and we expect to maintain this level of investment going forward. In total, we project capital expenditures for the year of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion, in line with our 2019 targets. In the absence of any high return growth projects, we expect the next principal use of cash flow will be continued return of capital to shareholders through both dividends and additional share buybacks. Importantly, we are committing to doing so in a way that maintains our strong investment-grade credit rating.","Over the last two years, we have accomplished many exciting things at CSX and fundamentally transformed the way the Company does business. However, none of us are resting on that success. In fact, we have only scratched the surface of this Company's potential. I believe the best is yet to come for CSX as we continue our journey to be coming the best railroad in North America. Bill?","Bill Slater","Thank you Jim. In the interest of time I would like to ask everyone to please limit themselves to one question and one follow-up only if necessary. With that we will now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes Brandon Oglenski from Barclays Capital. Your line is open.","Brandon Oglenski","Hey good afternoon everyone and congrats on a pretty good year relative to pretty difficult conditions. Jim or I don't know if Mark Wallace is on the line but do you guys mind digging a little bit deeper into your macro assumptions behind the flat to down 2% revenue assumption? And I think you did call out some headwinds in coal as well. Do you mind just repeating that again?","Mark Wallace","Yes sure Brandon. It's Mark. So going into 2020 we expect a continuation of the current macroeconomic trends to continue. We know the consumer economy remains strong but PMI and IDP and other macro indicators suggest that we're not going to see a near-term increase in industrial activity. IDP is projected to be relatively flat for the year and the PMI read in December was 47.2 which was the second worst since \u201809 and the 5th consecutive month signaling contraction. So given this we're not forecasting a hockey stick recovery but any improvement in the macro environment would be upside for us.","Despite these challenges we're going to continue to get better on what we can control providing high-quality service to our customers and executing. We have not changed our outlook for long term revenue growth intermodal as we've said many times we I think we think we can grow 2-ish times GDP and merchandise GDP plus. So we're going to stay close to our customers, watch things and see if sentiment improves throughout the year but clearly as I said we're not forecasting any type of a big recovery in the year.","Brandon Oglenski","Okay. I guess it's a related follow-up Mark can you just tell us how the marketing strategy and sales strategy has changed with CSX especially related to intermodal and merchandise?","Mark Wallace","Yes. Sure. I mean in 2009 we spent a lot at a time revamping the entire sales and marketing organization. We've changed a lot of people, brought in some great talent. We've actually developed a strong marketing team, no longer a pricing team as we've discussed in the past. The marketing team is doing a fantastic job working hard doing actual marketing activities and looking for opportunities to gain share from truck and going after them and providing the sales team with those leads and those opportunities to grow our share as we are leveraging this fantastic service product that Jim and his operating colleagues have provided the sales team to sell.","On the intermodal side again as Jim alluded to we are through our lane rationalizations that began in late of 2017. We have a great intermodal network that we're leveraging and we're excited to sell our as Jim said our 95% plus trip plan compliance or trip plan performance numbers and even higher in some other in some lanes is exciting and customers are taking note and we are executing and doing really well with our intermodal customers there.","Brandon Oglenski","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next we have Tom Wadewitz from UBS. Your line is open.","Tom Wadewitz","Yes. Good afternoon. I wanted to see, I appreciate the detail on coal the perspective. I think that $300 million is a revenue number, any thoughts on how we might think of that in terms of an EBITD number? Is that presumably a fairly high incremental margin? Is that a 50% incremental margin or how would you think about the EBITD headwind related to the coal revenue comment that you provided?","Kevin Boone","Hey Tom, it's Kevin. We've really never broken down the profitability between our different segments but we've always said that the coal business is obviously a very attractive business for us and we're going to continue to move as much coal as we can but that's probably as far as we want to go there on the profitability side.","Tom Wadewitz","Okay. What about I guess start in terms of the pricing assumption you have for seaborne? I mean it seems like you see Queensland benchmark look like I think it went down to or the market went down to the 130 area you've kind of I think come back to 150. Is there any sense within that coal headwind kind of what you're assuming broad brush for the seaborne prices format?","Mark Wallace","Yes. Tom this is Mark again. The net benchmarks and again the met is about 65% of our export coal. The benchmark prices have continued to decline as the global production has weakened and currently there are about 150 bucks. As a reminder our contracts reprice quarterly so you should expect to see a bit of a drag on the RPU into Q1 but that's kind of where it is and we will see what happens throughout the year. As a reminder this time last year the met prices were coming into the first quarter of the year or about 220 bucks.","Tom Wadewitz","So you just assume they kind of stay where they are today. Is that the right way to think about it?","Mark Wallace","Correct. Yes. So we will see the overall for coal we are going to see a step down in the first quarter but sequentially throughout the rest of the year we don't think it's going to get any worse on the RPU.","Tom Wadewitz","Okay. Thank you for the time. Appreciate it.","Mark Wallace","Sure.","Operator","Ken Hoexter from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Ken Hoexter","Great. Hey good afternoon and just maybe Jim looking at the expense side you've kind of accelerated costs here but if volumes are going to be down maybe you can talk about if most of the PSR gains are over, how do you think about moving along with reducing expenses in light of these reduced volumes in contrast to your statement about being cautious about not going too far to be prepared for the rebound and specifically like in the employees.","Jim Foote","Yes, I will ask Jim to give a little color on it here but there are significant amount of cost reduction embedded in that guidance that we provided just to offset inflation and other cost increases that we set out in terms of the increases in depreciation, etc. So but this game is not over and we're going to do the first and foremost thing is to make sure that we're a well-positioned to provide a really good quality product to our customers in the future and again Jamie offer a little more color on the specific initiatives.","Jamie Boychuk","Absolutely. We are continuing to look for good improvements this year on fuel definitely towards our car higher end of things. We're finding as we become more fluid out there and the railroad moves better, our bigger yards are able to do more for us. So we're looking at getting rid of more out of route miles.","Our locomotive fleet continues to go in a great direction as we utilize to get more miles out of our engines which again turns into fewer asset costs with respect to repairs and parts and really it just keeps on chipping away each and every day we're getting involved and getting into what's going on out on the balanced line and that's probably the most important piece that the team is doing is as we're getting on the balanced line and we're walking out there and looking at each industry looking at how we switch them, how can we do things better and by getting out of headquarters and making sure that all the right team including myself is out there each and every week taking a look at what we can do different and better not only does it give us an opportunity to continue to reduce costs but continue to improve the product that we're able to supply Mark and his team to get out there and gain some more business as we keep on moving along.","Ken Hoexter","Thanks but I guess maybe I was trying to be more specific on the employee side. So employees were down over 1,500 year-on-year. Is that something you see accelerating at this point given the volume declines or is that holding, I don't understand given Jim's commentary over not taking out too much to be prepared for the rebound.","Jim Foote","Well, you know as we've said before our focus is on labor cost not just headcount reduction. We've made a significant reduction in the labor costs and not just targeting heads. So we'll continue to look for ways to reduce our labor costs and as we did in this quarter and as we'll do in every quarter that we have to manage the company. We'll do what's necessary around here based upon what we see in terms of business activities. Right now we've kind of given you guidance that we think especially on the merchandise side of the business there's going to be some reasonable stability sequentially in terms of where the volume line should be and an increase on the intermodal side and we'll manage the headcount according to that if it goes sideways or downward you guys get the numbers every week and if you miss a week or something we will point it out to you that which direction the numbers are going in.","Ken Hoexter","Great and just a quick follow-up Jim, the arrivals really jumped or maybe Jamie from 53% on time two quarters ago to 85% now? Is there something beyond just execution that you're kind of that you want to highlight I guess on the positive side something really a strong performance there?","Jamie Boychuk","I mean look at the team is executing. The guys are out on the ground taking a look at everything we can. We'll probably ,I can tell you right now we're going to crank the times a little bit. We're going to pull sometimes out of our trains. We're going to get things moving faster on the network with respect to cutting out some hours on how long it takes to get across the network and that number might bump down a little bit into the next quarter because we tighten things up. So that's a gauge for us to make sure that our assets and people get to the other end so we can turn them back but at the same time when I see that number start to go up it tells myself and the team that on the service design side we can take a look at removing some hours and times from our trains getting across the network.","Ken Hoexter","Appreciate the thoughts. Thanks guys.","Operator","Allison Landry from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Allison Landry","Thanks. Good afternoon. So obviously this year you have a number of headwinds that you outlined and that was really helpful but I just want to understand and also you've talked about more to do on the cost side but just broadly speaking do you need a more normal volume environment in order to really leverage those costs and get the OR even lower somewhere in the mid to high 50s. How should we think about that in terms of the different revenue environments? ","Kevin Boone","Hey Allison it's Kevin. Clearly, we've outlined more cost savings that we think and there's runway to continue to do that. The model we're setting up here is where we're positioning ourselves for growth and really to leverage that when the growth comes and so I think we're very excited about the model we've created. There's a lot of leverage in this model really drop the revenue at a higher incremental margin. That's what we're looking forward as Mark and the team are diligently pursuing growth opportunities for us.","So but as Jim just explained too if the volume environment gets worse than what we expect we all know we have to react. We did it last year. We came in to 2019 thinking revenue was going to be $500 million higher. We had to react after in the second quarter and Jamie and the team pulled together we came up with a new plan based on the volume that we saw from that point on and we adjust it and I think we did a great job. So we'll do it again if we have to.","Jim Foote","The math will just work out in terms of what the margins are should be the business levels come back. We're building a tremendous company here with great operating leverage to take advantage of incremental volumes when they come back.","Allison Landry","Okay, that's definitely helpful. And maybe just on that point but specifically to your expectations for intermodal volume growth this year. If truck rates remain weak for first time period of time through 2020 is there a point at which you might be willing to give a little bit on price to maybe drive some of that traffic into the network or would you just wait for capacity to shore up and then wait for the volumes?","Jamie Boychuk","No, listen Allison we're not going to be cutting prices to grow the business. I think the team here is CSX's worked away too hard to do everything we've done to provide our customers with exceptional service out there. Large portion of the vast majority of our intermodal network on the domestic side is under long-term contracts anyway. We're not looking to grow by just to going out and slashing rates. That's not our game plan. That's not what we're going to do but the truck environment is still pretty loose to build as we saw it last quarter. We don't think there's going to be any meaningful snapback or tightening there but clearly if that happens it'll be a demand driven environment to prevent and that would be good for intermodal that happened. ","Allison Landry","Thank you.","Operator","Amit Mehrotra from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Amit Mehrotra","Thanks operator. Hi everybody. Kevin just wanted to quickly confirm the $300 million for coal that was a revenue number right?","Kevin Boone","Absolutely. Yes. That was revenue number.","Amit Mehrotra","Okay. That makes sense and it's obviously implied 15% decline. Any help on how we can maybe you can provide some color on what's split between the volume in revenue per yield on that? What's the makeup of that and then I thought you had said last quarter the DNA expenses we're going to pick up sequentially by about $15 million. We obviously didn't see that. Just wondering if there's any impact the first quarter and what should we think about from a sequential from a DNA perspective? ","Kevin Boone","Yes. I'll have the DNA question. I might pass off the coal question to Mark.","Jim Foote","You want to do DNA first.","Kevin Boone","Yes. On the depreciation like we did expect from the life study to have a little bit of uptick here in the fourth quarter which was offset by some smaller items so we basically netted out the zero. I did guide for 2020 and the 50 million to 60 million range incremental depreciation year-over-year. So we'll see some bump up from the life study and some incremental capital spend next year. That's the expectations. So no change at 2020 expectation there.","Mark Wallace","Amit on the coal side let me run through the coal environment and hopefully we can get to the your answer without me answering just specifically but starting with export as we've talked about before it's been a tale of two cities between met and thermal. As we guided through the year up to 2019 our expectations for export coal was it was around 40 million tons. We slightly missed that number coming in around 38 million. I tried to round it up to 39 and Kevin will allow me to so it had to be 38 but we now expect this year to deliver low 30s for 2020.","As I said we expect the declines both for met and thermal but probably larger for thermal than on the met side. On the thermal side again it's one third of our export shipments where we've seen largest volume declines given low natural gas prices and mild winters in Europe obviously impacting the coal demand there and the API to benchmark as we talked about a little bit earlier is 55 bucks per ton. So really low. On the met side again it mostly a price story not a volume story but a price story. I went back to my comment earlier the prices have continued to slide down to about a $150 per ton today. So that's kind of what we see on the export coal front.","Amit Mehrotra","Okay. That's very helpful and then just one follow-up for me. Kevin we saw, I guess a pretty sizable uptake in the labor for inch per employee I know there was you call that some acceleration incentives stock comp. So I just wondering what's the right way to think about that line item in 2020 because you have regular inflation but you guys have also been kind of focusing on managing overtime and with the volume environment being what it is there could be some cross currents there. So if you can just talk about that and if I missed it just help us think about how headcount will be at the end of 2020 as well. Thanks.","Kevin Boone","Yes. You talked about the incentive comp as a little bit headwind to that number when you calculated. The other thing that you have to remember in the fourth quarter is we have a lot of our capital teams particularly on the engineering side that go over into vacation and once a lot of their labor through the year is going towards capital but once they go on vacation it starts to hit ROE expense. So there is a bit of seasonality to our per employee cost and so that's what you saw there in the fourth quarter.","Amit Mehrotra","But it was a year-over-year number. It was up over 4% year-over-year?","Kevin Boone","Yes. I think some of that impact as well and then obviously the inflation that had set within that number. There's a little bit of mix as well but going on in the next year I wouldn't see any significant rise in our current employee cost. What was the other part of the question? ","Amit Mehrotra","Just the year-end headcount in 2020?","Kevin Boone","Yes. I think look we have a lot of momentum obviously that we've carried through the 2019 that will go into 2020. We'll continue to focus on managing attrition. There's a process here where we look at every job that comes available and ask ourselves given the model whether that job is necessary. So we'll continue to evaluate those. With the lower volume there's opportunities on the operating side that we'll find. So we'll continue to manage the labor side. It's not all about headcount. It's about the overtime which we saw some great success in fourth quarter. We have big targets next year to continue to drive the overtime down as well. So it's across the board on the labor savings.","Amit Mehrotra","Okay. All right. Thank you for the time gentlemen. Appreciate it.","Operator","Brian Ossenbeck from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Brian Ossenbeck","Hey thanks for taking my question. Mark, I want to ask you about the pricing environment especially given the softness here to start the year in rare volumes and the industrial economies mentioned. In last quarter you gave some indication of same store sales and how they were trending. So just given that the backdrop and what we're seeing on the rail industry is from a pricing perspective wanted to see what you thought was kind of the current market temperature when it came to price realizing you just commented on not gaining volume for price. So just what you see the market would be helpful. ","Mark Wallace","Yes. I was going to repeat that but we're not so but within merchandise and intermodal our same store sales pricing in Q4 was about in line with what we saw in Q3 which again was the strongest I think I said back then was the strongest we had seen in the past three years and our contract renewals the pricing on our contract renewals that came up in the quarter exceeded our same store sales pricing. So clearly the team is doing a great job to value the product for the service that we're offering to customers and we're pleased and I am pleased with the great work that the team is doing on the pricing side.","Brian Ossenbeck","And in terms of the inflation indices do you have a lot of exposure in the contracts they're just naturally reset lower in this coming year or is that not?","Mark Wallace","No, I mean on the thermal side those are annual contracts so they will reset sort of now on the met as I talked about earlier they retrace every quarter but clearly so that the met benchmarks being 140-ish or 150-ish h and $150 a ton in Q4 will sort of reset those contracts in Q1. So yes.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay. Thanks Mark.","Operator","Scott Group, Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Scott Group","Hey. Thanks. Afternoon. So I think you talked earlier about $300 million of operating profit headwinds. So I presume that's coal plus any of the discrete cost stuff. I just want to review that discrete cost thing. So I got real estate and depreciation but maybe Kevin can you just walk us through any of the other discrete costs headwinds that you see in 2020?","Kevin Boone","Yes, I think we obviously we called out the real estate sales this year and 2019 we\u2019ve realized roughly $160 million the guidance for that is $60 million which I talked about in my opening comments. The depreciation step up of $50 million to $60 million versus what we saw in 2019 are the items outside of coal that we've really kind of called out.","Scott Group","Anything on the other railway revenue or the other income that you want us to be thinking about?","Kevin Boone","Yes. I think where we run rating today is probably a consistent a good way to think about it going in the next year. So there will be a little bit headwind on the other revenue side as our customers, the merge cost stuff lowered gone down over the year. So we will have a little bit higher other revenue in the first half of the year and kind of normalized to where we are right now.","Scott Group","Okay. And then just lastly when we get back to revenue growth? What are the right incremental margin? Sounds like you're positioning yourself you said for incremental margins. Is that 50%, 60%, 40% how should we think about incremental margins when we get back to revenue growth?","Kevin Boone","Probably the best incremental margins that other businesses would be envy itself.","Mark Wallace","At some level you know it doesn't matter where the business comes but we have a lot of trains that have capacity. So obviously in those situations on the merchandise manifest business when we're adding up a car to the back of a train, existing train there's not a lot of cost you add to it, little bit of car hire a little bit of fuel but I think the incremental margins will be quite attractive.","Scott Group","Thank you guys.","Operator","Chris Wetherbee from Citigroup. Your line is open.","Chris Wetherbee","Hey thanks. Good afternoon. I want to ask about the revenue line. So if you take out the $300 million from coal that headwind sort of seems like you're guiding revenues kind of up a little bit to maybe up 2.5% or so and we know we have some headwinds from other revenue with some of the ancillary stuff from earlier in the year last year. How should we be thinking about maybe that cadence? Is it merchandise volume that improves as we go through the year in addition to intermodal volume? Maybe if you can help sort of bridge some of that gap because I would have thought mix might have been a bit negative too. So that any color would be helpful there.","Kevin Boone","Sure Chris. So we talked to we talked about coal being a significant headwind down sort of mid to double digits as Jim alluded to. In intermodal revenue we expect in 2020 we're going to return to a GDP plus environment as we lap our lane rationalizations and as I said many times our service product is strong with 95% plus [indiscernible] compliance. So I think a very good momentum there. On merchandise we exited 2019 a really well positioned to grow with a strong service product and I think even despite the tough environment and the tough comps year-over-year we can see a slight improvement revenue growth in the first half and with a stronger [technical difficulty] second half.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay. So maybe inherently ex coal volume up for the full year does that sound right? ","Kevin Boone","I would say that yes absolutely. ","Jim Foote","Again in the merchandise business segment if it hadn't been for the two specific items which I pointed out the refinery explosion and the GM strike we would have been close to flat this year in terms of volumes in merchandise which is significantly different than the rest of the industry and so we're reasonably positive as the business environment begins to at what point in time I don't know when that's going to happen. This is not the new norm. This is kind of a natural evolution. Things go down and then they go back up. When these things start to go back up we would expect to see merchandise volumes begin to increase and intermodal we have always said we believe we have a fantastic intermodal franchise. We have fantastic intermodal service and we had to bite the bullet over a two-year period to re-engineer the franchise to make it better as we go into 2020. We knew that's what we were doing and now we're going to see as Mark said hopefully a growth two times GDP.","So put those together and 80% of our business should be doing extremely well. Unfortunately, all four discrete segments of the coal business are getting hit simultaneously which is difficult for us to overcome.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay. That's very hopeful color. Appreciate the time. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next Bascome Majors from Susquehanna International. Your line is open.","Bascome Majors","Yes. Good evening guys. I wanted to go back to the service levels. You improved your trip plan performance in the car load business by 7 full points in this quarter. It had been pretty steady in the mid 70s before this gap hire. Can you dig a little more into how you're able to drive such a big improvement in 4Q if there's anything that's sustainable or something lumpy there and as you look forward is the conversation with your customers changing? Are you feeling that this yields excess car load business growth over some period of time? Can you just tell us how that's going on the ground? Thank you.","Jim Foote","I will start off with the product that we were able to create here and then let Mark touch on some of the feedback he's getting from the customers but look we've got a fantastic team of railroaders out there with CSX and we've gone through this transition over the past two and a half years almost three years and trip plans was a difficult piece for us to work on as a group.","And we tackled the first piece of intermodal which Mark had just mentioned the team has been knocking it out of the park over 95%. We still haven't achieved internally what we want to achieve for a trip plan on the merchandise side but it is day in and day out grinding, discussions, talking with the field working inside and out with each and every one of our operators in order to move up each percentage point. So we have I would like to say the most stringent trip plan with respect to a two-hour buffer and that's it. We measure empties which I don't believe any other railroad does and we work really hard hand-in-hand seven days a week driving that product.","So I would say that we're going to continue to see that percentage improve as we continue to prepare and get Mark's team ready to jump out there and make those sales.","Mark Wallace","And intermodal we measure to the minute.","Jamie Boychuk","Yes intermodal absolutely.","Mark Wallace","Within two hours. So if we missed by a minute, it's a trip plan failure. October 1, we rolled out trip plans. As Jim said in his opening remarks to our customers, on ship CSX in December, I think, on the 2, we rolled our trip plan performance out to all our merchandise customers, so they have total unprecedented visibility to every car whether it's a load, whether it's an empty on the CSX network. These are unprecedented visibility to their trip plans to what we're doing, how we're how we're doing in every lane, every car and customers love the tool, something they've never know railroad has ever provided this type of visibility. Listen, it's been having an impact.","I think going back to Jim's comments a few minutes ago if you look at our carload performance in Q4, we were down 3%; the industry was down 5%. If you take out the PES, the impact of PES refineries and the GM strike, we were flat in merchandise; rest of the industry down 5%. Clearly, customers are responding to that type of level of performance and rewarding us with their more of their business and we're winning share every day from trucks. And we're going to continue to push. And as this performance plus 83% for the quarter was great. We're hitting high 80s today and low 90s with some customers. And we're going to continue to -- I know, Jamie is not satisfied and team is not satisfied with that. So as we get better, continue to push and become more truck-like and provide great service. And we're going to be rewarded with more business.","Jamie Boychuk","The one piece to remember on trip plans for us, what Mark and his team has taken beyond what I think anyone ever thought trip plans were going to be. Trip plans are more of an internal metrics, so we can see how we were doing and look at costs as well as getting hour-by-hour across the network by putting this out to the customers, put the pressure definitely on the operating team, but guess what, we are hitting it. And look, we got a little bit more work to go, but we've taken this beyond what I think anyone ever thought trip plans could be.","Jamie Boychuk","The one piece to remember on trip plans for us what Mark has and his team has taken beyond what I think anyone ever thought trip plans are going to be trip plans are more of an internal metric. So we can see how we were doing and look at costs as well as getting hour by hour across a network by putting this out to the customers put the pressure definitely on the operating team but guess what we're hitting it and look we've got a little bit more work to go but we've taken this beyond what I think anyone ever thought trip plans could be. ","Jim Foote","And going from whatever the number was over the last couple of quarters, say, 75% to 85% in terms of the carload trip plan compliance. Two years ago that number was 35%. The reason we have to give our visibility and tracking mechanisms to our customers is so that they will trust us to try our new service product to prove to them that it is as reliable today as a truck. When a couple of years ago, your trip plan compliance was 35% and you were trying to get a customer to switch from moving his freight in a truck to rail, he didn't have a lot of confidence that the -- his freight was going to get to his customer on time when you're on-time performance was 35%. So that's why it's so important that we focus on this metric.","And then, we're so confident that this number would be reliable and consistent, but even more importantly, that customer believes that, that product is reliable and consistent. So he is willing to shift. He's always been willing to pay the 15% premium to buy the reliability in a truck. We need to show him through this transparent tool that he can trust us to get his product there when we said we're going to get it there.","Bascome Majors","Great. I appreciated the comprehensive answer from everyone. Thank you. ","Operator","Justin Long from Stephens. Your line is open. ","Justin Long","Thanks, and good afternoon. So I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color around what the guidance assumes for that quarterly cadence of consolidated volumes. Is it the right way to think about it that we should see something like a low- to-mid single-digit decline in the first half and then something like a low-single-digit growth number in the back half as the comps ease?","Mark Wallace","Yes. Clearly, we're lapping some -- going up against some tough comps here in the first quarter as I -- in the second quarter of the first half as I said. We had a pretty good environment in the first half of 2019. But we got a great service product. And we're going to do as much as we can. As I said, I think we're going to be able to do well in intermodal in the first half and in merchandise, hopefully, eke out some positive volume growth in merchandise. But we will, as we sort of get into the back half of the year, we think that it will be a little bit stronger than the first half for sure.","Jamie Boychuk","Yes. I think, Justin, you'll see throughout the year going first quarter will mark the low point from a growth perspective. That's probably across all of the -- not only revenue, but operating income, EPS across the board. And then from there -- and this is a lot of just based on the comps as we get in the back half of the year lapping some of the coal and some of the other headwinds that we saw in 2019, that growth should improve.","Justin Long","Okay. But when you put together all the pieces, do you think in the second half of this year, volumes can be up on a year-over-year basis, is that the assumption?","Jim Foote","Yes. ","Justin Long","Okay. Great. And then, secondly on free cash flow, obviously, that's a highlight of the business right now. So I wanted to ask in 2020 and beyond, what's the right framework in your mind to be thinking about for the free cash flow conversion percentage? And then, also on buybacks, Kevin, maybe you could provide a little color on the magnitude you're expecting in 2020 relative to what we saw last year?","Kevin Boone","Yes. Free cash flow conversion, our goal is to remain -- keep that high. We have some headwinds in terms of cash tax rate that will -- over time, that's going to trend higher. We're going to do everything we can on -- to offset that with working capital initiatives and really taking a look at our capital program and how efficient we can be on that side to save dollars there. So, a lot of opportunities. I don't think we have any plans to go back to the old ways of very low free cash flow conversion that we saw historically from not only CSX, but the industry. So we -- that's something we pride ourselves in. We continue to strive to maintain and have every plan to.","On the buyback, we are taking in $2 billion of cash, as I mentioned, end of the year. It gives us a tremendous amount of flexibility. There is no reason for us to retain $2 billion of cash on our balance sheet. So that allows us some flexibility going next year to be opportunistic when the markets present opportunities and we'll do that. We'll also look at the dividend as well. So we have a history of returning cash to shareholders, and we'll continue to do that.","Justin Long","Okay. Great. Thanks for the time.","Operator","David Vernon from Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open. ","David Vernon","Hey, Mark, I just wanted to dig in a little bit more on the expectation that intermodal is going to get better, it sounds like you were thinking in the front half we might start to see a return to growth. How are your intermodal partners kind of talking to you about the outlook for the business in terms of their ability to actually attract share? We're coming off a year where domestic intermodal is down, call it, whatever 5%, 6%. What's going to flip that switch that's going to get that volume to start coming back on to the network?","Mark Wallace","Yes. Let me split it up a little bit and talk both intermodal on the international side, on the domestic side. But the international business, it was down less than domestic. We're still continuing to see -- going into the early part of 2020 and hopefully, for the rest of the year, we're continuing to see good growth there on the international side with inland port strategy and some new service offerings with our customers. But the overall market remains soft. But we are doing well with picking up some business there.","I think -- listen again, customers are not responding to our repositioned network. It's moving faster and more reliably and more efficiently. And they like to service, and we're doing well to grow the intermodal franchise. And we're lapping those lane rationalizations, those are all behind us now and we're growing from that. So, again, we think -- given the environment and given the service product we got and we can grow this thing.","David Vernon","Okay. Maybe just as a follow-up, as you think about the improved service, obviously, some business is under contract. Is that going to give you a better leverage to kind of get some even better than sort of run rate pricing going forward, or should we be thinking about that as being kind of the standard and you're going to be using service more to drive growth than to really try to extract more value from the existing book?","Mark Wallace","Well, we attack it from all fronts, right. We're going to -- we've got long-term contracts with our customers, and there's rate escalators in there and we're going to -- but we're going to continue to grow with them and bring on more business and get price where we can get price. And again, we're not giving away our service. And so, we're going to attack it from all fronts.","David Vernon","All right. Thanks guys.","Operator","Cherilyn Radbourne from TD Securities. Your line is open.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Thanks very much. Good afternoon. Just wanted to ask a question in terms of performance evaluation, and how you differentiate between performance improvements that may be associated with lower traffic volumes on the network versus improvements that would be associated with sustainable process optimization that would remain once volume growth returns?","Kevin Boone","I think when we look at productivity, the way we measure it here internally, it is a lot easier to drive productivity and a growing volume environment because first, you got to -- in a declining market, you got to offset the decline in revenue before you even generate any productivity. So, the fact that we're able to offset the headwinds that we have talked about a lot on this call implies a lot of productivity this year, and there's a lot of smaller things that are adding up to big numbers across the board.","When I look at the overtime percentages and I look at a lot of different things, those aren't being driven by lower volumes. That's a lot of blocking and tackling, even at the D&A side, we're getting a lot more productivity out of our employees than we ever have. So, we measure productivity internally. It's certainly harder to -- it would -- if I can tell you right now, we would have realized a lot more productivity this year in an increasing volume market if that was the outlook for us.","Jim Foote","We can -- I mean, I -- we can look at the metrics and to Kevin's point, give me a growing environment, it's easier to run the railroad. Right now, we're in tough conditions to put up the numbers that we're putting. But ultimately, if you take a look at the metrics and where the metrics are sitting, how do you know that things are -- that we are improving even in the environment we're in, the cash is falling out. If we were hitting metrics and the cash wasn't falling out, then there'd be a point made, hey, it's easier and it's all because of volume base. But I think we've proven that, along with our metrics going in the right direction, the cash is falling out in the savings.","Kevin Boone","And many of these changes are transformational in nature and therefore, sustainable. We are not just kicking the can down the road. We are fundamentally in every respect changing the way we run this Company, and these changes that are resulting in these efficiency gains are to a large degree is going to stay with us as we go forward.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Okay. All of that makes sense. Maybe just by way of a quick follow-up, as operating ratios across the industry start to converge and maybe it's in the high-50s, what metrics do you think that investors should pivot to start focusing on to differentiate between the various franchises, whether it's ROIC, free cash flow conversion or some other metric?","Kevin Boone","Cash flow, we talk about it a lot around here, I think we're pretty proud of our cash flow conversion. It's not easy to both improve OR and generate a lot of cash flow, and I think we've proven that. So that's really the differentiator that we see out there. And as we shift longer term, we're here to drive operating income growth as well. So those are the two things that I think we'll be focused on.","Cherilyn Radbourne","That's all for me. Thank you. ","Operator","Jordan Alliger from Goldman. Your line is open.","Jordan Alliger","Yes. Hi, just a quick question. We talked a lot on the coal side about the export front, can you touch base a little bit on the domestic side, and how much of that $300 million top line headwind might be tied to that or is it really all on the export side? Thanks.","Mark Wallace","Yes. No. Sure. On the domestic side, there is some impact. I don't think it's going to be as much of a negative impact in 2020 as we've seen going forward. Net gas prices, unfortunately, have remained stubbornly low dropping to about $2 recently. But -- and we did not see the surge in prices that we saw in the fourth quarter of 2018. When they hit like $4 for a couple of weeks. But for core -- for utility coal to be competitive, prices would have to increase from the current levels.","And total electric demand would need to increase. Yes, as we all know in many locations, coal is used for peaking generation. And so, our upside is always seen or many cases seen when we have these extreme weather conditions and cold. Unfortunately, or fortunately, for the people on the call in the northern half of the country, you're not seeing a much cold weather, but that's bad for utility coal. So the natural gas capacity has not been stretched so far this year. But for 2020, we do see and we do expect that our utility tonnage will be relatively flat as we have had some wins, offsetting some market declines.","Jordan Alliger","And just a quick follow-up on the coal pricing, does domestic coal revenue per carload, I mean, does that stay positive or is it positive? I shouldn't say stay, I'm not sure that's the question.","Mark Wallace","There's going to be and they are on the domestic utility? ","Jordan Alliger","Yes.","Mark Wallace","Well, again, it will be down, just given where things are. Those contracts are multi-year contracts with our customers. But there are price adjustments. But we have minimums in the contracts with all these tied to them, but we do expect a little bit of pressure on coal -- on utility RPU.","Jordan Alliger","Great. Thank you very much.","Mark Wallace","No problem.","Operator","Ben Hartford from Baird. Your line is open.","Ben Hartford","Okay. Thanks for getting me in here. Kevin, just had a perspective as we move beyond 2020 and the model evolves one -- toward one of a growth focus as this operating plan takes hold, this 59% OR target here for the full year for 2020 and as Mark had said, we're near trough level, cycle trough levels for PMI ratings and industrial related activity. To what extent, do you view 59% or thereabout as a representative trough or a floor for this model's OR as we look ahead to the next decade or so? Why would not that be the case?","Kevin Boone","Why wouldn't 59% be the floor.","Ben Hartford","Why couldn't 59% be the cycle floor for dealing with trough levels of PMI readings and we're looking out toward growth? Why shouldn't this 59% OR or thereabout be viewed as a representative trough for a floor for this model's OR going forward?","Kevin Boone","You say floor, you're meaning that is -- why wouldn't it get better from here?","Ben Hartford","Correct. Yes. Can we treat this as a cycle trough, this 59%, the low point?","Kevin Boone","Well, I think as we look longer term and maybe Jim has some comments on this as well. We're really going to focus on growing operating income and generating EPS growth in the most effective way. We talked about the leverage we have we built in this model. So, we think, given everything that Jamie and his team have done that we can drop through revenue at a very high incremental margin, so that implies pretty good outcome on the margin side, but we'll have to think about what's the most effective way is to grow operating income and -- at a very high return.","So those are the things that I think as we get further out, we'll have to contemplate. But it's -- we have a better service. So clearly, getting price for service as we'll go after and -- but it's really operating income and cash flow that we'll be striving for in the next few years beyond 2020.","Jim Foote","Right at -- 42-or-so margins and as Kevin said, easier for that number as our -- for our margins to improve our operating ratio to go down with increasing volumes. Our long-term strategy is to continue to leverage our service, regain business that has been lost from the industry, while maintaining what I consider to be extremely good margins and grow our operating income, cash flow and earnings per share of the Company.","Ben Hartford","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Ravi Shankar from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ravi Shankar","Thanks. [indiscernible]. Just a quick one, again on coal, you said that you probably hit the worst-ever 1Q and then things kind of normalize from there if the benchmark stays where it is. Given your, the kind of, take-or-pay as you have on the volume side and kind of the way the contract reset. If the benchmark stays where it is for, let's say, the next three to five years or forever, is all of the coal impact going to be isolated in 2020 or is there like another leg to come in 2021?","Jim Foote","Oh my gosh Ravi. Coal benchmark stay here. That's not going to be happy. ","Ravi Shankar","Sorry, I'm making you do math at the end of the call.","Jim Foote","Yes. Listen, I'm in no position to speculate what's going to happen to coal internationally, whether it's thermal, met. I mean, again thermal is going to be driven internationally by the demand for coal -- agility coal in India and other places, Turkey, Pakistan, it's going down. It's -- in the next 10 years, it's probably not going to -- we're not going to be shipping anymore to Europe. And on the met side, again, it's industrial production worldwide. It's cyclical. These things...","Ravi Shankar","Right, right. I get that. I mean, I get that. We don't really have any visibility of where coal is going to go. But my point was, if it didn't change starting tomorrow, if it just stayed where it was, are your contracts all going to just lap and kind of completely reset in 2020 or is there more to come in 2021?","Jim Foote","Yes. No it would keep going. They would last.","Kevin Boone","There's not a contract that's going to expire in 2020, where there's another shoe to drop, so to speak on -- if the commodity -- underlying commodity prices to stay the same. I think what the volumes today represent is what the underlying commodity prices are at. So, all else equal, there is no long-term contracts within our export coal business that are set to expire after 2020.","Ravi Shankar","Got it. That's what I was getting at. Maybe just one more kind of, you guys implied that you're going to see a significant incremental margins when the volumes come back, that kind of implies that you haven't necessarily downsized your operations completely for the cyclical volume environment you're seeing right now. Maybe some of the other rails have. If volumes don't come back until the back half of next year, at what point do you guys say that, hey, maybe we can cut some more on the cost side here?","Kevin Boone","We watch this daily. It was kind of like, let's just kind of transition back six months ago when everybody was saying, man, in the second half of 2019, it's just going to be gangbusters, and we were saying, I don't see it. And we were responding accordingly and making the appropriate steps on the cost side to make sure that we delivered almost double-digit earnings growth this year in an extremely difficult environment, and we'll do the same this year as we go each and every month and assess where we are. And -- are the volumes better than or worse than what we expect them to be right now and we'll respond accordingly.","Ravi Shankar","Very good. Thank guys.","Operator","Walter Spracklin from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Walter Spracklin","Yes. Thanks very much. Thanks for sneaking me in here. I want to go back, Jim. You were talking a lot about the improvement in operating metrics that you had and how that's improving service and Mark is certainly echoing that. You mentioned about how you're using that to convince the truck customer to switch over. What evidence are you seeing that they are capitulating here and moving over, are they waiting for some other factor to consider? Is it -- or are you going to -- do you look at 2020 and see an opportunity for a notable share gain against truck coming up into 2020? Any thoughts on share gain opportunity against truck?","Kevin Boone","Yes. Well, let me touch it real briefly. It took us decades, it took the railroad industry decades of poor service to drive the business off the railroads onto the trucks. We are not going to get the business off to highway back on to the railroad in two weeks. So we're going to have to earn it. As we were talking about earlier, we're going to have to not only put up good metrics but prove to the customers that these metrics are as equal to a truck and that this business model is sustainable.","In the past, I'm sure they've had a lot of railroad guys that have walked in and said, hey, trust me take your business off to truck, put it on the railroad, I'll get it there on time. And the next thing six months later, it wasn't performing as well, and that customer lost business as a result of his conversion from truck to rail. He is skeptical and rightly so. We need to prove to that customer that this is a long-term, as I said, structural fundamental change in the way we do business.","And when we do that, we'll continue to see where we grow our merchandise and intermodal volumes at a rate that is faster than the industry. Is that going to be 1% greater than the industry? Is that going to be 1.5% greater than the industry? It isn't going to be 12% greater than the industry. It's going to be incremental quarter after quarter after quarter, year after year after year, where we have outsized growth relative to the industry that's going to prove this business model.","Walter Spracklin","Let me turn around and ask that same question now against your rail competitor. We've talked to a number of your customers, they've confirmed the service metric improvement. Jim, you've had experience of running -- working with a company that has had a significantly better operating ratio than its competitor. Is that an opportunity for share gain against rail if your operating metrics, as they have shown here, continue to improve and certainly, relative to the competitor, are we -- could we see a more notable upward shift in your share gain opportunity against your rail competitor?","Jim Foote","Well, I think it's different than -- our business environment here in the eastern half of the United States as I would say, is significantly different than the business environment in Canada. We have billions of dollars of opportunity available to us from truck. Customers today that are shipping products with us in a boxcar that are also shipping 50% to 60% of their product in a truck because the truck is more reliable. I want that opportunity, which is billions. It is crazy for me to go over there and price my service as a commodity that try and pick up a couple of million bucks of the other railroad. That's the business model that has run the railroad industry down for decades. And that is not the business model that we are pursuing.","Walter Spracklin","Got it. That makes a lot of sense. Appreciate the time.","Operator","Allison Poliniak from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Allison Poliniak","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my call and my question. Just wanted to talk, you made a lot of progress on the operations over the past few years. And you talked about the levers that you can pull in 2020. If you -- as you look at those, which ones do you feel could be the most challenging, particularly in this environment if there is anything?","Jim Foote","The levers are always challenging. As we said, if we wanted to just take -- and I've been saying this for the last six, eight -- we have been saying this for the last six, eight, 10 months or more. If the business had dropped off 10%, 12% in a couple of weeks in a traditional kind of recession scenario, it would have been easier for us to go in there and find the equivalent amount of costs and take it out of the Company.","When it was a slow drip week after week, month after month, a percent here, a percent in the half year and continue to down, down, down, down, down, it was more difficult for us to respond to that because we were fearful that we would -- and as we expressed again here today, we would cut service in areas where we were in an attempt to reduce cost, and we would perpetuate the downward trend by driving more business off the railroad and on to the highway. So that is a challenge, where can we cut and where can we maintain our levels of service. If the volumes continue to decline, it creates opportunities for us. And at some point in time, you just get a little more aggressive. We have not done that and -- but we have the ability, if it was necessary.","Allison Poliniak","Great. And then just trying to be optimistic, if we do get may be even more significant inflection in the back half. Just any of those levers sort of get moderated or pull in a little bit?","Kevin Boone","Boy, we're really -- we are optimistic. We like to think we're realistic. We are optimistic. We expect 80% of our business -- our merchandise business and our intermodal business to do quite well this year, especially as we said, in the second half of the year. If for no other reason, then we just get easier comps. And yes, if the business comes back, which clearly we hope it does, well, it's going to. Not a question, as I said, this is not the new norm. Business is going to come back. It is -- all of our businesses are cyclical. It's just a question of when does it come back. We're -- all we're saying is, as of right now, we're being a little more pessimistic about -- I don't expect all of a sudden volumes to jump up 5% in the -- on May 12. We're going to wait and see. We're going to be cautious. We're going to be vigilant in making -- and we have to do that in order to manage the Company. And if things come back, we'll be in a position to handle the volume and grow the business. Jamie?","Jamie Boychuk","Look, as Jim said, this isn't slash-and-burn exercise that we've been going through. It's controlling the costs. And on the operating side, we work very, very close with Mark and his team. As the business starts to come back, we're going to be prepared for it. We're going to be ready for it. We've got the assets. We make sure we have the people, and we don't leave alone behind. So this is purely being a controlling -- and look, we need to continue to control the cost because the businesses are coming back as quick as we may have thought it does, then we'll do that. But we will be prepared to grab every carload that starts to come toward us.","Allison Poliniak","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we have no further questions.","Jim Foote","All right. Great. If there's no further questions thank you so much for joining us today and I look forward to seeing you on the road at the next conference or on the next call. Thank you. ","A - Kevin Boone","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation in today's call. You may disconnect your lines."],"6373":["CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) Q2 2018 Earnings Conference Call July 17, 2018  4:30 PM ET","Executives","Kevin Boone - IR","Jim Foote - CEO","Frank Lonegro - CFO","Analysts","Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank","Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital","Tom Wadewitz - UBS","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","Brian Ossenbeck - JPMorgan","Matt Reustle - Goldman Sachs","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse","David Vernon - Sanford Bernstein","Justin Long - Stephens","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley","Benjamin Hartford - Robert W.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]","For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Boone, Chief Investor Relations Officer for CSX Corporation.","Kevin Boone","Thank you, Amber, and good afternoon, everyone. Today -- with me on today's call is Jim Foote, Chief Executive Officer; and Frank Lonegro, Chief Financial Officer. On slide 2 is our forward-looking disclosure, followed by our non-GAAP disclosure on slide 3.","With that, it is my pleasure to introduce President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Foote.","Jim Foote","Thank you, Kevin. Well, it\u2019s great to be with you this afternoon. Thank you all for joining our call. In order to get started, I guess, the first way to kick it off is, the press release that we put out says it all, record financial results. These results are due to the hard work of all CSX employees, who, I can tell you, are really excited about what has been accomplished. We will all celebrate a little bit tonight and then it's back to work tomorrow and continue to drive change to fully realize the potential of this company.","Before I turn to the slides, let me comment on a couple of key initiatives. First, safety. We intend to be the safest railroad. In May, our new Chief Safety Officer, Jim Schwichtenberg joined the company. Schwich comes to us with 20 years of railroad experience, including almost 10 years with the FRA. I'm confident that he can bring new approaches that will drive an improvement in our safety performance.","Also in May, we engaged DEKRA, a highly regarded expert in helping companies improve their safety performance. A comprehensive safety assessment is underway and I expect positive changes to materialize as a result. The entire organization is committed to being the best in safety.","Second, we recently announced the appointment of Mark Wallace as Executive Vice President, Sales and Marketing. I have known Mark for a long time and his ability to lead, combined with more than 20 years of scheduled railroading experience will allow our sales and marketing team to work more effectively with our customers and drive profitable growth.","Diana Sorfleet will take over most of Mark\u2019s former portfolio, assuming increased responsibility as Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer. Diana in her role at CSX\u2019s Chief Human Resources Officer has built a big -- has been a big part of our transformation by driving a more productive and engaged workforce. Her new responsibilities, which will now include technology and labor relations provide a significant opportunity to drive a more focused organization.","Now to get to the slide, let\u2019s turn to slide 5 and start with our results, two words I think sum up everything, great performance. Just like the first quarter, there's nothing unusual in these numbers. They're very straightforward. EPS increased 58% to $1.01 versus last year\u2019s adjusted EPS of $0.64. The new lower tax rate and lower share count, down 6% contributed to the significant year-over-year increase.","Our operating ratio improved 490 basis points to a record 58.6% compared to last year's adjusted OR of 63.5%, clearly the lowest ever for CSX and I believe the lowest ever by a US railroad. The significant year-over-year improvement in our results was driven by 6% top line growth, combined with price and lower costs, pretty much across the board with the exception of fuel. Revenue increased 6%, as price, fuel surcharge, supplemental revenues and a 2% increase in volume, all contributed to positive growth this quarter. Similar to recent trends, we did see slight improvement in pricing this quarter, excluding coal.","Quick look on the next slide on the business segments, each were -- which were positively impacted by higher fuel and price. In chemicals, strength in industrial products, plastics and crude by rail was partially offset by our fly ash losses, which we discussed last quarter. Auto saw strength based on North American US light truck production, which was up 5%. In Forest Products, lumber, panel, wallboard and paper products all increased in the quarter. In metals, shipments of sheet, steel and construction related field products drove increases. Fertilizer\u2019s revenues as I have mentioned previously were mainly lower due to the Plant City facility closure last year.","And in the coal markets, export coal remained very good during the quarter and showed healthy gains. Utility coal continued to weaken. On the intermodal side of the business, growth continued to come from the international markets with domestic relatively flat on a year-over-year basis because of the line rationalizations that we went through in the fall of 2017. Other revenue declined $58 million or declined due to a $58 million of liquidated damages, which was in last year's results, which did not repeat this year. Excluding that item, we saw gains in supplemental revenue, including demurrage. We continue to work with customers to create a more fluid network, especially as we approach the fall peak season.","On slide 7, let\u2019s take a quick look at some of the key operating metrics that this team is focused on. Train velocity increased year-over-year and on a sequential basis. Terminal dwell saw an 11% year-over-year and 7% sequential improvement. While we drove improved velocity in dwell, train length increased on both a year-over-year basis, 13% and sequentially, 5%. Let me tell you, improving all three of these metrics at the same time is no easy task. Finally, car miles per day showed low double digit improvement on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. This is a good measure of asset efficiency and our ability to effectively turn our assets. The improvements we saw in these metrics clearly translated into our financial results.","Now, let me hand it off to Frank who will go through the financials in more detail as well as the benefits of these operating improvements.","Frank Lonegro","Thank you, Jim and good afternoon, everyone. Turning to slide 9, I\u2019ll walk you through the summary income statement. Reported revenue was up 6% in the second quarter, driven by 2% more volume, higher fuel recoveries and solid core pricing gains across all major markets. Same store sales pricing, which reflects year-over-year increases for stable traffic improved sequentially in the second quarter.","Pricing for merchandising and intermodal contracts that renewed in the second quarter was strong, exceeding same store sales pricing growth. Other revenue was down year-over-year. Now, the benefit of higher demurrage and storage charges mostly offset the cycling of $58 million in liquidated damages from the prior year. Note that we now expect other revenue to remain in the $130 million to $140 million per quarter range for the remainder of the year.","Moving to expenses, total operating expenses were 8% lower in the second quarter or 2% lower after normalizing for last year's restructuring charge. Overall, labor and fringe savings of 82 million or 11% year-over-year were driven by an 11% reduction in average headcount. This smaller labor footprint spans both the operating and G&A departments. On the operating side, year-over-year improvements of 7% in velocity and 13% in train length drove more efficient use of our train crews and rolling stock.","Even with 2% volume growth, train and engine employee road starts were down 9%, while yard and local starts also fell 9%. And the level of recruits, a signal of network fluidity, dropped by 15%. Shifting to mechanical, the active locomotive count was down 13%, reflecting our ability to keep over 600 locomotives in storage, despite higher volumes. The smaller fleet along with great car repair efficiencies helped drive an 18% decrease in our mechanical craft workforce.","We recently aligned the engineering function to the regional structure we have for mechanical and transportation, which will also yield headcount and other efficiencies moving forward. Our G&A headcount continues to decline, as we look for every opportunity to absorb attrition. Over the past year, we have eliminated unnecessary layers of management, yielding a structure that is cost effective and enables rapid communication and decision making across our network.","MS&O expense was down 5% against the prior year. As you look at the year-over-year comparisons in MS&O, recall that we are cycling a $55 million gain from a favorable legal judgment in the second quarter of 2017. This year, results benefited from $37 million of real estate gains, as we continued to make headway in monetizing our surplus real estate portfolio. These gains are consistent with our guidance to achieve $300 million of cumulative real estate sales through 2020. From an operational perspective, many of the key drivers of labor expense favorability also yielded savings in MS&O in the quarter, as lower asset and resource levels helped drive down MS&O expense.","Material savings attributed to the smaller locomotive fleet were complemented by our decision to store units that are less reliable. The decisions we\u2019ve made around storage combined with additional fleet reliability efforts drove a 33% year-over-year improvement in our locomotive out of service measure and further reduced costs related to materials and contracted services. Looking at non-labor costs associated with our train crews, the reduction in road crew starts combined with better network fluidity yielded lower [indiscernible].","Additionally, MS&O continues to benefit from our efforts to streamline contractors and consultants, particularly in our technology department. Consistent with our prior guidance, we remain on track to reduce our total workforce by 2000 resources by the end of 2018. Looking at the other expense items, depreciation increased slightly as the benefit of asset sales mostly offset the impact of capital investments.","Yield expense was up primarily due to a 36% increase in the per gallon price that we were pleased to achieve record fuel efficiency in the quarter. We will continue to drive further fuel savings through continued improvement in network fluidity, train length increases and the use of fuel optimization technologies. Higher equipment rents expense is mainly attributed to volume growth. These volume related increases were partially offset by improving car cycle times across most markets.","Equity earnings were favorable due to improved performance at our affiliates in addition to a non-recurring benefit from an affiliate\u2019s property sale in the quarter. Given the recent strong performance, we now expect core equity earnings of affiliates of $20 million to $25 million in Q3 and Q4. Lastly, just as a reminder, we are cycling 2017\u2019s restructuring charges. Looking below the line, interest expense increased primarily due to the additional debt we issued earlier this year, partially offset by a lower weighted average coupon rate.","Tax expense was lower year-over-year, even with higher pretax earnings, given the benefits of the new lower corporate tax rate. Our effective tax rate was 23.3% in the quarter, slightly lower than our prior guidance, mainly due to a one-time benefit from state legislative changes. Going forward, absent one-time events, we expect our effective rate to be around 24.5% for the back half of the year. Moving now to P&L, as Jim highlighted in his opening remarks, CSX delivered record operating income of nearly $1.3 billion and record operating ratio of 58.6%.","Turning to the cash side of the equation on slide 10, year-to-date capital investments were lower by 14% and keep us on track for our three year $4.8 billion capital target. The reduced capital intensity of the scheduled railroading model, the substantial core earnings progress detailed on the prior slide and the benefits of tax reform helped drive a nearly $600 million increase in year-to-date adjusted free cash flow.","Significant improvements in free cash flow generation combined with higher leverage enabled us to nearly double our shareholder returns compared to the first half of 2017. We have now completed approximately $2 billion of the current $5 billion buyback authority and remain on pace to complete the program by the end of Q1 2019. As we stated at our investor conference, CSX will continue to evaluate cash deployment and shareholder returns on an annual basis.","In closing, I will reiterate the three key priorities that drive this management team on a daily basis, ensuring the safety of our employees and communities, delivering great service for our customers and appropriately rewarding our shareholders.","With that, let me turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks.","Jim Foote","Great. Thanks a lot, Frank. Turning to the last slide number 12, while we've achieved a lot in a very short period of time, we are far from where I believe we can go. As many of you know, we just rolled out our trip plan compliance a few months ago. We're in the early stages of driving improvement in this metric and there is significant opportunity there to get better. Trip plans are so important, as we think about delivering even better customer service and asset efficiency.","It allows us to track every car and container on our network and identify at a very discrete level where we may have a problem. This allows us to know why something happened, so we can react and more importantly, fix any problems so it does not repeat. I mentioned velocity and dwell earlier. Clearly, to be the best, we have more room to improve. Our train speed specifically, we have significant opportunity to improve as we remain below the industry leaders.","Our dwell is better than the industry average, but again there is significant runway for opportunity before we can call ourselves the best. Cars on line continue to be a focus of this team. We\u2019re in the business of moving cars and the more efficient we get, the less cars we need to move with the same -- to move the same volume. But turning cars faster, it also frees up capacity for us to take on additional business.","Finally, fuel efficiency. Diesel prices are up, so this becomes even more important. There are many ways to drive improvement in this area. [indiscernible] this quarter was $270 million in cost. So we're in the $1 billion run rate range for the full year. These are big dollars. For trip optimizer to distributed power, we will use all of these to drive improvement and lower cost.","Now, on revenue. We are raising our full year guidance from up slightly to up mid-single digits. At some investor conferences, I said we were trending to be a little better than where we thought we would be at that time of the year. This slightly higher outlook is a reflection of a number of factors, including our belief that export coal strength will continue, higher fuel prices will remain in a healthy economic backdrop. Obviously, there are factors we cannot control, mainly the economy that can provide some variability as we get into the back half and fourth quarter specifically. But this is how we see it today.","In closing, we have shown a relentless focus on executing our business model, but let me assure you we have an eye on the horizon to develop long-term sustainable growth. Our business practices are new to CSX employees, but are becoming part of our DNA, as we work hard every day with the goal of becoming the best run railroad in North America.","Thank you and I\u2019ll turn it back to Kevin.","Kevin Boone","All right. Thank you, Jim. In the interest of everyone\u2019s time today, I would ask that everybody limit themselves to one question and one short follow-up if needed. Operator, we will take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Amit Mehrotra.","Amit Mehrotra","Hey, thanks a lot. Congrats on the great results. Jim, the OR obviously in the second quarter is below the target that you set for 2020. I fully understand the nuances of seasonality and the risk around the macro. But would it be fair to characterize the 2020 target as conservative based on what the team has achieved so far? And if so, what do you feel maybe is a structural limit of where you can take that OR over that time period? Thanks.","Jim Foote","Well, over the time period, what we laid out just three months ago when I stood up there and said, we had a target of 60 in three years and I think everybody in that room kind of thought it was crazy that we'd never be able to get there. So -- and it's only \u2013 we\u2019re only two quarters in. So we're not -- clearly not changing our guidance here and what we think is achievable. And as I said, we have a lot, a lot of work to do and we got a lot of help this quarter from coal. So, if things continue to align, I continue to say I have confidence that we can hit a number, 60, which everybody I think thinks is extremely, extremely impressive. So there's no change in this short period of time from what we laid out just a quarter ago.","Amit Mehrotra","Right. Okay. And just kind of related to that as my follow up. Your comments at the end there with respect to where you are in implementing PSR and just a lot more room to go in terms of low hanging fruit on the cost side in particular, I would imagine, can you just talk about where PSR is not represented in the network today, I guess, some of the new initiatives that you're taking on specifically on the intermodal franchise in terms of implementing schedule railroading, that strategy on that particular business. If you can talk about some of the places where it's not represented and the opportunity there more concretely in terms of reductions in dwell time or things like that. That would be great.","Jim Foote","One answer, intermodal. Our intermodal network needs a ton of work in order to become the efficient part of our system that it needs to be and we're just really beginning to get in there and start to figure out how to rationalize that big part of our business, so we can become much more efficient and have a much better product for our customers.","Amit Mehrotra","And does that -- should we be watching origin dwell time yields in that business? I mean, how should we monitor looking outside in terms of your progress there?","Jim Foote","I mean, all of our \u2013 yeah, it will be reflected in all of our metrics. Again, our terminal dwells are pretty good. But we have a network franchise here that, to a large degree, is dysfunctional and it is the product for many, many, many, many years, CSX having a standalone intermodal entity. So we need to kind of go forward and reconfigure the franchise and make sure that it is properly and appropriately integrated into the rail company, so we can achieve the benefits of operating more effectively and efficiently.","So we are at very, very early stages, a lot of work to do in that area and every other area, as I said. Yeah. We had some great results and we did that. We don't have the highest velocity. We don't have the lowest dwells, so we have a lot of opportunity ahead of us to get EBITDA.","Amit Mehrotra","Yeah. Makes it seem just [indiscernible] so conservative. But I will \u2013 those are my two. So I will leave it there. Congrats again. I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch.","Ken Hoexter","Hey, great. Good afternoon and again congrats. It's a phenomenal job on the operating ratio so quickly. But Jim, I guess, on the on-time originations and arrivals, both are down year-over-year, but you noted the calculation has changed in the details, but the results were restated to conform. Why are they down, given the network improvement and how everything's accelerated on the network?","Jim Foote","We're pretty comfortable. Obviously, we'd like to be better on the originations. We depart our trains pretty close to on schedule. We don't get them across the network as effectively as we should. We depart, if we give ourselves, which we don't, but if you did from an accounting standpoint, give yourself a couple of hours of flexibility on either end, we depart 90% our trains to schedule and we get to destinations again with that two hour cushion over a three day operating period in the 80% range. That\u2019s unacceptable. You know what, that always comes up with -- for a number of different reasons. And so we need to just continue to be able to work to eliminate the causes of failures and that's why our trip plan compliance is in the kind of 60% range.","We need to get that up to 100% and when the trains fail to arrive on time, they miss their connections and therefore, we\u2019re off the trip plan. So all of those things need to improve. And a lot of it has to do with culture, where people recognize that there's going to be a failure and they go above and beyond the call of duty to make sure that we get the box that makes the connection on the next train. As I said many times, what does a UPS employee do when he sees that a box is not going to get in the truck, he runs behind the truck down the road and makes sure that he gets the box on the truck. Our guys are going to wait for the train, see you later and the car runs a day later. So, it's culture and it's all kinds of changes that we need to take place in order to get better.","Ken Hoexter","Wonderful. Thank you. And if I can get the follow-up on pricing. Frank, you mentioned that pricing accelerated on a pure pricing basis. Are there levels you can talk to, especially given how tight the truck market is? Can you be any more specific in terms of, are you seeing it growing, it, going 100 basis -- 200 basis points up on a sequential year-over-year basis from where you were.","Frank Lonegro","Yeah. Ken, I think you probably know the answer to that question. I think what we're trying to help you understand is the environment is a strong environment and that's why we're seeing the contract renewals coming higher than the same store sales pricing. I think the last public number we have out there is in the Q3 of 2017, at 2.2% for merchandising intermodal. What we can say is that we have seen sequential improvement every quarter since then in same store sales and the discretionary renewals in Q1 were better than that and the discretionary renewals in Q2 were better than that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays Capital.","Brandon Oglenski","I don't know if Mark is on the call, but I guess for Jim or Mark, it seems the improvement here is coming maybe a bit faster as the first two questions kind of alluded to. I mean, does this in any way change your philosophy on the revenue outlook? I think at the Analyst Day, you were seeing, look, maybe, we'll get a little bit of growth in \u201918, but obviously you're seeing a bit more now. Does that -- because of the changes you made in the network, is the market that much stronger and now with a lower cost base, does that change the dynamic on focusing between price and volume at all.","Jim Foote","As I said at the Investor Day and as I said basically ever since I\u2019ve been here, number one, I don't differentiate in the implementation of scheduled railroading that you ignore your customer and don't focus on growing the top line, as you implement your operational changes. You do that at the same time. So -- and we have been working to improve the quality of our service and work with our customers to grow our business throughout the last six months and with I would say pretty favorable results and responses from our customers.","They went from -- when I showed up here to hating me to now on occasion even buying me a drink. So we made great improvements in our customer relationships. And so, but I don't see a differentiation here. I also don't look at this as oh, you\u2019re a price leader or a price taker. We\u2019re focused on volume, we\u2019re focused on price.","We're focused on growing our business with long-term sustainable, profitable business that people recognize that we have differentiated ourselves in the marketplace, we have a better product to sell to our customers and our customers recognize that by working with us and paying us more, because we're a better quality product, they can save money in their business. That\u2019s our strategy, that\u2019s our strategy to grow the business and that has been our strategy since day one and will continue into the future.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Tom Wadewitz of UBS.","Tom Wadewitz","Yeah. Good afternoon and great results. I'm sure everybody is going to refer to that, but they\u2019re obviously very impressive. Let\u2019s see. What do you think about OR in second half? I mean, you\u2019re sub-60 in second quarter, it probably implies numbers ought to go up in the second half. Is it pretty reasonable to think sub 60 in second half as well or is there anything in terms of maybe no incentive comp, is it a tailwind, that would be a headwind or anything else we ought to consider when we think about second half OR relative to the really strong results in second quarter?","Jim Foote","Sure, Tom. From a seasonality standpoint, the second quarter for CSX is always the best. So one would assume that that's going to always be the best this year too. Going forward into the second half of the year, number one, the way we account for our vacations, we have a disproportionate amount of labor expense associated with vacations in the second half of the year. We have a 3% wage increase, around 3% wage increase in the second half of the year.","So, those are headwinds that we have planned for and have expected all along. And then, the most reliable variable is the weather here in the fourth quarter, which is a new phenomenon for me and Mark, where you've got a hurricane in Florida and the Gulf, while you're worrying about freezing rain in Atlanta and snow in Chicago and along Lake Erie. So we always seem to have weather that makes it more difficult for us to operate in the third quarter and fourth, I mean it\u2019s fourth quarter. So those are the kind of things that we look at and say, it is totally rational and what we believe to be the case that our expenses in the third and fourth quarter will be higher than the second. I can tell you that they will be lower than they were last year, how about that?","Tom Wadewitz","Sure. That's fair. I appreciate the color on that. Let me ask you also, you made a comment on the intermodal network. Seems to imply you might simplify it further. I don't know if that\u2019s accurate or not, but how do you think about the potential changes to get the intermodal network right? Is that simplifying the flow, fewer touches, and what might be the timing for that? Is that something that you can do pretty quickly or is that something you need to kind of plan and execute over multiple quarters and maybe you see that result in 2019?","Jim Foote","I think as I said earlier Tom, we\u2019re just starting to really peel this back and understand what changes we need to make. Obviously, last year, I mean it was well talked about. [indiscernible] changed the philosophy and got rid of the hub and spoke, that was about 7% of the volume that was taken off the revenue, taken off the railroad. And at that point in time, it was my belief that a large part of that rationalization of intermodal has been accomplished, well, that's not the case. So -- but we're going to take it very methodically.","We are going to have very good and open communication with our customers about what it is we're trying to accomplish and it involves train design changes, it involves terminals and terminal -- potential terminal consolidations. And we will do this very methodically and logically and appropriately and do it, being fully aware of the fact that we are looking at a peak season this year, which everybody is indicating us is going to be very strong. So we're not going to do anything that's going to screw up the railroads. So if it takes a little longer, then a quarter or two, I\u2019m fine with that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup.","Chris Wetherbee","Wanted to touch a little bit on sort of the revenue and volume outlooks. You\u2019re taking the revenue numbers up. I think, some of that is driven by what you're seeing on the other line, but how do you think about the sort of volume outlook and maybe sort of queuing up the competitive environment. You brought the OR down arguably a lot faster than most of us had expected. Did that open up new opportunities? Do you see some of that in the second half? How do you kind of think about those opportunities going forward?","Jim Foote","I believe that the operating ratio is a reflection of the efficiency of our service, which in my mind, means that we continually improve the product that we offer to our customers. We are not working diligently to drive down the operating ratio, so that we can be the price leader in the marketplace. So I think as I said last time, we don't get stickers and bonus points for volume. And therefore, to the extent that we can sell our product as a superior product in the marketplace, we fully intend to do that.","Clearly, we have as much flexibility as we want to, if there are unique opportunities in the marketplace, where a customer to us is not interested in quality of service, but is only interested in price and it makes sense for us, being the low cost provider, to pursue that business, we can do that too. So we have all the flexibility in the world to pursue whatever business segments we want. Our principal objective here is to be a better run network that has a differentiated service product in the marketplace that demands a higher price for that and we can grow business at the extent of truck, which we already know the customer is paying 15% to 20% more for, so why discount your better quality product when you know you can go, save the customer money by having a service that\u2019s more truck like.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay. I guess it sounds like there might be an opportunity there on the volume side, that's helpful. And then getting a little bit more specifically, you think about export coal as you look out into the back half of the year, I know this is the tough commodity to predict, but you\u2019ve given us some help in the past and you don\u2019t expect any changes to sort of that high 30 million ton number that we\u2019ve talked about for 2018 as we look out into the second half?","Jim Foote","Yeah. On the second half, I mean, clearly, one of the reasons that we have talked now about higher volume is because export coal has been better in the first half of the year and appears that it will be better in the second half -- slightly better in the second half of the year than what we originally expected. Frank, maybe you have some further comment on that.","Frank Lonegro","Yes. So we were at about 22 million tons in the first half. If the framework holds as Jim mentioned in his opening remarks and we see the indices hold at 200 and 100 or higher on the met and the thermal index, you can see that same run rate prevail in the second half. So early to mid-40s would be probably a decent range for it.","Operator","And next, we\u2019ll go to Scott Group of Wolfe Research.","Scott Group","So wanted to follow up on the intermodal and what you've been talking about. Jim, maybe give us some perspective, where is this OR relative to the rest of the business, are we 1000 basis points behind, maybe 2000 basis points behind, if you can maybe directionally give us some color there? And once you've got it all optimized the way you want to, how close do you think intermodal margins can be to the rest of the business.","Jim Foote","Well, as I think I tried to portray, we have a lot of areas in intermodal where we can make improvements. And we don't describe the various business segments in great detail in terms of what's more profitable than the other, even around this business moving up, which ones are. I can tell you when we did this, when I did this at CN, and we got involved and did the same thing at GM, we fixed the merchandise business and then we went over and started it and then we went over and started fixing the intermodal. And intermodal at GM was a basket case. When we were done fixing it over a couple of year period, the average profitability of our intermodal business there was better than the corporate average. So we\u2019ve got a ton of work to do and I couldn't be happier that Mark is here to do it. So -- and we'll just keep updating you, but it's going to be slow, it\u2019s going to be gradual and it's going to be a good process that works for our customers as well.","Scott Group","And then just real quick, some number questions. The raise in the other revenue guidance, is that because customers are not changing behavior or you're rolling it out to more customers and then do you have any way to \u2013 70 million of real estate in the first half, any way to put a range on what you think is realistic for second half?","Frank Lonegro","Hey, Scott. On other revenue, I\u2019d say it's two things. One, the behavioral changes that we're looking for obviously through the increases in the rates of the reduction of free days, it just isn't happening as quickly as maybe we thought it was three months ago, it was going two, three months ago. So that's, I think, the answer on that, we did roll out some additional policies effective July 1, so that then bleeds into the run rate there.","On the real estate side, yeah, you're right, we had about 70 million in the first half. So we had a good first quarter, a good second quarter. You all probably saw a line sale that was announced with OmniTRAX a couple of weeks ago. That combined with some smaller transactions that we may close in the third quarter, I\u2019d say will have a good third quarter, not unlike what we saw in Q1 and Q2.","Operator","And we will go to Brian Ossenbeck of JPMorgan.","Brian Ossenbeck","So wanted to talk about the domestic coal side for just a bit. I would say, the volumes or challenges remain a challenge for the first half of the year. Are you seeing anything from structural competition from new gas fired power plants, gas pipelines going further down south, especially into Florida and do you still have confidence that there's going to be no material retirements of coal fired plants this year or through the next couple of years through 2020.","Frank Lonegro","Hey, Brian, it\u2019s Frank. I think the utility story has largely stayed the same. Nat gas is 275-ish, which isn't all that helpful to the environment, though stockpiles in the south have come down pretty significantly, the cooling degree days are up year-over-year. We're just not seeing the burn rates go up in coal quite yet, but a lengthy autumn and a cold winter will certainly help those. In terms of your structural competition, again, we don't know of any plant closures that are going to impact us significantly in the next couple of years that are new. Clearly, we have a couple that are going to roll off. We knew about those, we've adjusted our outlooks for those, but nothing new.","Brian Ossenbeck","Could you give us a quick update on the lease and license? I guess the wires and pipes, the other ancillary revenues, are those things that you're starting to be able to monetize it or is that something that will start to pick up in the back half or 2019? Thank you.","Frank Lonegro","Brian, both. We\u2019ve had an ongoing business of licenses and leases that utilize or cross over the quarter. Mark and his team have been increasing those over time and will continue to deliver and are on track to deliver the $300 million guidance that we gave you at the Investor Conference over three years.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Reustle of Goldman Sachs.","Matt Reustle","You're obviously ahead of schedule on the network improvement and that\u2019s boosted the 2018 revenue outlook. Does that also raise the potential for revenue in \u201919 and \u201920 and I guess the real question is, does your 4% revenue CAGR target increase beyond the 2018 bump that you're guiding to now.","Jim Foote","I would say, at this point in time, no, for the two principal reason that I talked about. One is one of the most significant reasons that we're looking at higher -- have looked at higher volume and revenue in the first half of the year was export coal and one of the principal reasons we're talking about being more optimistic for the second half is because of export coal. And I don't know at this point in time that anybody could tell you what the future is beyond December 31 of \u201918, what export coal is going to do. So it's a little premature for us to start saying that that's going on.","And at the second time, I am at -- because we are in the early stages of this network reconfiguration in Intermodal, I don't know what implications that might have on revenue growth in Intermodal at this time. So I\u2019ll just have to stick with, hey, here's what we, where we are today, what we think the rest of this year looks like in terms of being mid-single digits and for now, we\u2019re in the same mode, looking at \u201919 and \u201920, about where we were three months ago. Three years ago, but it was only three months ago.","Matt Reustle","And the second question, just still early days on trade and tariffs, but can you talk about high level, where you see your business sensitive, are you hearing or seeing anything from your customers in terms of talking about adjustments relative to the tariffs, any color on that is helpful?","Jim Foote","Well, again, there's so much noise swirling around about tariffs. In terms of the specific impacts on CSX today from any kind of tariff activity, clearly, first, was steel. And from a steel standpoint, both finished steel out and\/or business in, we have seen some positive as a result of the US steel manufacturers kicking up production.","The second area where there have been some real activities involved export soybeans. Our export grain business in total is around 30 million bucks. About a third of that is soybeans. And so in the grand scheme of things, in terms of soybeans going to China, it's really not a factor at all for us.","And then the third area which again has not had any real activity, but again a lot of noise about it is both NAFTA and Europe in terms of tariffs on imported autos, we are not impacted in terms of imported autos from Mexico. We would clearly watch carefully, if anything were to be put on imported vehicles from Canada. But nothing has happened there yet and in terms of European imports coming in through the East Coast ports, normally, they don't touch rail anyway. So not much of an impact at all right now and our customers continue, despite the fact again that there is much discussion that this could lead to an economic downturn, our customers seem to be -- continue to be very optimistic about the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from Allison Landry of Credit Suisse.","Allison Landry","Maybe that was a good segue into my somewhat pessimistic question, but how are you thinking about CSX\u2019s ability to turn what have historically been fixed costs into variable costs in a downturn? And is the network at a point where if volumes dried up tomorrow, you'd still be able to generate significant OR improvement.","Jim Foote","Well, that is pessimistic. And it\u2019s such a big occasion for us here, but I'll try to deal with that and it's not something that Frank and I don\u2019t talk about on a regular basis here. Having myself been through with a couple of times, but all of a sudden, yeah, your volumes just go away. And again, because of all the speculation just in the media about tariffs and trade wars and what could that, so we\u2019re always doing recession scenarios here about what if this and what if that. Clearly, as we get better and as we get a better handle on our operations, we will be able to more quickly respond and make appropriate adjustments to our variable costs in the event of volume declines.","And you obviously have the wherewithal at your fingertips to reduce your fixed costs to a degree, meaning fixed labor. It's just how much you need to do in order to do that. Depending upon what kind of economic decline scenario you came up with, I guess my thoughts are, if we, again assuming a severe decline, if we were able to maintain our plan and they're at least the status quo, we would be able to be -- we would be doing a very good job. If it's a minor thing, then it\u2019s probably a minor thing and continue to stick with the program and see what we could do to make our numbers.","Allison Landry","And then as my follow up, if you think about the disparity between your service metrics and your competitor and within the context of your earlier comments about pricing for a better service product, do you expect to pull the growth lever perhaps earlier than what we saw at CPE and OCN?","Jim Foote","Again, we never push the growth lever the other direction. We are always in the growth mode. It was \u2013 and again to a lot of this, I wasn't present here, but many people that work here, Frank were, it was tough to grow when your railroad wasn\u2019t running in product and cars that should have been across your network in three to four days, we're taking three to four weeks. So that's difficult to say I'm in a growth mode at that period of time. Once the service is improved and where the service is today, we're always looking to get business from -- more business from current customers, business back from the former customers, all of that and \u2013 but it is \u2013 again, it is our philosophy that we want to be the premium service provider in the marketplace and get paid for.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Vernon of Sanford Bernstein.","David Vernon","Jim or Frank, could you help us -- you mentioned earlier in the call that coal helped you out a little bit here in the quarter. Is there any way you can help us to mention how much coal has contributed to the year-over-year sort of profit development in the company in the first half of this year? What I'm just wondering is how much of the very, very aggressive improvement in operating income due to chalk up to kind of PSR versus how much of it would you chalk up to help from the commodity markets.","Frank Lonegro","Obviously, it\u2019s helped from a lot of different areas, precision railroad is clearly one. When you look at the levels of efficiencies that you're seeing, the headcount reductions that you're seeing, the asset reductions that you're seeing, those producers build dollars and significant dollars. If you look at the point that Jim made around export coal, just to dimensionalize it, we moved a little over 11 million tons in the second quarter of this year. And last year, moved a little over 8 million tons. So you can get a feel for the uptick in export coal. At the same time, we saw some reduction in utility coals. You got to net those two things out, they\u2019re both good pieces of business for us. We want to move them both, but there's a whole lot more that\u2019s happening in our company other than coal.","David Vernon","I totally agree with that. And -- but I guess I was just wondering if there was maybe an indication you can give us for directionally how much export coal rates have moved up on a year-over-year basis in relation to domestic coal rates?","Frank Lonegro","We generally follow the indices. We don't follow on one for one. So when you see them, you see the forward curves move up. Generally speaking, our pricing is going to follow that -- again that one to one. The highs on the benchmarks are going to be higher than our price. And the lows on the benchmark are going to be lower than our price, but we generally are going to follow those. When you look at it on our view basis, you can get a feel for what the export RPU is and what the domestic RPU is. There are times when the exports are higher. There are times when the domestics are higher. But it\u2019s really going to depend on what those external benchmarks are. But again, there's a lot more happening here and I don\u2019t want you to lose sight of that by focusing on coal.","David Vernon","Yeah. Absolutely not I\u2019m losing sight on, I'm just trying to get you to tell us what happened to the export coal RPU? We\u2019re not going to do. So maybe \u2013","Jim Foote","You\u2019re going to get that for me and I\u2019m going to get that for Frank.","David Vernon","Let me ask a quick follow-up question, Frank. When you think about the gains you had at MS&O from idling some of the spare locomotives, is there a chunk of that that maybe snaps back as you start to run a little bit hotter and leaner or is it all just pure kind of run -- you should run rate these levels on the cost side going forward.","Frank Lonegro","Remember, you got real data in that line item. So be careful not run rating real estate on that basis. I\u2019ll try to give you some detail on Q3. But when you look at what we're doing, the smaller locomotive fleet is clearly a driver. You\u2019ve got contractor and consultant eliminations, which are rolling through that line. You\u2019ve got -- as I mentioned in my opening remarks, less hotel and taxi costs. You\u2019ve got G&A. Fewer people obviously spend less money on the MS&O line, so as long as you\u2019re seeing those things stay the same, excluding the real estate piece, I think you can run rate those.","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Long of Stephens.","Justin Long","Wanted to start and ask about headcount. Do you have any updated thoughts on where headcount will end this year? Just curious if your expectations have changed? And based on how the network has performed during the first half of 2018 and what seems to be a better than expected start as it relates to volumes, is there any change to the expectation for headcount that you're targeting in 2020 as well.","Jim Foote","No. In terms of this year, again, we're slightly ahead of where we -- the run rate to get to the 2000 reduction, but that was planned for as I said earlier because of vacations and other purposes that we would have an accelerated pace in the first year of the year. So we're right on target to hit the number for this year and nothing has changed in terms of the number for the three year plan.","Justin Long","And maybe to circle back on the increased revenue guidance for 2018 as well, is there a way to help us think about how you would allocate this increase between one, a better outlook for export coal and two, a better outlook for everything out? I'm just curious if that split is 75%, 25% or how you would quantify that.","Jim Foote","Without getting into the specific volume details by the various commodity groups, I\u2019m trying to come up with a more simplistic way to answer that. I think if you look at our coal business in the second quarter and I think that's a relatively good run rate. Again, we had a great -- we just got to tell you, we had a great second quarter with strong export demand and weak utility demand. That's kind of a norm for us for this year and -- but we expect that kind of run rate to continue in the second half of the year.","So I\u2019ll now give you some guidance in terms of volume from coal. And the rest of it is going to come primarily from merchandise, which is again across the board, all of these various commodities that I talked about metal, forest products, blah, blah, blah, were all relatively strong in the second quarter. That's just a reflection of good markets and customers recognizing that we've got a good service product. And so that's kind of, I would say, that that will give you a better run rate view of what we think the top line is going to do.","And then as both Frank and I mentioned, you\u2019d layer in continued reasonable pricing environment, continued recognition of supplemental revenues from the demurrage policies that we are now -- policies that were in existence for many, many years, but now, we're collecting on. And then thirdly, a little bit more fuel surcharge because for instance, fuel is going to get up and I think the second quarter will give you a pretty good understanding of why we think that the second half of the year is going to be a little bit better than what we originally expected.","Second quarter was a little bit better than we expected, kind of started talking about that earlier in the quarter when I said we're going to be a touch better and then now, we came in with 6% growth. And so if things stay the way they are right now, I think that leads us down the road of giving you a pretty good way to get to a general view of how you get to mid-single digit top line growth for the year.","Operator","And our next question comes from Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital.","Walter Spracklin","I want to come back, Jim, to your answer to a previous question with regards to exactly that the trends you've been noting in the back half of the year have picked up. And I think what you said in the last -- just now is that it wasn't all just due to coal. There was other factors due to better pricing and better volume in other areas. I'm just curious as to why that wouldn\u2019t change your view into 2019. Why would it all stop as of December 31? Wouldn't there be a carryover in the first half of next year, even if commissions remain that will lap easier comps that would give you a bit of better lift into next year? Just curious as to why you wouldn't expect it to continue more than just six months.","Jim Foote","For the two reasons, I said. One, I don't have a clue what coal is going to be like in \u201919 and \u201820. And I don't know what the implications are to our intermodal franchise by some of the work we have to do there. So those \u2013 the uncertainties surrounding those two big components of my business give me pause to say that out of the new norm for \u201919 and \u201920, I need to get a little bit further down the road this year to have a better -- more -- a clearer view of the year after.","Walter Spracklin","Okay. And just on the pricing environment, can you talk to us a bit about kind of the cadence in the negotiations you have now versus one month ago, versus three months ago, versus six months ago, particularly where trucking comes into play on your intermodal franchise or where you come head-to-head with your competitor? Are you finding that is there any capacity constraints that are allowing for the movement of price to come in a little bit, not easy, but easier than it might have one, three or six months ago?","Jim Foote","Well, six months ago, we had our \u2013 and telling everybody how sorry we were for not running a very good railroad. So the environment for us right now compared to where we were at the end of last year is dramatically different. In terms of the pricing environment and the capacity environment, it's a good time to be in the railroad business. It's a good time to be in transportation business, it\u2019s no secret that the pricing environment is strong for everybody. As I said, and again, but as I said earlier, we are in this to grow the top line through long-term, sustainable, profitable growth. I don't play in the stock market. I'm not worried about volume. I\u2019m not worried about timing to rail, awards that kind of stuff. Long-term, sustainable profitable growth where we provide value to our customers and our channel partners and everybody in the marketplace is our strategy and that is what's going to make CSX the best.","Walter Spracklin","If I could sneak one last one here in terms of when you sit down with Mark now in his new role, what do you guys talk about as your kind of objective. Number one, I think you alluded to is it the Intermodal franchise or is there something else that you want to kind of zero in on as his number one objective as he starts the role?","Jim Foote","One of Mark\u2019s strengths and one of the reasons I'm so excited about Mark taking over the job besides the fact that he\u2019s a really bright guy, he\u2019s got great relationship skills and we need to develop long-term solid relationships with our customers. There has been a lot of turnover here at the senior management of this company. We hear this all the time. We don't know who to call, we don't know who you guys are. You got to hold the team there, what am I supposed to do, who do I call if something goes wrong.","So number one, fix intermodal, but two, start build back the long-term relationship that CSX should have and I\u2019m totally confident that Mark's going to do an exceptional job in that area. Not to say that the guy that runs our merchandise group, Michael Rutherford and his team are doing a phenomenal job in that area. But again, I know Mark and I\u2019ve been around for a long time and I think that's where he can do some great work for us.","Operator","And next, we\u2019ll go to Ravi Shanker, Morgan Stanley.","Q - Ravi Shanker","A couple of follow-ups here. Just on the Intermodal and your comments on the tons of work you still need there and eventually getting that up to an above average margin profile. Can you just help us understand how much of that is fairly basic blocking and tackling that can be achieved pretty easily versus maybe bigger, longer-term initiatives like yard automation or something.","Jim Foote","This is blocking and tackling. This is just running a good railroad. I'd like to be in a position where we will run it so well that we could start to look at ways to adopt new technologies to help us run things better. We\u2019re long ways from that. This is just basic core \u2013 fixed, bunch of broken windows.","Ravi Shanker","And just a follow up, when you think of auto as an end market, is that primarily in your autos volumes or do you also have smaller auto components or something running through intermodal?","Jim Foote","We have auto parts. We have auto parts in our intermodal. Basically, imported parts. And we have auto parts in large cars and merchandise service. Racks, frames, et cetera. But the primary volumes are in finished vehicles that are moving in tri levels and bi levels.","Ravi Shanker","Is there any way to quantify your overall auto\u2019s exposure in terms of volumes kind of combined across segments?","Jim Foote","We could -- not off the top of my head, but if you give dates with Kevin, we can see if we can try to come up with some way for you to \u2013 some percentage. For every vehicle, how much moves kind of a general percentage. For every finished vehicle, what the percentage of a car kind of a thing, we might be able to come up with something that gives you guidance on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Benjamin Hartford of Robert W. Baird.","Benjamin Hartford","Real quick, Jim. What are -- in the context of intermodal and the work that needs to be done there, as you think about the back half of \u201918 and through \u201919, whatever the plan may end up being in terms of volume growth, what do you think the box count needs within UMAX specifically are going to be to support growth. Will it grow in line with volumes or is there enough opportunity as you work through that network and improve velocity that -- perhaps that fleet size does not need to grow to be able to satisfy volume growth targets.","Jim Foote","Yeah. Under the current scenario, I don\u2019t anticipate us making any investment in boxes for UMAX.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bascome Majors of Susquehanna International.","Bascome Majors","Frank, years ago, in the prior regime, you guys used to make some directional comments around the profitability of different commodity groups. I know putting hard numbers to that was declined earlier on this call, but I am curious with the overall profitability of the franchise, moving up 12, 13 points in less than two years here, has the directional sort of contribution of the various revenue groups that you do, has that changed dramatically? I\u2019m just curious if we're kind of in a new game as to versus the historic playbook of what's the best business for you and what's not?","Frank Lonegro","So Bascome, a rising tide lifts all boats clearly. In a good pricing environment and a good efficiency environment, you're going to expand your margins. When we look at the profitability, I could show you intermodal moves that are at the top, and I could show you coal moves that are more towards the bottom and merchandise runs at the same spectrum. So, we\u2019ve got a good portfolio of business. Obviously, when you see a 58.6 operating ratio across, that portfolio must be pretty good and we\u2019re going to continue to optimize it and drive that long-term profitable growth that Jim mentioned.","Operator","And next question comes from Cherilyn Radbourne of TD Securities.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Just wondering if you could speak to some of the mixed dynamics in the quarter. RTM is up 7% versus 2%, carload growth would suggest a pretty big shift. So maybe you could just give us some color there.","Jim Foote","Ton miles up 7. Frank?","Frank Lonegro","Yeah. So I think what you're seeing is, when we did some of the network changes last year, as we closed terminals, et cetera, we probably introduced some auto rack miles and we're now pulling those down pretty significantly. Ed and his team are working on that. I think you'll see that continue to come down and that disparity that you mentioned I think will get a lot closer as we go forward.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Okay. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on the whole intermodal discussion. As you continue to reposition that network, do you continue to be able to leverage the benefits of a hot trucking market from a volume and a pricing standpoint?","Jim Foote","A good time to be in the railroad business and it\u2019s even a better time to be in the railroad intermodal business. So, yes. Just take a look at it, as I said earlier, we took 7% of our business off the network last year and we're flat today. So people are looking for capacity. We want to be able to provide that service and capacity to our customers.","We just want to make sure that we have a rational footprint of an intermodal network, when we are going into the marketplace and selling a product to our customers and that's just going to take us sometime to straighten that out and then we are going to be back there, doing whatever we can to help out the -- again our channel partners principally who work with us, who want to use intermodal to reduce their costs as well as the growth that\u2019s coming with some of our other partners, as their volumes grow enormously with the growth of e-commerce.","So this is a good time for us to be here. We just need to make sure we fix it and that's what we're embarking upon doing and look at what we've done already with the company in terms of making improvements and this is just one more area where we're going to take all of our efforts and initiatives and tap into the brainpower of guys like Wallace and Harris and make intermodal a huge franchise.","Kevin Boone","Amber, I think that wraps up the queue. And I would like to thank everybody for joining the call and I'm available for callers afterwards. Thanks.","Jim Foote","Thank you very much.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. During this call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will be contacting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].","For opening remarks and introduction, I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Boone, Chief Investor Relations Officer for CSX Corporation.","Kevin Boone","Thank you Shirley and good afternoon everyone. Joining me on today's call is Jim Foote, President and Chief Executive Officer, Frank Lonegro, Chief Financial Officer and Mark Wallace, Executive Vice President for Sales and Marketing.","On slide two is our forward-looking disclosure and followed by non-GAAP disclosure on slide three.","With that, it is my pleasure to introduce President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Foote.","Jim Foote","Good afternoon and thank you Kevin and thank everyone for being on the call today. What an incredible year. I would like to first recognize the amazing team of CSX railroaders. They have stepped up to the challenge again and again and put this company on a new trajectory. Success breeds success and I am proud of the foundation we have built.","While we wrote an amazing first chapter, the CSX transformation story is still early. Across the organization, operations, sales and marketing and all other functions, there are plenty of opportunities for improvement to keep us busy for years to come. Millions of unnecessary events in our business processes can be eliminated which will improve service to our customers and allow them to be more efficient. We continue to make progress towards the efficiency goals set a little less than a year ago.","Whether it's locomotives, cars or yards, we are finding ways to deliver better service with fewer assets. This not only saves CSX money but saves customer's money by reducing their rolling stock and other infrastructure needs. Our progress has translated to significantly more free cash flow, which allows us to maintain a safe and reliable railroad, provide the flexibility to invest in high return projects and return significant cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.","Turning to slide five. Results are straightforward. EPS grew 58% on an adjusted basis. Our Q4 operating ratio improved 480 basis points to 60.3%, a record fourth quarter performance. And the full year operating ratio also 60.3% is a U.S. Class I railroad record.","Turning to slide six. As you can see there was broad-based strength across the portfolio. Revenue increased 10% with fuel recovery, volume, price and other revenue, all contributing to positive growth. I am encouraged to see the strong performance from our merchandise business with 10% overall revenue growth. Solid 4% volume growth helped drive positive performance across all markets with the exception of fertilizers. In fertilizers, we continued to face a headwind from the previously discussed fourth quarter 2017 customer plant closure. We also saw some weakness in the fertilizer export markets which appears transitory and should normalize in the next couple months.","Intermodal revenue growth was 4% with volumes up 2%. The intermodal grew despite our previously announced rationalizations, which shows very healthy core strength. Significant progress has been made in reengineering this very important part of our business which better positions the company for long term profitable growth. Coal revenues increased 8% with strength in our export Met business offsetting domestic utility weakness. Domestic steel and industrial customers also saw good growth. Finally, similar to previous quarters, other revenue gains were primarily driven by increases in supplemental fees.","On slide seven, I remain focused on safety. On a year-over-year basis, we saw good progress in both FRA personal injuries and train accidents. While it is encouraging to see some progress, the numbers are far from where I expect them to be. As of January 1, our annual bonus targets include specific safety improvement targets. Safety must be a priority for every employee in this company.","On slide eight, on the efficiency and service side, train velocity saw positive year-over-year and sequential movement, while dwell improved year-over-year. Only a couple of weeks into 2019, I see positive momentum in both of these metrics with the company currently seeing record performance in both measures. Cars online continued to trend down, down over 10% year-over-year, while volume increased 3%.","As you will see later, this directly translated to significantly lower car hire expense. And we periodically share with you different metrics which we track on a daily basis. On the bottom right is locomotive miles per day. This reflects the average daily mileage we are able to get out of each locomotive. Locomotives are a significant cost for the company and by reducing our active fleet we save on maintenance, fuel and capital requirements. Improvement in this metric means we need fewer locomotives to move the same amount of freight. Our active locomotive count ended the year down over 300 locomotives while we grew volume and revenue.","Now let me hand it off to Frank, who will take you through the financials.","Frank Lonegro","Thank you Jim and good afternoon everyone. Turning to slide 10, I will walk you through the summary income statement. As the slide shows, the impacts of tax reform, pension accounting changes and the remnants of our restructuring charges drove a significant difference between our reported and adjusted results for 2017. These adjustments impacted several line items and we have provided a full reconciliation of these items in the appendix to these materials as well as in our quarterly financial report. For year-over-year comparability, my comments will be focused on the variance to 2017's adjusted results.","Total revenue was up 10% in the fourth quarter driven by a 3% increase in freight volumes with particular strength in merchandise, broad-based revenue per unit gains of 7% from higher fuel recoveries, pricing gains and a favorable traffic mix together with increased other revenue. The overall pricing environment remained strong in the quarter, supported by our improved service product, healthy freight demand levels and supportive export coal benchmarks.","Consistent with prior quarters, pricing for merchandise and intermodal contracts that renewed in the fourth quarter was particularly strong. Other revenue also increased year-over-year, primarily due to increases in carload demurrage, intermodal storage and other incidental charges. These revenues are intended to offset car hire and car ownership expenses as well as the network impacts of equipment congestion.","Given the STB's recent focus on accessorial and demurrage charges, we thought it was important to note that in the quarter, only a third of this line item relates to demurrage in the carload business. As we look forward, we expect the run rate for other revenue to decline slightly in 2019, excluding any liquidated damages, which we will disclose if and when they occur.","Moving to expenses. Total operating expenses were 2% higher in the fourth quarter. Labor and fringe expense was relatively flat year-over-year as average employee headcount was down 6% even with 3% more volume. The company is cycling the previously reported reversal of share-based compensation for our former CEO, which favorably impacted 2017's results. Additionally, in the current quarter, we recognized railroad retirement tax refunds related to share-based compensation awards from prior years, given the industry's recent litigation win on this topic.","On the operating side, year-over-year improvements in velocity, on-time originations and arrivals and trip plan compliance led to significantly fewer active trains and enabled a 10% reduction in road crew starts. Non-productive re-crews, an indicator of network fluidity, improved by 78% and have declined sequentially for five straight quarters. These favorable operating results drove a 12% year-over-year improvement in crew productivity, measured on a GTM per active train and engine employee basis.","Shifting to labor. On the mechanical side, the active locomotive count was down 10% year-over-year. We continue to have over 800 locomotives in storage in addition to the hundreds of engines we have sold, scrapped or returned since the beginning of 2017. The smaller fleet, combined with lower cars online and freight car repair efficiencies, helped drive an 8% year-over-year decrease in our mechanical craft workforce. Our G&A headcount also continues to decline as we look for every opportunity to reduce our overhead costs.","With respect to our total workforce, which includes management and union employees as well as contractors and consultants, we exceeded our 2018 goal of 2,000 reductions. Looking forward to 2019, improved service and operating fluidity together with opportunistic streamlining in our support functions will drive a significant year-over-year labor productivity. At a high level, we would expect our total workforce to come down in line with historical attrition rates.","MS&O expense increased 3% versus the prior year. Our operations remained strong in the quarter with year-over-year service improvements driving asset efficiencies which were favorable for MS&O expense. With that said, in the quarter we did have several non-core impacts within this line. Specifically, discontinued projects resulted in asset impairments of $20 million in the quarter, an increase of $10 million year-over-year.","Additionally, there was a year-to-date reclassification in Q4 that shifted certain expense credits from MS&O into other expense lines, primarily fuel. Similar to recent quarters, MS&O benefited from real estate gains which were $19 million higher than the prior year. We are continuing to monetize our surplus assets and are making good progress toward our $300 million target for cumulative real estate sales through 2020 along with the potential for upside from line sale proceeds. We continue to have a strong pipeline of real estate and line sale opportunities, though the impact of these transactions will continue to be uneven from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.","Looking at other expense items. Depreciation increased due to the impact of a larger net asset base. Fuel expense was up 4% year-over-year, driven primarily by a 10% increase in the per gallon price, partially offset by improved efficiency. Specifically, we utilized 1.6 million fewer gallons even with slightly higher GTMs, driving favorable fuel efficiency savings. We will drive further fuel efficiency through continued improvement in network fluidity and the increased utilization of fuel optimization processes and technologies.","Equipment rents expense decreased 20% driven by significantly improved car cycle times, particularly in the merchandise and automotive segments as we continued to see strong year-over-year and sequential service improvements. Equity earnings decreased $13 million in the quarter as we are cycling a $16 million non-recurring gain recognized in the prior year by one of the company's equity affiliates.","Looking below the line. Interest expense increased primarily due to the additional debt we issued this year, partially offset by a lower weighted average coupon rate. Tax expense was lower in the quarter even with significantly better pre-tax earnings, reflecting the continued benefit of tax reform. Our effective tax rate was 23.2% in the quarter, slightly lower than prior guidance, mainly due to the settling of certain state tax matters.","Absent unique items, we expect our effective rate to be between 24% and 24.5% for 2019 with Q1 closer to 23.5% due to the timing of stock-based compensation payouts. As discussed at our investor conference, we also expect our cash tax rate to be up slightly, given the roll-off of bonus depreciation over time.","Closing out the P&L, as Jim highlighted in his opening remarks, CSX delivered operating income of nearly $1 billion, fourth quarter record operating ratio of 60.3% and earnings per share of $1.01, representing improvements of 25%, 480 basis points and 58% respectively year-over-year.","Turning to the cash side of the equation on slide 11. Adjusted operating cash flow was nearly $4.7 billion in 2018, an increase of over $1 billion or 29% year-over-year, illustrating the strength of the company's core cash generation capabilities together with the benefits of tax reform. Capital investments were down 14% or nearly $300 million, reflecting the reduced capital intensity of the scheduled railroading model. This reduction in capital intensity combined with the substantial progress this year in CSX's core operating cash flow generation drove an 88% increase in full year adjusted free cash flow.","Importantly, the company converted net income to free cash flow at essentially 100% in 2018. In 2019, we expect the combined impact of revenue growth, expense control and disciplined capital investment to deliver a high free cash flow conversion rate. This significant improvement in free cash flow generation supplemented by a strong balance sheet, help support substantial shareholder returns of over $5.4 billion. We executed nearly $1.9 billion of share repurchases in the fourth quarter and earlier this week, fully completed the prior $5 billion buyback authority.","With that, let me turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks.","Jim Foote","Great. Thanks so much Frank. Turning to slide 13 with a few comments about 2019. But before I talk specifically about revenue, I would like to provide some color on what we are seeing from a high level.","Over the past few days, I have spoken to a number of large customers across different industries. General customer feedback has been positive and it's consistent with the demand levels we are seeing today. While it's hard to ignore the volatility in equity markets, I cannot call out any trend in our business today that would point to a significant slowdown in our business.","Talking about this year, driven by merchandise strength, I expect total revenues to be up low single digits in 2019. This reflects muted overall intermodal growth, impacted by the rationalization of intermodal lanes we have talked about. Normalized intermodal growth should return in 2020. As recalled, similar to our view of coming into 2018, we expect some moderation of export coal benchmark prices in the back half of the year, but remaining at very healthy levels. As to the 2019 operating ratio, our goal is to maintain our position as the best in service and efficiency.","If you look at where we finished 2018 at 60.3%, we clearly get better in a number of areas including real estate and line sales. I believe a good 2018 OR baseline to measure our improvement in 2019 is closer to 61% which adjusts for some of the better than expected benefits from real estate that occurred in 2018. I now expect CSX to outperform our previous 2020 target of 60% a full year early. This represents continued efficiency gains across our operations while leveraging the revenue growth from Mark and his team.","At the Investor Day last March we guided for $8.5 billion in cumulative free cash flow over three years, including 2018 through 2020. I am happy to report we are trending ahead of that guidance. As part of our free cash flow outlook, we expect CapEx to be between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion in 2019.","Finally, as you saw in the press release, we have announced a new $5 billion share repurchase authorization. As Frank said, we completed the existing $5 billion share buyback earlier than was expected. Part of our annual process will be reviewing with the Board our long term outlook for the business and discussing uses of cash and capital structure which will determine the pace at which we complete the newly authorized share buyback program. The Board's review process will take into consideration economic conditions and the company's performance against its targets as well as the current stock price to optimize long-term value for the company's shareholders.","You really have to love being in the rail industry right now. So many exciting things happening. I couldn't be more proud of what we were able to achieve in 2018. It means a lot to the employees who work at CSX to be considered winners. It's great to see our mechanical employees are keeping the fleet in great shape, our engineering people that build and maintain the network and the T&E folks that get our customers' products where they need to be having this kind of success. But it does not get any easier from here. The bar is higher and it's our job to deliver. With that said, we have a team that is capable of making CSX the best railroad in North America.","Thank you. Kevin?","Kevin Boone","Thank you Jim. In interest of time, I would like to ask everyone to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up only if necessary. Shirley, we will now take questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. You may ask your question.","Tom Wadewitz","Yes. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask you a little bit about the operating metrics and how you think they would translate to cost side performance in 2019? It seems like you have obviously put up a lot of improvement in the metrics. It sounds, Jim, like from your comments that you would expect that to continue. I am thinking the metrics we see. maybe some we don't, but velocity, dwell and so forth. Do you think that translates to further cost side improvement in 2019? Is that the right way to look at it? And then maybe I have a follow-on on the OR as well?","Jim Foote","Sure Tom. Yes. I mean, we are going to continue to grind and make improvement and improve velocity. We are still long ways to go there to become consistently best-in-class. And dwell continues to improve. As we drive those two factors, that will improve our performance for our customers as well with trip plan compliance numbers increasing all the time. So it's the same metrics that we have used in the past and they will definitely continue to get better.","Tom Wadewitz","Okay. Great. So it sounds like there should be a translation of the cost side as well. You mentioned kind of an adjustment that you would think of on the base that we look at, like more of a 61% OR for 2018 kind of adjusted. Can you give a little more perspective of what you are adjusting out? Is that primarily land sales? Your land sale gains, are you thinking you won't have those gains? Or how do we think about that? [Indiscernible].","Jim Foote","No, Tom. We overachieved in that area and what I am saying is, if you are going to take that over achievement and kind of normalize it and say, okay, in order to move forward and say that we are going to do better than 60%, what's the good starting point? It's kind of foolish to say we are at 60.3% and say we are going to do better than 60%. So if you take out these real estate sales that were higher than what we had originally expected when we set our goal of 60% and remember, again, in 2020, for us to go forward into 2019 and to say we are going to beat that 60% 2020 target in 2019, we are just trying to put it in context for everyone that we believe we are really starting at around 61%.","Tom Wadewitz","Okay. So it's primary around how we think about real estate sales. That's primarily what you are saying?","Jim Foote","Yes. I think we had a number of $300 million and we had a trend on that. That doesn't mean we are going to do more than $300 million over the three years. It just means that we did better than that in 2019. And so taking that into consideration, as we look at, again, nine months ago, when we said, when we rolled this up, everybody thought we were insane people for thinking that we could hit a 60% operating ratio in three years. We are just trying to put it in context to show that we are going to do better than that and we are going to do better than that in a shorter timeframe.","Tom Wadewitz","Right. Okay. Great. Thank you for the time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.","Amit Mehrotra","Hi. Thanks operator. Thanks for taking the question. So Jim, I was just hoping if you could help us parse out the company's perspective margin improvement between the volume growth that you are expecting and the significant costs opportunity that you talk about? Clearly the outlook for volumes is a bit more uncertain than where it stands today, even outside export coal in the back half, but also the cost opportunity is significant. So if you could just help us think about the net impact of those two in terms of the OR guidance that you put out in 2019. How much of that is really in your control and how much of that is now dependent on the macro environment and the volume environment?","Jim Foote","Well, as we have always said, we need to have a topline growth as we move forward and our plan here is not to just merely reduce costs in order to grow the company's financial performance. So it's always been a balance as we have looked at this. That being said, as I talked earlier, on the cost side we believe that we have a lot of opportunity out there for us to continue to improve the efficiency of the network and continue to do that through many of the same practices that we have already put into place, whether it's running trains with distributed power, using other technology to reduce our fuel costs, eliminating more and more and more unnecessary touches, the way we handle our customer's products which improves throughput and improves fluidity. So it's many of those same initiatives that will drive costs further out of the company.","At the same time, we are constantly focused on the topline growth both in terms of volume and price. We have, again, starting 2018, taking just a high level view at the various business segments, we started the year with intermodal which is the \"growth engine of the railroad industry\". And for a lot of reasons, as I said quite a few times, we had to reengineer that business which meant we took 7% of the volume off the railroad. Well we came out of the year with 2% up. So the 2% plus 7% means recurring about 9%, okay. So I would say, under the circumstances, pretty good.","Amit Mehrotra","Okay.","Jim Foote","To a large degree, coal has been an issue for CSX for a while and we recognized that the domestic side of the business would be relatively stable in terms of volumes which it was and we had kind of anticipated, along with everybody else in the universe to trying to guess what's going to happen with coal, that these benchmarks for both export, met and steam coal would probably not stay at their high levels for the full 12 months, but they did until basically the very last few weeks of December. So that gave us a little bit of a better, gave us a boost there on the revenue as well, which we are seeing right now. The benchmarks are still high. The optimism right now is still strong for coal. But nobody is saying that these price levels are locked-in for sure. So it's prudent for us to say, they will probably decline somewhat but still be good in the second half of the year.","Amit Mehrotra","Right.","Jim Foote","And then we get over to the merchandise side of the business. The merchandise side business is the area that most benefits from the change in the operating model from the old way of looking at things and running trains and forgetting where your customers' cars were half the time on the railroad. So as we have implemented scheduled railroading and have improved the quality of our service, we are expecting, first time in a long time here at CSX, we are going to turn around this merchandise business segment which is 66% of the business and start to grow it and we are already seeing some of the business that, for a long time, went away and went to truck because we didn't have a service product that met our customer needs.","So as we have done that, we fully expect to see volume growth across all of the business segments in merchandise which is the key part of this company, the heart of this company. And we are making that service product fantastic and it is something that numerous recent reports have highlighted from the customer base that they are very excited about the new attitude, the new way we do business and the service product that we offer.","Mark, do you want to add anything else?","Again, I guess I talked plenty there. [Indiscernible].","Amit Mehrotra","Okay. Let me just ask one very quick follow-up, if I could. Jim, you talk about the best run railroad in North America. I just want to understand what that actually means. Does that translate to the best operating ratio in North America that accompanies the best service levels in North America? And then if you could just tie that into kind of the 2020 target because it doesn't seem like that has changed unless I am reading too much in the language. Does it seem the 2020 target has changed? Is that just too far out for you right now? Or is there something where you are thinking 60% is really kind of the high watermark for the network?","Jim Foote","Okay. Well first of all, as I said, what does the best railroad in North America means? First and foremost, the safest. Second, providing the best service possible to the customers and the best service recognized by the customer base as being had at above everybody else in the industry and doing that in the most efficient manner. And the most efficient manner one could look at, one way to measure that in the way that it's commonly measured is by looking at the company's operating ratio. As I have said and as we said in the press release, we had a 60.3% operating ratio this year. That is the best ever in the history of a North American railroad.","We are ahead of the CN and the CP who have been at this for 15 or 20 years and we are ahead of these guys and we plan to stay ahead of those guys. We have an operating ratio that was going to be 60% in two years from now. What we are saying is, we are going to have an operating ratio that is better than 60% this year. So it's not the same, not at all. It is a dramatic and significant improvement in our efficiency and performance. A full year ahead of where we said we were going to be. And as I said, when we said it nine months ago in New York, everybody said we were crazy, it can't be done.","Amit Mehrotra","All right. Thanks guys. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. You may ask your question.","Brandon Oglenski","Hi guys. Well, I guess following along that line of questioning. Jim or Mark, can you talk more about the lane rationalization that you have had on the intermodal business? I think you highlighted it a little bit last quarter that it was about optimizing with some of your interchange partners from the West. But maybe if you could elaborate on that? And how much, again, headwind that could represent in 2019?","Mark Wallace","Sure. So let me just repeat briefly so everyone understands what we did in 2017. As Jim just mentioned, at the end of the year 2017 when we began this journey of fixing our intermodal business and getting away from what we thought was a broken hub and spoke model, the impacts to those changes that we made then had an impact of about 7% of our intermodal business. As Jim just said, despite that, we grew our intermodal volumes last year 2%. In the middle of last year, as we continued working through a lot of the changes that we made over the course of the year, we decided to do another round of rationalizations, changes that impacted as of October 1, another 3% of the business those took effect and we announced as well as other changes that took effect this year on January 3, impacting roughly another 5%.","And as Jim just said, for 2019, we think we are going to be flattish to hopefully slightly up for the year on volumes. We have been going through this for some time now. You have probably seen some reports from some of our customers who actually agree with what we are trying to achieve. Clearly, we are competing in the lanes where we think we can do a better job of serving them. We are doing really well. We had a great peak season this past fall and into Christmas and we are doing so at lower cost.","We got away from, as I said, the traditional hub-and-spoke. And so the switching and the lifting and all the crazy stuff that we have been doing previously that were driving down the profitability of that business segment is improving substantially and we are not done. We still got a ways to go, but we are pleased with the progress that we have made so far in that area.","Brandon Oglenski","Okay. Appreciate that, Mark and if I can just sneak one in here. I think Frank mentioned that you would expect headcount would be down with natural attrition this year. So can you put some context around that for us?","Frank Lonegro","Yes. So a couple of things on that one. Better service obviously requires less folks to run the railroad. Less assets come from better service and less people to maintain those assets. And then certainly on the G&A side, as we have attrition opportunities, we will take those. As you think about our historical attrition levels, we are thinking about going to 6% to 7% from a total workforce perspective.","Brandon Oglenski","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. You may ask your question.","Chris Wetherbee","Yes. Great. Thanks. I wanted to come back to the OR for a second. So I just wanted to get a sense that you are going to exceed the 2020 target in 2019. What do you think the potential of the business is as you look out a little beyond 2019, say 2020 or 2021?","Jim Foote","I think that in terms of the specific place where the operating ratio should be, as we move into the future, whether it's a year, whether it's five years from now, wherever it is, we will find the right spot where that operating ratio should be that it allows us to provide the most efficient, highest quality of service but grow the business at optimal levels. So there isn't a magic point where you say, oh, this is necessarily where I am trying to get to. We are trying to put the three elements there of service, efficiency and growth together and find the optimum spot and we will start to search for that in the future.","At the same time, I can tell you that, at least in my opinion, you will always want to be the most efficient in the marketplace. No matter what the line of business you are in, no matter what you are making, no matter what you are selling, normally if you are doing it the best, you are going to be the most successful. So that's my number one reason for wanting to continue to drive on continuous improvement and continue to make all these changes because it continues to make us the best in the marketplace and the best in the industry. And I think that should be a goal of any organization.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay. That's fair. That's helpful. And then I also just want to touch on the intermodal outlook. I wanted to make sure I am clear on what you guys think volumes might be in 2019. It sounds like maybe down or flattish a little bit in that segment? And then where are you in that process? You have done some of the rationalization with the repairs. But I am just kind of curious how you think about how much more wood there is to chop on the intermodal segment specifically?","Mark Wallace","Yes. As I just said a couple of minutes ago, we just announced another round of rationalizations took effect on January 3 this year. Those are obviously working with our customers as they work through all those. I don't foresee and I don't anticipate any other significant announcements in intermodal changes anytime soon. I hope we don't have to do anymore. I think we are getting the network down to a manageable area where we can really focus on the lanes, where we can really compete and deliver superior service.","So we are focused on that. We are driving hard. As I just said, yes, we are going to overcome the loss of the rationalizations as we did in 2018, hopefully in 2019 as well. And so yes, I would be disappointed if our volumes were down and I am looking and I am pushing that we make that up and maybe do a little bit better.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay. Thanks for very much. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.","Allison Landry","Thanks. So obviously you guys did a really good job on the service metrics overall. But I was a little surprised to see the on-time arrivals kick down sequentially. I think that's a pretty important metric that you focus on. So is there something specific during the quarter that drove that? Or was that where you thought it would be? And what has to happen for that to improve to the point where you can create the slots for intermodal and drive incremental volume growth?","Jim Foote","Hi, Allison. Yes. We were clearly disappointed with that metric during this quarter and worked extremely hard on that. Both originations on-time and arrivals were clearly not where they need to be. How do you get them better? You execute. The train is supposed to depart on schedule so that it can arrive at the next terminal. So that the assets and the crew and everything are balanced as we run around our network. It needs to get out of the terminal on time. And then, there can't be an event en route that causes it to experience a delay so that it doest arrive in the destination terminal where it needs to on-time. And so it's just execution.","It's constantly looking at all of the root causes of what caused the failure en route. So, is it a mechanical issue, do we need to, are we focusing on, what causes the engines to fail? Are there systemic issues that caused the locomotives to fail, which causes the train not to get across the river? Are there mechanical issues? Are there engineering issues that we need to address? Are there crew balancing issues that we need to address?","So it is all of those various elements in the way you run the railroad that you need to focus on in order to get those numbers up. I can tell you that the on-time origins and arrivals in our most recent numbers have been, I certainly hope that we can maintain this and don't get whacked with a bunch of crazy snowstorms, but are significantly better than where they were in the fourth quarter.","Allison Landry","Okay. And if I think about that improving all that the things that you talked about, is that what we should be watching in terms of a metric to sort of think about, okay, this is maybe the point where the intermodal business can start to see incremental volume growth from maybe the guidance that you guys talked about?","Frank Lonegro","Well, yes, I will let Mark add onto this. But again, incremental volume growth in the intermodal business, when we take 7% of the volume off the railroad intentionally every year because we shouldn't be doing that kind of work in order to fix the company and we grow 2% or we come in maybe this year flat to slightly up and our goal in the business here, 7%, 8%, 9% a year in intermodal. So that's a good environment for us to be trying to reverse and improve the overall core product of the intermodal business. We are not just driving off just to get rid of bad business. We are fixing and improving the intermodal franchise and the intermodal network of the CSX so that it can grow and grow and grow and grow profitably consistently in the future.","Mark?","Mark Wallace","And I think Allison, one thing under scheduled railroading that we have talked about a lot historically and the Canadians talked about a lot, we are focused on here as well, trip plan compliance. Trip plan compliance is what the customer experiences. When the train departs in the terminal and when it arrives is one measure, but what the customer experiences is, did we hit the committed to trip plan for his or her container or intermodal. That's something that we are intensely focused on CSX right now and we will be rolling that out to customers this year and that's our product. That's what we sell to our customers is meeting their trip plans and the commitments that we make to them on when we are going to deliver their goods.","Allison Landry","Got it. Thank you for the time.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.","Brian Ossenbeck","Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. So I want to go back to the export coal outlook embedded in the 2019 guidance. What are you thinking in terms of the range of assumptions specifically for volume and the mix of thermal and met? You had a pretty good year as did the market for thermal last year. Do you think that moderates? And I know you have said that basically the back half of the year is going to see some softness on the pricing, but what about the first quarter? I would imagine that's reasonably well spoken for at this point. Can you give us some color as to how that's shaping up, first quarter of 2019?","Mark Wallace","Sure. So 2018, I think it was the second highest export coal year that this company has ever done. Somewhere around 43 million tons. We expect similar low-40s in 2019. Hopefully we are able to match our performance in 2018. But the mix is 65% met, 35% thermal. That hasn't changed. I should say that of our export coal for 2019, we have about 65% of our contracts are already locked up and the team is working hard to get that to a 100%. So we see a very good demand environment and the benchmarks are where the benchmarks are and there is a forward curve. Who knows where that's going to go. It bounced around like crazy in 2018. We are not sure exactly what's going to happen but we have made reasonable assumptions in our plan for 2019 which I think, as I said, are reasonable. And again, as long as we can get the coal out of the ground and get it to the port, I think we will have a very good export coal year.","Brian Ossenbeck","Thanks Mark. A follow-up on that. The 65% of contracts, can you just put some more context around that? Is that spoken for volume tied to a benchmark? And is that any different in this cycle versus the last one, as clearly [indiscernible].","Jim Foote","Yes. So it was 65%, sorry. I don't want to go into the specifics of our contracts, but some of them are tied to the various benchmarks. So pricing goes up and down, collars, et cetera, et cetera. But the 65% is significantly higher than where we were at this time last year. So this time last year, we were low in terms of contracts signed up and we have started the year really good there. So that's just a reflection of the demand and that our customers want to lock these contracts up soon. So we are very happy with that.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay. And then just be clear, those are volume commitments or some are actually performing?","Jim Foote","Correct. Yes.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay. All right. Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Justin Long with Stephens. So you may ask your question.","Justin Long","Thanks and good afternoon. So, wanted to ask about your expectation for gains on the sale this year. I know it's hard to predict. But just curious if you have any initial thoughts on what this year looks like versus 2018? And then also on equipment, you referenced the reductions you have seen in cars online and locomotives. Can you share with us what your expectation for the reduction in 2019 is, if you have those numbers?","Frank Lonegro","Hi Justin, it's Frank. In terms of the real estate, as Jim mentioned in his remarks, we did have an extremely good 2018. We still have a good pipeline for 2019, perhaps not as good as 2018. But you should expect some choppiness quarter-by-quarter in 2019 on real estate. On the line sales, in 2018 we did have line sales that had both cash and gain impact. It's a little unusual to have the gain impacts on line sales. Those were lease conversions that drove some operating income favorability. In terms of 2019, we do have a couple of lines sales in the work. They will be cash accretive but not necessarily operating income accretive.","In terms of your equipment question, yes, we had a great run in 2018 both in terms of engines and in terms of cars. We will continue as service improves and depending on the volume elements of things, we will continue to see less equipment in service in 2019. We don't have specific targets around that. Obviously a lot of that's going to be dependent on our achievement of service levels and the volumes that come onboard. But you should continue to see us run a better railroad, a more efficient railroad, a safer railroad and continue to drive long term profitable and sustainable growth.","Justin Long","Okay. Great. I will leave it at that. Thanks for the time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Reustle with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","Matt Reustle","Yes. Thanks for taking my question. One on the intermodal business. As you get past the rationalization and you return to those normalized growth rates in 2020, what should we expect those normalized growth rates to look like? Is this a segment that you would expect to be the fastest growing in the business?","Jim Foote","We hope so. At better profitability that would be very, again, we took off 7%, it grew too in 2018, so 9%. It all depends on state of the economy, the demand. You have all the things working in your favor. But certainly, it should be healthy, it should grow at a healthy clip. A couple of points above GDP hopefully, if not more, at better profitability.","Matt Reustle","Great. That's helpful. And then just one more. In terms of the CapEx budget, it seems like you are trending above the three year $4.8 billion target. Are you pulling forward any CapEx? Are you spending more as you generate more? What's driving the trend? Or should we expect a major step down in 2020 to ultimately get to that target?","Frank Lonegro","Yes, a good question. In 2018 we did pull some stuff forward. We did have an acceleration of PTC. Jim wanted to get that done as quickly as possible. From a safety perspective, it makes all the sense in the world. We had some hurricane damage obviously in 2018 that we had to take care off.","And then we had a couple of high return projects that got involved and wanted to look at certain things that could help improve on the maintenance side, especially on locomotives. 2019, we gave you a range there to give ourselves some flexibility on projects that may or may not come to fruition, as we look across both the commercial side and the operating side of the business.","We are going to hopefully finish up positive train control and most of the spending in 2019. So we ought to see at least that element of step down as we get into 2020. But then again, every year is going to be a little bit different. We are going to look at the free cash flow. We are going to look at the opportunities to generate returns on those projects. So we will give you 2020 guidance as we get out much further into 2019.","Matt Reustle","Okay. Great. Thanks for the questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question.","Scott Group","Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon guys. So Frank, I just wanted to ask you a couple of small little guidance things. One, can you give us some color on equity earnings line for 2019? And then I think you said other revenue maybe a little bit lower, but maybe what's a good quarterly run rate for that line?","Frank Lonegro","Yes. So let's do your equity earnings one first. I think if you plug in somewhere in the $20 million to $25 million benefit a quarter in your 2019, you will probably end in good shape. This year was $96 million in total. I think you are going to see roughly that same amount, as you think about 2019.","In terms of other revenue, yes, I did say it's going to be a tad lower from a run rate perspective. This year the number was $582 million. We have $28 million of liquidated damages. So back that one out and then get a little bit lower on your run rate there. I am not going to give you a quarterly run rate number, but if you take the $28 million off and then back out a little bit more you will be in the right neighborhood.","Scott Group","Okay. Helpful. And then Jim I understand your point about, you have got to figure out exactly what the optimal operating ratio is where you can still grow. So you are not ready to give a number, but is there a reason why that optimal OR couldn't be in the mid-50s? I mean there's still obviously more to go, headcount, the intermodal network changes, we haven't seen the full impact there yet. Could we be talking about a mid-50s OR as the optimal OR at some point in the future?","Jim Foote","Well, sure, Scott. There's no reason in the world that we look at where we are today as far as we come and where we are positioned in the railroad industry today. And you can't make this stuff up when we find that we need to fix it every single day, opportunity after opportunity after opportunity. And I know that it sounds crazy when we said, we don't think we are anywhere near where we can get. So it's not inconceivable that mid-50s is something that someday might happen. But it's not like that is the quest. The quest is to get as efficient in best places as we possibly can be so we can grow the business.","Scott Group","Makes sense. Okay. Thank you for the time guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.","Ken Hoexter","Hi Jim, Mark, Frank and team, congrats on the OR. Just, Jim, you noted you are not seeing economic weakness. So I just want to dig inside for a second. Intermodal pricing slipped to about 2.5% from 9% growth. Is that from just the loser truck environment? Is that a shift in mix? Any thoughts on pricing at intermodal?","Jim Foote","Well, pricing at intermodal was clearly the markets going into the peak season were tight. And they have been tight for a long time due to the driver situation and the electronic reporting. So it took a while for that to work out. So I think that the truck market clearly, in terms of the spot pricing, has declined.","Now, in our case, as I have said before, we don't chase that spot market. Our contracts, our arrangements with our customers, our channel partners is much more of a longer term. We guarantee we provide a longer term service, a partnership arrangement with the intermodal people and they make commitments, they make investments, they buy containers, they do a lot of things in order to be able to grow their intermodal franchise with us.","So it's not like, oh my God, look at this is up, that is up, that sort of thing. So that is the more recent view of the marketplace in terms of pricing. In terms of the overall economy and are we seeing changes in the economy that would prohibit or limit intermodal growth, I could say, as I said earlier in my remarks, we look at every economic indicator possible to try and understand what the economy is. And we talk to our customers, which touch every segment of the U.S. economy and especially in intermodal where they move from auto parts to technicians. And so we believe that we have a very good feel and sense for what's going on in the economy.","However over the last couple of months, everybody, not only us, but when we talk to our customers, we are talking about headline news about trade, tariffs, interest rate, what's going on with Brexit, government turbulence, al of these things that everybody swirling around that must have a solid impact on the way you run the business. So we all go back and we look in the crystal ball really deeper and we try to determine what's going on and we go back to the same place we were a few months ago. Everybody, us and our customers, are still very optimistic about the business in 2019 and not necessarily on the intermodal side business, but on the merchandise side of the business, we have customers who are making the long term capital investments where they are going to be building and expanding their facilities over into 2019 and 2020. And none of those projects are being pulled back.","So we feel very good about where we are right now especially given the fact that we are dramatically improving the quality of our service and are just not sitting here with a transportation product that's viewed as a commodity, that we just sell into the marketplace based on price. And the customer decides, I will go with truck or I will go with railroad, whoever gives me the lowest price. We are providing them with a valuable service and changing the dynamics and we are starting to get business from truck that historically moved on rail that's now coming back because of the changes that we have made.","Ken Hoexter","It's helpful.","Jim Foote","So it's a good time. And as I said, it's a great time to be in the railroad business.","Ken Hoexter","Yes. I appreciate it. It just seemed odd to see the deceleration of pricing in intermodal. But let me just ask a quick follow-up. You mentioned the work of or I guess, we have seen a lot of the peers adopting precision railroading or I guess the final two big ones on the Class I side. Any impacts that you have seen on service interchange? You always talk about if the industry gets better, it's better for everybody. Have you seen impacts to service as the other carriers start launching into that?","Jim Foote","Well, first, yes, I would reiterate, yes. I mean to the extent that all the railroads run better, we are a network. So if everybody's running better, it's better for the individual companies. I am unaware of any kind of interchange issues that we are experiencing that would be, let's say, attributed to somebody changing their business model. Clearly, day of the week, couple of days here and there due to snow in Chicago or something like that, yes, everybody gets slowed down, yes. But nothing unusual.","Mark Wallace","Hi Ken. Just to alleviate maybe some of your concerns with respect to the intermodal issue in Q4. Don't be concerned. You are always going to have a little bit of noise in there. We did see some impact with respect to the lane rationalizations. We are seeing and experiencing some really good pricing renewals from channel partners on the private asset side. And the spot market rates don't really have too much of an effect, 90% of our intermodal business is not impacted by the spot market. Most of our contracts are multi-year. We have seen recently there are all kinds of talk in the industry about what's going to happen to the spot market. Nobody really knows. There has been a little bit of softening, but I don't think we are too concerned about it at this point in time.","Ken Hoexter","Thanks for the follow-up. Thanks, guys. I appreciate the time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. You may ask your question.","Ben Hartford","Yes. Thanks. Frank, just to clarify on the OR target for 2019 now. The previous 2020 target was 60%. So that does assume some sort of normalized. You talked about choppiness and gains here in 2019. That does include gains to some degree, right? That's not a complete ex-gains number, that 60% that you are talking about?","Frank Lonegro","Yes. So sub-60% for 2019 is obviously the message that Jim is sending and it's a reported number. So yes, it would include some level of real estate gains.","Ben Hartford","Okay. That's good. And then the share repurchase authorization, when does the schedule expire?","Frank Lonegro","It doesn't have an expiration. But certainly, we wanted to make sure we had the authority and the capability to be in the market when the window opens. We exhausted the prior program early, which is why we are announcing it on this call. Normally, it would have been a little bit later in the year in connection with the capital structure conversation that Jim mentioned in his remarks.","Ben Hartford","Okay. Perfect. Thanks for the time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Walter Spracklin with RBC. You may ask your question.","Walter Spracklin","Yes. Thanks very much. I got one question on the OR and one question on volumes. On the OR, I guess Jim, when PI service first contemplated at CSX, it was a significant opportunity and I think you executed on that in 2017 with upwards of 400 basis points of improvement. 2018, almost 600 basis points. I am just getting now, I am hearing you say there's still tons of room for early innings, lot more to go, but I am getting the indication that that's going to slow significantly. Am I reading that right? Is the trajectory now of the 55% OR now far, far down in the future that it's something that will come and really we are going to block and tackle from this point going forward, a 100 basis point per year here, a 100 basis point per year there? Am I hearing you right on that?","Jim Foote","Well, I think that as I said, Walter, you have been following this longer than anybody, probably because you started with me, with us. And yes, as you get further down the road, it becomes harder. CN and CP have been doing it for a long time and have been recognized to be the greatest of all time and are still considered by some to be phenomenal, because they can take a point out a year after doing this for 15 years.","We are beating them and we are saying we are going to get better next year, below 60% off of a 61%. So I am pretty confident and pretty comfortable that we are clearly not just sitting back and taking it easy. It just gets harder. And so I don't think anybody at this level can look you square in the eye and say, yes, let's take another 600 basis points out of the current this year.","Walter Spracklin","Right. So when do you --","Jim Foote","It is growing it up","Walter Spracklin","And Jim, you mentioned CN and CP. And PSR has been used as a cost driver and you have used it very much successfully there. But in prior incident or prior iterations, it then turned into a revenue driver, where PSR could then be used to gain share, to gain traction, be it from truck, from your rail competitor. You are guiding it kind of flat to slightly up volume growth this year. When do you really see an inflection, where you can turn around and take PSR and use it the way the other PSR players have done and really drive revenue growth?","Jim Foote","Well, in my opinion and I have said this many times for years and years and years, the reason that my opinion as it becomes a point in time when all of a sudden you start to see above average growth for a railroad company that's adopted this, is because of the quality of the service becomes so much better than it historically was. Again, it's not like some people say, oh, all of a sudden you get to some point in time, June 22, 2020 and you go, oh, we are going to pivot from cost reduction to growth. It is an evolutionary process that as you continue to focus on getting your trains to run on time as efficiently as possible, it improves the quality of the service and that customers can put more, because we become more reliable, they will put more business on it. So it's an evolutionary process.","And yes, that's what we, Mark and I and everyone here now who have seen the benefits of this transformation recognize that the customers are actually starting to like us for the first time in a long time. And so we are going to continue to grow. That doesn't mean we are all of sudden going to say, okay, 60.3% is it. We are not going to get any lower. No, we are going to continue to believe that each and every year, we can continue to improve the efficiency of the network that again, it improves the profitability of the company, but it improves the quality of the service to the customer. So it's an ongoing continuous improvement initiative that hopefully will go on as long here as it has at CN and now CP.","Walter Spracklin","Excellent. Thanks for the insight, Jim.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from David Vernon with Sanford Bernstein. You may ask your question.","David Vernon","Hi. Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the time. Jim, I want to ask a question on the regulatory and then just a quick follow-up on CapEx. First, the STB poking around accessorial fees, can you give us a sense for how that is expected to play out? Is there any timetable for that review? And do you see any risk to the industry from seeing some of those fees maybe called back?","Jim Foote","I don't know that there's any kind of formal process with time stamp. I just think that the Chairman reached out to the railroads and wants to know more about it. And we have responded and provided a great amount of detail. And none of these issues, whether it's demurrage or any of these things, is new. These things have been on the books for years and years and years. They are kind of industry practices in transportation. So I don't think there's any issue.","And you also have to remember that these are public tariff situations. The vast, vast majority of our contracts or services are privately negotiated and have been since 1980 when we were deregulated and when we sign a contract with a customer and it says, you will be governed by our tariffs. So it's a very, very small percentage of the business that the customers already have not agreed to as being fair and just.","David Vernon","So there is no formal case that's been opened or docket that's been open for them to [indiscernible]?","Jim Foote","No. Again, I think this is just the Chairman doing her job. She heard like you know in the media or wherever, maybe that one of those public trains magazine or something like that, she read an article that something nefarious was going on and they were reporting at. And she said, well, I am going to check it out. She said, tell me what's going on.","David Vernon","Maybe that interview with Matt Rose the other day. Second is --?","Jim Foote","I didn't say that.","David Vernon","Not sure if you want to comment on that one, but that one would obviously be welcome to your comment. But as a follow-up, I have question on the CapEx and the Baltimore tunnel project. I read some stuff and the industry ragged about that maybe coming back to life. Could you talk a little bit about kind of what that looks like from a capital commitment standpoint and whether or not that thing come back to life from a planning perspective for you guys?","Jim Foote","Well, about a year ago, maybe you will remember I went out just about a year ago, I went out and met with the Maryland delegation because Hunter had said, we would not participate in the project. And I went out there a year ago and I just said well, give me some time to look at this and figure out what it is, what's going on with this tunnel, why are we spending all these hundreds of millions of dollars for a tunnel under the city of Baltimore.","And so we studied it. We looked at it for a long time. And we went back and said to the Maryland delegation, I did, again just before Christmas and said, we have looked at it. The economics are such that there would be justification for us to participate, but at a lower level than had been previously committed to.","The lower level being, we believe that there's a sufficient return on investment to CSX, if we put in around $91 million. I think that's like $50 million or so less than what we had previously said we would participate at. The Maryland delegation, I think, it's in my opinion, was pleased that we did what we said that we were going to do and they are trying to figure out if they could find other funding mechanisms to make up the difference.","And if they can find other funding mechanisms, then maybe this project goes forward. It is viewed as a tremendous opportunity to the city of Baltimore and the state of Maryland and we are trying to participate and work with them as best we can.","David Vernon","But no hard data or anything like that, right?","Frank Lonegro","There's nothing in the 2019 capital number that Jim and I talked about relating to the Howard Street Tunnel.","David Vernon","All right. Thanks very much guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. You may ask your question.","Bascome Majors","Yes. Thanks for taking my question here. This summer you changed the operating structure of the railroad to a more regional one with more responsibility under the people in those regions. And it sounds like there may have been some turnover in that senior team since then. I was just curious, are you happy with the new structure and the results it's producing? And may be longer term, either Ed or Jim, could you discuss your thoughts on the bench strength and when you might name a permanent Chief Operating Officer? Thanks.","Jim Foote","Yes. We are very happy, I think, with the structure. It's a structure that we are comfortable with, I am comfortable with, Ed is comfortable with because that's the way we structured the railroad at CN, driving the accountability and responsibility down to the line supervisors and the front line supervisors to make the day-to-day decisions and our experience is that the railroad runs better that way. So far, that's exactly what we are seeing. But we will continue to refine it. We will continue to improve it. At least as the employees tell me, they like it, because they get to make decisions and they don't have to pick up the phone and call somebody in Jacksonville and ask if it's okay to take a switch engine off. They get to make decisions on the fly in order to make the railroad run better each and every day.","In terms of naming someone to, I guess become head of the operating department, let's call it that, we don't have a specific timeframe. Ed and I are working on that along with our human resource people to come up with a plan and the Board, because it's important for the Board too, I would say to get somebody in there as quick as possible. But we are not going to rush forward and do something rash. We are assessing all of our talent internally and if appropriate, we will look elsewhere.","But, we got a lot of great people here that can probably step up into that role. And then one of Ed's responsibilities when I asked him to come and help me was to help me choose that, find that person, work with that person and train that person so that they can be the best. And there's nothing that's changed there. You know maybe we will get it done this year, I don't know.","Bascome Majors","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Ravi Shanker","Thanks. Good evening everyone. Just one follow-up on the guidance. Did you say a flat to slightly up volume growth on the intermodal side? Or just overall volume growth? Or both?","Jim Foote","What I said was that with the lane rationalizations that we announced in October and then ones that we implemented January 3 of this year is about another 8%. We would look to make that up. And if we are flat, that's great. If we are up slightly on volume, that's even better.","Ravi Shanker","Great. It sounds like that's an intermodal comment. Can you just help unpack your full year revenue guidance in terms of volume mix and maybe some other components, because if I look at low single digit revenue growth, I am assuming you guys get at least 3% price which doesn't leave much room for volume or mix growth there, even if you adjust for the fuel surcharge headwind. So can you just tell us what you are expecting in terms of overall volume growth for 2019?","Jim Foote","I don't think we gave any volume growth for 2019 other than, as Mark anecdotally said in his comments here related to volume growth on the intermodal side that we hope that we will see flat, again because we took 8% of the volume off again, flat. And if Mark being the marketing czar that he is, is able to achieve success, he will grow it, again like he did this year. And so the low single digit number is in relation to revenue growth in 2019.","Frank Lonegro","And remember, Ravi, you got fuel price moderating. So you are not going to get the fuel surcharge uptick that you saw this year. And then as you heard me answer, I think Scott's question around the supplemental line, that's coming down. So, you have got more help from the volume and the pricing side than what that low single digit might imply.","Ravi Shanker","Okay. Got it. And just as a follow-up, I think as it was alluded to earlier, there are a couple of U.S. rails left that are potentially going down the PSR path, one of which is your regional competitor. If they do something significant and they do see service disruption as a result of that and there's volume that comes your way, are you willing and able to take that just given the right focus that you have on price and margin over volumes?","Jim Foote","Listen, we are trying to grow the business. That's what we keep saying over and over here. And you know we can grow the business with price and improving margins. And we are open for business.","Frank Lonegro","We have ample capacity, line of road, equipment, people, we are good to go. When they want to bring it over, we are ready.","Ravi Shanker","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. You may ask your question.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Thanks very much. Good afternoon. I just wanted to ask, in terms of your safety goals, I am wondering if you could give us a high level idea of some of the areas where you would like to see improvement in 2019 and how that ties back into the cost equation?","Jim Foote","Well, the goals are pretty clear. FRA personal injuries and FRA reportable accident. So there's complete transparency and no ambiguity in terms of what we are trying to do. From a cost savings perspective, they have put a dollar amount on personal injury. My goal and I have told everybody here since I walked in the door here is, I don't want anybody to ever get hurt here. And so you will see that our numbers, at least from a personal injury standpoint, have improved and come down dramatically.","On the FRA reportable accident\/derailments, wow, there's a huge amount of money we could save if we can get that number down, huge. But again, that's not necessarily the sole motivation. Every one of those, in my opinion, every one of those accidents where we derail, where we corner the car or we kick the car down the wrong track and it derails or something like that. In my opinion, every one of those incidents means somebody could have got hurt. And so we have got to stop doing that and we have got to stop wrecking things. But on that accident side, it could directly answer your question, there would be a big pot of money there if we can improve that number.","Ravi Shanker","Thank you. That's all from me.","Jim Foote","Great. Thanks so much. Kevin?","Kevin Boone","Yes. I think we are done. Thank you everybody for joining the call. If you have any question, please reach out.","Operator","This does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation in today's call.

Directionally, I am very pleased with the direction the organization has taken.","Although, I think maybe certainly in some quarters, and I understand that, your expectations were pretty high, which used to be -- I'll talk a moment you don't even make the cut anymore. So, I'm going to be interested obviously in some of the Q&A and I do think that, as a result of this to some degree, I think we are going to change the format of how we announce earnings in the future.","And I think we will go more to the conventional approach of releasing our earnings ahead and the call effectively simultaneously because I think it does create some awkwardness in that some of you still remember the night before. You have questions we have able to respond to some of those questions or you might get all of them. We didn\u2019t talk to anybody last night and I just kind of mopped the tears up a little bit and there is all.","So, I think it will put us in a situation where you not having to make observations in the dark and it will make our work here much easier in distributing this information to the shareholder, which is really the important thing we're dealing with here.","So with that said, let me return this over to conductor, Frank, and let him proceed with the presentation.","Frank Lonegro","Good thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks Hunter. Slide 7 reviews our safety service and efficiency performance year-over-year. You can see our train accident performance improved slightly while our personal injury frequency index rose to 1.14, reflecting a slight increase in injuries in a significant fleet to fewer number of man hours. The safety of our employees is paramount and our commitment to them is unwavering.","Cindy Sanborn","And let me jump in, Frank, even though we express injury performance in numerical terms on the slide, safety is always about returning employees home at the end of their tour duty. Tragically, we had two employees who were killed in an accident that occurred in Washington D.C. in the quarter. Our condolences go out to the family of Stephen Deal and Jake LaFave as we mourn the loss two of our colleagues. It is a stark reminder that even though railroads are one the safest industries in North America, they can also be very unforgiving one and our commitment to safety remain.","Frank Lonegro","Thank you, Cindy. Service and efficiency measures are turning well year-over-year due to train length reflects two initiatives that offset one another in the quarter, both are integral to Precision Scheduled Railroading. The first is balance. We have expanded the days of service on most trains to seven days per week, which is instrumental to improving cycle time and after utilization, but negatively impacts train length. The second is unit train conversations into the scheduled merchandized network, which reduces both asset and resource intensity, and increases train length.","Going forward, you should see train length increase sequentially. Dwell and velocity of both improved and reflect the early success of Precision Scheduled Railroading. These improvements are particularly noteworthy given the rapid pace of change we're driving. Balancing the train plan, merging unit trains into the scheduled network and converting for flat switching has reduced handlings, improves transit times and improve velocity, and allowed us to idle 26,000 freight cars and 900 engines. Cindy can certainly provide more color during the Q&A on those items. Fuel efficiency has also improved year-over-year with 900 fewer engines and service and a more fuel efficient active fleet.","Turning to Slide 8, we\u2019re encouraged by the financial results driven by the early implementation of Precision Scheduled Railroading. Revenue was up 8% driven primarily by core pricing gains of 3.7% all in and 2.2% excluding coal, volume growth of 2% and higher fuel recoveries. We also had liquidated damages of 58 million in the quarter, which reflects the resolution of a longstanding dispute. It is recorded in the other revenue line and drives the year-over-year variants. GAAP expenses were up 6% and down slightly excluding the restricting charge. Efficiency savings of $90 million more than offset the impact of inflation in the quarter.","Looking at the detail, labor and fringe was favorable reflecting 2,200 fuel resources. As Hunter discussed on the first quarter call, we have also begun to address the size of our contractor workforce with savings following through the MS and other line. On that line, we also concluded a decade plus condemnation proceeding, resulting in $55 million of favorability. Fuel expense was higher reflecting a 15% price increase. Strong revenue gains combined with cost control drove very strong incremental margins. Reported EPS was $0.55 with the 67.4 operating ratio. Adjusting for the restructuring charge, EPS was $0.64 for the 63.2% operating ratio. The reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is in the appendix with these materials.","Slide 9 illustrates that our free cash flow generation continues to improve, given in large part by three things. Strong top line gains, cost control and reduce to capital intensity. Our success in generation free cash flow has enabled us to increase our shareholders distributions year-over-year with over 750 million of share buybacks year-to-date, including nearly 500 million in quarter two. And you can also see the effect of our recent $0.02 dividend increase. The Company's improved financial performance is reflected in our trailing 12-month ROIC of 10% nearly a four point better than last year. Finally, adjusted EBITDA ratio remains stable as higher earnings offset the impact of additional debt.","Turning to Slide 10, the third quarter volume outlook shows nearly three quarters of our business is expected to be favorable and neutral. Export coal demand remains strong and we now expect to ship around 30 million tons for the year. The revenue per unit will moderate sequentially as the global benchmarks come down. Consumer sentiment remains positive driving intermodal growth in the third quarter. As a reminder, in August, we will cycle the shortfall domestic interchange loss we've mentioned previously. We expect continued economic growth as well as a tightening truck market, which should support growth in several of our merchandize markets.","On the left side of the ledger, a few of our markets will experience year-over-year volume declines in the third quarter due to market specific headwinds you're very familiar with. Auto shipments will be impact by softening production, as reflected in the forward views of North American light vehicle production. Crude oil trends have essentially gone to zero more than offsetting the growth we expect in the core chemicals markets. And domestic coal remains challenged due in large part to the impact of the shortfall competitive loss as of January the 1st.","Before I wrap up on Slide 11, two housekeeping items, one our fiscal year will now tie to the calendar, as a result the third quarter of 2017 will have one more day than the third quarter of 2016. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we will have one more day than the comparable 13-week fourth quarter of 2016. Also a result of a recent state tax law change, our effective tax rate for the third quarter will be between 39% and 40%, as we revalue the deferred tax liability for that particular state.","Now to Slide 11, we're up to a good start to 2017. Our first half performance provided this team with continued confidence in our full-year expectations and we are reaffirming that guidance today. Excluding restricting and assuming no weak genomic or coal related disruptions, we are on track to deliver a mid-60s operating ratio, record efficiency gains, EPS growth of around 25% and free cash flow of around $1.5 billion.","With that backdrop, the CXS Board of Directors has authorized a 500 million increase to the share repurchase program, bringing the total authorize program to $1.5 billion. We are continuing to evaluate the optimal capital structure and cash performance strategy for the Company and are committed doing investment grade profile. We are excited to host our 2017 Investor Conference on October 29th and 30th at Palm Beach and look forward to sharing with you our multiyear strategy and associated financial partners.","With that, we would be delighted to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin conducting a questions-and-answer session. Our first question, one moment, our first question will be from Brian Ossenbeck of JP Morgan.","Brian Ossenbeck","So, you mentioned in the press release that, there is some impairments on PTC about $10 million or so. So I just wanted to get, if there is opportunity to talk more probably about that system. How you stand right now, if you\u2019re seeing any implementation effects and why you took the impairment? And overall, what sort of OpEx you\u2019re running through the P&L this year? And how you expect that to progress over the next couple of years?","Frank Lonegro","Hi Brian, it's Frank, thanks. In terms of the impairments about half of the 10 million impairments were in positive train control. The others were in literally smattering of technology projects that are necessarily consistent with Precision Scheduled Railroading and so we stop those. Back to the PTC, half of the equation, that was really divided into two parts. As we\u2019ve reduced the locomotive fleets and don't have plans to bring those back, some of the labor side that did on those engines for PTC won\u2019t be necessary. And therefore, we have to pull it out of the capital plan and roll it through the P&L. The other part was some signal design work that we did on portions of the railroad, based on the traffic flows that we anticipate as well as the THI flow that we anticipate. We won\u2019t necessary be upgrading those to PTC so we had to roll those through as well.","We\u2019ll continue to look at things obviously impairments are somewhat unusual. We don\u2019t have those on a routine basis. But as we look at the capital plan, don\u2019t follow, and as we look at the PTC footprint going forward and then maybe some, I don\u2019t know with any right now but there may be some. In terms of your OpEx question, I know there has been a lot of commentary on that recently based on some statements by CN this year in the UP. Let me tell you where we are from an OpEx perspective. Our OpEx on PTC has been ramping up for several years. Our full year 2017 will be a $150 million. Now that is the cumulative impact of a ramp up since about 2009 on the OpEx side. And the cash piece of that is about one-third, the depreciation piece of that is about two-thirds.","When you look at the cash piece, it\u2019s really as our corporate phone bill goes up because it\u2019s a very heavy communications type system that phone bill keeps going up. So, we\u2019ve got some piece of that in hardware, software and maintenance and support, as we go forward would be the other part with cash piece. We likely will have a terminal run rate in 20-20 of around $200 million to $250 million. And again, I think that's split between depreciation and cash expenses will be roughly the same. And Cindy can talk about where we are on the project.","Cindy Sanborn","Yes, we\u2019re about 40% of our PTC miles are in service at this point. We feel very comfortable that we\u2019ll have a majority of our -- certainly our commitment by 2018 to be hardware complete and continued implement of subdivisions, as we progress from this year and next year and into the 20-20.","Brian Ossenbeck","Thanks frank. I know you\u2019ve spent a lot of time on PTC in the prior role. So just to confirm it 200 to 250 kind of annual rate split between OpEx and D&A, so it\u2019s kind of an all-in expense costs given the network?","Frank Lonegro","And Brian just to tell you, it's kind of a terminal run rate and like 2020 or 2021.","Brian Ossenbeck","Right, right. Okay. Great. And then just a quick follow-up on the high level market view. We\u2019ve seen the U.S. dollar on a trade-weighted basis basically declined ever since the beginning of the year. I think it\u2019s down almost 7% or 8%, as we stand right now year-to-date. So, Fredrik, what -- what are you seeing in terms of the various puts and takes after the obvious in export coal? When does that decline start to become more of a benefit and start to show up and grabs some more exports and probably fewer disruptive imports?","Fredrik Eliasson","Yes, I think we\u2019ve been encouraged to see other fact that IDP to begin with is showing a little bit of strength versus what we've seen in the last couple of years. And clearly part of that is also the dollar has helped some of the U.S. exporters. You paid on the export coal side clearly a weaker dollar helpful there. And I think as we look at some of the other markets, we will see some of those benefits. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen a lot of it yet, but anytime we have a little bit of weaker dollar, it does help them. So, I do expect to see that as we move forward.","Operator","Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup. Your line is open.","Chris Wetherbee","Hi, great. Thanks. Good morning. Hunter, I want to touch a little bit on sort of expectations and maybe cadence of improvement. Your points earlier were well received in terms of peoples. The expectations that what we might see this quarter, but maybe you could help us sort of understand a little bit, how some of the changes that you\u2019ve been implementing early on in the process here. Ultimately, play out sort of in the physical world in terms of closing hump yards, obviously working with the employee group and generating that productivity. Just wanted to get a sense of maybe how we can start thinking about that, as we move into the second half of the year?","Hunter Harrison","I appreciate your question, Chris. That\u2019s good question, I was going to raise -- you have raised the question. One, you should think about sensitivity of your plan. When we make a operating decision to reduce expense or change the operation, say maybe in early April, we might not see the benefit net-net in the P&L still in August or September, depending on collective bargaining agreements, and depending on the tax treatment, and all those various things coming to play. So, we can take certain actions and we know exactly when those benefits will start kicking in. It\u2019s a little difficult and it\u2019s kind of for me here it\u2019s a learning experience. It\u2019s kind of different everywhere you go, but the trust of what we have talked about that we are trying to do, it hasn\u2019t changed at all.","We\u2019re down -- and look after, I\u2019m not restricting my numbers to second quarter. This is just kind of where we stand today or where we see ourselves to return. We\u2019re down about 900 locomotives now it\u2019s certainly not over and probably clearly go to a 1,000. I\u2019m not sure where it\u2019s going to stop. We\u2019re now depending on the way you look at the way you whether you include store or not, but the way I look at it if you look at the active inventory, we\u2019re down about 60,000 freight cars from where we were earlier in the year of 200,000 again to 135,000 or 140,000.","I think that we have emphasized that we -- this is more of the team and me, but I think from hump standpoint, I think we started off somewhere I think 12. The number is quite about some round. Humps and I think, we think we\u2019re going to end up probably within the next year. We\u2019ll end up with three, it could be two or it could be four, but in that range a significant drop in the number of humps. And I would add to that is that look, those humps that we\u2019ve taken had a service hump, doesn\u2019t mean we have to sell all the land and throughout the year and I'd hope t hat on day post-Harrison that this company is going. But we\u2019re going to see growth in the merchandise side where we did and maybe there be a time into the future.","So you know we are going to keep hope on. We\u2019re not -- we\u2019re not having a dry sale here. I think that as result of some of those things, the capital spend over the next several years unless there is opportunity to come up and at this point I am aware of that we will come down pretty significantly from what has been in the plan forward. I think this year we are going to be down $500 million or so. Yes, there will be $100 million this year, when you look at year-over-year basis versus where we end up last year we close for $600 million. Somewhere in that neighborhood and I would expect, that\u2019s going to -- the reason that we\u2019re going to be able to take that all day obviously on locomotives, rolling stock and lot of things that going to support that.","That\u2019s going to help obviously free cash flow, pretty significantly, which I think -- I think my personal view is, we should certainly have some influence on the board when they make the decision to authorize the additional buyback that if some will be done, financed internally and with operating expense reduction. Yes, we\u2019ll basically with one exception, all the operating metrics are trending and hitting in the right direction, very, very encouraging. If you are a headcount person, I think the headcount as we are seeing today -- I am not doing this quarter-over-quarter, but we stand today about I think 2,300 -- again that\u2019s now somewhere we are trying to set some record with, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if before the years that is a lot things come together that could be 3,000.","So, when I look at that, I look at my past experience in this business, and I\u2019m just saying that\u2019s hell of course. I hated these amount of people, but I'd say that\u2019s all I guess and but there is other opportunities that we will for us. And the team is coming together, and clearly you\u2019re going to ask this question, so I\u2019ll try to address. What\u2019s the bigger challenge that we get? One of the bigger challenges we have is what I was talking to you about before and it\u2019s the change, it\u2019s the change, it\u2019s the cultural change, and that\u2019s difficult for organization to go further. And we are having a little bit there ourselves. And at all levels, you saw that, this was right prior to my arrival. So, I think I should refer that our friends in either way. I'm a neutral with just a 1,000 people, but I did take note that they were -- I think effectively all management people.","There were no Indians if you were Indianan so we didn't take away from what was being done to the business plan. And I think our view going forward will put us in a position we don\u2019t have to replace those. Now, on the operate side, do we have a few guess, yes. If that's the address, yes, I think our human resource group along with Cindy and others here in the team are sensitive to that. I think we've recruited -- they know better than I, but 15 or so people that we think are top notch, high potential, very honest from various background and various locale. And so I think that there's something we can solve and deal with.","And there's a lot of things in the bucket, so if I let with that, this is back and review and had a look at second quarter I got to be pretty excited and I got to be excited about third and fourth and three or four years out. You know the other plan, the live plan on this report is, you all said I couldn't get it done in four years and now you owe me because I can get it done in four months, so the bar's been raised here but I'm ready for the challenge.","Chris Wetherbee","Sure enough, that's a very comprehensive and helpful answer, I appreciate that. You know the follow-up would just be in terms of initial customer reactions and sort of how you might think about the business from the volume standpoint, as you also progress through that sort of cost and operational efficiency efforts, as we go through the rest of the year. Have you been surprised? Has it been more negative or sort of more expected in terms of the reaction from customers? And sort of what you've been sort of pushing off the network potentially, as maybe some stuff has potentially moved competitively or otherwise? Just want to get a sense of how customers are sort of viewing that initial changes at the Company?","Hunter Harrison","Well, let me comment and then I'll let Frederick comment. This is not -- it's not a lot different what I expected. You know customers are like other people, a lot of them don't like change. I've spent some time with them myself, it's hard to find with them on the telephone and face-to-face. And I've tried to explain to them where we're going, why we're going there, what's important about it. And to get there we have to go through this change. And so there's going to be a little pain and suffering. I don't know frankly how to get there without some busting road. This is not just something you could try to switch on. So, I think most of them, by far the majority are pretty sympathetic, I heard that some not bow out with them and look.","We look forward to this changes coming in and we limited to suffer a couple of bruises along the way. Just don't bruise us up too much and I think with -- with a couple of exceptions, it's been typical of what you might think and expect. Look, nobody loves them okay, so we\u2019re going to have people out there in dollar and second guess, but I don't -- when the bottom-line comes to end, I don\u2019t think anybody is going to change businesses, plus or minus, they're doing that. They're going to do it, yes. If we provide this service, we talk about. If we make the improvement that we\u2019ve made, we\u2019ll be rewarded. If we don\u2019t, we won\u2019t and it\u2019s the way it works. I am not asking, we're not asking anybody going in the business just because we need it. We\u2019re going to work hard to earn it and I think we can -- I don\u2019t think any of those issues our instruments.","Fredrik Eliasson","No, I mean I would say that I noticed about transit time and it\u2019s about reliability. And if we look at transit time as an example, if I look at the scheduled merchandized network and coal network and in all network, if I compare transit time here in the second quarter versus the fourth quarter, they\u2019re all improved and clearly will go through a lot of change. Cindy and my team are working through that with customers where we are impacting them specifically and trying to fine tune the operating model, and making sure that ultimately we reach with what Hunter, as we're clear about that we\u2019re going to get a better service product for our customer because, not only is that better for the customers, but it is also better for CSX.","Operator","Next, we will take a question from Tom Wadewitz from UBS. Your line is open sir.","Tom Wadewitz","Yes, great. Good morning. So, Hunter, I just wanted to get a sense. Do you refer that I think all the metric to move in the right way except one. I don\u2019t know if the one you\u2019re referring to is well timed. But when I look at the dwell time at some of the yards, I see numbers that are kind of 40 to 50 hours which to me is unusual. You know, I normally think 20 to 30 hours kind of typical dwell time. I know you made pretty dramatic changes in converting hump yards to flat twitching. So, how would you characterize kind of the progression, you know. April and May were really good. June seemed to be a little bit of a pause. Are dwell time numbers that concern and how should we look at things in third quarter? Does that -- those numbers come down, so if you can just help us with the forward look and also what\u2019s happening in the dwell time, I would appreciate it? Thank you.","Hunter Harrison","Sure. Tom, there's a lot of people who don't understand the dwell time in my view. In this model of ours scheduled precision railroading, the challenge is not to get the dwell time as well as we can go. It's the planned dwell time and you hit the place, so you don\u2019t hurry up and wait. Spend money you don\u2019t need to spend just to create some dwell 18 hours instead of 20, if there is no real through safest opportunity there. So, this is not how well you can go, this is look, let's just say, we're at 20 forward today or 5 and it was our -- but let\u2019s just say that, as we run all this plan out and say how should the cars dwell at these various tunnels, that continue to exist for example.","And you say what kids dwell time need? Should it be 21 hours? Should it be 19 hours? What is the dwell time? Now, what some people on the outside looking indoor and saying, as they look at and say, the dwell time is up an hour, god, that\u2019s a horrible trend. So, wait a minute we\u2019re going through one terminal instead of three. So, we do really go through three terminals at 26 hours or one at 27. All they said, we're late and get in it and that's the dwell understanding. That's why we're trying to answer your question.","So, now, as we said that, a lot of things as they dwell, if we have too many cars in inventory and if it's slow period business wise or if it\u2019s a holiday period. What happens to the cars? They dwell because there is not -- there is not a need, a demand for it. That\u2019s a little bit our fault by having maybe too many cars in supply chain to pipeline, whatever you might want to call it. But all those things effect dwell, so look there is going to be 4th July, although we would like people to work 365, they don't do it. We do. Can you imagine if the railroads did? We're going take every Saturday and Sunday off like normal people, and we\u2019re going to have our time off -- we're not at the work every day. The impact that it will have economically to this continent, I am telling you, I've seen numbers and that's enough to put us in a depression. I'll tell you that.","So, we\u2019re going to have period with holidays. So, the dwell time as a gross number, we've known from 26 to 25 doesn't a concern me. Now, if I see, Tom, what you have mentioned 40 or 50 hours is certainly worth of the second load to be sure that we know why that is existing. Is it because of service failures? Is it because of operations that we're not doing? What we need to do? And then we will get in with those terminals and correct them. But when we get these the hump stop that\u2019s doesn\u2019t mean that the whole yard is going to close down.","But I mean significantly may a place we're working 12 or 15 assignments, will go to two or three plus the fact that we don\u2019t have to replace the equipment and a lot of things that busted the humping operation. You will see the dwell time come down and that will come down because we can take the product down consistently. So, we're giving three days service and we do those things and we get to two and the dwell time will change to the standard of two, not what it was before. So that a little commentary of dwell.","Tom Wadewitz","Okay, thank you. And second question would be on the -- I guess a full-year guidance when you consider the upside in second quarter -- if you including the $0.64, it seems that it's a conservative expectation for second half. I mean, assuming, just kind of putting some revenue numbers in, I get a, call it, 67 OR in second half, maybe 66.5, 67, which seems that it implies you wouldn't have much sequential improvement. I know there is seasonality, but I'm just wondering is it appropriate to say maybe there's some element of conservative in the full-year guide? Or is it appropriate to say, well, it just take some time to see the OR improve and don't expect a lot of sequential improvement in the second half?","Hunter Harrison","Well, I think you have to be real sensitive to the timing. Now, I just kind made a case that a lot of actions we took in the second quarter, we haven\u2019t seen come to the bottom lines yet. But they are going to come to the bottom line in third and fourth quarter, and they are not in that headline. So, one of the things I think we're all doing, and I've done at everyone's turnaround is that, for lack of a better turn, we're dealing with the leap of faith. Because I am saying to the team when you do one thing, and they are saying we have never done it before, show me. So, we are going through that phase. And I'm pretty comfortable and I know Frank is shifting hips over here on as I start to say this. I'm very comfortable -- have I ever been wrong, I've been wrong before not many times, but I've been wrong. Then I think, if I know exactly where I guided to then we are going to be somewhere around -- if you talk about clean quarter then we could talk about all that.","We are going to be in the range mid 60s, which could be 66, could be 60 forward. I think we are going to be in plus free cash flow. I think the earnings are going to be pretty damn good year-over-year. So, I think it's pretty realistic. What I do think is this I think we are all and me including short selling ourselves a little bit because we are really not seeing these recruits and some these cultural change. We are not really giving all the credit there. And those I mean we have brought a couple of people in. We think in this organization is -- but I'm telling you they have made huge different one individual, huge. Million dollar of difference, now you don\u2019t run upon it every day, okay, there is not a Michael Jordan on every street corner in Chicago or North Carolina. But if you can get more into that there, it really helps think I suppose to set up a group of player.","Operator","Your next question is from Allison Landry of Credit Suisse.","Allison Landry","I just wanted to follow up on the headcount. Hunter, you mentioned earlier you are taking -- today you stand at a reduction of about 2,300 employees. Does that include the 1,000 management positions that were --?","Hunter Harrison","Yes.","Allison Landry","And then Frank, on the contractors, could you -- how many do you guys currently have employed?","Frank Lonegro","Well, we haven\u2019t published that number yet, but let me give you a sense of what we are going to do and then let me give you a sense of where we are. What we are looking to do and Hunter's given some really good guidance on this one is to, look at what can be in sourced economically and being able to absorb that over the existing employee population or do some sort of conversion factor two to one, three to one something like that where we can take two or three contracts out for every employee that we might add. So, you obviously see that flow through on the MS&O line. And then you may also see, I'll call it lesser degree of comp for employee takeout or comp for workforce takeout on the MS&O line, and then you might see on the labor line. What Hunter said on the first quarter call was, we would be down an incremental 1,000 in addition to the 1,000 that we did through the management restructuring.","And that second 1,000 that we mentioned was going to be accommodation of management, union, and contractors, I would tell you that we are through that. We've made great progress and the Hunter's point around making him about a 3,000 number by the end of the year against the 2,300 where we are now. I mean we'll continue to work on all three of those elements through converting contractors. We'll look at the resources that we need in the field to run the operating fine, and we'll certain look at continuing to manage attrition as tightly as we can. So, I think all of those things continue to see sequential improvement in account. And as we get to a point where we had good year-over-year comparables for you on the contractors and consultants, we'll begin to publish that one, and it could be as early as the Investor Conference, but certainly be as of the first in the year.","Hunter Harrison","Okay, let me in fact just add a little comment and context to that. And what I'm trying to encourage and organization is trying to do to absorb the business. If I go back one of our proudest moments was at Illinois Central. And we after some financial engineering and I became CEO, we settled in and we had a little railroad that had 3,000 employees in an 80 operating ratio. And two years later, we had 3,000 employees and we had an operating ratio of 62. The issue is this, it's not that it then people would say, what had you do there, what was it different? We allowed those 3,000 people to create value. We gave them opportunities and that's what that's a much better story. It's much better bottom line if you can say, look this is not about stripping heads out, it's just taking valuable people and allowing them to add value to the organization in the most effective, efficient way it can be done, by doing it with internal people, have to get in the buyouts and all this other stuff. So, that's kind of the road we hit in down.","Allison Landry","Okay, that makes a lot of sense. Hunter, you also made some comments earlier, which I think were alluding to long-term share gains in merchandise. So I guess should we be thinking about that similar to where CP is now? In other words, does CSX eventually shift from a cost improvement story to a top-line growth story? And do you expect those share gains to come primarily from truck or are there any opportunities that you see for CSX to take share in merchandise from your competitor?","Hunter Harrison","That's a hell of a question. Number one, yes, we want to see CSX for a while. Number two, one of the levers that'll help us grow is low cost and efficiency. So, there's going to be a continual drive and a hopefully compatibility between those two numbers. So that if we lose the sense of our cost, we lose the ability into -- we've to go to business as effective as we like. Where can we gain the all share, clearly in my views off the house. There is something in the competition and these folks remember better than I know more about that. But look, the focus is not at least in my view at this point, not the rail competition, it's the highway, okay. We kind of although we let jealousies getting here from times to time, we go to Canada and you said the three words depending on what part of country you in and people just go nuts. They're emotional about it.","But the big opportunity is on the highway. We will have -- I think with those I just described is jump all business without competitors. They don't have railroads. Their good railroad is just competition and we will have non-compete. That\u2019s where I guess a good capital system thereabout. But the key is that we really and really gotten this service factor. We have to understand that. We have to appreciate that. We have to understand that it's difficult people change in to some degree. It's going to take along, but that\u2019s where a railroad the last 40 years, as last the big market share, that\u2019s the most probably all in, some of the most profitable business we have. And I'm not trying to say to you that, we are going to see some rapid growth over the next 15 or 16 months. And a lot of this will probably happen in the post-Harrison era. I think, if we do our job today in laying the foundation, there will be a lot of opportunities to grow.","Operator","We have our next question from Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, [ma'am].","Amit Mehrotra","Wanted to get a sense of the performance I guess in the quarter relative to your own expectations. You have kept full-year guidance unchanged. There's maybe over $100 million of benefit in the quarter that may be considered extraordinary in nature. If you could just talk a little bit about that in terms of maybe how your near-term assumptions have changed, if at all. And then as it relates to the second half, it looks like the guidance implies something like $300 million of year-over-year incremental profit improvement in the second half year over year, despite revenue that looks to be flat or down. Can you just offer some color there in terms of one, your confidence in delivering that, and then maybe what the drivers are? Thanks a lot.","Frank Lonegro","Sure, so a lot of the questions last night really asked us, at least implicitly, did we know about these things? And when you're dealing with the 10-year plus condemnation litigation, that\u2019s coming to a conclusion you know about it. When you have a liquidated damages dispute, that\u2019s coming to a conclusion, you will know about it. The exact timing that we know which quarter it was going to follow in and I know that we know whether it was going to be 2017, we thought so. But we want to 100% sure, so all of these or in contemplation.","We are probably experiencing a bit more inflation this year than we were originally expecting the tax rate probably little bit higher than we were expecting. Fuel price solution, the first half of the year was probably higher than we were expecting. So, there is a bunch this happening, just like every quarter and every year there is lots of moving parts. So, all of this was in contemplation as we thought about the guidance and one of the reasons why we gave you a range of guidance was because you never know which way the pluses and the minuses are ultimately are going to go.","Turing to the second half, I think which you're going to see is an improvement in sequential productivity, when you think about a $90 million in Q2 and you look at the record productivity guidance and you given you again that against the $427 million that we delivered in 2016 when you do the math real quick you realize that we got to be at least as good in the second half, if not better in order to hit that target and obviously we have a lot of confidence and our ability to do that, so you should see sequential ramp and productivity between Q2 and Q3. And again Fredrick and his team are doing everything on the customer side to bring in more prices and to price it appropriately. So our teams are going to run the railroad better and better on a quarter over quarter basis, so looks like about second half.","Amit Mehrotra","Right. But just quick follow-up on that. I guess the productivity, the way I think about it, is it shows up on the bottom line when revenue and volumes are a little bit more cooperative. They certainly were in the first half, partly due to easier comps and then some tailwinds on the coal side, too. In the second half, you don't really have those tailwinds. Hopefully you will, but it doesn't seem like you will in the second half. So can those productivity savings actually drop to the bottom line when revenue growth is zero or negative in the second half?","Frank Lonegro","Yes.","Amit Mehrotra","Okay. Okay, I will leave it there. One quick question on the capital structure. You have caveated your comment by saying that you want to keep the balance sheet investment grade. Can you just give us a sense on what actually constitutes investment grade? Is it two times growth or net debt to EBITDA? So if we could get a sense of maybe the firepower the Company has, I guess, to optimize the balance sheet, which is I assume what you are trying to do for the benefit of shareholders. Thanks.","Frank Lonegro","Sure, obviously we go with the same Moody and S&P ratings that you all follow very closely, you know where those ranges are. Really what we did was took a fresh look at the balance sheet, we took a fresh look at leverage in the implicit ratios based on the free cash flow for the year are going forward basis. We got obviously new CEO and Hunter, we constituted board, we got the shareholder vote behind us or lot of things really said, time to take a look at the capital structure and we want to provide the maximum flexibility for the management team and the board to way in on those issues. So we though like it was appropriate during this period of revaluation, I'm sure that we won\u2019t tie to anything specifically.","Amit Mehrotra","Given the momentum you have on the profit growth and the cash flow growth, I mean is there any has other agencies told you or given some guidance around what perimeters, maximum perimeters if you're willing to accept in terms still keep it investment grade.","Frank Lonegro","They have.","Amit Mehrotra","Can you share those with us please?","Frank Lonegro","No, you know where the ratios are, you know where the boundary lines are and obviously we're currently rated triple B plus, AA1. You know, what is that one step down looks like, what two steps down look like, all of those are in contemplation, so we report back to you on that one as we make those decisions and it could be as early as the investor conference or certainly as we turn the page into calendar 2018.","Operator","Ravi Shankar of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ravi Shankar","If I can just maybe follow up to that last response. And Hunter, not to steal your thunder, but can you just help us frame the topics of discussion in terms of the broad agenda for the investor day? What can we expect to hear? What do you expect to learn or are going to progress through between now and then that you can share with us at the event?","Hunter Harrison","What do you want to hear? We'll give you a menu. No, seriously look, we'll spend a lot of time in then. I tell you it\u2019s not going to be a restatement of all the number you heard today. We\u2019re going to peel back the onion a little bit. We\u2019re going to start taking that while our hump yard had worked today like we used 50 years. We\u2019re going to talk you that, that your economy of scale with that. We\u2019re going to talk you about while we\u2019re able to use locomotives more objectively than some others and some of the techniques. And I guess, it\u2019s kind of hopefully a restatement obtain, we have no a little bit of that over doing here. We got a pretty good track record and we\u2019re going to try to reinforce would be. And at the same time have a little fun and enjoy ourselves and that\u2019s the objective.","And I\u2019m sure that each time, we\u2019ve done this. I\u2019d say they have been rather successful couple of puts and takes and now were change a little bit, but it\u2019s too late for that. But I think they have been very helpful in new representatives of our shareholders. For example when they ask you, I don\u2019t understand this why, if they closed hump yard in order to buy that's a good deal or what that you had some knowledge and understanding and appreciation for that. And so that\u2019s our intent, but I would certainly say to you that, if you have to request that you like us to consider of addressing, we\u2019d love to hear them. David, I am sure would love to hear it. We\u2019ll try to address those things.","Ravi Shankar","But it sounds like a great event. But would you have made enough progress by then to give us like longer-term OR targets and balance sheet targets?","Hunter Harrison","Yes. Certainly, the trends will be there. You can see what we're doing. I don\u2019t know, you won\u2019t have wait and say, we're going to have a validation meeting, but you think it is. When you all are going to satisfy that everything is validate, it would be hard as bleach.","Ravi Shankar","Understood. Just as a follow-up, just an end-market question on autos. You guys clearly identified that as a market with a negative near-term outlook for obvious reasons. Can you just help us understand kind of the puts and takes behind decremental margins? And what you can do on the order side if SAR were to decline sharply from here?","Fredrik Eliasson","I think historically we\u2019ve been moving very much in line with the automotive production as done and obviously it\u2019s been a great seven or eight years here, we\u2019re righting enough and here we\u2019ve seen a little bit of softening as expected. And then we will monitor that very closely as going forward. We do have the opportunity as this part of our scheduled merchandise network to monitor that and make appropriate changes to plan and see certain areas where tailings gets impacted. So, like any other part of our business, Cindy and team, and Hunter has an operating plan that is flexible enough to be able to address that\u2019s make sure, we don\u2019t lose any of the productivity gains that we have gotten so far and that we\u2019re contemplating the future.","Operator","Next we have a question from Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch. Thank you, sir.","Ken Hoexter","Hunter, I just want to clarify or may be just Frank, just including the two gains. Should we reassess reducing the second half targets? Or Frank, were you suggesting before that, that this was in your kind of originally thoughts and the implied savings in the second half should continue to scale?","Frank Lonegro","Yes and yes.","Ken Hoexter","Okay. So, yes, no I got that. So when you say yes to that first one, you are reducing second half or you are not reducing second half?","Frank Lonegro","No, I mean what we were thinking at the beginning of the year, yes, was to change our internal view of the second half, no, while we continue to see productivity accelerate and gains et cetera continue in second half, yes.","Ken Hoexter","Okay.","Hunter Harrison","You can appreciate where we are. I mean I didn\u2019t know about them. So, if you don't know them, you can't figure them in. But this is what I saw this is what gets us into that leap of faith there, okay. And look, I appreciate that Frank and others in this organization, there needs to be some checking balances. I just don\u2019t mean by checking need, but there are some issues internally of saying and we get there. And we make it and there is a tendency, and you all have accused us of this before and I don't think that we were guilty of being conservative or sandbagging or whatever. I am telling it that my numbers that you hear me talk, not official guidance, let's put in those terms.","We don\u2019t determine whether the quarter is clean or not, clearly speaking, there is principles, there is GAAP, there is rules and regs that says, you get to check, you got report to check. Now, it's not like we got draw again -- I used to accuse the CFOs of having a left-hand bottom drawer and they get down there anytime they needed and they could come up with miracle. You learned that but it's not like that. But I think that what I said to you to more of the questions, it\u2019s more of the operating metrics.","I am not a big, well, it\u2019s easy comp, what the hell with the comp, the comp has gone it's none. We got a number that says we have to be it that gross tons, miles available horsepower, no matter what it was last year. If it was over the last year we look better but our standards says our be 100% better I am not being influenced, I am not going to be influenced but easy comps, be influenced that\u2019s something else but I think there\u2019s a little bit of just planned if known here and look if we keep precise and hit this thing right on the return, thumbs are on.","Ken Hoexter","Appreciate that. If I talk a follow up on the maybe the competitive environment a little bit. You talked your thoughts on where things, but any competitive response from your peers in response to your cost cutting or may be strength in the truck market, are you seeing any strengthening in the pricing on the intermodal, if you can talk about the competitive market response?","Hunter Harrison","Let me comment and then I'll turn on Fredrik to be the expert here. My statement is a little -- I've been all over this continent and I go here and I get here and I say what's the competition doing having the kamikaze pricing, they're killing the market, they're putting us under, and I leave and I go over there and they said what are those guys doing you left, ah kamikaze pricing so given this way I don\u2019t know so I don't know where we are there.","I do know that you know back to my point about competition. Look, then I go lay down to those where I can laid into this. We're going to be as aggressive as we can be and I say that as we can be because we're going to be disciplined. Cause we're going to you know, a lot of companies can get it to the top-line. That's not the hard part. The hard part is getting into the top-line and there'll be something there we can get to the bottom. So we're trying to you know fulfill both of those and Frederick is much more qualified than I to talk specifically about those markets and competition, so Frederick why don't you.","Frederick Eliasson","Sure, so I mean all our customers had options so ultimately it goes back to the fundamental thing that we're trying to do, system scheduled railroading which is to make sure we improve our transit time and improve our reliability, and we are in early stages of that specifically right now to competition I think the key thing it's been a tough transportation environment for several quarters now in terms of pricing to their market and generally this is about truck competition, there is a lot of excess truck competition.","Fortunately though as we look at the market over the last few months and we've seen some signs of tightening capacity. I think the combination of tightening capacity environment does move into the second part of this year and early 2018 coupled with what we are expected to do from a service perspective should lead to a 2018 that is good from a top-line perspective and as I said ultimately this is all about providing a service to our customers that they want to use day-in and day-out. Because if we do that I think it's less relevant what our competition either on the rail side or the truck side is doing.","Operator","Brandon Oglenski of Barclays.","Brandon Oglenski","Hey, good morning everyone and thanks for getting my question on. Hunter you know earlier in the call you talked about challenges inside the organization to change and how you know you have seen that at your prior leadership position. Can you talk about how that progresses and how you brought your team together and you know how that plays out from a financial perspective as we go through over the next year or two.","Hunter Harrison","Well, one of the things we did as a group is convince me and they did not me that we got to do some hard camp. People really got to understand what we're trying to do and do it awful fast and that's very important component here. To be very-very frank with you, we have just had said people you have to change, you got to get things that maybe you didn\u2019t expect on doing in the past, but you got to get with it and if you can't get with it then we got to do something different and we'll try to treat you in the most humane manner possible, but look we got a responsibility to the shareholders and our customers and our other employees with this, we can't carry this way.","If I have got to do their job, if I've got to do their part and that's a tough assignment for a leader to do and what we are talking to talk about leadership. One of the things I talked about as the hardest part for a great leader to do and where they fail and what makes the real difference is the ability to make a tough decision. Nobody likes to call in [indiscernible] and say that you can\u2019t use it anymore. I know anybody that plays around that and enjoys it. It\u2019s hard, it\u2019s difficult somebody has got to do it.","So we have been very honest and straightforward with the people about what the expectations are. We try to display and add the appropriate amount of patience with people knowing that look I\u2019m not saying which strategy this company has had over the years was right along. You know except a lot of different mergers, people have been exposed to a lot of operating philosophies and it\u2019s just confusing to them. So you know yes its flexible.","You know I learn that early on in my career, get a new team and new leader and he comes in and we are going to play this game different and blow up a little bit and then put to you and you can make than change, you get to stay and be a player [indiscernible] and so you make a change. So I think we try to be honest with people and I think they know what is expected of them. But they also know with understanding that its difficult and that\u2019s what I think is the difference in organization.","Look, you know if you look at the real business, we all get the same locomotives and same gauge and same signal [indiscernible] all the things in similar markets. Nobody gets some huge handle in the market. What is different about the organization is people and leadership, and how they respond and how lead people and you know that\u2019s why in spite of the fact that we have been criticized, maybe I shouldn\u2019t say we have been, I had been criticized for creating cultures of fear or whatever.","And that\u2019s not what we are trying to do, that\u2019s not part of the mission and in spite of this people are saying why are you approaching all my people. And I\u2019m saying a lot of the more come over here, if we get this culture fear and we are so demanding and unreasonable why would they ever want will leave that lovely level of yours and come to mine, maybe you have to look at your whole part.","I\u2019m not into the specific about anybody, I\u2019m just saying that we have no one to my knowledge working at CSX that can\u2019t get released. If there are some, they\u2019ve got some hands cuffs on, I don\u2019t know that, I got the key to the hand cuffs. So if they don\u2019t want to work here, I don\u2019t need them. If they want to go to someplace else, that\u2019s where they are able to go. It\u2019s kind of a free market, [indiscernible] is about except when you get into the non-compete and have expert there if you need any advice, so that\u2019s kind of where we are there.","Brandon Oglenski","I appreciate that insight Hunter and if I can respectfully ask the question on top-line, because like it or not, there is a perception among investors and maybe some of your prior colleagues that you worked with that, your focus is not really on the customer and you have mentioned it a couple of times today, the post Hunter era you hope CSX grows a little bit more. But I\u2019m trying to line that up with Fredrik\u2019s comments about next year and you guys, I think did win some contracts this quarter. How do we think about the focus on top-line, is that part of the plan over the next couple of years Hunter or should we just be thinking we got to get service and cost in the right place, then we can grow beyond?","Hunter Harrison","So, I think, Fredrik, [Indiscernible] to join in the different here. Look, to be successful we have got to hit top-line growth to get you always recall. When people can make mark with us in the late 90s and why was our operating ratio was to be here in Eastern Canada. So well when they saw that we were price increase, they should keep both operating wise and it suppose to be [Indiscernible].","So I learned early on, that this a balancing act between cost and service. I have got in all respect in one of the places that\u2019s still on I think, that goes back to days when I was first being taught about controlling calls and it was amount of sales that shows one side service, once side cost. You got to keep that in balance, if you spend too much and providing this premium service it\u2019s a market they don\u2019t want to everyone pay for, you won\u2019t make any money and vice versa. So to be honest with you, I get a little sensitive about my remarks.","Going back to the track record, I went to being - there they didn\u2019t have a great representation about service and they didn\u2019t have to pay their bills, but they have good reputation about service. Look at what had the top-line grew, I guess in spite all of their actions with customers through top-line pretty good. I don\u2019t think is anywhere we have been that we get to see top-line growth and I look at some of the places that I have come to and I aint seen anybody that\u2019s had any crazy outperformance of top-line growth.","I just think that\u2019s something that you know if at all they don\u2019t like you, they don\u2019t listen anything, [indiscernible] well, they are not sensitive to customer and I was talking to [Indiscernible] and I think this is right, I have never had anybody say, who it was, when it was, where it was, it\u2019s just the perception you still like customers. I don\u2019t buy into that so I don\u2019t think any of that when in spite of the fact they might not like me. Even in spite of that when this company puts best service out there at the right cost structure we will get the business, this is not like the old days and you can argue that\u2019s just relationship spending - days that where the relationship is that all made dollar for you. So Fredrick.","Frederick Eliasson","I'll just add I think ultimately there is actually nothing in consistent with precision scheduled railroading and being customer focus is what is challenging in short-term is just a change and that\u2019s what our team is out there selling right now. Because there is a lot of change so this un linear in terms of the improvements that we have seen. If all be although we still have seen improvement in terms of transit by first quarter to second quarter.","And ultimately as we go through change, we feel confident and we have seen some early signs of it that we will have a superior service product to sell thought we have before that\u2019s why I don\u2019t see - and I talked about our customers over the last six months or so that have had precision scheduled railroading experience. And ultimately the feedback is almost consistent from all of them, which is that once you get through the period of change we get to better service products. Then I think while Cindy and I are very much focused and aligned around that as where our team is out there selling to our customers as well.","Cindy Sanborn","Yes, I would echo that more of a core tenants of our model here is do what you say you are going to do. And that is 100% focused on the customer. I think Fredrik you mentioned we are going through some transition here that is problematic, but looking at the model how it works I'm extremely confident that this model will work well, it will work well for this company and it will drive not just cost production it will drive superior customers as well.","Operator","Our next question will come from Cherilyn Radbourne of TD Securities.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Thanks very much and good morning. Wanted to dig into one of the changes to the train plan has been mentioned which is incorporating committee unit train business into the car loads network, can you give us an examples of what commodities that\u2019s been appropriate for and talk about how that influence same link service and balance and go forward?","Cindy Sanborn","So let me go back a little bit to drive some context. So you recall variable train scheduling, merchandise business that was really just our scheduled network and we drove train links as a result of that. And as Hunter came along and we talked about precision scheduled railroading and we look that opportunities where we had overlap on the same sub division where we had a rock train, maybe a metals train, occupying that same territory and generally speaking the quarry or loading facility did not load a full train and very few number of hours they were loading a portion of the train in a different line.","And so as we looked at the opportunity to incorporate that in the merchandise network then that allowed us to go to seven day train operation, incorporate those commodities into that merchandise train and drive train links that way with very consistent service and then as you mentioned and talk of that then alone as another layer onto the concept of how do we make sure we have the same number of trains going east and west or north and south depending on where we are to allow even more efficiencies in terms of locomotives and full utilization of our people. So that\u2019s an example of where and types of commodities that has worked for us, and we see pretty good progress with that. And I think its driving some good efficiency and Fredrik can comment on the impact.","Fredrik Eliasson","Yes, and I think there are certain where we have been very successful in that and has improved the cycle time for the customers and there are some places where we have yet to improve the cycle time. And we are still working through the customer to make sure we get the operating model I call fine tuning operating model to make sure that we provide a level of service that is needed and there are certain places where we are not there yet but we're relentless of trying to get there.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Great that\u2019s helpful color. Wanted to ask a quick one on coal RPU which was relatively stable versus the first quarter, notwithstanding some likely sequential moderation in the export coal rate. Can you just dig into some other moving parts on coal RPU for us?","Fredrik Eliasson","Yes, I think in the first quarter we mentioned, we had a plethora of things that was all moving in the right direction especially on the mixed side within both domestic side and the export side that all create a positive mix. As we think about the coal part for you components here in the second quarter, export prices is the biggest driver there albeit probably not to the same degree we saw in the first quarter and we don\u2019t have as much mix improvements as we saw and that\u2019s just luck of a draw so to speak, in each and every quarter its different depending on who, which utility wants more coal and where do we go in terms of different export terminals. So really the key driver for coal RPU this quarter was clearly the export pricing.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Thank you. That\u2019s all for me.","Operator","Thank you. Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Scott Group","Thanks good morning guys, just a few quick ones. Frank can you just clarify, do you have any liquidated damages in the guidance for the back half for the year or anything else unusual.","Frank Lonegro","No. If one comes up we will certainly lets you know but no.","Scott Group","Okay I would say always helpful to let us know in advance that would be great. Fredrik just on that coal yield, do you have any view on how much of the sequential drop we should expect in the third quarter and then just on the merchandize intermodal pricing number. Do you think that continues decelerate the back half for the year before, I guess you say we accelerate in 2018.","Fredrik Eliasson","When I look at my general counsels here, I'm going to make sure that I state that we never forecast price, but more important though, if you go to the coal side clearly it is a commodity market that is very volatile and we have made a decision strategically to align ourselves with the producers to go up and down with that curve, partly because what a level road and rail road's is much as possible.","Benchmarks have gone way in the export market but instead lot of index is set out there, that there are customers are we're using to determine, what sort of price we should use and I think you can follow those quite they are well top at size, so there is an opportunity to see what they will do and they will be based on what we're seeing right now obviously some impact.","On the merchandize and intermodal network as I said before, it has to be in the tough market for numerous quarter for year and half, two years now in terms of pricing and as that said, as I see the truck market tightening up which there are clear signs that it is and we go through this change period and really start improving the service product the way we expect, I think as you get through 2018 you have an opportunity on both merchandize and intermodal to turn this got a sequential decline around.","Scott Group","Okay that\u2019s helpful and then lastly for Hunter, I know you have got the Analyst Day coming up some, I don\u2019t know if you want to get too specific, but it felt like last quarter, on last quarter\u2019s call you sort of blast a low 60's operating ratio next year and 50's may be even mid 50's longer term. Anything three months later change in your mind on that directionally those kind of numbers.","Hunter Harrison","No, I felt very confident in, and I'm a four months out here so, but I feel even more confident than I did then, given that I've seen these additional four months of potential [indiscernible]. I think the numbers is just doing solid.","Scott Group","Okay. Thank you guys.","Operator","Thank you. Jeff Kauffman of Aegis Capital, your line is open sir.","Jeff Kauffman","Thank you very much. Just one brief question, Hunter as you have gotten deeper into the details, what have you found that you have been able to make greater traction on maybe then you would had anticipated coming in, and what have you found is going to be a bit of a longer haul or more complex process in terms of getting done the things you are looking to do?","Hunter Harrison","Well, clearly Jeff, I think nothing pretty obviously, but clearly this cultural change you call it what you want of the kind of a shift in strategy and at the same time I will go with the just turn my best on the obvious. There are some people that they are more pleased with this change, they more pleased with what we went through with the proxy fight, I tried to please with people during that time, that it's hard to fight one day or one week and then we also wanted one for all the next week.","So, we determine here with the best chemistry is [indiscernible] we are all in this together type thing. So, we've got some open wounds there, so that's a key because if we don't have the right leadership, driven the right way we are not going to get these things done, and the first part of the question was more of the opportunities that are even more than I thought initially well, obviously I didn\u2019t think or obviously I didn't, there was more opportunities with the up yards and I felt - I just had this general feeling about railroads that I've been associated with a lot of them in North America that had too many hubs.","So I think that that's the opportunity although it's not real easy to get to, was more than I had thought, we have an opportunity and I hadn\u2019t had a chance to spend a lot of time on this personally, but we need to improve our engineering productivity particularly on the capital side which impacts the capital spending more which people don't recognize, but I would rather put another tie and then I would have inefficiencies and not productivity in labor.","And I guess the other one that was not on my list at all, because I just was not familiar with the collective bargaining issues and so forth was to go in from the land dispatching officers to one central location. And I think to be confounded on just a minute, but I think the plan is to have that number first quarter of 2018.","Cindy Sanborn","That's correct.","Hunter Harrison","Which is that's all grade B from most and so I guess just some observations there Jeff.","Jeff Kauffman","All right. Cindy, Hunter thank you and we will see in October.","Hunter Harrison","Thanks Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. We have a question from David Vernon of Bernstein. Your line is open.","David Vernon","Hi. Good morning. And thanks for taking the time. Fredrik, are there any metrics on sort of customer satisfaction around service availability that you can share the couple of dimension is. And are there any segment in particular of it standout as is either being more or less happy with some of the changes that are happening at the customer touch points that are enabling some of these changes in this schedule?","Fredrik Eliasson","I mean I think we try to work through all parts of our network here in a very rapid pace in terms of making sure that we provide the service we want, with the cost structure that we want long-term. So, as we are encountering challenges from one customer group or one specific customer, we are trying to be as responsive as it possibly as can, as quickly as we can with Cindy.","We use JD Power to look at customer service and customer responsiveness and we continue to monitor that. We normally don\u2019t talk too much about that externally, but that is a gauge for us, just. But ultimately this comes down to reliability in transit time. And that\u2019s what we are trying to go through right now. And there will be pain points, we know that and we have communicated that to our customer, but the key thing is the responsiveness from Cindy and team that try to address whatever challenges that we see as quickly as it possibly can.","David Vernon","And can you help us dimensioned some of the changes in these metrics. Obviously I know you are not going to share your internal customer satisfaction scores. But I\u2019m just kind of struggling to trying to dimension how unhappy or unhappy this could be and where the source of revenue risk could be within the top-line?","Fredrik Eliasson","No, the specific competitive information we try to stay away from talking about that, but clearly what is the strange thing somebody service from unit train to schedule merchandize or when you go out and you change the network as significant as we changed in a very short period of time whether it\u2019s intermodal or merchandizes customers, there is going to be pain points.","And the key thing is that we are asking our customers to hang with us, and see what is ultimately on the rise and we look at the new schedules that should allow for better transit time, better reliability, but in the short-term we are out there on a daily basis out to our customers and kind of working through those changes and make sure they see where the light is at the end of the tunnel.","David Vernon","All right. I guess thanks for that. And Hunter, one of the broader questions we get asked a lot is, is what is the company being to do to make this precision railroading less just of Hunter Harrison competency and more of a CSX competency. If you think about the next sort of couple of years on the contract that you have with the company and which are going to be doing. What are the two or three tangible things that you think you need to do make sure this precision were already model becomes a CSX competency and is not as tied to you as it seems to be at the early going?","Hunter Harrison","Well, let me make this observation first, I mean this is not the first place that schedule precision railroads have been prior to exercise. It has a pretty good, not me it schedule precision railroading has a pretty good track record and its left pretty path. If you look at Illinois Central prior to bankruptcy doing whatever now that was a just a little small regional that ran down here with coals of so we don\u2019t count that.","And when you go to Canada the product does not need also went along with and it had a big positive influence on Canadian National and I would say this, it's still hanging out, because I think to the best of my knowledge, [indiscernible] certainly from an operating side, they were looked by a lot of people, rightfully so it was may be still the top railroad out there [indiscernible] and I think they continue to go pretty well from what I read.","So this is not the first place that is being tried. Now I think, what I would say to you is the key is this, is how well we teach if you will here and so the better job we do of teaching, coaching, measuring, development let the people understand it and understand really the whys and ins and out. Which you know a lot of people just don\u2019t - and I don\u2019t mean this disrespectfully, just don\u2019t have an appreciation for it.","I mean you know some of you have probably heard your whole carrier about unit train efficiencies and I can tell you that unit train efficiency was a biggest factor to ever just remember. It's not unit trains are on average way more costly, okay. You were unbalanced in a lane which is what you want to do, because if you don\u2019t have balanced, you don\u2019t know when that imbalance is coming and there is lost cost associated with it.","And you are balanced and here comes the grain, a grain train. So you have to dig and you don\u2019t have a source to supply there to get the load to train. You get the loaded the train after you deadhead it and you run the train to the port. Well they dumped it but it takes three or four days and so there is no empties to move back, So you deadhead the crew back because there nothing form them to do.","Well three or four days later now the train is empty and it\u2019s time to run it back, so you run four train instead of two and everybody says what a beautiful operation. And we don\u2019t do it like that and I think to may be to Cheril\u2019s question earlier about this change is with the rock train and the merchandize doubled. We have grain trains that we were running with 56 cars, unit grain train. Other railroads are running 130, we were running some in a 115, can you imagine that the incremental cost is different is basically few.","If you are investing money at 56 cars in a unit and you double it to 112 which is big, then you will really make a lot of money. So there are real questions raised there. So I think that I made it and I sit down with people and start to go through this thing like that and they kind of look at me like god [indiscernible], well why are we running unit train. Well that\u2019s because somebody one day taught some statistics that\u2019s the way you do it. And so everybody evolved into their systems.","So the more time and we are going to get a good feel for this next week for the first 10 because the people they are going this time are little different than what we have done before. He is going to be operating people and is going to be basically transportation operating people which is where we need the help the quickest.","So it\u2019s going to get specialized force with handpicked individuals from the existing team because people said to me here, we don\u2019t have people that are able to and I don\u2019t believe that. Where we have just moved is got a lot of smart people that want to make itself from the part to do well is just our job to find them. So I think that will be the key is to have what we do in this development at every level. And that we are consistent from a price running to the price yard.","We used to talked about it in early my career, we come in for staff meeting and then talked about three things, cost, service and they just need service to get all of this. And we believe you go home and every morning they talk to is about cost. The only time they talked about service and safety is when we came back from another quarterly meeting. They talk about the best service cost and safety.","What you think will react to it, cost so that\u2019s what we heard. So those people re understanding what you want will give it you, you can say it but if they don\u2019t know and you just say you know not down in target want and they don\u2019t know why or whatever. If that\u2019s not the right strategy they don\u2019t know the alternatives or what to do. So the better I do , we do collectively as a group developing these people most successful it\u2019s going to be get ahead of some of the competition. Now whether that\u2019s [indiscernible] but competition.","Operator","Mr. Vernon was that all?","David Vernon","That\u2019s it.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is John Larkin of Stifel.","John Larkin","Hey good morning and thank you for taking my question. We haven\u2019t talked a lot about intermodal today but I thought it was a good topic to bring up especially given that CSX historically has had a relatively unique intermodal strategy with what I call the regional sortation centers like the one in North West Ohio, the one that maybe planned in North Carolina perhaps is the third one in the long-term plan for somewhere in the Alabama area. Allows you to serve much larger number of origin destination pairs but does take a little away from the truck load like service potential. Just wondering how that plan looks relative to the overall precision rail roading emphasis and whether that will survive as envisioned or whether you planned to adjust that to make it more compatible with the overall precision rail roading operating strategy?","Hunter Harrison","So, Fred and I will both comment. John, whatever works - the challenge that we have with intermodal is price, there is no doubt about it. But at the same time, I would say to you that we are pretty this company I am new to is pretty disciplined in their approach, cost control. So I don\u2019t think right now all intermodal practice. And if you believe any of our numbers of what we had improved on so we are going to see our margins improve the number 8%, 10%, well that really gives us the opportunity to be even more aggressive and going after growth.","That\u2019s where I think John some people miss it, the cost control or controlling expenses, so paramount in this effort to grow the business. We have - my last episode like this with the - CSX, last time I did this, the group invited me in a week before I got there, and took our largest customer and signed a 10 year deal. And then said, they know what you make money out of this business. That\u2019s tough, so and they were down about 267 on margin length, which meant there was no free cash flow.","But I\u2019m proud to report to you that 18 months later, they were in the top five, they were in the top five, because the team had been able to take the number which was 29 down to 17 and hold 10% more total and now what was the [Indiscernible] no price difference to the customer just internal controls made us be able to play that market. So I think to some degree that will offer some opportunities for us to continue and I\u2019m not sure I don\u2019t stand totally the recent strategy, but that strategy and others that Fredrik and his team might want to pursue.","Fredrik Eliasson","Yes and I think the key thing is and you have heard Hunter talk about the opportunity because it did grow the business, because that\u2019s ultimate opened up what we need to do. Traditionally intermodal has been a key growth market for us, we have been able to grow this base domestic at 5% to 10%, then we don\u2019t see any reason why that should change, but it\u2019s always about converting traffic of the highway system and what Hunter is focus on in addition to intermodal is also to convert things the highway into our merchandise network by significantly improving that service product.","The key thing for us in intermodal has been and it could be to make sure that we drive productivity and we have always been focused on that terminal, train lengths, making sure we are pricing it appropriately and clearly with a new balance train plan we have taking train length in even greater level and that\u2019s going to be helpful. In the short haul kind of area that we are in, being able to connect the dots in the way that we can do with - how has really allowed us to grow that part of our network in a way that we haven\u2019t been to do historically. So I think being able to connect the dots efficient like we have is critical. So every piece of business has to carry its own length and when we look at [Indiscernible] what we do there, it is carrying its own life and has been great success and we've post our seven times and I think that's the business model that we think will continue and make sense.","John Larkin","Thank you, maybe just a quick question on the international side of intermodal now that the third set of locks has been opened for quite some time in Panama, have you noticed any increased volumes on East Coast ports and now with the Bay on bridge completed do you see that as an opportunity for metal business.","Fredrik Eliasson","If you go back to 2010 70% of our international and modal business came through the East Coast today it\u2019s 80% and it is slightly higher than that so we've seen this go on for the better part of a decade in terms of the more and more of our traffic coming into the East Coast ports and if you just look at the growth numbers by the East Coast port versus the West Coast ports you see that that trend generally seems to be continuing.","So the good news is that we have the infrastructure in place to be able to solve that and I know that very hard on the sort of thing that you said that New York is doing, Savannah is expanding their capabilities, Charleston is expanding their capabilities, Norfolk as always been in the forefront of that as well so all of the ports and [indiscernible] all of the ports are preparing for additional growth and we are well positioned to capture that as we see additional cargo coming into the East Coast ports.","John Larkin","That's terrific, thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you, next we have a question from Bascome Majors of Susquehanna.","Bascome Majors","Yes, thanks for fitting me in here. So Frank you gave us considerable detail on the restructuring charges that you broker out of the labor expense line and the quarter, but there is any way, is there a way you can help us quantify some of the other costs you incurred during the quarter you know related to the closing of hump yards and other changes to the operating plan, your net-net just trying to get at what a reasonable run rate expectation could be for the non labor variable expense lines like MSNO and rates look like as we head into the second half of the year.","Frank Lonegro","Okay, in terms of the restructuring charge Bascome the only thing that we're putting in there are things associated with the management restructuring that we did as well as some of the dialogue that we were having between Maple Ridge as an act to the shareholder and the company and so those are the things that we're putting in there in terms of the restructuring charges going forward you should see the very minimal restructuring charges in Q3 and Q4.","Now to your point about run rate expenses if you want to just take it down to labor and fringe side obviously you saw significant efficiencies there offset by inflation, incentive comp and things of that nature, if you were thinking about looking forward on labor and fringe year-over-year should be favorable on labor and fringe for both Q3 and Q4.","If you want to talk about MSNO obviously we were down 29 million year over year and down 77 million sequentially or 22 million if you want to back up a combination gain. So if you look at Q2 versus Q3 sequentially, ex-condemnation you should see MSNO lower, and then just as you know Q4 had the real estate gain in Q4 of last year so you got to pull that one out as you think about run rates for MSNO.","You know fuel when we jump to fuel real quick if you think about where we were in fuel, price is the big driver of the year over year change in expense in Q2, I think you should probably think about Q3 as a set of brackets depending where price ends up going. It's probably on the expense side, up year over year due to price but likely down sequentially because of the continued improvement on the efficiency side so that will give you a range there.","On the rents that line move a heck of a lot. You saw the re-class that we called out in that particular line. And so I don\u2019t think, we are going to see a lot of move that\u2019s because car hard to calm down is part of line as you take the lower to second times improve in the second half of the year.","Bascome Majors","I appreciate all the detail there. Just one follow-up for Cindy or Hunter here. Just you mentioned some of the talent capture, you are having some success feeling on the operating team. Where those left and when do you expect to field them and just curious where you are finding these people that you are seeing pretty excited about to adverse the FX team? Thanks.","Cindy Sanborn","Well, I think as we change operating model and culture to goes with that the Hunter is pulled upon. I think it is a big part, maybe the biggest part of implementing, we are working on implementing. So we have pretty gone external in terms of attracting people through our normal channels to attract people and some other railroads excited about the opportunity here. I think we have a huge opportunity here and I think the folks that are coming in there as well.","Bascome Majors","Thank you.","Operator","We will move on to Jason Seidl of Cowen.","Hunter Harrison","Good morning Jason.","Operator","Jason Seidl, did you have a question?","Jason Seidl","Yes, guys. Sorry, I was on mute. Fredrik, first question for you. Given that we have seen some strength in the truckload marketplace and the looming ELD mandate. Customers on the intermodal and maybe some of the competitive merchandise lanes come to you guys and talked about capacity on the railroad for next year?","Fredrik Eliasson","Well, I think those, so sort of compensations that we are in the early stages of having and pretty recent that we seen the stock market move up in a sustain passion, we have some good starts in the past, but the stock market is moving up. So as people are trying to get into planning for [indiscernible] needs for 2018, I expect those dialogues to occur much more frequently. And that\u2019s where some of our encouragement is coming from.","Jason Seidl","Okay. Fair enough. And I guess the last one is for Hunter. Hunter, you talk a little bit about how there is changes obviously, when you come to this organization and some people are happy about and some people might not be. Could you talk a little bit about the changes and how you are handling and even for the people that are happy that are there and does the dynamic change much between operations and sales and any communication in gaps, but there may be and should we see, I guess of a ramp up of things just running smoothly as we run throughout the year?","Hunter Harrison","Well, I don\u2019t want to pacific, all the, so I\u2019m looking problems. But clearly, we are trying to take a team approach for this. We are into kind of three free lane [indiscernible] where we don\u2019t really have that place we kind of [indiscernible]. I think that there is a lot to be determined yet on how the organization will eventually end up. And I\u2019m not sure what things going to be and that plan is going to be [indiscernible] and others will have a big part to play, where we end up there. I think the, some of that's creating some anxiety with people, that we've tried to say that's not an issue, that's not something that you should necessarily worry about.","we're trying to do you know Fredrick and I've tried this before, and then real success we are making it work that I think they are talking about maybe given some commission sales in certain areas, I would certainly encourage that, that we do some things differently that we throw some letter in the wall differently, I think Cindy has given her comments, clearly I think she's got certainly grasp on where we're strong and where we're a little weak, where we need help and the varied way to deal with.","We've created different places, although I'm not a big advocate of consultants, we have two or three people that I've worked with over the years, that are in retired capacity, that are out doing some basic work today where we have some very hard working confident managers but we can [indiscernible] them up a little more by giving them some help.","So, I think all of those things are very important to us, going forward - you have been building a room of team players and it does take you long when walk in that room you get a sense of the forming of the [indiscernible] happy no matter what their mass is. I mean we have get to people that have got prettier smiles, but if you pull them back they've got the ugliest smile and we got to be able to read some of that.","So I mean just trying to put that chemistry that is [indiscernible] pull together, it's tough enough, pulling together, when you pull in part, it really makes you difficult and hopefully I can be as I told you my first time on the [indiscernible] I am a short timer here, I am an interim person that's been trying to get this company the next step, that foundation, I'm a active shareholder, I'm want to see this organization do well and I don't want to be used getting in people\u2019s way and careers and that's not my role, that's not my purpose.","I had a very some very best named dialogues, some of the Board members about but I felt like I had to do or didn't do for the organization I think that's clearly spelled out, I think most of the team here knows pretty well where I'm coming form and understand the agenda and so far we've been successful and people had been [indiscernible] and so I feel pretty good about what is taking place here.","Jason Seidl","Thank you for the color and thank you for the time.","Hunter Harrison","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Next we have a question from [indiscernible] of Morningstar.","Unidentified Analyst","Yeah. Thanks. Hunter, some investors have questioned the ability to achieve results on par of the Canadian Rails due to CSX operating in more populated regions and configured in the less linear design. What structural object obviously those have you found that could constrain some aspects of performance maybe velocity, operating ratio or customer service or some other aspects of performance asking about structural obviously?","Hunter Harrison","A lot, I don\u2019t know that there are any particular \u2013 there are some but I mean we have to deal with them. I\u2019ll tell you quick story and answers at this way, but I went to Canada and CEN has made some pretty low changes mostly around by scenic or engineering it takes a lot of people out.","And one of their statement was public was known ever aspect but Canadian railroad to be contained with U.S. numbers it\u2019s just not structurally in the car, okay. Except when CEN became the load of operating ratio, the U.S. road did that every aspect we are going to improve the U.S. and we expect that to get to see in the imagine standard, it\u2019s just not the car, well I have been on both sides of the board and I vote for CSX headquarters over Calgary was [indiscernible].","Healthcare is an issue that that\u2019s obviously France and healthcare knowledge makes it much better in Canada, but we got some weather in Canada, it doesn\u2019t make it pleasant to be there and some mountain although we get some mountain here to people forget about this mountain to be even Tennessee and so forth. And so, I don\u2019t think that there is any structural issues. I think we got a plane field that we do our job and we have got a plenty of opportunity [indiscernible].","I think something the way that did I, I would say what is going to come up with the like this make some sense and I don\u2019t know what it is. I haven\u2019t heard a good answer yet. First 40 years I didn\u2019t hear that structured, but all was certainly was big impairment structural and then left one away particularly what we found out that the, I don\u2019t see much of all that that except the two can be forces at the same consultant that against the development of this fall that is structural issue.","So, let me I think there is a maybe no one placing. Let me ramp something up and okay start there is going to be something a little bit. Let me start, there is been obviously we have talked a lot today and around this issue of playing order and where we are going to be in. So, let me say this to you, this is going to be challenging going forward, because mostly we haven\u2019t talked about that we are in a position that this organization is going to develop the amount of U.S. whole lot of free cash from the real estate market. And not unlike what we experienced at my last employer.","For example, I\u2019m not an expert on this but I think I am right about, we set at different locations in Jacksonville. Next year we will be in two, five location, willing to be sold, get out of the lease, whatever the take might be. We are moved or ahead of our training center in Atlanta, also very pretty expensive piece of property there. And all those done, there is a lot of money in there. Now we debated in terms of how much, and I am always precise, internally it\u2019s all to half way, I think be in plus.","And my point is this, I can\u2019t tell you how the real estate market is going to move over the next two or three years, I can\u2019t tell you exactly what the interest rates will do, I can\u2019t exactly tell you what the timing of the some of the things are, but when they are concluded, they are concluded. And you can call non-recurring, although they have 24 straight months, all we can do is do our job of running and operating. And then when we do something with real estate our other assets that are made available as a result of these operating changes, so that\u2019s something that we should think about and then you should think about and consider as we go forward.","I thought back last night, not the first time I have done this and I have been CEO for 20 years or so, maybe longer, a little break in there but and I said have you ever seen a clean board, I mean clean, clean board, squeaky clean board, no. well how I do describe the clean board. But with these results, I look back to some degree earnings then I looked at trends, productivity improvements, those type things, let\u2019s say what this organization is potentially in the future and size. So sorry for [indiscernible].","Frank Lonegro","Next question please?","Operator","Certainly. Thank you. Walter Spracklin of RBC. Your line is open sir.","Walter Spracklin","Yes, thanks for squeezing me in there. I guess Hunter when I talk investing opportunity you are proposing I think no one questions really that there will be significant change. I think really the question comes around how fast and how significant. So my two questions are around that. You have kind of addressed both. But we will start with the how fast. When you did what you did at CN it was a little bit over a longer period of time I think you are building a team, you are applying a precision railroad model that, you used once before but over a larger network. When you went to CP it was much faster and I think part was you brought over a team that knew in depth of how precision railroading worked. Are you building, rebuilding a team, I know you said you are pulling people, you are using a few experienced, those experienced in precision rail, but overall is this a longer process because you are kind of rebuilding the team or is this you have done now three or four times and you can hit the ground much quicker than before.","Hunter Harrison","Well I mean I think when we hit the ground it all factors in each case it was kind of this. So the team here did a lot about this good bad and different and get to see every day the results of the Friday night side and what they were and what it might be and do a little research and I think maybe somewhat we are saying here this might be a good opportunity that the others were looking at a different way. But that quickly came to a conclusion here that we have at the senior level I don\u2019t think we have here any efficiencies like that and maybe prescribe at this middle managerial level.","So as I told you some kind of interim step there and then the board which is part of is now and we file another assistance will likely be the selection for you have got to leave this company on that and that\u2019s important. I think that then I would be able to interrogate I think once they heard a little bit from me and then when we heard, they understood to some degree that it\u2019s a good match and we had some good people at the wrong spots without the appropriate amount of expertise and knowledge and some of that was their fault and some of them not.","And so that\u2019s when we kind of where that do this and we brought couple of people in that were actually kind of lock star attach to them. And then we rub each other of bringing I guess the volume in about \u2013 and I think that maybe is all the risk to do even in what we do in the camps and given that they install in the place but if it\u2019s not you know what to do then. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be, where you have got \u2013 this is top most and we have got some restrictions from the last employer to the retirement party that gave me but it seems to have until I could retire anybody from there.","Well that\u2019s another story, and then so there is all kind of restriction out there about who get higher who and so forth and I\u2019ll be proud to say that we don\u2019t have anybody. One of the things that Cindy encouraged and we have done is that we really to a large standpoint were behind and perhaps with this. I don\u2019t believe the Indians are like more into [indiscernible] and that\u2019s what we had and we had well and have good conductors and engineers that didn\u2019t want to take this job, they like to cut it. So that\u2019s wrong, that\u2019s people that don\u2019t know how to value car mover on new railroad.","So I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going forward will be a continuation. I just think the issue is kind of to your question [indiscernible] now if we go through - what I have never been through a time where this country is like its politically ever, I never dreamed of the time like this. So I don\u2019t know what is going to happen in Washington and I don\u2019t think they got the view. So we follow one time where we think about turn for no other reason, freight and made in America, a lot of things, infrastructure, well I don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going then.","But if we had if there is such thing in normal without any geopolitical interruptions I think it\u2019s very reasonable to say that we can get this done in the timeframe we talked about which is I guess 2020 we will have it done by then, I think it\u2019s very reasonable. But if we miss three, four months or you are going to choose, or the shareholders not going to love us, that has pretty good run anyway. So I think we are going to get there, I admit one yet [indiscernible].","Walter Spracklin","So on the second question on the impact again I don\u2019t think many doubt your ability to drive you alone down of the range. You mentioned is what revenue showing through that. Those views out there they were, call that perhaps will be some service disruptions. My question to you is and when we look at the data we do see a contraction in, we see your volume level tracking below peers that could be kind of reasons for that, now touch on that but we are also seeing pricing come down on the rate of growth, my question are you right now seeing volume share losses on account of those disruptions or are you having the price lower to keep that volume because of the perceived volume disruptions, service disruptions, I guess your view as to when that will smoothen out if it is happening?","Hunter Harrison","Walter this service disruption, there has been adjustment which we have many, I have got the numbers, 400, 500 customers do 90% business, a lot of customers. We have had two that might make the case, major disruption. And one case the major disruption was back to where they were then you have heard and it was a result of some labor actions pushed back some way and we had to take a few names and pass another pressure.","So that is really not in my view effected any top-line. I don\u2019t know that there has been anything pricing wise that\u2019s affected the bottom that we have made any desperate moves in. We have got a couple of, you all know this is no secret I\u2019m not a big not right to advocate, I think it\u2019s not in anybody\u2019s interest but others see it differently. You go out two, three five years and so forth. But we got a couple of big ones over the next 18 months that are coming up.","And you know look part of the alignment you get here is when you walk in and let\u2019s say the new one is off the block. If you don\u2019t do me a cut, if you don\u2019t do this for me I\u2019m going to say you are not sensitive to the customer and I\u2019ll get you to use this and when I get criticized about this I don\u2019t, I\u2019m not worried about it, somebody said you don\u2019t want to \u2013 well I did and that\u2019s some business we get apart. I don\u2019t think that and to this earlier what we said to the customer is we are going to say what we say we are going to do.","You know you go to one way or around and they say you don\u2019t have any chance. So you get that service, you got another area and put schedules in and now you have not been insensitive to customer. I mean how would you like to go and call somebody to book the flight on the \u2013 and then say what time you want to leave? And then you believe it\u2019s their time to file service for them. Well I don\u2019t think that people united will think that it\u2019s necessary.","All that being said, the service and the operating metrics and all those things is only going to improve and then it improve service and add to the lower cost and you have got a double effect here, you got a download there. So I don\u2019t see anyhow and you know what I\u2019d love, I\u2019d love to somebody to serve the public debate, okay to represent the shippers and I will debate in Times Square and about this issue of who, where, when came about.","So I\u2019m not, I think that\u2019s all about it.","Walter Spracklin","Fair enough, just an housekeeping for Fred and maybe for Frank as well. Frank did you say 39 was the tax rate for the rest of the year or is that the new tax rate going forward?.","Frank Lonegro","What I said was 39 to 40 in Q3. I think it would probably be somewhere in the 38to 38.5 in Q4 and then obviously we\u2019ll take a look at next year.","Walter Spracklin","Okay. And Freddie did you update on the export coal, I missed it but did you give any update your guidance on the export call I think you were at 30 million tons or high 20s.","Fredrik Eliasson","Yes Frank in his prepared remarks, we said about 30 million tons in export pull market for the year with a declining rate structure and those slightly based on what we are seeing in terms of indexes.","Walter Spracklin","Okay. Thank you very much for your time.","Hunter Harrison","All right, thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Yes, we have one more question. Justin Long of Stephens.","Justin Long","Good morning. And thanks for setting me in. So Hunter maybe the follow-up on the point you made a little bit earlier on real estate. Are you factoring in those real estate gains when you talk about the potential for a low 60s OR next year and something in the 50s longer term or would the real estate gains be incremental to the objective?","Hunter Harrison","It\u2019s incremental.","Justin Long","Okay. Great. And then.","Hunter Harrison","Anything real estate, we did achieve these numbers.","Justin Long","Okay, that\u2019s helpful to clarify. And then secondly I wanted to ask about coal, and how that\u2019s influencing some of the changes you are making in the network today? When you think about your coal business, what is your assumption on how that looks three to four years from now as you start to implement various structural and operational changes in the network as a whole?","Hunter Harrison","I will comment. Fredrick has other comments. Look, I\u2019m not going to buy a locomotive for coal, okay, I\u2019m not [indiscernible] as assets 40 years of life and my personal view, I am not an expert on this point, almost got run out of hand that fossil fuels - that\u2019s a long-term view, that will not happen overnight, it\u2019s not going to be two, three years but it\u2019s going away in my view with all those issues, environmental and so forth natural gas always in pressure, coal is not along current issue.","And we will see what comes up with this commitment to coal and so forth. And so look having said that the right car load coal that shipped [indiscernible] now I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s 2020, 2030 or when, but we are not going to make long range and if something changes drastically at the end of market we are not going to go out and put going track in or buy locomotives or anything for coal.","Fredrik Eliasson","And just to build on what Hunter just said and I think we have been pretty clear that over the long-term we think it will decline, and there will be periods that we are seeing right now where coal will be going up and we are trying to capture that value economically and so with our customers as their needs are increasing or decreasing. But overall it\u2019s a good business for us and to Hunter\u2019s point we want to be there the last [indiscernible].","Justin Long","Okay, makes sense. I know it\u2019s been a long call. We really appreciate the time.","Hunter Harrison","Thanks a lot. Thanks everybody for joining us. We appreciate it and I can\u2019t hardly wait unit the third quarter call. Have a good day.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation in the call. You may disconnect your lines."],"6428":["CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) Q3 2012 Earnings Call October 17, 2012  8:30 AM ET","Executives","David Baggs - Vice President of Capital Markets and Investor Relations","Michael Jon Ward - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President, Chairman of Executive Committee, Chief Executive Officer of Csx Transportation Inc and resident of Csx Transportation Inc","Clarence W.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. David Baggs, Vice President of Capital Markets and Investor Relations for CSX Corporation.","David Baggs","Thank you, Lori, and good morning, everyone. And welcome again to CSX Corporation's third quarter 2012 earnings presentation. The presentation material that we'll be reviewing this morning, along with our quarterly financial report and our safety and service measurements, are available on our website at csx.com under the Investors section. In addition, following the presentation, a webcast and podcast replay will be available on that same website.","Here representing CSX this morning are Michael Ward, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Clarence Gooden, Chief Sales and Marketing Officer; Oscar Munoz, Chief Operating Officer; and Fredrik Eliasson, Chief Financial Officer.","Now before we begin the formal part of our program, let me remind everyone that the presentation and other statements made by the company contain forward-looking statements. You are encouraged to review the company's disclosure in the accompanying presentation on Slide 2. This disclosure identifies forward-looking statements and risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance to differ materially from the results anticipated by these statements. In addition, let me also remind everyone that at the end of the presentation, we will conduct a question and answer session with the research analysts. [Operator Instructions]","With that, let me turn the presentation over to CSX Corporation's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Michael Ward. Michael?","Michael Jon Ward","Well thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Last evening, CSX reported third quarter earnings per share of $0.44 versus $0.43 in the same period last year despite continued headwinds in coal and an economy that is growing more moderately.","As Clarence will review in more detail, revenues were down 2% on lower volume and fuel recovery as well as an unfavorable mix that continues to be significant. At the same time, lower revenues were partially offset by the outstanding efforts of our operating team. As Oscar will discuss further, we continue to adjust to near-term market conditions while staying focused on building our capabilities for the long-term. As a result, despite substantial headwinds we saw externally, operating income declined just 3% to $854 million. In addition, our operating ratio held stable at 70.5%. And Fredrik will provide you the complete financial analysis for the quarter.","Bottom line, we're encouraged by how this team is dealing with market conditions that are far from ideal. Long-term, this bodes well for what CSX will be able to accomplish when sustainable growth resumes. With that, I'll turn it over to Clarence to talk about our top line results. Clarence?","Clarence W. Gooden","Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 6, leading indicators continue to predict moderating growth for the U.S. economy for the balance of the year. Looking at the left side of the chart, projected GDP and IDP rates indicate weak growth, and discussions for many of CSX's customers support this broad assessment of the economy. On the right, the Purchasing Managers' Index registered a rating of 51.5 in September, indicating a slight expansion of U.S. manufacturing. At the same time, the Customer Inventories Index registered a rating of 49.5, indicating that respondents believe their inventories are still slightly below normal levels. Overall, transportation demand in the markets we serve was mixed in the third quarter, consistent with the broader economic environment.","And now let us take a look at the overall revenue. Total third quarter revenue of nearly $2.9 billion was 2% lower compared to last year, reflecting continued headwinds in coal and a more moderate economic environment. Starting at the left of the chart, volume-related revenue had an unfavorable impact of $31 million in the quarter as volume growth in Export Coal, Automotive and Intermodal was more than offset by the significant decline in domestic coal. Moving to the right, the combined effect of rate mix was $14 million unfavorable. Here, the benefit of core pricing gains was more than offset by the unfavorable mix associated with higher Intermodal growth and declining coal volume. Finally, fuel recovery decreased $24 million in the quarter.","Now let's turn to pricing. Core pricing, on a same-store sales basis, remained solid across nearly all markets. Recall that same-store sales are defined as shipments with the same customer, commodity and car type, and the same origin and destination. These shipments represent approximately 75% of CSX's traffic base. Looking at the chart, consolidated pricing, shown as the blue bars, includes all shipments. On this basis, pricing increased 1.5% in the third quarter. The sequential decline through the year has largely been driven by rate reductions in Export Coal, where pricing is impacted by changing conditions in the global market. The gold bars, which exclude Export Coal, show pricing gains of 3.7% in the quarter, exceeding rail inflation and stable with what we saw in the second quarter. Pricing was higher in the first quarter as we cycled several significant contract signings from 2011. Looking forward, the strong service product that CSX is delivering to customers and the relative value of rail transportation provides a solid foundation for pricing above rail inflation long-term.","Looking next to the next slide, let's take a closer look at the volume. Total volume declined 1% in the quarter versus the same period last year, and performance across the markets we serve was mixed. Export Coal volume increased 20% year-over-year, but growth rates slowed from the pace in the first half. Both Intermodal and the industrial sector continued to see robust growth in the quarter, generally consistent with what we saw in the first half. The agriculture and construction sectors remain challenged, with these sectors declining 4% and 5%, respectively. Finally, domestic coal declined 26%, although the rate of decline moderated from what we saw in the second quarter.","Now let's look at the individual markets in more detail, starting with coal. Coal revenue declined 17% to $791 million. Domestic volume declined 26% as natural gas prices remain low, leading to the continued displacement of coal at many utilities. In addition, electrical generation declined in the Eastern United States. Partially offsetting this weakness, Export Coal volume grew 20% as demand for U.S. thermal coal remains strong. Total revenue per unit declined 1% as a result of lower export rates, which more than offset core pricing gains in domestic markets. Looking ahead, Export Coal volume is expected to decline in the fourth quarter, although second half and full year volume will grow on a year-over-year basis. At the same time, domestic utility volumes are expected to face continued challenges due to lower natural gas prices, above-normal inventory levels and environmental regulations. Headwinds should begin to moderate somewhat but will continue well into 2013.","Now let's look at merchandise. Overall merchandise revenue increased 3% to $1.6 billion. Automotive was a key driver in the industrial sector, growing 18% as North American light vehicle production increased 12% in the quarter. In addition, the chemicals market grew 4% with plastics, petroleum products and frac sand being the primary drivers. In the agricultural sector, corn shipments for animal feed declined as severe drought impacted harvest levels in the Midwest. A strong local crop in the Southeast, typically transported by truck to feed mills, also contributed to lower rail volume. In addition, ethanol shipments fell as a result of lower gasoline demand. Looking at revenue per unit, rates increased 3% for the overall merchandise market, with core pricing gains overcoming lower fuel recovery.","For the fourth quarter, in the industrial sector, the automotive market will remain strong, although we are now cycling tougher comparables. At the same time, we continue to see growth opportunities in chemicals, particularly in commodities that support the oil and gas industry. We expect the agricultural sector to be soft, with continued weakness in ethanol shipments and lower crop yields more than offsetting increased phosphate demand. Finally, in the construction sector, aggregates, waste and salt shipments will remain challenged, while the continued recovery of housing starts from a low base will drive growth in building products.","Moving to the next page, let's review Intermodal. Intermodal revenue increased 10% to $399 million. Domestic volume was up 6% and set a new third quarter record. Growth was driven by highway-to-rail conversions, the continued success of our UMAX interline container program, the addition of the new service lanes enabled by the Northwest Ohio Terminal and growth in existing business partners. International volume grew 10% as a result of successful on-boarding of the Maersk business. Total Intermodal revenue per unit increased 2%, driven primarily by core pricing gains.","Looking forward, strategic investments position CSX to compete for an estimated 9 million truckloads of opportunity, which reflect shipments with a length of haul exceeding 550 miles in CSX-served markets. Terminal capacity investments in Columbus, Ohio; Charlotte; Cincinnati; Wister; and Winter Haven, combined with expanded double stack capability to Boston and Chambersburg in early 2013, will drive future growth.","Let's turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter. Looking forward, we recognize the economic environment has moderated. While we expect stable or favorable conditions for 67% of our markets, we also expect an unfavorable environment for the remaining markets and an overall neutral outlook for the fourth quarter. Intermodal growth will lead the way as our strategic network investments and strong service delivery will continue to support highway-to-rail conversions. In the industrial sector, automobile and light truck production will remain strong but year-over-year comparisons become more difficult. In addition, the chemicals market will grow as our petrochemical customers benefit from low natural gas prices and we capture opportunities created by the growing domestic oil and gas industry.","The overall outlook for the agricultural sector is unfavorable with the drought reducing the Midwest corn harvest and ethanol shipments impacted by lower demand and higher inventories. In the construction sector, we expect a continued recovery in demand for building materials, including lumber and panel products, while waste and aggregate shipments will remain challenged. Finally, Export Coal volumes will be weaker in the fourth quarter due to lower global demand for metallurgical coal. On the domestic front, while the decline in utility and industrial coal shipments will moderate, they will remain well below prior year levels. Based on the combination of weaker export volumes and continued significant declines in domestic coal, we expect total coal will be down sequentially from the third quarter levels and will also decline more on a year-over-year basis as well.","Now I will wrap up on the next slide. Looking at the state of the economy, the indicators we follow generally point to continued expansion but at a more moderate pace. Overall, the fourth quarter volume outlook is neutral. While the outlook for 67% of our markets is neutral or favorable, we anticipate total volume will be flat year-over-year. Utility coal volume will continue to be challenged by low gas prices and high utility stockpiles. Although we expect these headwinds to moderate somewhat through the balance of the year, they will continue well into 2013. Finally, we are delivering high service levels and offering environmentally friendly solutions, which creates compelling value for our customers and will drive long-term growth.","Thank you. And now we'll turn the presentation over to Oscar to review our operating results.","Oscar Munoz","Thank you, Clarence, and good morning, everyone. Despite these economic uncertainties, I think a big part of the success we've had at CSX is constantly focusing on safety, on providing high levels of customer service, and of course, driving greater efficiency. This allows us to fulfill our commitments to all our key stakeholders.","So let me start the day with the fact that CSX sent more employees home safely in this third quarter with a personal injury rate that remained near all-time best levels. At the same time, customer service remained at record levels, demonstrating our team's focus on consistently and reliably executing the operating plan. And furthermore, we sustained these high levels of safety and service with fewer resources, thereby improving asset utilization. The ability to adjust in a more dynamic environment is critical to our success and our operating strategy and it means constantly, constantly reviewing resource plans in order to prepare for a variety of different scenarios that may come in front of us. Of course, in every one of those scenarios, the goal is to maintain a safe and reliable service product, while at the same time maximizing productivity levels.","Now let's review the results for the quarter starting with safety. As you know, safety is critically important in the railroad industry. And if you look at the FRA personal injury rate on the chart on the left, our employees operated more safely and produced a rate of 0.70, representing a 35% improvement year-over-year. This is a strong testament to our company's culture around safety. On the right, the FRA train accident rate, which improved 3% to 1.94, is in part a result of our employees' rigorous attention to detail and the company's commitment to remain vigilant in safeguarding the communities we serve.","Now let's review on-time performance. Here on Slide 18, you can see the on-time originations on the left and on-time arrivals on the right. In addition, we've again overlaid 6- and 12-month trend lines. A reminder, the on-time results for the quarter are represented by the bars, and the technicals are represented by the 6-month moving average in black and 12-month moving average in red. You may recall that earlier in the quarter, CSX was impacted by Hurricane Isaac. The storm caused significant damage to a stretch of the railroad near New Orleans, causing outages and reroutes for several weeks. Through the tireless efforts of our employees, strong collaboration with the other railroads and a great operating plan, the impact to customers was minimal. In fact, we achieved a record high of 90% in on-time originations, and we are very near all-time highs in on-time arrivals at 80%. CSX's commitment to service is clear now more than ever and the feedback from customers remains very positive.","Now looking at overall system performance on the next slide. Terminal dwell is a strong indicator of how well we are utilizing our assets. When you look at the chart on the left, you'll see dwell improved 9% to 23.2 hours and the trend lines again reflect strong momentum. Looking at the chart on the right, velocity again showed improvement, up 10% to 22.6 miles per hour. A more fluid network allows us to utilize assets more effectively and provide consistent levels of service to customers, even while the environment around us has changed.","On the next slide, I'll discuss velocity by market in a bit more detail. As you can see, velocity was up across all 3 networks, as were both the 6- and 12-month trend lines. In coal, despite the continued domestic headwinds, we are driving improvements in service and efficiency. With volume down 16%, CSX adjusted plans and maximized loading to increase both train length and tons per car. Turning to Intermodal, velocity continued to reach high levels while growing volume at an 8% clip. A higher velocity in the Intermodal network gives us the ability to reach end markets more quickly and to meet or exceed customer expectations. Finally, the merchandise network also continues to perform well. With velocity up 10% to 21.6 miles per hour and terminal dwell improving 9%, we are making more of the final deliveries to customers on time and remain in a great position to drive growth in these markets.","Now let's look at productivity and resource alignment on the next slide. In 2012, we have quickly adapted to the changing business environment. We have seen a significant decline in the domestic coal market along with growth and volatility in other markets, and we have responded to all 3. In doing so, we have maintained high service levels, improved productivity and proactively adjusted resources. Regarding productivity, we remain on track for a full year productivity in excess of $180 million. And in order to achieve this productivity, we have relied on several different levers.","First, the service product the company is delivering for customers has driven significant improvement in car cycle times and a reduction in overtime and other associated labor costs. These results allow us to constrain rent expense, materials usage and labor cost per employee while producing a reliable service product that supports growth. In addition, through effective resource planning and execution, overtime is down significantly in the transportation, mechanical and engineering departments, driving savers to the labor line. On the fuel side, in order to achieve those savings, we've implemented a targeted locomotive shutdown program and invested in onboard technology to optimize fuel efficiency on each trip, and these initiatives are delivering results.","At the same time that we are driving greater productivity, we're also adjusting resources to better align with current volume levels. As a result, there are 500 train and engine employees on furlough or retention boards. In addition, the active locomotive count has come down, commensurate with volume, as over 300 engines are now in storage. Combined, the productivity benefits we are producing and the savings associated with the resource adjustments are helping CSX maintain a strong operating ratio despite the headwinds we are currently facing.","Now let's talk about -- a little bit more about these resource adjustments. The chart on the left represents the total active T&E workforce, with the blue portion of the bars representing full-time employees and the gold portion representing those employees on furlough retention boards. While utilizing the furlough retention boards result in a higher headcount than with traditional furloughs, CSX still realizes lower labor cost and retains the flexibility with its manpower to meet attrition and service demands. We have this flexibility because it's easier and quicker to bring an employee off of a retention board than the longer process of bringing an employee back from a traditional furlough. If you turn on the chart on the right, you can see active locomotives peak during the first quarter of this year. Since then, we've been storing excess power. Again, the decision to store locomotives is aimed at saving cost but not at the price of service or flexibility.","So let me wrap up on the final slide. CSX's near record safety results continue to reflect the company's position as an industry leader and demonstrate our commitment to keep our employees and the communities we work in safe. Customers are experiencing service reliability at sustainably high levels. And as Clarence mentioned, strong service product drives long-term value for customers, which in turn drives growth and long-term value for you, our shareholders. As CSX delivers a superior service product for customers, the company is achieving it with improved operational efficiency. And we continue to expect to realize the productivity savings that will exceed $180 million this year.","So in summary, our operational strategies support the company's goal of creating long-term value for owners. Once again, this company has demonstrated the ability to adjust to changes in the economy, thereby variable-izing our cost structure and delivering stable financial results despite a number of headwinds outside of our control.","So with that, let me turn the presentation over to Fredrik to review the financials.","Fredrik J. Eliasson","Thank you, Oscar, and good morning, everyone. Looking at the top of this slide, revenue was down 2%. Expenses were down by the same percentage, driven in part by productivity gains and resource adjustments made in response to changing market conditions while maintaining high levels of customer service. As a result, third quarter operating income was $854 million, down 3% versus the prior year. Looking below the line, interest expense and other income were essentially flat year-over-year, and income taxes were $266 million in the quarter for an effective tax rate of 36.9%. Finally, EPS was $0.44, an improvement of 2% reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program.","Turning to the next slide, let's discuss the impact of fuel lag. On a year-over-year basis, the third quarter fuel surcharge lag impact was $32 million unfavorable. Looking at the chart, lag fuel prices are shown by the yellow line while un-lag fuel prices are shown by the blue line. In this quarter, fuel prices were increasing over the course of the quarter, resulting in $16 million in negative in-quarter lag. Conversely, in the third quarter of 2011, fuel prices were declining, resulting in $16 million of favorable in-quarter lag. The combination of the 2 is a $32 million year-over-year negative impact.","Turning to the next slide, let's discuss expenses in more detail. Overall expenses were down 2% in the quarter as we began to cycle resource investments made in the second half of last year. I'll talk about the top 3 expense items in more detail on the next few slides, but let me briefly speak to the last 2 on the chart. Depreciation was up 7% to $268 million due to the increase in the net asset base. This is in line with our previous estimates and is expected to increase a few million dollars sequentially in the fourth quarter. Equipment rents were up 1% to $96 million, as strong volume increases in Automotive and Intermodal, plus inflation and more leased locomotives, were almost entirely absorbed by improved cycle times.","Turning to Slide 28. Labor and fringe expense was down 1% versus last year, or $11 million. Looking at the chart on the left, headcount, which includes employees on retention boards, was up 2% versus last year but down 1% sequentially. This is roughly in line with our prior guidance, which was for headcount to remain relatively constant.","Moving to the table on the right, you may recall that CSX took a charge in the third quarter last year for labor-related cost associated with a facility closure. We are now cycling this charge in the current quarter, resulting in a favorable impact of $14 million. Improvements in network efficiency reduced crew overtime costs by $7 million, driven by reductions in overtime hours and relief crews. Moving down the table, labor inflation was up $7 million, slightly favorable to our expectations. While core wage inflation was above 3%, lower cost on health and welfare programs, as well as the impact of lower railroad unemployment tax rate, continued to provide favorability. Rounding out the table, other costs were $3 million higher, driven by $8 million in incentive compensation favorability that was more than offset by various other non-recurring items, none of which are material in and of themselves.","Looking at the fourth quarter, headcounts to continue to be relatively constant, though as we have demonstrated once again this year, we will adjust accordingly as business conditions warrant. In addition, we expect that labor inflation will remain modest, in line or slightly higher than what we experienced this quarter. Finally, we now expect incentive compensation to be lower year-over-year in the fourth quarter.","Turning to Slide 29. MS&O expense decreased 7% or $37 million versus last year. In the third quarter, CSX recognized a $30 million deferred gain related to the company's sale of property in November of last year to the State of Florida. While CSX will recognize a similar gain in the fourth quarter of this year, the year-over-year favorable comparison will be lower since the company first recognized a $14 million gain from this sale in the fourth quarter of last year. As Oscar discussed earlier, continuing improvements in our safety performance have reduced personal injuries and train derailments. As a result, adjustments to casualty reserves generated $18 million in cost savings for casualty, loss and damage. Moving down the table, volume-related expenses increased $8 million, primarily reflecting terminal-related costs associated with our growing Intermodal, Export Coal and Automotive businesses. Finally, inflation and other cost increased $3 million this quarter.","Moving to the next slide, let's discuss the impact of fuel. Total fuel cost decreased 4% or $15 million versus last year. Looking at the table to the right, fuel efficiency was favorable by $8 million, reflecting a 2% year-over-year improvement in gallons consumed per gross ton mile. Lower volume reduced fuel expenses by $7 million, with gross ton miles down 2%. Next, as shown in the chart on the left, CSX's average cost per gallon for locomotive fuel increased to $3.16, up 1% versus last year. This increase in fuel price accounted for $3 million of the overall increase in fuel expense, as seen on the table on the right. Finally, non-locomotive fuel expense was $3 million lower.","Turning to Slide 31. CSX remains committed to an improving investment-grade profile, and all key credit measures improved during the third quarter. This improving credit profile supports the company's commitment to a balanced approach for deploying capital to shareholders.","As a key driver of long-term value, capital investments is the first priority of our balanced approach. For 2012, CSX remains on target to invest $2.25 billion. Longer term, our core capital investment target is 16% to 17% of revenue plus the additional investment required for PTC.","Our second priority is dividends, and the company continues to target a payout ratio of 30% to 35% of trailing-12-months earnings measured after each year's first quarter. As a result, the dividend was increased 17% and became effective with the second quarter payment earlier this year.","Finally, we expect to fund future share purchases primarily through free cash flow. With $200 million of share repurchased in the third quarter, there is about $234 million remaining under the current program which we expect to complete by the end of this year.","Now let me wrap up on the next slide. Recapping the third quarter, cost reductions helped mitigate the effects of fuel lag and coal headwinds. Automotive and Intermodal growth partially offset declines in coal volume while safety, service and productivity remained at or near record levels. For the full year, CSX is still expecting modest earnings growth and margin expansion. However, with a weaker Export Coal outlook and a moderating economy, the fourth quarter outlook has become more challenging.","Longer term, achieving a 65% operating ratio by 2015 will be challenging as well. This target is based on stabilizing utility coal volumes next year and Export Coal remaining in a 40-plus-ton million range over the long-term. By maintaining an outstanding service product, CSX can drive inflation plus pricing long-term, as well as long -- as volume growth and productivity gains that can keep us on the path towards 65%. Finally, as we deliver outstanding financial results for investors, CSX remains committed to a balanced approach in deploying cash, which includes capital investments to drive long-term value as well as dividends and share repurchases that provide immediate returns for shareholders.","With that, let me turn the presentation back to Michael for his closing remarks.","Michael Jon Ward","Well, thank you, Fredrik. In this economic environment, aside from all the measures we examined this morning, we think it's important to continually challenge ourselves with 3 key questions:","First, are we providing our customers with a service product that is valuable and will drive long-term growth? The answer is yes. As you heard this morning in fact, our employees are driving service at record levels. That service makes a real contribution to our customers' ability to thrive in the competitive near-term environment while continuing to gain their confidence for a future that will be more prosperous. Service is the foundation for growth and provides CSX the ability to price its product to reflect the relative value it provides customers.","Second, how well are we managing the things that are most in our control? I believe our productivity and resource alignment speaks volumes here. In a year when the economy has moderated and the headwinds in coal are significant, CSX continues to produce strong financial results. The $180 million in productivity savings that is being produced this year represents a strong commitment by the team to continually achieve shareholder value in any environment. It also reflects just how nimble we are, the focus of our team and the extraordinary capability for improvement that our employees bring to work every day.","Third, while managing through tough near-term times, are we staying focused on what we know to be a more prosperous long term? Here, again, the answer is yes. Most transportation planners continue to expect a significant increase in demand for transportation in the United States, and we know that our public highway system is already at capacity in many places. CSX offers what is, in effect, a privately funded highway that serves about 2\/3 of the population and even a greater share of consumption. The very things we've done to better safety, service and productivity in this tough economy makes us even more prepared to meet significantly higher demands for our service in the future. And we continue to invest to prepare our network for that eventuality.","As shareholders investing in CSX's future, you rightfully expect management to deliver results even in difficult economic times, and we want you to know that we are highly committed to doing so. Likewise, as we face important decisions in the upcoming election, I know you will join me in urging both sides to work together to foster a business environment that creates as much certainty as possible and is conducive for long-term growth. CSX and the freight rail industry are providing our nation's businesses with a great competitive advantage. Your company has achieved outstanding results throughout the recession and the slow recovery, and I especially believe that what we are doing now will lead to significant value creation long-term.","With that, we'll take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Wanted to get a sense of how you're looking at the Export Coal market for 2013. I know that's probably kind of a limited visibility type of question. But how much of your thermal exports would be locked in where you'd have some visibility to 2013? And how much of the overall export tonnage would be something that essentially is not on committed contract for 2013?","Clarence W. Gooden","Tom, this is Clarence. Most of the contracts for 2013 are not committed at this time. The market is very volatile, as you're aware, in both the thermal and in the metallurgical markets, particularly given the volatility in China. So we'll start most of the thermal discussions here in the next 30 to 60 days to try to get those contracts put in place at the first of the year. The met is trending more and more to quarterly negotiations. And we'll start -- a lot of those really won't start until end of first quarter next year.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So how -- I don't know if this is for -- I suppose for the broader team or for Michael. If you look to 2013 and the economy doesn't show much of a pickup and the kind of overall coal is maybe a modest headwind, maybe not quite as much as this year, what do you think the key areas are where you might be able to drive operating ratio -- material operating ratio improvement and earnings? What would you really look to drive that in 2013 if you don't get help from coal or you don't get help from the economy?","Michael Jon Ward","Tom, 2 things. I think one, we obviously are going to continue to produce the kind of productivity that Oscar and his team have produced this year. And that's always going to be one of our key value creators. But if you exclude coal, our business will be up 4% to 5% this year. And if you count all the other markets, Tom, that's probably double what the economy is growing. So we believe that we can continue with this great service we're providing to grow at a faster rate than the economy as well. So I think those 2 will be very helpful in value creation. Fredrik, do you have something you want to add to that?","Fredrik J. Eliasson","No. I think we're going to continue to pull the levers, Tom, that we've pulled in the past, including inflation plus pricing, driving productivity and then solid volume growth. Obviously, we -- it's a difficult coal environment, but that's something we've been dealing with for an extended period of time now, going back all the way to 2006, and we've been able to produce very solid financial results during this period.","Operator","The next question is from Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Can I just ask one sort of clarification on the long-term target of 65%? You say based on stabilization in utility coal. Is that over the time period through 2015 relative to 2012 levels? Or -- because you mentioned that it's going to go down in '13 likely in the -- we're not going to get to easy comps until we get further into the year.","Fredrik J. Eliasson","I think what we have said at this point, Bill, is that we will -- what we expect is we're going to have this overhang with us into 2013. And at that point, we expect to stabilize. We're not counting on a significant recovery. Exactly where it needs to be is obviously difficult to pinpoint, but we're not banking on a significant recovery from the levels that we're seeing this year.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And based on the levels that we saw this year, should we expect to see liquidated damages? Does that have any benefit this quarter?","Fredrik J. Eliasson","We had liquidated damages this quarter year-over-year that was about $6 million. And we don't expect anything for the fourth quarter, as most of the contracts really come up at the end of the year. We are going to see some next year. It's a little too early to tell exactly what it's going to be, but we will update you on that as we see them.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","All right. And then just last question. Clarence, can you remind us, in the third quarter as you look out to '13 now, how much of the business do you have visibility on pricing? How much is usually locked in by this point for next year?","Clarence W. Gooden","Bill, we have about 75% right now locked in for next year, 25% to go.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And it's at inflation plus, presumably.","Clarence W. Gooden","Yes. Over the long-term, we think we'll be right at the inflation plus pricing.","Operator","The next question is from Kevin Crissey with UBS.","Kevin Crissey - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Maybe this is for Fredrik. I guess, it relates to liquidated damages in Q3. The other revenue line, in addition, has some other elements to it, I believe, and it was up pretty sharply, more than we would've expected, in Q3. Is that a good run rate going forward, x the $6 million you talked about in liquidated damages?","Fredrik J. Eliasson","Yes, we had liquidated damage. We also had some volume incentive refunds, adjustments that were positive. And some of the other line items in other revenue were all favorable this quarter. I think the best way to look at it's probably a run rate that was similar to what we saw the first 2 quarters versus what we saw here in the third quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Hoexter with BNY Mellon [ph].","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You talked about a bunch of yards, Clarence. Was that -- can you run down the list? And are those expansion? Or are those new yards? Can you talk about the percent capacity increase that those yards will provide for your Intermodal segment?","Clarence W. Gooden","Yes. In the case of Columbus, Ohio, we've more than doubled the capacity of the Columbus terminal. It was on the existing footprint that we expanded, and the same was true at Charlotte. In fact, this was the third phase of 3 phases that we're planning for Charlotte. Wister is a new facility, expanded facility, but you might as well say it's new because it was from the ground up. It'll be in operation late this year, early next quarter. It was part of the New England strategy in which we double-stack cleared into New England and then expanded the Wister terminal and got out of Boston's Beacon Park. The facility at Cincinnati expansion was ended at current. And the existing facility that was there, it's almost double the size of that facility. And Winter Haven is part of the new terminals that we're building as a result of the SunRail purchase. That's located just south of Lakenham [ph], Florida. It's on U.S. Highway 60, which transverses the southern state of -- southern part of Florida from Tampa over to West Palm Beach.","Kevin Crissey - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And the percentage increase that -- is this like a step function on these yards? Or is this just incremental?","Clarence W. Gooden","It would be a step function, because in most cases it's significantly increasing the capacity, both in terms of physical capacity as well as in terms of the technology that we're employing in those terminals to increase the productivity and the lift capabilities.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just my follow-up on pricing. If you look at pure pricing on Export Coal, the contracts you mentioned moved to quarterly. Does that lead to pressure on other contracts as you start downshifting on some of those contracts? Can you kind of walk us through the mentality of how you value in [ph] in some of those negotiations as you start bringing some contracts down?","Clarence W. Gooden","As it relates to Export Coal?","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","No, I just mean in terms of when we look back in the early part of the decade, the kind of the coal contracts led the pricing on the way up. We've gotten a lot of questions on, does this lead it to be more volatile in terms of pricing relative to your inflation plus target?","Clarence W. Gooden","No, I would say that in the case of the export market, what you'll find is that our rates will move directionally with what the coal prices do. So if coal prices go up, our rates go up; if they go down, our rates go down, but not at the same rate that the coal rates go up. So we'll go up a little less than the coal price will and we'll go down a little less than the coal price will. In our utility contracts going forward, that's just a totally separate environment, and as we go more to fixed and variable, those prices will tend to rise higher. And then to the third part of the question was most of that pricing that you saw in the first part of the decade was legacy contracts that we were able to reprice under the rail renaissance.","Operator","Our next question is from Scott Group with Wolfe Trahan.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","So on the coal side, Clarence, you talked about the met exports softening here. Are you saying that the met pricing that you're getting softened as well at this point? Or is that more something that you think happens in 2013? Maybe just talk about the overall pricing strategy on the export side, both met and steam, as you look out to next year. And do you focus a little bit more on keeping volume and giving up some price, or how do you think about that balance for next year?","Clarence W. Gooden","Well, as we said just then, Scott, to Ken, the met prices are going to move with the market. So think about it like this: 18 months ago, metallurgical coal was strike price, Queensland was about $320 a ton. Today, the strike price is about $170 a ton, which means it's selling at less than that, and so our rates have been adjusted accordingly. We still make very good money on the volumes that we move. So the volumes that we can move and move profitably, we will protect with rates. Those that we cannot move profitably, then we won't protect that rate when it gets too low. And so that's essentially how the mets are being priced. The thermal that we're moving this year was actually signed on a forward curve 2 years ago, so it has had little impact in our movements this year as a result of that.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","How do the forwards look for next year's pricing on the steam export?","Clarence W. Gooden","Steam forwards on API-2 index, the steam prices are about $94 a ton as of about 2 days ago on the forward-looking curve, and that's not as strong as it was 1 year ago or 2 years ago. So it has weakened to some extent in Europe.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay. And then last thing if I can, Clarence. The 3.7 pricing x coal, so x Export Coal, we haven't gotten that level of breakout before. Can you give us just a sense on how that 3.7 compares with what it would have looked like last year or 2 years ago? I'm just trying to get a sense of the pricing x coal, if that environment is changing. Now that we're through the legacy contracts, is this kind of the new normal?","Fredrik J. Eliasson","I think -- Scott, I think we provided pretty good transparency here in terms of giving the first 3 quarters of the year. I think you know that in the past, we've used that slide in the overall pricing and clearly, you know that in the beginning of this rail renaissance period, we had a lot of legacy contract that kept pricing a little bit higher level. So I think that's the best barometer we can provide you. This is something we think is important for people to understand, that the core pricing of our sales and marketing team is continuing to do inflation plus pricing, but it is a different market in the Export Coal side, which is why we're providing this breakout that we're doing now.","Operator","Next question is from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","If I can just come back to Tom's initial question here. Now I think what a lot of us are asking ourselves is, with the coal headwind in '13, feels like a similar outcome, maybe not as bad as in '12, but where you get productivity. But it just didn't drive a lot of OR improvement this year. Should we be thinking just modest targets on OR improvement for '13 and really have to wait for coal to stabilize where you can really drive those gains to get to your 65 target?","Fredrik J. Eliasson","I think that you have to -- we've kind of outlined the different profit levers that we have, and clearly, in an environment where coal is declining, it is going to be more difficult to provide a meaningful margin expansion. I think, based on the fact that our visibility into the Export Coal market is relatively limited, it is hard to see right now what it's going to do next year. If it's stronger, we will do better; if it's weaker, we will do less. But the other drivers that we have, inflation plus pricing, as Michael said earlier, we're going to -- we've grown our volumes up 4% this year, our non-coal business is still there, productivity is still there, we're putting a service product in front of our customer that is better than probably in recent memory or longer. And so we're doing the things that we can control the most very well and then we're going to have to adjust to whatever market environment we have and therefore, the operating ratio improvement would be reflective of that.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Well, maybe if I can follow up with that. Oscar, what type of leverage do you think you can get outside of these bulk networks? So in merchandise and in Intermodal where you're seeing the growth, is there a lot of spare capacity that you're anticipating can be utilized better as we look forward into '13?","Oscar Munoz","Yes, we certainly do have excess capacity. And with regards to the future, let me tell just a quick story. You may not have heard of our TSI carload initiative, but in essence, it's implementing what you have seen in our operating metrics as a kind of a more rapid car cycle. What we're doing now is in some cases, sort of contrarian to what you might think, we're actually servicing customers more frequently and with shorter trains in some instances to, a, increase the customer commitment that we want, but it's also improving a lot of our labor costs. So to your question, the next sort of step function in there is maintaining that great service and good car cycle, but doing it with a lengthening train length. And that's where kind of the next level of productivity will really, really benefit us.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Wetherbee with Citi.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Maybe a question just on the -- just to make sure, I want to understand the coal outlook when you put together the utility side and the export side for the fourth quarter. Clarence, did you mention that year-over-year we should see a lower number than what we saw in the third quarter? I just want to get a sense of kind of how we should be thinking about that cumulatively for the fourth quarter.","Clarence W. Gooden","Yes, that's correct Chris. From a percentage standpoint, it moderates, so there's less...","Oscar Munoz","The utility does.","Clarence W. Gooden","Utility does. Less decline than you saw in the third quarter. However, in terms of absolute tons handled, it also goes down on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Total tons handled both export and utility.","Clarence W. Gooden","No, utility.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Just utility. Okay.","Clarence W. Gooden","Export Coal will exceed the 40 million tons that we exceeded last year, but due to the volatility in it, we're just not sure how much at this time, but it will be another record year, third record year in a row for CSX in export tonnage.","Oscar Munoz","But it will moderate some of the export in the fourth quarter, right?","Clarence W. Gooden","It will and the second half will still be...","Oscar Munoz","Year-over-year up.","Clarence W. Gooden","Year-over-year up.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. I was -- I thought I had heard you say it was going to be weaker on a percentage basis. So I shouldn't just think that the 16% decline on total coal in the third quarter, it will be a larger negative number in the fourth quarter. That's not what you're saying.","Fredrik J. Eliasson","It is what we're saying. So year-over-year, the fourth quarter would probably be the most challenging quarter, even though utility coal volumes would probably moderate as Clarence has said. Because we expect Export Coal to be down year-over-year, the total between the 2 is going to make the fourth quarter probably the most challenging quarter of the year in terms of year-over-year volume, total coal.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. That's very helpful. And then maybe switching gears onto the productivity side. Oscar, obviously it looks like you're on target to the 180-plus that you said last quarter. Just want to get a rough sense of kind of the line of sight onto that for the fourth quarter. Is there a possibility of potential upside there? What are the challenges that you see facing you for reaching that goal in the fourth quarter?","Oscar Munoz","No challenges, I think we're well on path to the 180-plus. We talked about sort of a pro-rata delivery. I think we're ahead of that game, given the market outlook that you've seen. We have a great sense of where the future's headed in the near term and have taken the appropriate action. And so, we're probably ahead of the game and so we'll expect a probably $20 million to $30 million number in the fourth quarter, but more on the high-end given again the outlook. So well on path with a great deal of confidence.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Ceraso with Credit Suisse.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So you've responded to the lower price of the commodity in the export markets for coal, but as we look forward, as contracts start to roll over in domestic, what's your expectation about maintaining price there? And maybe as a follow-up on that, you mentioned 75% of your contracts for '13 are already locked in. Does that include any thermal coal contracts that have turned over or will be turning over?","Clarence W. Gooden","Chris, on the thermal contracts, as we mentioned earlier, it's we're in the process of negotiating most of those for the export side of the business in 2013. So that answer would be no. On the utility side, going forward, I think there's 2 factors there. One is we're going to price to the market, and number two is that as less coal is shipped and coal itself becomes more variable than fixed, then the cost of handling that goes up. And so our rates will have to reflect those increased costs going forward, and so we feel very positive about being able to make those recoveries going forward.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just a follow-up on stockpiles. Can you give us an update of where they are and then maybe how you think about what normal stockpiles are given the lower volumes and given the change in coal's role in the dispatch curve?","Clarence W. Gooden","In the Northeast, the stockpiles are running between 60 and 62 days, which is about 30 to 32 days above normal. In the Southeast, this data is according to PIRA, the stockpiles are running between 120 and 124 days and that's a normal 60 days, so about 60, 64 days above normal. And what was the last part of your question?","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Well, just have you thought about redefining what normal is given that there's a lower burn rate and that coal has become more of the swing fuel instead of the baseload?","Clarence W. Gooden","We are looking at it. We have some outside parties helping us to look at that also, because what has happened in the near term here with these low natural gas prices is gas has become more of the baseload and coal more of the variable load that's going in. So I just don't know right now.","Operator","The next question is from Justin Yagerman with Deutsche Bank.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A few questions here. In looking at your utility book, was curious how much of that is actually rolling in 2013. And if you previewed with those customers some of the thoughts that you've shared with investors around a more flexible service and how you price for that on a tiered basis and whether or not you've gotten any feedback on that as you've marketed that idea.","Clarence W. Gooden","Most of our utility contracts that come up for renewal in 2013 actually come up for renewal in late 2013.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And what percentage is that of the book, Clarence?","Clarence W. Gooden","That's going to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 20-plus percent, okay? Number two is yes, we have begun discussions with utilities about the nature of taking coal. Now here's the feedback from the utilities: \"We've seen low gas prices before. So what we're not going to let ourselves do is get locked in to 1 fuel source versus the other. We're going to dispatch according to the economics, but we recognize the fact that we have to protect the coal.\" So they're willing to enter into discussions with us on, how can we best price that and protect a certain amount of that coal? And then what do we do when there's peaks and spikes? And those discussions are ongoing.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Is it fair to say that because of that, these will be shorter duration contracts most likely?","Clarence W. Gooden","I don't know, is the truth on that.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And, Clarence, quick question. You didn't give a breakout, I don't -- or I didn't hear it, of thermal versus met in the quarter in terms of export. Do you have that?","Clarence W. Gooden","Yes, 60-40 in favor of met.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And when I think about the thermal side, how out of the money is $94 on the API-2 right now? And then when I think about what that means for volumes as you go into these contracts right now, how realistic is it that you could see flat to up volumes next year in thermal given where you are on the API-2 right now?","Clarence W. Gooden","Well, $94 is going to put us on the margin. If we had to make the contract going forward today, there is some overcapacity, as you could imagine, in the coal market on a global basis. It's really too volatile and too soon to tell. We'll know a heck of a lot more, Justin, on that question in the first quarter, as we can see how this thing is moving and what's happening to the economy in Europe, and what kind of weather they have in Europe this winter.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And last one. Fredrik, you guys got this 65 OR target, it sounds like there is a lot in flux when it comes to coal right now, and honestly, you guys put this target out there before we saw nat gas prices collapse. Why stick with it here? I mean, where is the confidence coming from in terms of line of sight if you've got so much variability. I get the productivity gains and I understand, in the merchandise business, the growth beyond GDP, but it will be hard to push the ball that far forward if coal is going to be a headwind both on export and on utility, at least for the near-term foreseeable future. And none of us have a crystal ball, so who knows what happens 2 or 3 years out? Why stick with this number here?","Fredrik J. Eliasson","Well, you hit on it. First of all, it is 3 years out. And when we issued the guidance, we had appropriately put in a fairly sizable contingency to deal with stuff along the way and obviously, stuff happened with utility coal. And we've been pretty transparent that as that happened and has occurred throughout the year, we have said that it's going to be more challenging. And clearly based on where we are today, it's going to be more back-end-loaded than we thought originally to get there. But that is what this organization is rallying around and as we look at things right now, if we execute extremely well all the different parameters we have, we still think we can get there, but a lot of things has to go right. We're going to go through our normal strategic plan process here this spring and review that with the board, and if there's additional color to be provided at that point, we will do that. But right now, that's just the goal that unifies this organization. This is the goal that we have the incentives rallying around and right now, we still feel we have line of sight towards it.","Operator","Our next question is from Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities Equity Research","Just wanted to ask you a question in terms of resource levels, the furloughs, the retention boards and the locomotives that you've got parked. Are you happy where you are based on the business outlook as it stands? Or is there more to go there?","Oscar Munoz","Michael closed his comments, Cherilyn -- this is Oscar -- with 3 questions. Do we believe a strong service product drives long-term growth? Are we managing the things that we can? Are we investing in the right things in the future? And so you have to take all those 3 questions into account when you answer that question. And so we are not yet confident there. There's a lot of uncertainty out there. What we're building, because of that uncertainty, is the ability to recover and move quickly. For instance, as we put locomotives down, historically, the time to put them down and bring them back up has taken us quite a long time. Our efforts with -- inside our team is to sort of accelerate that process so it becomes less of a variable for us. So no, we are not. It is a constantly moving and dynamic business. We have to be flexible to it and we will continue to moderate the different scenarios, as I've spoken earlier, and manage accordingly.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities Equity Research","Okay. If I could ask a question on Intermodal. I did notice that from a carload standpoint, you were up 8% year-over-year, but the RTMs were up 19%. So I was just wondering if you could speak about what's going on there in terms of mix impacts.","Clarence W. Gooden","Yes, Cherilyn, this is Clarence. We've looked at that several ways internally. We think there's 2 factors that could potentially be driving that. The first one is our customers are making a concentrated effort to reduce the number of empty miles that they're hauling the containers. So I mean it's a normal process. It's what's to be expected. But secondly is the mix of what we're actually exporting and importing and the weight that's in those containers. So for example, in some of the businesses that we're doing now where we are exporting some grain products, some DDGs overseas, they tend to be denser and heavier type commodities.","Operator","Our next question is from Ben Hartford with Baird.","Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I guess, Oscar, can you talk a little bit about services? Obviously very strong here in 2012. To what extent has better -- maybe better-than-expected service -- maybe you could talk about how service has trended relative to your expectations and how meaningful that is in driving above this $180 million annual savings threshold this year. And does this improved level of service allow a line of sight to something greater than the $130 million to $140 million in annual savings that you had talked about a year ago when you were talking about that 65 OR target?","Oscar Munoz","Great. I will stay out of the guidance business on that front, but you've laid it out very well. Better service is indeed cheaper for us and that has been the key focus across the different technology and process teams that we've done, execution and great leadership out there. Your question is about whether the services exceed our expectations. I mean, it's near an all-time record level, so I guess, ostensibly, you could say yes. But it is the new norm for us. Our customers are expecting that and that's what we're focusing on.","Operator","Our next question is from Jason Seidl with Dahlman Rose.","Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","A couple of quick questions. One, since -- I won't beat coal to death too much here, but since you guys are talking about the expenses, in the MS&O line you said it was going to continue on some of the benefits into 4Q. Should we consider that's going to be ongoing onto '13 as well? Or is that going to dissipate after 4Q?","Fredrik J. Eliasson","On the MS&O line, clarify the question just so I understand.","Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Yes. And I'm sorry for that. On the MS&O line, you said that you expected another benefit in 4Q, but moderating, I think, somewhat from 3Q. Do you expect that to also continue into 2013?","Fredrik J. Eliasson","You're referring to our SunRail gain?","Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Yes.","Fredrik J. Eliasson","Yes. So what we have said on the SunRail gain is that we are expecting a similar amount, that we saw here in the third quarter, in the fourth quarter as well, but the year-over-year comparison [indiscernible] as we have started recognizing the gain last year at a tune of $14 million.","Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","And that is going to be done for the gain after 4Q.","Fredrik J. Eliasson","Yes, so right now, we have recognized to date about $83 million and the total gain is $160 million, so there's $77 million left. And so a similar amount in -- as we had here in the third quarter will be in the fourth quarter, so you'll have about $50 million or so left to be recognized in '13 and beyond.","Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Very, very helpful. Last one is on pricing overall. If you look sort of x utility coal, it has moderated somewhat. Clarence, how much of that is due to just of sort of a weaker economic environment and it lowers your ability to grab price? And how much of it is due to sort of just lower inflationary cost plus pricing.","Clarence W. Gooden","I'd say there's a third factor. Most of it in the utility coal is due to the legacy pricing over time. As we started out in the first 2 or 3, 4 years around 2004, '05 and '06 with a lot of legacy contracts that we could renew, then in the subsequent years, we had a second shot at those, and now you're seeing a more normal pricing in those areas.","Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","So it's almost like your golf score, and the ability to get it lower and lower and lower becomes harder and harder and harder the better you get.","Clarence W. Gooden","Well, that would not be true of my golf score, but it would be true...","Operator","Our next question is from David Vernon with Bernstein.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So with the mix and weight changes that are going on in the Intermodal business, Clarence, the 2% gain in RPU, how much of that is -- would you consider core price versus mix, weight or length of haul change?","Clarence W. Gooden","I would consider most of it core price.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So the longer haul or the heavier weight stuff isn't -- you're not getting any benefit out of that. Or the shift from international to domestic, you're not getting an RPU lift from that, or...","Clarence W. Gooden","Where we have -- where we do have mix and longer length of haul, yes, we're getting more money for that, but on the weight basis, we're not because we're charging by the unit, not by the weight.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. So -- but the 2% gain is mostly price in Intermodal.","Clarence W. Gooden","Yes.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And how heavily is the Intermodal business weighted in that same-store sales x Export Coal number.","Clarence W. Gooden","Now that, I don't know.","Fredrik J. Eliasson","I think that we provide pretty good transparency in what we've done here in this -- by breaking out Export Coal. I think that's the appropriate level. What we're trying to get across is to make sure people understand that overall pricing continues to be in line with what we've said previously and it's an inflation plus level.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. Great. And then just one last technical question. On Slide 7, the fuel recovery number down 24, is that fuel surcharge revenue down 24? Am I reading that right?","Fredrik J. Eliasson","Yes.","Operator","Our next question is from John Larkin with Stifel, Nicolaus.","John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","On the Intermodal side, can you remind us what the international Intermodal volume would be year-over-year and the overall Intermodal volume would be year-over-year x the Maersk win, which I think it the anniversaries on 1\/1\/2013?","Clarence W. Gooden","The international volume on a year-over-year basis, John, have been essentially flat.","John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And the total?","Clarence W. Gooden","I don't have it broken down by total. I've got what the domestic increases are.","John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, are there any other customers that find the Northwest Ohio hub as attractive as apparently Maersk did? Are you on the verge of any additional market share capture as a result of that strategy, which is quite a bit different than brand access strategy?","Clarence W. Gooden","Well, I think we mentioned a couple of earnings releases ago that one of the principal reasons Hyundai chose CSX was because of the advantages that Northwest Ohio has given us. We have gotten, in the past year since the terminal has been opened, rave reviews from all of our customers about the facility. It's living up to all the things that we had promised that it would live up to, and based on that, we think that we've got us about where we're going to be in the market share side on the north, and we're going to be able to retain the market share.","John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. Given that, that's worked so well, is there any reason to think that it might be worth taking a look at perhaps putting together a similar hub, perhaps somewhere in the Southeast, that would give you the same sort of flexibility that you now have in the Midwest?","Clarence W. Gooden","Well, John, we're looking at all kind of opportunities in the Southeast as the network gets more complex, so I just don't know right this minute.","Operator","Next question is from Jeff Kauffman with Sterne Agee.","Salvatore Vitale - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Sal Vitale on for Jeff Kauffman. Just a quick question. You mentioned softening global demand for metallurgical Export Coal in 4Q. How quickly do you think that we can see the effect of the new steel projects in China as a result of the recently announced stimulus measures there? We've already seen -- started to see rising Chinese iron ore prices and steel prices in response. How quickly do you think that can take effect?","Clarence W. Gooden","Well, I'm not sure I know the answer to that and I'll tell you the reason I say that. As of last week, there's a lot of unsold coal that's off the coast of China in vessels right now. So the Chinese are playing a cat and mouse game of \"I'll wait until the prices go down and I'll buy.\" As soon as that backlog is worked off and assuming with the new regime changes in Beijing that they continue to stimulate the economy, then you could see that sometime in the first to second quarter.","Operator","The next question is from Anthony Gallo with Wells Fargo.","Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I was hoping you could talk a little bit about agriculture for 2013, and I'm thinking about it in the context of what your business has historically seen following the type of drought that we had this year. I suspect increased planting drives fertilizer, et cetera, but can you put a little color around what '13 could look like following the type of drought we had this year.","Clarence W. Gooden","Well, here's our view. On the ag side of the business, you won't see any significant upswing in shipments until the late third quarter and fourth quarter of next year, because we literally got to plant the crop and grow it. Second factor is you will see, as far as the Eastern roads go, this will not be true of West, you will see less exports, grains moving to export. Historically, for our mix of business, we're about 40% feed, 40% ethanol and 20% export. So you will see less of that. A lesser impact could come in the ethanol market as energy credits are used in lieu of production while prices of corn are as high as they are on a per-bushel basis. We do believe that in the next planting season here, that the crop will -- the farmers and the market itself will adapt for this and will have heavy plantings. Our Phosphates & Fertilizer shipments are staying reasonably robust. As a result of the drought, there is some belief that there's nutrients still in the soil. We'll know more about that in the first quarter as the spring planting and spring fertilizing comes in. Did that help?","Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Very helpful.","Operator","The next question is from Pete Nesvold with Jefferies & Company.","Peter Nesvold","So my operational questions have been answered. On the financial side maybe, thinking about the dividend rolling forward to 2Q, as well as share repurchases, which will be exhausted by the end of this calendar year. Understanding that both of those are board decisions, I'm interested in hearing management's perspective on each of those. I mean, you're at 31% payout right now last 4 quarters. Arguably we're probably looking at flattish type earnings, maybe slightly down 4Q and 1Q. It would still leave some headroom -- there is headroom still to the higher end of your payout range. So when you think about increasing the dividend -- well let me ask, is it about seeing earnings growth year-over-year in 2Q? Is that sort of the primary catalyst for raising the dividend? Or do you like to continually raise the dividend each year? And then separately, you've been shrinking the share count by about 15 million shares each year. If we are in for sort of a flattish earnings period here for a bit, what's the appetite to reload and to continue to shrink the share count at roughly that level?","Fredrik J. Eliasson","Well, let me start with the share repurchase program question. So you know that we have about 234 million left of the current program and that's our #1 priority right now, to complete that by the end of the year. As we get into our plan process and review with the board for next year, we'll see what sort of free cash flow levels we have. At that point, we'll size that program appropriately. We have said publicly that predominantly it should be funded by free cash flow, but we also can use some balance sheet capacity if we think that's appropriate. But predominantly free cash flow, so that -- so when we get to the first quarter, we'll have an update and a view of that. On the dividend side, I think we've been very transparent. Between 30%, 35%, that is what we're going to target going forward. I think we will see what the fourth and the first quarter does in terms of earnings and based on that, we will size it accordingly but the parameters between 30% and 35% is really the key driver.","Operator","Your next question is from Donald Broughton with Avondale Partners.","Donald Broughton - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","As cars on the line are down over 7%, almost 8%, can you give us some color on what the complexion of the cars you put into the storage, how many of them and what classification?","Oscar Munoz","Yes, Donald, it's Oscar. Many of the cars in storage kind of older gondolas for the metals and coal business, as well as some covered hoppers, and some of these are just in storage simply due to the normal seasonality. And again, back to an earlier point, these are stored in strategic places where, when we need them, we can pull them back in the service very quickly.","Operator","The next question is from Matthew Troy with Susquehanna.","Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Going back to the golf analogy before. This is starting to feel like a five-hour round. Let me just ask essential questions. RCAF is a primary metric of rail inflation but has been limited in its application in recent years. Just wondering what percentage of your contract base of your book of business is tied to RCAF. And how should we look at that as a directional indication of rail inflation as we try and determine what rail inflation plus actually might mean? What are your assumptions there?","Clarence W. Gooden","Well, RCAF represents about 1\/3 -- RCAF less fuel represents about 1\/3 of our business. We look at -- we use Global Insight's forecasting to look at what we think RCAF is going to be on a forward-looking basis.","Fredrik J. Eliasson","And over time, RCAF seems to be gravitating between somewhere between 3% and 4%. I think that's a good proxy for our inflation plus pricing comments as well.","Operator","The next question is from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital.","Erin Lytollis - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","This Erin Lytollis in for Walter. Just a quick question for you on the Domestic Intermodal side. You've previously identified about 9 million units of truckload conversion opportunity in the Eastern markets. Can you give us some color on what your targets are and your timelines are for converting this traffic?","Clarence W. Gooden","Well, we are meeting with our customers now and the beneficial cargo owners on a regular basis. We have some models that we can run that shows which of that business is conducive to being converted over to Intermodal. We do that along with our truckload partners and our IMCs as well, and so we're targeting to turn as much of it as quickly we can, to be honest with you.","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Levin with BB&T Capital Markets.","Mark A. Levin - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Just a big picture question. As you kind of think about the utility market going forward, obviously seeing massive declines in central Appalachia, particularly on the steam side, Clarence, as you kind of think about what central Ap steam production looks like over the next couple of years relative to your sort of market sort of stabilization, I mean, how do you kind of -- how do you reconcile the 2? Because it seems like just given the cost structure in Central Ap, unless natural gas prices get a massive, massive surge, that the production decline, particularly on the thermal side, is going to continue. And then related to that point, the Illinois Basin, what type of growth should we expect out of the Illinois Basin to maybe offset some of that steam decline in cap?","Clarence W. Gooden","Well, I think you'll continue to see declines in Central Appalachian production. You've seen it over years. It's forecasted by a lot of the coal companies that it will, in fact, decline. As my colleague, Oscar Munoz, can attest to here, there is great growth that's occurring in the Illinois Basin. That growth is both as the result of the high BTU content and the fact that the power plants are scrubbed, number two. Number two, it's a lower cost coal, which makes it at a lower price point versus natural gas and so we think that, that for us would bode positive, as well as Northern Appalachian coal, which is serving a lot, both of our export markets and serving our utility markets there. Did that answer you?","Mark A. Levin - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Well, as you kind of think about the mix in a couple of years. Illinois Basin today, versus cap today and then maybe in a couple of years, how could you see that mix changing on the steam side?","Clarence W. Gooden","I would see it heavily weighted towards Illinois Basin.","Mark A. Levin - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","And enough to offset -- do you think enough to offset the potential decline in cap steam over the next couple of years?","Clarence W. Gooden","Well, I don't -- the problem that I'm having with answering that question is what's going to determine the steam is going to be what the utility burns. And so, whether -- if you're sitting in our shoes, whether it comes out of Illinois Basin or cap basin, we just want to haul it.","Operator","Our final question will come from Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","A service question for you. On-time originations and arrivals improved pretty impressively, 25% to 30%. I'm sure this is due in part to Oscar's arrival as COO, but also were there easy comps or simply lower congestion in the coal system? What drove such dramatic improvement?","Oscar Munoz","I think it has nothing to do with me, I suspect. We have a great team out there. I think it's the additional resources that we geared up for last year. I think one of the things we got caught up is not having quite enough and so we've adequately resourced around that. Our operating plan has been running very smoothly. Certainly, you mentioned kind of lower volumes, but again, as Michael has mentioned and Clarence has mentioned, our overall volume growth this quarter was actually fairly robust absent the coal business. And so, lower volumes is not necessarily a big factor in that. It is around execution and the performance of our team.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","And maybe one more quick one. Oscar, you mentioned I think in your remarks, locomotive fuel management tools. Can you comment on how broadly you've rolled out travel selection, position guidance software. And is this a pretty material lever on further reducing fuel expense?","Oscar Munoz","It is a material and will be an increasingly more material lever. We are in the genesis of that, so we're probably maybe 1\/6 of the way in as to where we want to be. The tool's called Trip Optimizer and it's an neat tool that has been helpful. You saw some of the fuel efficiency in Fred's presentation and that will continue.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Any thoughts on nat gas as a viable locomotive fuel?","Oscar Munoz","It's an exciting concept. Most of the locomotive manufacturers are actively working it. There's some pilot tests being done within the rail industry. Outside of rail, a lot of the heavy industry out there is putting that new technology into action. We will be very open and very flexible in understanding the merits and sort of pivot accordingly when the time is right.","Michael Jon Ward","Well, thank you all for attending the conference today and we'll see you in another quarter.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference.

And welcome to the CSX Corporation Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. During this call all participants will be in a listen-only mode.","For opening remarks and introduction, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. David Baggs, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations Officer for CSX Corporation.","David Baggs","Thank you, Shirley, and good morning, everyone. And again, welcome to CSX Corporation\u2019s second quarter 2015 earnings presentation. The presentation material we'll be reviewing this morning along with our quarterly financial report, and our safety and service measurements, are available on our website at csx.com under the Investor section. In addition, following the presentation a webcast and podcast replay will be available on that same website.","This morning, our presentation will be led by Michael Ward, the company\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Fredrik Eliasson, our Chief Financial Officer. In addition, Oscar Munoz, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Clarence Gooden, our Chief Marketing Officer will be available during the question-and-answer session.","Now before I turn the presentation over to Michael, let me remind everyone that the presentation and other statements made by the company contain forward-looking statements.","You are encouraged to review the company\u2019s disclosures in the accompanying presentation on slide two. The disclosure identifies forward-looking statements, as well as the uncertainties and risks that could cause actual performance to differ materially from the results anticipated by these statements.","In addition, at the end of the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session with the research analysts. With approximately 30 analysts covering CSX today, and have to respect for everyone\u2019s timing including our investors, I would ask as a courtesy for you to please limit your inquiries to one question and if necessary a clarifying question on that same topic.","And with that, let me turn the presentation over to CSX Corporation's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Michael Ward. Michael?","Michael Ward","Well, thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report that yesterday CSX announced second quarter financial results for its shareholders that included all-time company records for operating income and operating ratio, as well as earnings per share, which were $0.56, up from $0.53 reported in 2014.","Overall, significant operating efficiency helped offset year-over-year declines in revenue and volume. Starting with the topline, revenue in the quarter declined 6% to $3.1 billion. Pricing gains were more than offset by lower fuel recovery, a changing business mix, and a 1% volume decline as we cycled last year\u2019s demand surge.","At the same time, we have the resources in place to meet customer demand across the network, supporting improved service performance and operational efficiency. That efficiency coupled with lower fuel prices helped decrease expenses by 9% and delivered all-time records in operating income at $1 billion and an operating ratio of 66.8% for the quarter.","We expect service momentum to continue as we progress toward the record service levels we saw in 2012 and 2013. That service is the foundation for driving long-term growth and value creation of our shareholders, as it also supports our ability to price to the value of rail transportation and produce ever more efficient operations.","Now, I will turn the presentation over to Fredrik, who will take us through the top and bottomline results in more detail. Fredrik?","Fredrik Eliasson","Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by providing some more detail on our second quarter results. Revenue was down 6% versus the prior year, driven mainly by $183 million of lower fuel surcharge recoveries. At the same time, the impact of negative business mix and lower volume were essentially offset by core pricing gains.","Volume decreased 1% from last year, with low commodity prices impacting coal and crude volumes and some of our merchandise markets, particular metals being challenged by the strong U.S. dollar. Core pricing continues to improve sequentially and for the quarter was up 3.5% overall and 3.9% excluding coal.","Other revenue increased $46 million versus the prior year. The primary driver was the cycling of about $20 million negative impact to the in-transit reserve last year, coupled with the positive impact this quarter from a similar amount as network performance improved significantly.","Expenses decreased 9% versus the prior year driven mainly by the impact of lower fuel prices. Our ongoing focus on efficiency drove $45 million in productivity gains in the quarter, but lower volume resulted in $32 million of cost reduction versus last year.","In addition, we recorded a $17 million gain in the quarter associated with the sale of an operating rail corridor. Operating income exceeded $1 billion for the quarter for the first time in CSX's history and was up 2% versus the prior year.","Looking below the line, interest expense was similar to last year, while other income was favorable as we cycled environmental charges for non-operating activities from the prior year period.","And finally, income taxes were $334 million in the quarter, reflecting higher pre-tax earnings. The effective tax rate was about 38%, which is consistent with our expectation going forward. Overall, net earnings were $553 million and EPS was $0.56 per share, up 5% and 6% respectively, versus the prior year period.","Now, let me turn to the market outlook for the third quarter. Overall, we expect volume to decline slightly in the third quarter. Although, we expect a slight decline of the higher 2014 base, CSX\u2019s portfolio remains balanced with several growth markets offset by challenging near-term market dynamics in other. We are projecting favorable conditions for 49% of our volume in the third quarter and stable to unfavorable conditions for the remaining 51%.","Strong intermodal performance will continue as our strategic network investments support highway to rail conversions and growth with existing customers. Increased infrastructure development projects continue to drive a favorable outlook for minerals.","Agricultural is neutral as strength in domestic grain shipments closing out the prior harvest is offset by a weaker ethanol market as a result of higher inventory levels. Automotive volume is expected to be similar to the strong level we saw in the third quarter last year reflecting North American light vehicle production.","Chemicals is expected to be neutral due to lower drilling activity stemming from the continued low commodity price environment, which will put additional pressure on volumes in our crude and frac sand businesses. Both markets are expected to decline by about 15% in the third quarter. However, strength in plastics and LPG will keep the chemicals portfolio stable.","In unfavorable category, we sustained low natural gas prices under $3 and high stockpiles going into the heart of the summer season. Domestic coal volumes will decline close to 15% in the third quarter, and for the full year we expect volume to be down approximately 10%.","Export coal volume is expected to be lower in the third quarter, reflecting global oversupply and the strong U.S. dollar. Although, we still expect about 30 million tons for the full year.","Forest products will benefit from steady housing gains as inventories are worked off, but paper products remain challenged due to the secular trends in that market. The metals market is expected to be unfavorable as fuel production remains below prior year levels with the strong U.S. dollar encouraging higher imports. The phosphate markets will draw down on existing inventories and we expect volume behavior to be cautious going into the new harvest season.","Overall, on a sequential basis, intermodal will experience a typical third quarter increase going into the peak season while the merchandise segment will remain essentially flat and coal will be down.","Turning to the next slide, let me talk about our expectation for expenses in the third quarter. Beginning with labor and fringe, we expect third quarter average headcount to decline sequentially by approximately 1% as we align employees to the lower demand environment.","We expect labor inflation to be around $25 million in the third quarter, which is a reduction from the level seen in the first half as union wage inflation becomes less of a headwind. In addition, we expect labor and fringe expense to benefit from further network fluidity improvement and efficiency as we remain focused on increasing train length and aligning crew starts.","Looking at MS&O expense, we expect inflation to be offset by productivity gains. We also expect to incur remediation costs in the third quarter associated with the recent derailment in Maryville, Tennessee. Fuel expense in the third quarter will be driven mainly by lower cost per gallon, reflecting the current price environment and continued focus on fuel efficiency.","We expect depreciation in the third quarter to increase $10 million to $15 million versus the prior year, reflecting the ongoing investment in the business. Finally, equipment and other rents in the third quarter is expected to stay relatively flat to last year, with higher freight car rates offset by improving car cycle times.","Now let me wrap it up on the next slide. CSX delivered another strong financial performance this quarter and as Michael mentioned, we set new all-time records for operating income, operating ratio and earnings per share.","Looking ahead to the third quarter, while service excellence will continue to drive continued efficiency gains and strong pricing to support long-term investment in the business, we expect third quarter EPS to be relatively flat to the prior year. Included in this outlook, we expect to incur at least a penny impact related to the Maryville, Tennessee derailment.","In addition, we will be cycling a strong demand environment to last year, which coupled with the dynamic conditions we are facing is expected to impact our volume growth. Domestic coal continues to be a significant headwind and we now expect that market to be down close to 15% in the third quarter.","Looking at the full year 2015 earnings, we are still targeting mid to high single-digit EPS growth. However, given the current energy environment, achieving the upper end of that range will clearly be challenging. That said, we still expect to make meaningful improvement to our full year operating ratio and with improving service driving efficiency and strong core pricing that supports investment in the business, we are confident in the company's future and our progression towards the mid-60s full year operating ratio.","With that, let me turn the presentation back to Michael for his closing remarks.","Michael Ward","Well, thank you, Fredrik. As you\u2019ve seen today, CSX produced excellent results in the second quarter for its shareholders in a challenging market environment by driving operating efficiency with the committed efforts of our 32,000 dedicated employees. And we continued to focus on the actions that are foundational to our long-term success.","Delivering excellent service supports growth and operational efficiency, which in turn creates customer value that enable strong pricing for the value of the service we provide and allows us to continue driving earnings growth and margin improvement. We are pursuing new opportunities across our diverse portfolio and further improving network performances to our consumers and producers throughout the global supply chain and to create value for you, our shareholders.","Thank you for your interest in CSX and we are now glad to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Ossenbeck with J.P. Morgan. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Ossenbeck","Hey, good morning and thanks for taking my call. So one thing that stood out is this is the first time in the quarter where you\u2019ve put all-in numbers in core merchandise, intermodal same-store sales pricing results anywhere really close to one another including last quarter.","So, I was wondering how much did the shift in the business mix impact those numbers, and could you have had even higher pricing trends if the commodity carloads didn\u2019t drop off about 4% in the quarter. Is there any other -- any other color on that would be helpful? Thank you.","Fredrik Eliasson","Brian, this is Fred Eliasson. The big driver here is that we\u2019re cycling the actions we took last year in the export coal markets. And as a result, we\u2019re seeing those two numbers harmonize more now and we expect that going forward as well.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay. So you expect them to be harmonized in the near future at the same level on that 3.5% to 4%.","Fredrik Eliasson","No. What I am saying is that the gap between the two numbers, between our all-in pricing and the non-coal pricing has been exacerbated because of the actions we\u2019ve taken over the last year or two in our export coal markets. We are now as we move into the third quarter moving past those actions from last year.","I think, over time, we continue to expect strong pricing in all our markets as we continue to price to market and ensure reinvestment in the business. So, I think that gap will be much, much more narrow going forward.","Brian Ossenbeck","Thank you, Brian.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citi. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Chris.","Chris Wetherbee","Good morning, guys. Thanks. I wanted to talk about sort of the productivity gains that you\u2019re getting. You\u2019ve seen sort of the cost from efficiencies pickup 2Q to 3Q. Presumably, if service continues to improve, those numbers should get a bit better in the back half, but just wanted to get sort of an update on how you think about sort of the back half in terms of productivity and efficiency gains from the cost perspective?","Fredrik Eliasson","Yes, this is Fredrik again. We\u2019ve gone up to a good start here this year, obviously $45 million here in the second quarter, but $41 million in the first quarter. We have said that we still think we can approach $200 million for the full year, but probably not as close as we originally have thought because of what we saw in the first quarter, because of weather and also because of the fact that the volume environment is not as strong as we had originally anticipated.","However, we\u2019re very much focused on driving efficiency gains, but just implied by the first half performance and our guidance for the full year, we are going to have a strong second half as well.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Tom.","Tom Wadewitz","Yes, good morning, Michael. I wanted to ask you a question on coal. I appreciate the commentary on third quarter and kind of how to look things. If you look beyond third quarter, how might we think about when coal volumes might bottom both on the utility and on the export side? I mean, do you think that kind of down 15% in fourth quarter and then maybe you are flat next year?","Or how do we think about that, because it just seems like the pressures are in place both utility and export? And it\u2019s hard to -- looking at a couple quarters, it\u2019s just hard to know how to think about how coal volumes might play out? Thank you.","Clarence Gooden","Well, Tom, this is Clarence. It\u2019s looking like the fourth quarter could be -- easily if gas prices remain where they are now to be repeated in the third quarter, it is probably too soon to tell about what export is going to look like next year, but it certainly won\u2019t be as strong as it is, has been this year as Australian benchmark stays where it is now. Australian dollar stays where it is now which is about $0.74, and the API 2 stays where it is now which is at the high 50s. Next year it won\u2019t be a good export year.","Tom Wadewitz","So if you said the current conditions persist, do you think coal will down next year further or do you say well it\u2019s already been down enough this year so it\u2019s flat?","Clarence Gooden","Well, there is certainly more upside than downside for next year, but it could be down.","Michael Ward","So a lot depends I guess on the weather and where gas prices are.","Clarence Gooden","Weather and where gas prices are, right. Weather and gas prices.","Michael Ward","I think just to clarify what Clarence said, I think there is probably more downside to the coal volume next year than there is upside.","Tom Wadewitz","Right.","Michael Ward","If the current -- if gas prices stay, and the exports markets kind of remain challenging.","Clarence Gooden","Yes. Based on seeing right now both between domestic and exports, probably more downside to our volumes for 2016 than there is upside in those two markets.","Tom Wadewitz","Okay. I know it\u2019s a tough market to figure out, so I appreciate the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Allison.","Q \u2013 Allison Landry","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering in terms of the fourth quarter, do you think that you could grow earnings year-over-year even if the volume environment remains soft, just given the acceleration in productivity gains, sort of getting the network back in balance and then continuing to see acceleration in the core pricing gains?","Fredrik Eliasson","Well, I think Allison, this is Fredrik again. I think obviously we have two quarters behind us. We\u2019ve given guidance for the third quarter and we\u2019ve given guidance for the full year that range. So that range depends on what we\u2019re seeing -- what we\u2019re going to see in the fourth quarter. So, great momentum in terms of what we do on our productivity side. We continue to -- we see a strong pricing environment as well. But it really depends on how massive will this coal headwind be in the second half. And I think how those, kind of the positives and negatives work out, will allow us to see what we are ultimately going to be producing. We\u2019re certainly targeting to produce earnings growth. But I think until we get through a little bit more of this summer to see where the stockpiles end up as we go into the shoulder season, it\u2019s hard to exactly pinpoint where we\u2019re going to end up.","Allison Landry","Okay. So it seems like coal is really the wildcard or question mark for 4Q.","Fredrik Eliasson","Yeah. I think coal is the wildcard and I also think as we have indicated in the prepared remarks that we also expect a sequential decline in our crude volumes based on what we see in the spread due. And I think we\u2019ll going to have to follow that as well to see what the impact from that will be on our volumes there.","Allison Landry","Okay. All right. Thank you for the time.","Operator","Thanks. Our next question comes from Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Rob.","Rob Salmon","Hey. Good morning. As a follow-up to some of the productivity discussions, could you talk a little bit about -- if we look back a couple years, the productivity is a couple of miles an hour stronger. Maybe could you speak to operationally kind of what additional adjustments need to be made across the network to get back to those levels? And then Fred describes from a financial perspective what the bottom line tailwind would be if CSX achieves those two miles an hour of roughly of improved velocity.","Oscar Munoz","Rob, this is Oscar Munoz, nice to meet you. Listen, with regards to the recovery aspect of that, I think what we\u2019ve said for sometime is the initial point of recovery was this quarter, second quarter and then the acceleration and continued performance and getting back to those record levels. I think the timing of that is related to a lot of the other activities that we've been talking about. But I think that\u2019s the progression we\u2019re making.","Fredrik Eliasson","And yeah, we still have -- in the second quarter, obviously improved significant and sequentially throughout the quarter but we\u2019re still at the place where we still have over time levels that we think will come down. We have re-crew levels that could be improved, equipment cycle times can be improved as well, which is part of why we see us very robust opportunity set, not just in the second half of 2015 but also going into \u201816 as well.","And that is going to be critical for us, as we see a topline environment that from a volume perspective, perhaps not as strong and as robust as we would like it, at least based on what we\u2019re seeing right now. So good momentum on our productivity side and should translate into some good numbers from a bottom line perspective as well.","Rob Salmon","Note. And just as a clarification with the productivity, should we be expecting another elevated productivity gains looking out into 2016, given those expected, continued improvements?","Fredrik Eliasson","I like to think that we should be able to exceed our historical average, which has been somewhere around the 130, 140 as we move into 2016.","Rob Salmon","Perfect. Thank so much.","Fredrik Eliasson","Yeah.","Operator","Thanks. The next question comes from Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Thomas.","Thomas Kim","Good morning. Thanks for your time. Last quarter, you dispose as an operating asset. And I\u2019m curious if you could sort of frame out for us the opportunity set to monetize what management seem to be non-core or perhaps maybe less strategic going forward?","Fredrik Eliasson","Yeah. This is Fredrik again. Yeah. So, we did have an operating property that we monetized here this quarter, was a deal that we worked on through an extended period of time frankly. And we do have some more, both operating and non-operating properties going forward and when they occur, we would be transparent with those. And of course, you will see them as I said when they\u2019ll occur.","I don't think that the opportunity set is big enough where it\u2019s going to make a huge difference over time for us because we've done a lot of this over a last couple of decades frankly. But there is something that we constantly look at, to see if there are opportunities to rationalize some of the infrastructure we have, whether is operating or non-operating.","Thomas Kim","Okay. If I can just ask a follow-on question related to that, to what extent do these -- for example, the most recent asset sale improve your operating expense?","Fredrik Eliasson","One more time?","Thomas Kim","With regard to -- for example the most recent asset sale, to what extent is the sale beneficial to reducing operating expense, is there some\u2026","Fredrik Eliasson","This sales specifically I don\u2019t think is going to improve our operating expense because it essentially a line segment that we weren\u2019t really operating much on it at all and so it really won\u2019t have an impact. There could be instances in the future really would but this one specifically didn\u2019t.","Thomas Kim","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Bill.","Bill Greene","Hi. Good morning, Michael. Clarence, I have a question for you on pricing, because I get asked this a fair amount and that is, when we look at sort of what CSX chose to do in export coal as things got weaker there, why would you not take a similar approach in the domestic market? Could you or is it your view that you can or cannot sort of preserve some volume, save some utility plants given the low natural gas price? How do you think about the pricing in the coal market, because that's something, given what you've done in export that folks look to and say, how sustainable is the pricing dynamic there?","Clarence Gooden","Bill, we have taken a look at it and frankly, the gas prices are so low, we just cannot materially impact it enough to make a difference.","Bill Greene","Okay. And then on the export side, is there -- we said we would lap this. It's done. Is there any risk further that the markets kind of cause you to sort of rethink that at all or at this point have you kind of done what you can do and the volumes will just take care of themselves from here?","Clarence Gooden","We have done what we can do in the volumes, so we just have to take care in the sales.","Bill Greene","Yeah. Fair enough. Thanks for your time. Appreciate it.","Michael Ward","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Hoexter","Great. Good morning, Michael and team. And just on the labor cost here, you have dug into cost per employee was flat this quarter versus up 5% last quarter. Just your thoughts, I guess, on a couple things around that and further employee cuts, I think, you noticed down 1%, but if volumes continued to fall, how do you think about that, Oscar, maybe in advance? And then, cost per employee, what happens to that as we go forward here on your productivity?","Fredrik Eliasson","Yeah. And this is Fredrik, let me take that one. So, yeah, cost per employee did fall here versus what we saw in the first quarter and that\u2019s, obviously, part of that is, in fact that we now have close to 600 people on furlough and that reduced it. But also reduction in overtime, a little bit of reduction in training costs as well. So that helped.","And as we move forward now, as we continue to run better, we probably have an opportunity, perhaps, that even greater number of furloughs and reduce overtime that reduce the crew, the recruits as well.","I think there are opportunities to see efficiency gains that was obviously those have biggest expense component and therefore, the one that we focused relentlessly around, how do we reduce the number of people, how do we become more efficient, how do we become more efficient over the cost employee and so that, you should see continued improvement there. Thank you again.","Ken Hoexter","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Brandon.","Brandon Oglenski","Good morning, Michael. Good morning, team. Fredrik or Michael, think in the past, you have talked about how, you really need core to establish and I really want to hone in on the idea of that there is more downside risk 2016 closing that is probably is upside, where we have plenty shale gas in those countries, so I think we are resetting into this new reality that gas is just a lot cheaper than it used to be? But you are getting positive price, you are getting productivity, you are getting growth, especially in corridors like intermodal? So, in the longer term is it possible to get sustainable earnings growth and margin expansion to hit that a lot of target even if we are facing continued sequential core declines or is that still going to be too much headwind on the business? And maybe we don't understand how difficult it is to get the cost out of the core system, maybe that\u2019s where we have been underestimated?","Michael Ward","Well, obviously, coal is a very profitable business of ours in our portfolio. But I do think that the fact that we will be able to produce the 66.8% operating ratio here in the second quarter with coal being down more than $100 million year-over-year is a great testament to what our core strategy of service excellence to our customers is providing.","Now, clearly, as we look forward, the impact of the coal declines is going to also impact the path of progression. We are going to make meaningful improvement here in 2015 and we feel very confident that overtime we can get to that mid 60s operating ratio.","And I think this quarter as I said earlier is a great testament to that, but if coal is cooperating, we can get there faster and if coal is going to not cooperate is going to take us longer, which is why at this point I don't think we have enough clear around the coal picture to really put a flag down in the ground on when we actually get to that mid 60s operating ratio. Thank you.","Brandon Oglenski","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Jason.","Jason Seidl","Thank you. Good morning, guys. How is everything?","Michael Ward","Great.","Jason Seidl","Quick question here, obviously, you mentioned a little bit on furloughs and you have some very good productivity numbers in the quarter? Is the network right sized for the current volumes or is there a little bit more work to do as you move throughout the third quarter?","Oscar Munoz","Jason, it\u2019s Oscar. We are always, always, reflecting on where our volume loaded and the capacity is. So it\u2019s never perfectly right sized but we are working towards that. We have a lot of capacity. Importantly, I think, our train size initiatives have been really creating even more capacity and more productivity. So, we'll continue to work on that, teams done a great job of it. But I think there is still opportunity to right size.","Jason Seidl","Okay. Appreciate it, guys.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Matt Troy with Nomura. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Matt.","Matt Troy","Hey. Good morning. My question was on intermodal. Specifically, just if you could give us a sense in terms of the competitive environment you referenced in your press release some competitive share loss and I was wondering if you could just put that into context and then more specifically just looking at the rate trends whether you are looking at revenue per carload, a revenue per ton-mile, certainly we\u2019ve seen a step down in those metrics over the last two quarters. Obviously, fuel is a big component of that traffic category. I just want to make it clear as to what\u2019s going on with rates, if you could just answer those two. That\u2019s all I got. Thank you.","Michael Ward","On the competitive loss as you are aware, we don\u2019t make particular comments for individual customers. On the revenue-ton mile as you summarized, it is all in fuel. On the rates of sales in the trucking market, we still find that these truckers are keeping their rate structures up this year into 3% to 5% range on the trucking renewal rates. Our particular spot markets in our trucking part of our door-to-door product has been very strong this year. Our transcon product has been down a little bit because we are still rebuilding our owner operator base in the L.A. Basin from the strike. But the core part of the intermodal business and the pricing this year has remained fairly strong as we've been able to price for the value of the service that we are offering into competitive markets for our reinvestments we've been very pleased with that. Clarence, you want to comment on the domestic volumes?","Clarence Gooden","Yes. As you\u2019ve seen the domestic intermodal volume themselves have been up around 9% in our intermodal business, so the highway to rail conversion programs that we\u2019ve had in place have been quite successful this year.","Matt Troy","Absolutely. That\u2019s what I was pointing out. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Ben Hartford with Baird. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Ben.","Ben Hartford","Good morning. Clarence, maybe just to continue that point, there has been a lot of debate about the pace of conversions going forward as the truck load capacity situation has normalized a bit in \u201815 from \u201914, fuel prices are lower, rail services has not fully been restored. What is your -- let\u2019s take a timeframe, three year view on the pace of domestic intermodal conversions and the opportunity? What are shippers saying given some of the diverging trends with lower diesel fuel prices, with some of these looming capacity constraints? Has the outlook changed at all meaningfully over the past several quarters?","Clarence Gooden","Ben, I don\u2019t think it has. We -- in 2014, this crew that we lost some intermodal business back to the highway due to the service issues. But we are actually seeing some of that volume return in 2015 as services improve. As I mentioned in the highway to rail conversions, our estimates this year will be in excess of 40,000 new loads on CSX organically in addition to what our trucking partners are growing back to rail that will grow. As you know, the electronic reporting that we require next year and the legislation will kick in and we think that that's going to put more stress on the particularly small truck load carriers that will make intermodal more attractive.","That has changed in the highway issues that are around, congestion that\u2019s in the highway in America. We still have the driver issues and shortages that are facing the trucking companies as we go forward. If you look at what's happening in Congress today, we still will have a highway transportation bill probably be passed with the continuing resolutions and no new confusion of the money to rebuild the highways and the infrastructure in this country, so all the issues that we\u2019ve talked about over the past few years still remain. So, intermodal to me looks, is a very positive thing going forward for the next two or three years.","Ben Hartford","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Hi Cherilyn.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Thanks very much and good morning. You saw good sequential improvement in both on-time originations and arrivals. But there was much more improvement in originations than arrivals, which I think is the normal order things as network velocity increases. Maybe you can just talk about that. And when we should expect to see the gap between those two metrics narrow?","Oscar Munoz","Hey, Cherilyn. Thanks. It\u2019s Oscar. Historically, as you probably know, there has always been a small gap between the arrivals and the originations, and we have seen both measures improve as we want to restore a service level. We would expect the improvement in arrivals to slight lag that of originations, again as that continuity of service improves.","The key thing for us is to focus on how late the average train is. That is a metric we\u2019ve seen substantial improvement over the last several months, so in effect spend. So while you will still see the optic on arrivals a little lagging, we actually look at it still more internally the number of hours that our late is improving. So I think over the next quarter and two and then certainly into next year, I think you will see that gap narrow to its historical average.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Thank you. That\u2019s my one.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Vernon with Bernstein. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, David.","David Vernon","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Fredrik, may be just a bigger picture here. The volume growth is moderating. The GPMs are down a little bit. Do you see any opportunity deploy in the CapEx budget? And then longer-term, do you think we should be -- how should we be thinking about the impact of the reduced utilization of the coal network on depreciation going forward?","Fredrik Eliasson","Yes. In terms of capital I think we have the $2.5 billion number out there. We are looking at that to see if it makes sense. But in general, a lot of those products have already been started. So I am not sure if there is many opportunities short term. We have a sales kind of corrective mechanism and then we tied it to revenue and I think that will be correcting it. Ultimately, that\u2019s a proxy for gross ton miles because 80% of that we spend is a reflection of how much we run over the next network. So if that comes down, then our capital will come down. So we will look at that as we get into the planning for 2016.","And then in terms of the coal network, I can assure you we had a very concerted effort in 2012 to see what we could do to drive our cost there. We\u2019re excellent at taking out train starts and crew base to more than reflect the kind we saw in volume. And here now in 2015 and 2016, there is a renewed focus again because of the step function change that we\u2019ve seen to further look not just train starts and look at the crew base and the locomotive assets we have deployed, but also the fixed infrastructure that is up there and to see what we can do.","It is not as black and white as you would like because we do have growth up there as well and we run other traffic around there. We have seen a lot of growth in LPG and fraction in those same areas, but there should be more than we can do and our team is very much focused on those efforts.","David Vernon","Appreciate it. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Larkin with Stifel. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, John.","John Larkin","Good morning, gentlemen. Clarence was very adamant on the first quarter call about how pricing was accelerating from the later stages of the first quarter into the second quarter. Is that going to continue into the third and fourth quarter? Or are we going to plateau at this relative high level where merchandising intermodal same store pricing is up say 3.9% year-over-year?","Michael Ward","Well, John, as you can see in the past several quarters, we\u2019ve improved the pricing sequentially. And here in the second quarter you can see that we had 3.5 all-in and 3.9% in the merchandising and in intermodal.","As I look forward we remain focused on the strong pricing reflecting the value of the service we provide across all these competitive market which just defies the reinvestment in our business that drives a long-term value of our shareholders. So that\u2019s what you will see.","John Larkin","Got it. Any pushback from customers given that service levels have been fully recovered, are they willing to absorb those even higher price increases given where service currently stands?","Michael Ward","I think they see that the service that we\u2019re providing right now has just defined that price levels for the reinvestment that they see that we\u2019re doing.","John Larkin","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna Financial Group. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Hi, Bascome.","Bascome Majors","Hey, good morning. So coal miner\u2019s financial situation has continued to deteriorate here. And we\u2019ve seen recent reports that one of your smaller customers is going to file for bankruptcy this week and other larger miners that were still working on restructurings here. Can you just talk a little bit about how you manage your risk in this business given financial situation on that side, maybe a little bit on the business side such as pricing pressure which you addressed a little bit already but counterparty risk as well?","Fredrik Eliasson","Yes. This is Fredrik. So obviously from a credit perspective, we do monitor it very closely. Many times it\u2019s actually utilities that pay the bill. But we do have some exposure to some of these producers that are going through a very difficult time. So we\u2019ve already seen some of those go through restructuring. Generally, we are well protected through a variety of means through that process.","And one of the most important thing is that if you do want to restructure out of it, you\u2019re going need to need the rail service that we provide in order to be successful in transforming the company.","And overall, from a broader perspective, clearly we're also looking at the capital deployment. And you heard in other previous question, we're really trying to make sure that as we look at reinvestment in coal-related assets that we\u2019re really taking a long and hard look at whatever capital put in there to make sure that we\u2019re not leaving capital stranded for 40 years, which is essentially the life of assets that we\u2019re putting in.","So we work very, very hard across our system to make sure that we\u2019re making prudent decisions around that. So, great question. Thank you.","Bascome Majors","Yes. Do you have a sense for how much is paid to the -- or just percentage of your business where you\u2019re paying the miners versus utilities were just balance with export versus utility mix or is it more complex in that?","Fredrik Eliasson","Well, I think on the domestic side, I think the majority is clearly paid by the utilities and on the export side, I think there is little bit of a more mix and more perhaps the producer.","Bascome Majors","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thanks. Your next question comes from Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff Kauffman","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. With the revenue, well, I shouldn't say revenue, but the volume outlook taking another step down, have you rethought the capital program at all and can you talk a little bit about where the capital is going to help in terms of the productivity recovery and get the system back to fluidity?","Fredrik Eliasson","Sure. So in terms of the capital, $2.5 billion is our capital plan here for 2015. We are looking to see if there\u2019s some things that we would move out of this year. But as you -- so far into the year, it's hard to affect the current year because a lot of these things are well underway at this point.","What we are looking at next year and we do have that kind of self-adjusting mechanism that it\u2019s tied to percentage of revenue when we talk about it publicly, but internally we look at it from a gross ton mile perspective more perhaps. 80% of what we spend is on the maintenance side and 20% is productivity. And clearly this year our main focus has been to acquire additional locomotives.","We\u2019re acquiring about 200 locomotives new and rebuilding about a 150 and that has been the number one priority for us already starting last time this year -- last year this time, where that has been the focus of ours to make sure because that has been the linchpin in order for us to get back to the sort of service excellence levels that we've been looking for.","Other productivity initiatives, we have plenty of them that not just is capital driven but is specific driven capital as locomotive. Fuel optimizer, for example to make sure we drive fuel efficiency. We have a variety of other technology products that we\u2019re working on and also automation on some of the other back-office functions. So there is a wide variety of things that we put capital towards to drive productivity.","Jeff Kauffman","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Group","Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. So I wanted to follow up Oscar, your comment about more to go in terms of right-sizing the network. Just given the volumes and now the service levels improving, is it possible ahead to start seeing some more material headcount reduction? I don\u2019t know, 3%, 5%, 10%, I don\u2019t know, is that possible?","Oscar Munoz","Scott, I think I\u2019d answer by the fact that we always make those adjustments commensurate with where we see the volume forecast. And so it's hard to detect specifically a number, but we\u2019ll as you've seen us do before take the appropriate measures.","Fredrik Eliasson","And to add to Oscar\u2019s answer that we do expect and I said that in prepared remarks about a 1% decline sequentially in headcount and we already have 600 people in furlough and it is our largest expense base. So we\u2019re going to be very, very prudent and very, very thoughtful about what we\u2019re doing there, because we do need to reduce our labor expense in order to create a sort of productivity savings that we\u2019ve outlined.","Scott Group","Yes. So just with that maybe Fredrick, so the volume environment changed most notably in the second quarter. How much of the cost response from you guys did we see in the second quarter versus how much are we going to see ahead? If there is a way to kind of bucket it out?","Fredrik Eliasson","I guess, this is a pretty hard question to answer. I do say that from the overall productivity knowing our guidance for the full year and the fact that we\u2019ve been done here about $86 million for the first half. Clearly, we have at least as much in the second half or somewhere around there and so there is a lot of opportunity still.","We have done a lot of structural things that we have worked on for a period of times in terms of train length and of course some of the other ongoing initiatives as well. And well we have made some inroads in terms of driving the fluid into the network back. It was only kind of partly through the second quarter we really got traction around that.","So as we move into the second half, we should expect more of that. And so we\u2019re once again, we feel very strong and we feel very bullish about the opportunity set going forward on the productivity side. Thank you, Scott.","Scott Group","Thank you, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Donald Broughton with Avondale Partners. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Donald.","Donald Broughton","Good morning, gentlemen. Help me better understand your guidance of expecting meaningful full year OR improvement, because to the first half, the gross cost of diesel is down about $325 million. So you had a run rate, let\u2019s call $650 million. If I just assume that the cost of diesel is down by $650 million for the full year, and the fuel surcharge is down by $650 million and all of your other operating costs remain constant on a year-over-year basis. That alone would create 150 basis points of OR improvement. So is meaningful full year OR improvement less than or greater than 150 basis points?","Fredrik Eliasson","Well, that -- it have to be seen. It\u2019s a good question. We have taken out in the first half, if you just look at our quarterly flash we\u2019ve gone from about 72.3 last year in the first to 69.5. So that\u2019s obviously very meaningful improvement in just one-year timeframe. As we think about this quarter specifically, the majority of our gain was actually not fuel related because fuel this quarter while it came down, we actually had a negative impact year-over-year because of the negative lag and the spread differential that we saw.","So I'm not going to pinpoint exactly where we\u2019re going to end up, but we do clearly expect meaningful improvement despite the fact that the volume environment is less than stellar. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Cleo Zagrean with Macquarie. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Hey, Cleo.","Cleo Zagrean","Good morning. I would like a little bit of help with fending the utility coal volume down side for the next year. Where do you see that coming from? We\u2019re potentially hoping for some reversal of gas switching and inventories having normalized? So is that retirement driven? What are you hearing from your customers that drive your cautiousness on domestic utility? Thank you.","Fredrik Eliasson","Well, the stockpiles are -- both in the north and south are higher than normal. So there is some inventory hang. We still expect that the gas prices will be relatively low as it would be the second point. And the third is there is some research that would indicate the installation of more gas acres in the region that we serve and are currently in service. So the combination of those three would lead us to believe that there could be a possibility that the utilities consumption of coal in our area would be slightly less than it is this year.","Cleo Zagrean","Okay. And then just as a quick clarifying follow-up, when you give guidance for domestic coal, do you include the domestic math or that refers to utility?","Fredrik Eliasson","Includes both, everything.","Cleo Zagrean","Thank you very much. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Patterson with Topeka Capital Markets. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Rick.","Rick Patterson","Good morning, guys. Hi. Oscar, you put out a service update in May that listed your T&E trainees at 1,235. What's that number today?","Oscar Munoz","The people -- by the way Rick nice to hear you, welcome back.","Rick Patterson","Thank you.","Oscar Munoz","The number in training we have, approximately it\u2019s about 800 right now.","Oscar Munoz","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Tyler.","Tyler Brown","Hey good morning. Hey, I was just curious, if we could get a lot more detail on the acceleration of the non-coal pricing. And I appreciate this might be a bit of semantics but Clarence, was the sequential acceleration fairly broad based or was it more in thousand say intermodal than the other merchandise, just maybe some broad comments there?","Clarence Gooden","No, it was very broad based across almost all of our commodity lines.","Tyler Brown","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Barnes with RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, John.","John Barnes","Hey, thank you. Hey, good morning. Hey going back to the CapEx question -- I hate to beat this to death but how quickly can you really prioritize the project list and reallocate the capital? And then if volumes continue to be weaker, how aggressive are you willing to be on say maintenance CapEx? Is there any give and take there?","Fredrik Eliasson","I think from a maintenance spread, the developer things that you can do that short term would save you money but long term would hurt you. So just for example, shutting off our teams that are out there replacing the rail right now is something that you could do. But long term doesn\u2019t make sense because mobilizing and demobilizing something is more expensive than taking advantage of the fact that you have the teams out there right now.","So there are things you can do but the key thing is that you do things that are smart. And so that\u2019s why I think that making significant changes in you capital budget is not necessarily the right thing to do from a long-term economic perspective.","But as we think about next year, we will always -- we always look at what the gross ton miles would be. We look at the line segments and so forth that we need to allocate capital to. And that\u2019s where I think the coal example is a good place. We really are looking long and hard to make sure that what we\u2019re putting in that makes sense, of course, without sacrificing safety in any way, shape or form. And so we constantly look at that and we will take a look at what next year capital budget would be in the context of what the gross ton mile picture will look like.","John Barnes","Thank you.","Michael Ward","Thank you, John.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Justin Long with Stephens. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning Justin.","Justin Long","Good morning. Thank you. I was wondering if you could comment on me final tank car regulations that we got during the second quarter. Assuming everything in this regulation which stands legal pushback, how should we think about the impact these changes could have on your business going forward?","Michael Ward","Justin, I think we are by and large very pleased with the new tank car standards they come out with, we think it\u2019s a much safer vehicle. We were a little bit surprised that the thermal blanket was not included and we will continue to push for that as an industry because we think it gives some extra layer or safety at not a great expense. As far as the long-term impact on the business, obviously as you know, we don\u2019t own the tank cars, the customers or leasing companies do.","Our early read is that most plants retrofit their cars or buy new cars that meet those standards. Obviously, it impacts the economics of the movement somewhat and as Clarence alluded to earlier, there is already a little bit of pressure on the crude movement just because of the current spreads between Bakken and Brent. But we think longer term that this car is a better car or safer car and I think we\u2019ll continue to see the movements of the crude as we go forward.","Justin Long","Okay. Great. Thanks for the time.","Michael Ward","Thank you. Thank you everybody. We will see next quarter.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s teleconference.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. For opening remarks and introduction, I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Boone, Chief Investor Relations Officer for CSX Corporation.","Kevin Boone","Thank you, Michelle, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me on today's call is Jim Foote, Chief Executive Officer; and Frank Lonegro, Chief Financial Officer. On Slide 2 is our forward-looking disclosure, followed by non-GAAP disclosure on Slide 3. ","With that, it is my pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Foote.","James Foote","Thank you very much, Kevin. It's great to be here this afternoon with everybody on the call. Before we start with the slides, I would like to make a few comments. CSX had a very good quarter. We are drastically changing the way we operate the railroad by taking millions of unnecessary steps out of the business process that we use to run the railroad. This is producing record operating performance, improved customer service and, when combined, impressive returns to shareholders. The women and men of CSX have accomplished a lot. Clearly, first quarter results are a reflection of all the hard work that has taken place over the past year. We are proud of these results, and I would like to thank all CSX employees for their contributions towards achieving them. ","With that said, the plan recently laid out at our investor conference is a 3-year plan. We're only 1 quarter in, 1 out of 12, and we still have a lot of work to do to achieve our goals. The good news is that every day I feel a little more confident in our ability to deliver on these targets. And I want to take the time to highlight safety. On my watch, safety will always come first. We have some work to do to improve, and the team is committed to do so. To be the best run railroad, you have to be the safest. ","Now let's get into the deck, and we'll start with the Slide 5 on our highlights. And this should be a pretty simple quarter to walk through. We only had 1 extra day in last year's first quarter and, other than the restructuring charge last year, just a few relatively minor onetime events that Frank and I will point out. EPS increased 53% to $0.78 versus last year's adjusted EPS of $0.51. The increase was driven by lower costs on flat revenues, which drove a 19% improvement in operating income versus the prior year's adjusted results. The new lower cash rate and share count, down about 4%, also contributed to the significant year-over-year increase. Our operating ratio improved 570 basis points to 63.7% when compared to last year's adjusted OR of 69.4%, a record first quarter. I might be a little biased, but I think it's CSX's best quarter ever. Lower cost in labor and MS&O partially offset by price, driven fuel -- higher fuel costs, drove a significant year-over-year improvement. ","Going to the next slide, Slide 6. Total revenue was flat as price, fuel surcharge and supplemental revenues offset a 4% decline in volume and negative mix. We did see a slight sequential improvement in pricing, excluding coal. Looking at the business segment. Each was, to some degree, impacted by either outside influences or a prior period demarcating decision. Chemicals was impacted by a few items, including no fly ash movements that occurred last year, lower plastic and pet coke shipments and basically no crude-by-rail. Lower North American vehicle production and challenges with rail car availability, which was an industry issue, reduced auto. Ag and food was mainly impacted by lower ethanol business, which we exited because of its low or no margin. And fertilizer revenues, as I mentioned previously, were down due to the Plant City facility closure. Domestic utility coal declines were somewhat offset by a continuing strong export coal market. And intermodal saw strong international volumes. Other revenues increased year-over-year as liquidated damages contributed $19 million, and the remaining increase was driven by higher demurrage and other supplemental revenue. Obviously, we have changed the business practices in this area and are working with our customers to create a more fluid network. ","On Slide 7, let's take a quick look at our operating performance. We've highlighted some key metrics that are familiar with you. As we outlined at the Investor Day, we continue to make significant progress year-over-year in both train velocity and car dwell. We also saw improvement in train length and GTMs per available horsepower, which represent improved asset utilization and efficiency. It seems like almost every day, we set a new CSX record in one area of our operations or another. We are making progress, but there is clearly more opportunity ahead. Since the beginning of the year, we reduced another 142 locomotives and a total of 816 year-over-year. Service design improvements have been -- have seen a reduction in over 40.8 million expected annual car miles and 351 weekly crude starts year-to-date. Brian Barr in our mechanical department has done an exceptional job with line of road failures, improving 35% and doing it with a smaller workforce. ","Now let me hand it over to Frank, who will take you through the financials and provide more details on the benefits from the operational improvements.","Frank Lonegro","Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Turning to Slide 9. Let me walk you through the summary income statement. Reported revenue was roughly flat for the first quarter as a 4% decline in volume was offset by the benefits of increased supplemental revenue, higher fuel surcharge recoveries and solid core pricing gains. ","Moving to expenses. The P&L reflects our adoption of the new pension accounting standards where only the service cost component of our pension expense is now included in operating expense, while the remaining aspects of pension accounting now fall below the line in other income. Prior year results, including the geography of last year's restructuring charge, have been restated to reflect this new standard. Total operating expenses were 13% lower in the first quarter, 8% lower after normalizing for last year's restructuring charge. Overall, labor and fringe savings of $100 million or 12% year-over-year were driven by an 11% reduction in average headcount. ","Scheduled railroading enabled train crew savings on multiple fronts. A 22% increase in velocity and a 5% increase in train length enable an 8% reduction in road crew starts, while the elimination of 8 hump yards last year and a 20% improvement in cars processed per man hour drove savings in yards staffing levels. Improved network fluidity seen through the velocity and dwell metrics, combined with a 20% improvement in GTMs per available horsepower, has helped eliminate rolling stock assets. Our active locomotive fleet was down 23%, and the number of cars on line came down by 11%, the combination of which enabled resource reductions within our mechanical workforce. ","In addition, the efforts we started in early 2017 with our management restructuring to streamline the management workforce, eliminate bureaucracy and improve the speed of decision-making across the system and here in Jacksonville have resulted in significantly lower labor expense. Fewer management resources also resulted in lower incentive compensation expense versus the prior year quarter. MS&O expense was down 16% against the prior year. The asset efficiency of scheduled railroading, combined with improved year-over-year locomotive availability, resulted in lower fleet counts, yielding lower materials expense, lower maintenance and repair costs and lower levels of consumables. Given the sustainable nature of these asset reductions, we have sold or scrapped hundreds of engines and thousands of freight cars in the past 12 months. ","The locomotive fleet reductions have also allowed us to rightsize our contracted maintenance services agreement. Fewer crew starts and the more balanced network operating plan also drove reductions in ancillary costs such as hotels, meals and taxis. Efforts to streamline the workforce and reduce organizational complexity also apply to our contractor and consultant workforce. Working towards our broader total workforce targets for 2018 and beyond, we have made significant progress in reducing our labor footprint with savings from contractor and consultant reductions flowing to the MS&O line. ","Finally, continued efforts to monetize our surplus real estate portfolio resulted in $32 million of real estate gains in the quarter versus $2 million in the year-ago period. The gains in this year's first quarter are consistent with the guidance we provided at the investor conference, that we would achieve $300 million of cumulative real estate sales through 2020. ","Looking at the other expense items. Depreciation increased slightly due to changes in the asset base driven by capital investments, offset by asset sales. 24% higher fuel prices year-over-year presented a significant headwind, although our continued focus on fuel efficiency through better matching a horsepower to trailing tonnage and increased use of energy management and distributed power technologies drove year-over-year improvement in fuel efficiency despite harsher winter conditions this year. ","The equipment rents are up slightly due to higher incidental rents, though we are continuing to drive days per load improvements to reduce our car hire expense. Equity earnings were favorable primarily due to improved performance at our affiliates and tax reform true-ups. ","Lastly, we are cycling 2017's restructuring charges, part of which are now housed below the line due to the new pension accounting standard. Below the line, interest expense increased, primarily due to the additional debt we issued earlier this year. Tax expense was roughly flat on a 57% increase in pretax earnings, illustrating the favorable impacts of tax reform. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 23.8%, though we continue to expect around 25% for the full year. All told, these pieces sum to the headline items Jim highlighted in his opening remarks. Importantly, the 63.7% operating ratio we achieved in the first quarter represents a meaningful step toward the 60% operating ratio target we set at last month's investor conference. ","Turning to the cash side of the equation on Slide 10. Capital investments in the first quarter reflect our recently announced 3-year capital target of $4.8 billion, driven by the reduced capital intensity of the scheduled railroading model. As we've said many times before and reiterate here, our commitment to investing in safety and reliability remains unwavering, and we have undoubtedly become a less capital-intensive company through improved asset utilization that reduces yard infrastructure and rolling stock needs and better processes that serve as an effective alternative to capital investments. Our free cash flow growth of 3% was more muted than our earnings growth would have implied. First and most importantly, estimated federal tax payments for the first quarter are not paid until April. As a result, you see the year-over-year benefits of tax reform in our earnings but not yet in our free cash flow. Second, as with any quarter, there are timing items that can impact free cash flow on a short-term basis. Here, we made back wage payments in the quarter to employees affiliated with unions that have concluded national bargaining. There were also timing differences in state tax payments and prepaid expenses. Bigger picture, the combination of core earnings growth, lower CapEx and lower cash taxes will drive significant free cash flow conversion and $8.5 billion of cumulative free cash flow through 2020. ","Finally, we were pleased to provide significant returns to our shareholders during the first quarter. On February 12, we announced a 10% increase to our quarterly dividend and meaningfully increased our share buyback program to $5 billion, with expected completion in the first quarter of 2019. As you evaluate our buyback cadence in the quarter, remember that our buybacks in the first half of the quarter were premised on a much smaller $1.5 billion program. Since implementing a larger program mid-quarter, we have capitalized on recent mark-to-market fluctuations and repurchased shares at a faster than pro rata pace. ","With that, let me turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks.","James Foote","Great. Thanks a lot, Frank. As I said at the very beginning, it's a very simple and clean quarter for everyone to understand. And so in conclusion on the last slide here, a little bit about the financial outlook. As I've said before, previously said, we expect the revenue to be up slightly for the year, and I have the increased confidence in this outlook given the start of the year. ","Also, as many of you are aware, as I am happy to say, not only to say it, but I am happy that we are no longer under the requirement to have weekly calls with the STB. We have improved our service, and I expect that to continue. As we demonstrated in the first quarter, we expect a solid step-down each year in the operating ratio. There remains significant work ahead in order to deliver on our 2020 target of a 60% OR. However, our goal of making CSX the best run railroad is in sight, and we are working hard to achieve that. ","So I would like to turn it back to Kevin now. We can start. Frank and I will be glad to answer any of your questions.","Kevin Boone","Okay. [Operator Instructions]. Michelle, I think we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Chris Wetherbee from Citigroup.","Christian Wetherbee","I guess, maybe I want to start on the revenue side. So, Jim, you kind of outlined the outlook for some modest revenue growth over the course of the year. I guess, when you think about sort of volume and price, could give us a little bit of sort of help there? When you looked at yields in 1Q, they certainly were good. Can you give us a sense of maybe where core pricing is and maybe what that assumption is of mix of volume and price as the year progresses?","James Foote","Yes, I think what I said was prices sequentially improved slightly. If you exclude coal and if you look at the revenue, clearly, we are going to continue to see a slight tick-up as we go through the year in our supplemental revenues as we've implemented more specific demurrage policies as an example, and you'll see that in other. Fuel surcharge is going to move up and down as the year moves around. So I think there's a reasonable -- a reasonably solid environment out there for pricing. And based upon kind of expectation that we've put out there in terms of a year-over-year kind of slight increase, the run rate you're seeing there today in terms of volume and these other elements that increase or bringing together total revenue should be reasonably consistent with what you saw here as our -- and then as you remember, we've had a lot of onetime items in the prior year that we've demarcated. As an example, the 7% volume of intermodal that was taken off to railroad in late summer of last year as well as some other items. And those items, we begin to cycle. And so that's why we're a little more confident that the volume in the later part of the year begins to see more of an improvement than what we're having right now.","Christian Wetherbee","Okay. So cadence could get a bit better as the year progresses. That's helpful. And then just maybe a follow-up on...","James Foote","But a much shorter way of saying it, yes.","Christian Wetherbee","Yes. I appreciate it. Now your color was greatly appreciated. And then, I guess, just trying to get a sense of what maybe normal seasonality from an operating ratio perspective might look like. So you guys are doing some dramatic things on the cost side, so it's a little hard to kind of see through that and relate it back to your historical patterns from 1Q and then how the rest of the year typically plays out. Is there anything you can help us with and maybe, Frank, sort of headcount expectations? We saw where you ended the quarter. But anything you do on sort of the cost or cadence of the OR improvement in 2018 would be helpful.","James Foote","Clearly, the first quarter, so I think in everybody's opinion here, the first quarter is the toughest operating environment for CSX. And I'll let Frank jump in if he has anything additional to that.","Frank Lonegro","Chris, the only thing I'd add, as you implied seasonality for the rest of the year, remember that we had a couple of fairly significant onetime items in the second quarter, so you probably need to adjust a little bit for that one. On the headcount side, I mean, you see the 3,000 year-over-year in the first quarter, and it really doesn't matter whether you look at average headcount or ending headcount, we're down about 3,000 employees year-over-year. When you add in contractors, it's a little bit more than that on a year-to-date basis, about 1,100 down year-to-date, and that's against the goal that Jim set on the fourth quarter call of around 2,000. So we feel like we're in pretty good shape on that one. So hopefully, that gives you enough color to go on.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kenneth Hoexter","Jim, your thoughts on the service failures of some of your peer railroads. Does that impact your ability to continue this pace of improvement just given the amount of traffic that is interchanged between rails, whether it's your fellow eastern peer or even going west or north? Can you just talk about your -- the constraints that you see from that?","James Foote","Well, Ken, clearly, it's a network out there, and so we're impacted, to a degree, by our interchange partners, whether they be in the west at Chicago or Memphis or wherever or the Canadians, again, in Chicago or wherever we interchange traffic. So obviously, we would like to have a more fluid network. It's better for us. But I think if you look at our operating performance in the first quarter and if you look at the way we ran our network during the first quarter, if you wanted any proof that the scheduled railroad model works, you'd want to stress it. So I think we passed the stress test in terms of -- Hunter didn't build a dome over this railroad. We are operating in the same winter conditions as everyone else and in the same soup, so to speak, with everyone else, and we improved dramatically. And so I think that's kind of a -- shows the resiliency and the strength of our organization to perform even better in the future just based upon historical operating performance metrics.","Kenneth Hoexter","Yes. Truly a great job. Just didn't know if there was a limitation based on what you saw, but great job. The follow-up would just be on the sustainability of your other revenue surcharges. Does business adapt now that they see that you're increasing your rates on demurrage and other items? Or does that come back down as your customers adapt? Or do you expect that to continue to grow as you've changed the business based on what you've seen in the past?","Frank Lonegro","Ken, it's Frank. So we broke out for you the liquidated damages piece in the prepared remarks. So you've got that as an item, obviously, to look at on a onetime basis in the quarter. We're not trying to make tons of money on supplemental revenue. We're really trying to change the behavior of the customers so that we get into 7-day a week service, we get into balance, we get into the things that scheduled railroading is all about. And in some respects, we need the customers' help in turning cars fasters. So this is really intended to be a behavior change or -- I wouldn't imply the run rate that you saw here in the first quarter for the rest of the year. Think something more like the 1.15 type of a number for Qs 2, 3 and 4. And obviously, we're expecting the customers to change their behavior and not want to pay these charges going forward. But Jim's commentary on the top line should give you a sense of where we think we're going to be on a volume basis. So we feel pretty good about it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom Wadewitz from UBS.","Thomas Wadewitz","Congratulations on the great results, really strong OR and cost side performance. Wanted to, I guess, get your thoughts, kind of a granular one and then maybe a broader question. The comp and benefits per worker we were thinking maybe be up year-over-year was down, and, I guess, incentive comp was down. Can you help us think about, is that against the backdrop where performance is good? Is incentive comp going to be down in coming quarters? Or was that kind of a one-off? And how do we think about comp per worker as we look at second quarter, third quarter? Does that continue to be down? Or how would we think about that relative to first quarter?","Frank Lonegro","Got you. Tom, Frank. You're right, on a comp per person basis in the quarter, we were better by about 1%. And you're right, the driver is largely the year-over-year favorability on incentive comp, probably a tad of employee mix in there as well. As you think about modeling in the future, if you assume static employee mix, you're really just talking about inflation and then you're spreading your fixed costs. I think what you're going to see on the incident comp piece depends on how we do against our plan as the year goes on. We did have a fairly significant headcount reduction year-over-year that drove it lower in the first quarter. And then as you think about the fourth quarter, remember, we had a fairly significant reversal of incentive comp in the fourth quarter of last year that we'll cycle. That was the reversal of Hunter's options, if you remember, about $30 million number. So just as you think through how to model that, those are probably the big moving parts.","Thomas Wadewitz","Okay. So incentive comp might be down, but then you get to fourth quarter, it's tougher comp, it could be up. Is that...","Frank Lonegro","I think that's fair, yes.","Thomas Wadewitz","Okay. So then the broader question I have, I think you were asked this a little bit earlier, but with the 63.7% OR in first quarter, if you just apply kind of normal seasonality, you could be -- you could see 300 and 400 basis points of improvement in second and third quarters versus that. So that puts you at a 60%, 61% potentially second quarter, third quarter. Is that a reasonable framework that, that's possible you deliver that? Or should we kind of step back from that and there are one-offs in first quarter, whatever reason that, that type of pattern wouldn't apply?","James Foote","Tom, as I said, we delivered a very, very solid and impressive performance in our historically most difficult period. But as I said many times in my opening remarks, this ain't easy. So we're going to continue to grind and we're going to continue to do everything we can to continue to improve. But 1 quarter out of 12 isn't a game done -- game set match. And so you figure it out. But we got -- this is hard work, and we're going to hopefully -- hopefully, we're going to get better. But I wouldn't draw any kind of drastic conclusions from the enormous step-down we just had in 1 quarter.","Frank Lonegro","Yes. One other thing, Tom, just as you think about your year-over-year comparisons. Q1 of last year was pre-precision railroading. So you are not necessarily comparing apples-to-apples. Whereas, I think, as you go forward in this year, obviously, we made significant step-downs in Qs 2, 3 and 4 year-over-year against '16. So just sort of put that into the hopper as well.","Operator","Allison Landry from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Allison Landry","Given the tightness in truckload and the service issues at Norfolk, do you think that your intermodal volumes could recover a lot sooner than you originally expected and I think is consistent with your comments at the Analyst Day? But how should we think about perhaps the cadence for the balance of the year and maybe what the potential upside is?","James Foote","Yes. Intermodal this year, like I said though, has a big hole to climb out of, to a degree, but as we move forward, I think that -- clearly, there is a lot of opportunity for us on the intermodal side, both internationally and domestically. But we have two specific goals in mind as we look forward for intermodal, which I think we outlined at the investor conference, is, one, to make sure we improve the overall efficiency of the network and concentrate in the key corridors that are best for us; and then secondly, focus on the profitability of the business. And so just because there might be a lot of intermodal and truck business that's available in the marketplace right now, I'm not going out and just chasing it to put volume on the railroad. So we're going to logically and methodically move forward with the rollout of our growth plan. And so therefore, I'm not looking for a major, major upside in what we've already told you.","Operator","Scott Group from Wolfe Research.","Scott Group","So wanted to start on coal. Maybe if you can share some views there. Met prices kind of dipped a little bit below 200. And how you think about export volumes and maybe coal yields on a sequential basis given some of the step-down in met prices. And then maybe just some views on utility coal volumes that were down a bunch in first and how you're thinking about that rest of the year.","James Foote","Yes. Let's take the second part of your question first, utility coal volumes. You know what the challenges are there in terms of the southern utilities here and the other ones that are most -- becoming more vulnerable. Northern utilities were stressed a few years ago, domestic utility coal volumes. And now it's kind of moving into the south. And so as gas prices stay low, we're going to try to do everything we can to keep those utilities up and operating, but it's a challenge for us. And so we're expecting that the domestic utility side of the business is going to remain under pressure, absent some other forces that would change that. On the export side, the -- both the thermal and met coals have remained relatively strong, stronger than we had originally expected. And the outlook for this year is that, that strength should continue. And we're not seeing -- even though some of the metrics that are used to price the business, like the API2, are starting to trend down slightly. The demand is still there. So we'll continue to do everything we can to maintain the domestic utility franchise, and we'll continue to run the wheels off the railcars to move as much of this export coal, whether it be thermal or met, as we possibly can as long as the demand is there.","Scott Group","That's helpful. Jim, can you just say, do you have a big length-of-haul difference to southern versus northern utilities?","James Foote","I think we do, yes.","Scott Group","Longer than the south.","James Foote","Yes, yes. That's why it's -- I guess, one's the south and one's the north. And the mines are more located in the north, so we run it further.","Scott Group","Okay. And then, Frank, just quickly, can you just clarify what your point was about the buyback? And I know you didn't have the new bigger buyback until sort of the middle of the quarter. What's sort of quarterly run rate should we be thinking about for dollars on the buyback?","Frank Lonegro","Well, it depends on what the stock price is, to be honest with you. But, no, we're obviously in the market pretty heavily, about $835-or-so million in the first quarter. The point I was trying to make was, if you were looking for a straight pro rata version of the $5 billion over 5 quarters, given the fact that we entered the program mid-quarter, we didn't obviously hit that. But from a run rate perspective, if you had forgiven the first 6 weeks, which were under the earlier program, we were ahead of a pro rata from that level. And obviously, it's going to depend on our prognosis for our performance for the year. It's going to depend on what we think the economy is going to do. And it's going to depend on what the market's reaction to our performance is. We're clearly going to return a significant amount of capital to shareholders over the coming four quarters. We've dimensionalized that for you. The exact cadence, I think, is just going to depend on the factors that I mentioned.","Operator","Our next question comes from Fadi Chamoun from BMO Capital Markets.","Fadi Chamoun","I just want to go back to the volume kind of questions. So you've kind of outlined at the Investor Day to us that, ultimately, the improved cost, improved service, your ability to kind of start leveraging that to grow the business faster is more of a 2019, 2020 story. But I'm wondering, given some of the service issues we're seeing elsewhere and the trucking capacity problem, is there kind of an opportunity here to see an acceleration? How's kind of the conversation with customers going? How do you feel about your ability to begin to leverage this service and cost story a little bit earlier?","James Foote","It was only like six weeks ago, or whatever it was, we were in New York and kind of laid out this plan, and the weather conditions across North America were brutal at that time and the railroads, to a large degree, were having issues at that point in time. And everybody in the world knew about ELDs and all kinds of challenges that were there. So there's not been a lot of major -- there haven't been really any kind of external influences that would make us change our minds right now in terms of what we see for the rest of the year, which is kind of what I said at the -- in summary. What I said 6 weeks ago is kind of where we still are. Obviously -- and we're running our railroad 6 weeks ago really good. So like I said, not only externally, but internally, there's not a lot of change. And so our service is second to none. And our strategy to leverage that service and make sure that we are appropriately compensated for the service that we provide is still our strategy. And so that is not something that you want to turn on a dime and discount in order to put volume on the railroad. So it's going to be a methodical, strategic, rational growth story as we go forward and as we improve the efficiency and as we clearly distinguish our ourselves in the marketplace and show to the customers that we can create value for them. We will begin to have the growth. I believe we'll continue to have the growth or we will achieve the growth that we outlined to you in 2019 and 2020 and I see no reason to try and do something to accelerate that strategy.","Fadi Chamoun","Okay. And maybe just 1 quick follow-up. When we look at the intermodal pricing, like what you're reporting in RPU and intermodal, like how well aligned is this with the current market rates that we're seeing on the truckload side? Or is there an opportunity to kind of move that materially as you kind of begin to touch a little bit more of your contracts?","James Foote","I have the ability -- I do not have the ability to price my portfolio of business to the markets on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. We have kind of long-term contracts with our existing customers. So a large part of that business is locked up. The pieces of the business that aren't, I will take advantage of the market environment to price the business appropriately, but that's kind of methodical. These things roll over a little bit here, a little bit there, a little bit in the summer. So -- but more so than just a tightness in the truck market is the differentiation now in the quality of my service. And the reliability of my service is what's going to be the main factor in driving growth in the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from Amit Mehrotra from Deutsche Bank.","Amit Mehrotra","Just first question, Jim. Can you update us on how the apology tour is going and anything tangible you can share following the disruption last summer? And kind of related to that, Canadian Pacific put out a release last week. Seems that there's still significant gaps in terms of them reaching an agreement with their unions. If you could just help us think about what the exposure, if any, I'm sure there is some, for CSX, if there's any type of work stoppage at CP, either on the revenue side or the -- related to the cost actions.","James Foote","No apology tour anymore. That's canceled. Nothing to apologize for. The railroad is running great. The railroad is running -- again, if you look at the metrics, our railroad is running better than anybody else in North America. And -- so I got a suitcase that it says I apologize on it. So maybe one of the other railroads wants to borrow it, but I'm not using it. In terms of the Canadian Pacific, I don't know if they're going to have a strike or not. I don't think they know if they're going to have a strike or not. And so I can't really speculate and I can't comment on that.","Amit Mehrotra","Well, I'm not asking if they're going to have a strike. What I'm asking about is if they do, like what's the exposure to CSX?","James Foote","I think that's a hypothetical question. So I just said I'm not going to speculate.","Amit Mehrotra","Okay. I'll move on. And then just one quick one for Frank on the buybacks and debt levels. Just from the perspective of the rating agencies, I guess, the rating agencies look at balance sheet capacity and buyback. I guess, they have a couple different metrics and can -- maybe even conflicting with each other in terms of retained cash flow and the way they compute that versus maybe adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA. And you could be well in the parameters of retained cash flows as a percentage of your total debt but kind of out of the parameters of adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA. So maybe it's a little bit too technical for sure, but if you could just help us think about how CSX thinks about its balance sheet, pro forma for all the share repurchases. You surely have the capacity, but just philosophically, if you can just help us with that, and we'd appreciate it.","Frank Lonegro","Sure. We spent a fair amount of time with the rating agencies earlier in the year as we looked at our credit profile, we looked at debt that we wanted to raise this year, we looked at the sizing of the buyback program, et cetera. And I think we have a good understanding of where the breakpoints are. They obviously look at 2 key things at a very high level, one is leverage, and the other is coverage. And I think what tax reform has done is probably allowed a little bit more room on the leverage side because you've got more coverage, because you've got more free cash flow. So I think we've struck a very good balance. I think we have a very good understanding, and I think everything that we are proposing to do on the buybacks as well as on debt issuances later in the year are all right in line with the conversations that we have with them. So we feel like we're in really good shape.","Amit Mehrotra","So just to press you a little bit more, if I could. As we look out beyond sort of the $5 billion framework that you provided and we kind of flex the beyond 2019, is it now kind of 2.5x net debt-to-EBITDA, which is maybe obviously a little bit higher on a gross debt basis? I mean, is that the right sort of benchmark that we should think about from a modeling standpoint?","Frank Lonegro","We said at the investor conference, and I'll reiterate here, that we're going to look at that on an annual basis.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays.","Brandon Oglenski","Jim, can you just remind us of the level of business that you've looked at and said we don't really want to have that on the network anymore. Because as we look at your volumes trending early in the second quarter, I think you guys are close to flat on the publicly available reports. So how do we put that in context, the business that you walked away from?","James Foote","Well, again, on the intermodal side of the business, as I think we've said in the middle of last year, we started to transition away from what we referred to us the hub-and-spoke model in intermodal. And in closing a number of lanes that we served, we took about 7% of the intermodal traffic off the railroad. And we're getting close to getting intermodal volumes back to flat with prior years, so we're replacing a large percentage of that business. And if our run rate is getting close to, on a volume basis, flat, that would kind of give me, as I said earlier, a little more confidence that we're going to be able to have a revenue line for the year which is slightly up. So it all kind of fits in with our prior view of the year that the volumes would strengthen across the board with coal as always being somewhat of a question mark for us, but they would strengthen as the year progressed, and we'd see enough in the second half of the year to offset what is a 4% decline in volume in the first quarter.","Brandon Oglenski","Okay. Appreciate that. And when you look across the network, you do have headcount down quite a bit. I mean, like everyone talked about, your OR has improved pretty aggressively here. But what is left on the structural side? I mean, if you did have a big influx of demand, do you think the headcount levels can still come down or are you at a point now where you would have to be thinking about hiring more people and bringing on more assets?","James Foote","Clearly, clearly, you'd have to have some sort of monumental increase in volumes for us to begin considering hiring employees back and assets. No, we've got 800 locomotives in storage. So we're in great shape to handle any kind of increase in volume. Forget about taking assets out. We still intend to improve the fluidity of the network. We still intend to improve velocity. We still intend to drive down dwell. We still intend to increase train length. All of those initiatives do two things, one, improve our operating leverage, drive -- which by driving down our cost and improving our efficiency, but they allow us, because of that, to add additional volumes with our existing asset base that we have today. We're handling just about the same amount of volume that CSX handed -- handled a year ago with 8 fewer hump yards, 1,000 fewer locomotives, 4,000 fewer employees, 20,000 fewer railcars. So putting more volume into this railroad that is going to continue to improve to be operated more efficiently is not going to be a challenge for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Ossenbeck from JPMorgan.","Brian Ossenbeck","Jim, just a follow-up on the train length. I've been able to track those improving in the West and up North, but it's more recent phenomenon in the East. So I was wondering in a detention network, are there actual physical limitations to building train lengths, grade crossings or something like that? Or was it just more temporary and you just need longer sidings, the right balance to keep that track going?","James Foote","No capital necessary in order for us to improve train length. We are not restricted by siding length. We'd have a long, long way to go before we would need to spend capital to be able to get, say, 12,000-foot trains out there. But if we were, that'd be good news probably, which I'm sure we'd consider if necessary. But that's not in our 3-year vision to be -- to have to spend capital to do any of those stuff.","Frank Lonegro","Brian, two other things I'd add to Jim's good comments. One is we invested a fair amount on what we call the Southeast corridor, Chicago into the Southeast in the last decade or so, so we're leveraging that clearly. And then as Hunter, Jim, Ed and others have really looked at the network operating plan, we've done a fair amount to reduce congestion, i.e., to reduce the number of active trains. The number of meets and passes that you have in any given day is a lot less than it used to be.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay. Is there anything specific to the East, physical limitations, tighter, shorter distances between grade crossings that would limit train length growth from here?","James Foote","No. No different.","Brian Ossenbeck","Just wanted to clarify that. But if question was, just to go back to intermodal for a second, talking about disciplined growth in that business. Can you give a sense as to how you're handling the demand? But dwell times are up the terminals across the whole industry, so specifically, I wanted to get your comments on some of the terminal performance in the larger hubs like Memphis and Chicago in addition to the trade capacity serving those markets.","James Foote","Well, we have improved the efficiency of our Chicago terminals, both Bedford Park and 59th Street significantly. Everybody had challenges at Christmastime, especially in Chicago and Memphis when the winter weather came in at Christmas day and just hung around for a month, so it slowed everybody down. Our dwells are -- both originating containers in our intermodal terminals and containers that arrived in our intermodal terminals, our dwells are down because our train service is becoming more reliable and predictable. And therefore, the trade community can rely upon us to be there and handle load for them to haul away. And then at the same time, as we mentioned earlier, with us being more clear in what we expect of our customers in terms of when those containers come into our terminals that we want them out. And if they don't want to get them out, they have to pay to store them. That is increasing the throughput and the fluidity of those 2 main terminals there. Again, Memphis has been a challenge for us, but Memphis is now running smoothly. And again, and I have a big focus on our intermodal terminals for this year. And I'm sure. I'm positive. In fact, I was just in Chicago going through our Bedford Park and 59th Street terminals. I'm sure that we can make improvements there that will improve throughput, which basically adds a significant amount of capacity without spending any money.","Operator","Matt Reustle from Goldman Sachs, you may go ahead.","Matthew Reustle","Maybe if you can touch on asset sales for a moment here. Made some progress in the quarter. What do you expect to be the driver -- what determines whether you hit that $300 million base case or that $800 million in upside that you highlighted at the Analyst Day? Is it simply demand in the market? Are there certain assets that are tied to federal grants that make up a big portion of it? And I guess, if you can categorize the market for asset sales now, that will be helpful as well.","James Foote","So on the real estate side, we're seeing, obviously, pretty stiff demand for what we put out there for sale. Mark Wallace and his team are working awfully hard to free up assets that maybe haven't been for sale for a while. Obviously, you saw a good down payment on that $300 million in the quarter from a line sale perspective. You've probably seen a little bit of traffic out of the STB on a couple of items that we have out for bid right now. And you'll continue to see us focus on that. It is not a demand-side problem. There's a lot of demand out there for infrastructure-type assets, so we think we're hitting the market at a pretty good time.","Matthew Reustle","Okay. Got it. And just one more on the higher demurrage charges. Is this a case where you're hiring good rates on customers? Or is it you're becoming more strict on the chargeable days. Maybe you can walk through that. It seems like quite a jump for some of these customers' in just in one quarter.","James Foote","Well, basically, what you're talking about is here is demurrage or detention, which is a standard operating practice throughout the transportation industry, whether it's the railroads, whether it's the steamship companies, whether it's the terminals. If your asset sits around at somebody else's property and you don't get it out, they charge what for what sits there because they can't use it while your equipment is sitting there. All of these charges, to a large degree, have been on the books of CSX for a long time, but were not necessarily enforced aggressively, or for one reason or another, a customer here or a customer there was given an exception to the policy because it was viewed as an incentive to the customer to come and do business with CSX. Under our current model, under scheduled railroading, we're focused equally on providing our customer with a fair value for what they pay us. But at the same time, having an intense focus on the value of our infrastructure and the value of our asset, and we are not just going to give that away anymore. So as -- again, as Frank made his comments, this is not something necessarily that we want to view as a profit center that we want to, in any way shape or form, gouge our customers. It is a simple fact of life that, again, when the car sits on our network, that -- or it is our car that has been delivered for unloading and it's not unloaded, we expect to be compensated for either the use of our track space where the cars are sitting or the use of our asset while it's -- we can't use it for another piece of business. And again, these are standard industry practices that we just are applying in a more uniform and consistent manner.","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Long with Stephens.","Justin Long","So maybe to address service first and take a bigger-picture approach. Clearly, you've shown improvement, but some of the other rails are struggling. Jim and Ed, you've seen a lot of service disruptions in the industry in the past. You know what it takes to fix some of these issues. With that in mind, when you look at the North American rail network as a whole today, do you have any thoughts around the timing of when we can return to an environment of normal fluidity?","James Foote","No. I can comment on how CSX is running. I can't comment that, on when other railroads are going to do that. It'd just be inappropriate for me to comment.","Justin Long","Okay. Fair enough. And maybe to go back to pricing for my second question. Seems like things are moving higher, coal being the exception. Could you talk about your view on coal pricing going forward? I'm just curious if you expect this downward pressure to continue and if you're pursuing any changes as it relates to the percentage of your contracts that have a fixed component.","James Foote","Well, two pieces of businesses here, the export business, both of the thermal and met, pricing is kind of driven by other indices -- indexes that we really don't have a lot of control over, and so that piece of business kind of goes up and down with those indexes. On the utility side of the business, clearly, the coal-fired utilities, in competing with other utilities, generating facilities that are using natural gas to generate -- to run their turbines, the coal guys have a disadvantage just on a cost per million BTU basis. So to the extent that we can work with those customers, those coal-fired utilities, to give them a more -- a lower-cost basis on a delivered per million BTU basis, i.e., might involve cost of the coal post our transportation, we're going to try and do that and see what happens. There is a lot of coal to the utilities. The majority of the coal that comes from either the Powder River Basin or the Illinois Basin going to our utility. So there is a longer haul. The transportation component of that is larger than what has historically been the case just because it's moving a farther distance. And so if we can do something in that marketplace that will help our customer, that will allow us to use the fact that we've got coal assets, cars and locomotives to move it and it produces to us a very good return, we're going to try to do that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ben Hartford from Baird.","Benjamin Hartford","Jim, any perspective on international intermodal, in particular, your service being a standout relative to the other rails. But any other concerns for the steamship lines with regard to network fluidity broadly in diverting some of the flows away from the East and the Gulf Coast over to the West to improve transit times? Have you seen any or have you heard any talk about that as we enter the spring peak?","James Foote","I'm putting up a big for sale sign in, let's see, Jacksonville, Savannah, Virginia, Baltimore, New York, New Jersey. Open for business. Bring it in. We can handle it all. So I'm good to go. I'm ready to handle their freight and not going to -- not a problem.","Benjamin Hartford","Okay. And then more broadly on protectionism. Several weeks now into -- a lot of the rhetoric around tariffs, obviously, on the steel and aluminum side and, on the grain side, down more recently. Any thoughts that you have as it relates to consequences near term that may have arisen given the rhetoric that we've now been absorbing over the past couple months?","James Foote","No. I keep being asked to become an expert on tariffs, and I'm not. And so right now, everybody -- yes, everybody depends on what day it is as to whether or not this is viewed as a good thing or a bad thing. Anecdotally, we're looking at moving some more petcoke, and we're looking at some steel mills on a rail we're opening up. So that's just anecdotally. So I'm sure as things play out, if anything does come to be, there will be negatives and positives in it. And it's too early to try and guess what those might be.","Operator","Cherilyn Radbourne from TD Securities, you may go ahead.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Just wanted to ask a question around routings. One of the things I was struck by at the Investor Day was just how, in closing hump yards and in moving away from the hub-and-spoke system in intermodal, you'd eliminated some what would seem like very dysfunctional routings. Could you just speak about what impact all of that has on length of haul in merchandise in intermodal and what, if any, implications that has for RPU in those franchises?","James Foote","Well, again, if you take an inefficient -- if you route a car in an inefficient manner, basically, you have artificially increased the length of haul, assuming that you can haul it in a more direct fashion and assuming that you do. And so by improving the efficiency of your network and by taking out all of these millions of out-of-route miles that we move cars on an annual basis, you're going to, theoretically and I would think actually, reduce your length of haul. At the same time, your revenue, if you just look at it on a revenue per unit basis, it's not going to change much. If you can get to a cents per revenue ton mile, you would see an increase because you're going to get the same amount of revenue and having less of the ton mile. So it's kind of a -- there are different metrics, but I think what you're trying to get to is taking something and moving it in a straight line is going -- versus a crooked line is going to be less miles, and you're still going to get paid the same amount of money for doing it.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Great. And then maybe just by way of a quick follow-up, in terms of the equity earnings of affiliates, that's a new income statement line item. Frank, can you just give us some help on how to think about a normal annual run rate for that?","Frank Lonegro","That's a great question, Cherilyn. So the equity earnings of affiliates, the reason that we had to create that was because the nonconsolidated subsidiaries, so you might know those as Conrail, TTX and the Belt Railway of Chicago, among some others, they had to actually revalue their deferred tax liabilities. And because of the size of those revaluations, we had to carry it as a separate line item. You saw a $25 million benefit in the quarter against a $13 million benefit last year. Obviously, those affiliates, when industry volumes are up, they do better. And when industry volumes are down, they may not do as well if they're not pulling costs out the same time. We did have some tax true-ups in there. We said on the call for the fourth quarter, we said think about a $10 million to $15 million per quarter credit there. We're probably at the top side of that one if you're thinking about it from a run-rate basis.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Vernon from Bernstein.","David Vernon","I just wanted to clarify, Jim, it sounded like you were talking a little bit before about the coal business trying to maybe get a little bit more aggressive to grow some utility coal business using price. Is that -- did I hear that correctly? Or what are you trying to get at with the utility coal pricing commentary?","James Foote","Basically, what I said, yes, is on the Southern electric utilities to the extent that we can work with our customers, i.e., if it makes economic sense for us, CSX, to be more aggressive on price to keep those utilities up and running and using coal, we will try to do that.","David Vernon","And can you bound that for us as far as kind of any sort of directional indicator of how much room there is to move in that stuff on the rate?","James Foote","We have room to move.","David Vernon","All right. And then maybe -- I'll follow up with Kevin off-line. But maybe, Frank, question for in the MS&O. How do you reconcile taking a lower accrual on the personal injury when the accident rates are up as significantly as they are in the quarter?","Frank Lonegro","So what the actuaries do, this is not something that we do, it's something that we work with actuaries on. They look at probability and severity, so it has to do not just with the number of incidents but also the severity of incidents in its overall longer-term period of time. We give them all the data, they run the numbers, and we adjust the accrual as necessary. In some quarters and years, it might go up. In other quarters, it might go down.","James Foote","Our accident rates -- actual accident rates in the first quarter this year, or not?","Frank Lonegro","Yes, but the raw incidents that we had were roughly flat, both on a personal injury and a train accident basis. But obviously, what moves the ratio is the denominator, which is per million train lines on train accidents and 200,000 man-hours on PI.","David Vernon","Yes. I mean, they're indexed to the volume of activity, right?","James Foote","Right, which is not -- I'm not suggesting that, that's inappropriate. I'm just saying someone can look at the number and say, \"Oh my god! They're having a lot more accidents,\" when actually, we're either equal to or slightly less than, depending upon what day it is going forward in the year, kind of back where CSX historic -- to historical run rates and moving up vis-\u00e0-vis the rest of the industry in terms of these numbers.","Frank Lonegro","Yes. And the thing you have to remember, David, is in the frequency index, a sprained ankle counts the same as an amputation. I mean I hate to be that graphic about it, but what we look at and what the actuary looks at it is what is the frequency, so we talked about that, and then what is the severity based on our recent experience. So that's why you see the change.","Operator","Our next question will come from Walter Spracklin from RBC.","Walter Spracklin","What I'd like to focus in on is some of your opportunities after the full implementation of your precision railroading is rolled out and your service levels are really salable. Jim, can you focus in on what you've seen as areas or sectors that you really see CSX as being able to grow into a little bit more than either competitors or more than it has in the past? Are there any sectors that really excite you with regards to that of selling your service model once we kind of get through this phase of de-marketing and slower growth -- slower volume growth in 2018?","James Foote","Well, clearly, much as you're familiar with this, much as that way we looked at this at the Canadian National in the early days, the benefits of this are on the merchandise side of the business. And having, on a revenue basis, 2\/3 of your business tied to the merchandise segment, that's where you want to focus, and that's really where the value comes. And those are the customers today that are the easiest to convert because in most -- well, in all cases, they're shipping already today by rail, they're comfortable with shipping by rail, they're sophisticated and big customers who are shipping by rail and they're paying a premium price to move a large product -- same product that they're moving by rail in the truck where they want to get reliability. And the big area of opportunity is to convert those customers and other customers like them to your network on the merchandise side of the business. Half of the intermodal business is looking just for price, and the other half of the business is looking for just price, but at the same time, a really high premium service. So the area where you can focus and do the best good for CSX and the customer base is on the merchandise side of the business, and we'll be transitioning a much greater focus on the top line in the out years, than just truing up and improving the basic operation of the railroad.","Walter Spracklin","Okay. That makes a lot of sense, Jim. And so reliability, how long do you think -- clearly, you're going to be increasingly -- have a reputation for higher reliability. How long do you think before those truck customers buy in and trust that by going over they're are going to get that reliability? Is this something that you got to build out over quarters or over years? How long do you think that'll run?","James Foote","Days, week, quarters, months, years, it depends upon who the customer is. It depends upon where you're doing it. And most of it as in any business, you got to go in and sell to the customer on the idea of converting. And as I said earlier, these guys are sophisticated purchasers of transportation that know rail and they know truck, and they'll scream at you every day that they have to pay premium prices when your service is not good, i.e., they got to pay more to put it in a truck. And so you just got to go onto them and prove lane by lane by lane by lane that you can handle their product to their valued customer and do it in the same way at the same level efficiency and reliability that they get out of a truck. They don't necessarily need it there at 24, 48 hours. They needed there with a degree of reliability that if you say you're going to do it in 4 days, it's there in 4 days 85%, 90% of the time. And if you can do that and not have the outlier where, \"Oh, that load didn't get there for 12 days, and this one didn't get there for 10 days,\" that's how you win it back.","Walter Spracklin","Makes a lot of sense. Okay. Last question here. Senior management, now when you look across a group -- you got a good set of railroaders here. Any areas where you think you're going to be looking to add or ameliorate over the next -- in 2018 in your senior management ranks at all?","James Foote","I think, well, clearly, based upon the results and the performance and everything I've said since I've been here, we got a great team of people that know what the heck they're doing. And as I said, I'll match these guys up with anybody in the industry, and I think we've proven that with our first quarter results that we can perform with anybody. And -- but yes, there are some holes to fill in the organization that everybody is aware of. And Ed and I are working very, very hard to make sure that we find the right people and the right talent who can fill those roles. And we'll probably -- moving some things around by -- during this year more to give people, again, opportunities to show what they can do in certain roles. And we're not sitting still and sitting back on that area either. Everything here is all systems go, improve the place and run it better and better every day and make sure we have the future leaders for CSX ready to go when called on.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Seidl with Cowen.","Jason Seidl","I wanted to touch back on price a little bit, excluding the coal franchise. Jim, I think you mentioned there was some sequential improvement there. Can you give us a sense of how much of your book of business for 2018 has already been repriced?","James Foote","In what segment of the company?","Jason Seidl","Ex-coal.","James Foote","All right. I guess it's safe to say that kind of we have -- best way, say, 1\/3 of the business rolls over every year. That's kind of a good metric to use. And we can't -- I'm not going to -- can't give you any much more guidance than that.","Jason Seidl","Okay. And piggybacking on some of your comments on the call. You mentioned that you might change some of the pricing dynamic. Should we think about it as maybe you guys setting this up something that links to a natural gas index like a Henry Hub to be more flexible given some of the utility's needs?","James Foote","That would be the obvious methodology to use.","Operator","Our last question comes from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley.","Ravi Shanker","Just wanted to make sure I understand your strategy on intermodal here with what's going on in the truck market. Are you saying that you are focusing more on getting pricing from existing customers versus focusing on truck-to-rail conversion? Or is it -- or are you pursuing the volume opportunity as well?","James Foote","Well, clearly, we're focused on two things, one, growing the business; two, profitably. So volume with price equals top line growth. And whether that's an existing customer giving more volume or whether it's a new customer that could give me volume I don't have today, that is always the equation. I do not have a scorecard in my office that says R to R, or whatever you call it, road to rail and how many did I get today. That's not a game that's going to make me any money. Just taking a truck off the highway and putting it on the railroad, if it's not priced right and it's not moving in the right and specific corridor, it adds no value to me. And at the end of the day, it adds no value to the customer because we probably don't do a very good job for him. So whether it's an intermodal customer or whether it's a merchandise customer, the whole objective here is to go to the customer and say, \"I can provide you with value,\" whether it's the merchandise customer that we talked about before or whether it's the intermodal customer who wants to take advantage of the railroad in connection with his over-the-whole trucking -- over-the-road trucking operation. I need to provide value to him and make sure that, that value to him, I get paid for. And if the 2 don't align, if the guy wants me to add value and expects me to give him a discount at the same time, then we don't -- the stars don't align, and he probably goes someplace else.","Ravi Shanker","All right. Understood. And just one housekeeping for Frank. On the real estate gains, I think you had indicated at the Analyst Day that you expect that run rate to step down in 2018 versus 2017. But you had $30 million higher this quarter versus last year. I know that's a lumpy line, but what can we expect in terms of the cadence of that in the coming quarters because right now it looks like it's going to be a significant headwind unless you guys kind of step into the extra $500 million bucket?","Frank Lonegro","So Ravi, we're not trying to time this at all. When the assets are up for sale and they are ready to close, we close them. Like you said, it's going to be lumpy in terms of the quarters and years. We set that goal of $300 million in real estate sales. It's aggressive but achievable. And you might remember that in Mark's remarks at the investor conference, he actually said he thought there was some upside to that, which isn't in the targets that we set. So we're not trying to time it at all. We're going to go as fast as we can and put the money in the bank as fast as we can.","Kevin Boone","And so I think we're done with all the questions, so we'll wrap it up here.","Operator","And thank you.

As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. During this call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode (Operator Instructions).","For opening remarks and introduction I would like to turn the call over to Mr. David Baggs, Vice President of Capital Markets and Investor Relations for CSX Corporation.","David Baggs","Thank you, Wendy and good morning everyone. And again welcome to CSX Corporation\u2019s third quarter 2014 earnings presentation. The presentation material that we will review this morning, along with our quarterly financial report and our safety and service measurements are available on our website at csx.com under the Investor section. In addition, following the presentation, a webcast and podcast replay will be available on the same website.","Here representing CSX this morning are Michael Ward, the Company\u2019s Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; Clarence Gooden, Chief Sales and Marketing Officer; Oscar Munoz, Chief Operating Officer; and Fredrik Eliasson, Chief Financial Officer.","Let me remind everyone that the presentation and other statements made by the Company contain forward-looking statements. You are encouraged to review the Company\u2019s disclosure in the accompanying presentation on Slide 2. ","This disclosure identifies forward-looking statements as well as the uncertainties and risks that could cause actual performance to differ materially from the results anticipated by these statements.","In addition, at the end of the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session with the research analysts. With nearly 30 analysts covering CSX, I would ask, as a courtesy for everyone, to please limit your inquiries to one primary and one follow-up question.","Now, before I turn the call over to Michael, I would like to remind all of you that today\u2019s call will be focused on the discussion of the Company\u2019s strong third quarter results. As a longstanding policy here at CSX we do not comment on rumors or market speculation, and we will not address questions that do not pertain to our quarterly results. We appreciate your cooperation. ","And with that, let me turn the presentation over to CSX Corporation\u2019s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Michael Ward. Michael?","Michael J. Ward","Well, thank you, David, and good morning everyone. Last evening, CSX reported record third quarter earnings per share of $0.51, up 13% increase from the $0.45 in the same period last year. CSX also generated record third quarter revenue of $3.2 billion, up 8% on a 7% volume increase. ","These results demonstrate CSX\u2019s ability to capitalize on the continued economic momentum that is driving broad-based growth across nearly all markets, coupled with the secular growth trends in intermodal and the gas and oil markets. ","Even with the high level of demand CSX\u2019s operations have remained stable. We are continuing to work with our customers to meet their current and future needs, by adding crews, investing in locomotives and infrastructure to increase capacity. ","Thanks for those efforts, the company increased operating income by 16% to $976 million this quarter and improved its operating ratio by 240 basis points to 69.7%. CSX continues to see growth potential across the markets. We are confident in our ability to continue to generate substantial value for our shareholders.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the presentation over to Clarence, who will take us through the top line results in more detail, Clarence?","Clarence W. Gooden","Thank you, Michael, and good morning. The underlying macro-economy remains strong and the data and our experience suggest a positive outlook for growth. The Purchasing Managers Index came in at 57 in September; a reading above 50 indicates that the manufacturing economy is expanding. ","This is the 16th consecutive month the PMI index has signaled expansion. At the same time, the Customer Inventories Index declined to 45; a reading below 50 indicates customer\u2019s inventories are low and suggests continued strength in the demand for manufacturing output.","As a result, many of the customers we serve grew at a robust pace and most of the key indicators we track point to continued expansion. ","Now let\u2019s look at the results on the next slide. Starting at the left side of the chart, total volume grew 7% to more than 1.75 million loads in the quarter with strong growth in merchandise, intermodal and coal. ","Moving to the right, total revenue increased $236 million to over $3.2 billion in the quarter, reflecting overall volume growth and increased pricing across most markets. Merchandise and intermodal account for over three quarters of CSX\u2019s overall revenue. Total revenue includes $17 million of liquidated damages related to contract shortfalls in coal shipments which compares to $51 million in the third quarter of last year.","Next, the average revenue per unit was up slightly. Here core pricing gains and our merchandised and intermodal markets offset the impact of mix and lower coal revenue per unit.","Finally, let\u2019s move to core pricing. Recall the same-store sales are defined as shipments with the same customer, commodity, and car type, and the same origin and destination. These shipments represented about 75% of CSX\u2019s traffic base for the quarter. ","On this basis, all-in pricing was a positive 0.2% in the quarter, reflecting continued rate pressure and export coal markets and the impact of fixed, variable contracts in the domestic utility market where volumes are now increasing.","Since the pricing environment for coal has become more dynamic, reflecting global market conditions for exports and our fixed variable contract structure for domestic utilities and since our merchandise in intermodal markets are becoming a larger portion of our business, we have again provided you with the same-store sales pricing for these two markets on a combined basis. ","At the bottom of this panel, you can see pricing for merchandise and intermodal averaged 2.5% for the quarter. This pricing gain is smaller on a year-over-year basis and essentially flat sequentially while still representing a small spread over rail inflation.","That said we remain confident that the value we create for our customers combined with increasing demand for our service product, provides a solid foundation for growth and sustained pricing of both rail inflation.","Now let\u2019s look at the individual markets in more detail, starting with merchandise. Overall merchandise revenue increased 12% to more than $1.9 billion in the quarter. Volume in the agricultural sector was up 7%. Feed grain shipments continued to benefit from the strong 2013 harvest and ethanol shipments grew as lower corn prices resulted in higher ethanol production levels. The construction sector grew 5% overall reflecting the ongoing recovery of housing and construction activity. Finally, the industrial sector grew 13% led by strength in the energy-related commodities including crude oil, liquefied petroleum gas, and frac sand.","Moving to the next page, let\u2019s review the intermodal business. Intermodal revenue increased 6% to more than $450 million. Total volume grew 5%, setting a new quarterly record for intermodal. Domestic volume was up 7%, driven by continued highway to rail conversions and international volume was up 3%, reflecting an economy that continues to expand. Total intermodal revenue per unit was flat as continued core pricing gains and higher fuel recoveries were offset by mix changes. Finally, we continue to grow our international business by adding new service offerings and making strategic investments. We anticipate opening our new terminal outside of Montreal and completing expansion of our Northwest Ohio hub late in the fourth quarter.","Moving to the next page, let\u2019s review the coal business. Coal volume increased 7%, while revenue was essentially flat in the quarter at $721 million. Domestic coal volume increased 14% with growth in both northern and southern utility shipments, reflecting higher natural gas prices, replenishing of stockpiles, and a competitive gain. Export coal tonnage declined 13% as global market conditions for both thermal and metallurgical coals remain solid. The current API2 spot price of about $72 per ton remains well below the $80, the price level where U.S. coals are more competitive. The Quinton metallurgical coal benchmark has also remained at low levels with a rate of about $120 per ton in the third quarter. Finally, total revenue per unit was down 6% with lower export pricing, fixed variable utility contracts, and unfavorable domestic mix negatively impacting revenue per unit.","Now let me wrap up with the outlook for the fourth quarter. Looking forward, we expect that positive demand environment in the fourth quarter with stable to favorable conditions for 96% of our markets and unfavorable conditions for the remaining 4%. Looking at some of the key markets; chemicals is favorable as we continue to capture opportunities created by the expanding domestic oil and gas industries. In metals, we saw production increase in the third quarter and we expect this trend to continue with demand in the automotive and energy markets being the key drivers. Strong intermodal growth will continue as our strategic network investments support highway to rail conversions. We expect strong domestic coal volume growth in the fourth quarter as utilities continue to rebuild inventories.","Forest products is neutral as continued strength in building products is expected to be offset by lower shipments of wood pellets. Automotive is neutral as slight growth in North American light vehicle production continues to be offset by modal conversions that occurred earlier this year. Export coal volume is expected to be significantly lower in the fourth quarter and our best estimate of 2014 volume is now in the mid to high 30 million ton range. Overall, we expect high levels of demand for our service will continue in the fourth quarter.","Thank you. And now I\u2019ll turn the presentation over to Oscar to review our operating results.","Oscar X. Munoz","Thank you, sir. Good morning everyone. Let me start with a review of our safety as it is our first and foremost priority. In the third quarter, the personal injury and train accident rates both increased versus last year\u2019s near record lows. While we\u2019re disappointed that the metrics have ticked up slightly this quarter, we remain focused on continuous improvement in safety. We remain a leader in the nation\u2019s safest industry and we\u2019re committed to both community and employee safety.","Let\u2019s turn over to the service performance on the next slide. As you can see on the left, third quarter on-time originations and arrivals, along with velocity and dwell, were all stable sequentially. While CSX\u2019s overall service performance is still below the level of our customers and we have come to expect demand on our network has remained strong. As you can see on the chart on the right, service levels have remained steady since the end of the first quarter and have continued to support volume growth. And as importantly, our cost of service is improving. We are working with our customers to meet their rapidly increased demand levels, but as you know, resources in the rail industry take time to be put in place.","In that regard, let me discuss the framework on the next page which we\u2019ve been sharing with our customer to keep them updated on our service recovery efforts. Now, while elementary, the chart on Page 15 conveys the four primary service components, all of which are highly interrelated. We tell our customers there\u2019s a need to ensure not only that we have the right level of train crews but the necessary infrastructure and appropriate number of locomotives with a process that anticipates and reacts to changing business conditions.","Let me briefly touch on each of the four areas depicted on the chart, starting with trained crews. We have hired about 1,250 T&E employees this year for a net increase of over 300 crews and revenue service this year. We currently have 900 crews in training and expect to have over 1,300 by year-end. Hiring crews, as you know, takes six to nine months to find the right individuals and train them. I\u2019m happy to report that given the hiring we\u2019re doing we\u2019re well on our way to having the train crews we need to support both recovery and future growth.","Turning to infrastructure, this is the longest lead time area there is in the rail space. In addition to the actual construction, new projects can take years of planning and getting the necessary approvals from local, state and federal officials. The good news is that we have finished several projects and have many more underway to help improve network fluidity in Chicago as well as our water level and river line routes in the northern tier. Additionally, we\u2019ve been steadily increasing our intermodal investment such as the expansion of our Northwest Ohio intermodal terminal which is nearly complete.","Next, and as you can see on the bottom of the chart, the locomotive icon is colored red. While we have added over 400 active units on a year-over-year basis, unfortunately the unanticipated rapid volume growth that we\u2019re experiencing has exceeded the current capabilities of our locomotive fleet and is a major cause of our service challenges, earlier this quarter we signed an agreement to purchase 300 new locomotives over the next few years with deliveries beginning early next year in 2015. This combined with our own heavy repair program will generate the locomotives we need to enable recovery and again support future growth. Now because these units will not be arriving until after the first of the year, we anticipate locomotives will continue to be a challenge for CSX into next year.","Lastly, let me focus on the process bubble for a moment. This is the area most in our control with the fastest cycle time. We\u2019re actively working to improve planning with other railroads, especially in the critical Chicago Gateway. We are nearly complete with our winter preparations and, also very importantly, we\u2019ve been holding ongoing dialogue with our customers to keep them up-to-date on our service recovery progress in order to better meet their continued volume growth.","Now wrapping up on the next slide. While the service is critical, our team understands that safe operation is still job number one. This team remains committed to safety and service and I greatly thank them for it, and I\u2019m proud to be part of it. The network performance remains stable and we\u2019ll continue working on maintaining the delicate balance of meeting increased customer demand and service recovery. While costs are temporarily higher as we work through our service issues, they have improved sequentially and we expect them to return to normal as fluidity is restored. Lastly, we remain highly confident that our dedicated operating team will gradually restore service to the levels our customers have come to expect from CSX.","So with that, let me turn it over to Fred for his review of the financials.","Fredrik Eliasson","Well, thank you, Oscar, and good morning everyone. Let me begin by providing a summary of our third quarter results. As Clarence mentioned, revenue increased 8% versus the prior year on 7% higher volume, driven by broad-based strength across our merchandise, intermodal and coal markets. Expenses increased 5% versus last year, driven primarily by higher volume, which I will discuss in more detail in the coming slides.","Operating income was $976 million, up 16% or $136 million versus the prior year. Looking below the line, interest expense was relatively flat to the prior year, at $137 million. ","In addition, other income declined $31 million versus the prior year on two unique items. First, following our recent $1 billion debt offering we used some of the proceeds for early retirement of existing debt for which we incurred an additional expense. Redeeming the debt early, generated a positive value of holding the proceeds in cash. ","Second, we also incurred some environmental cleanup costs, during the third quarter related to a non-operating site. Income taxes were $304 million in the quarter for an effective tax rate of 37.4%. Overall, net earnings were $509 million and EPS was $0.51 per share, up 12% and 13% respectively versus the prior year period. ","With that, let\u2019s turn to the next slide and briefly discuss how fuel lag impacted the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, the effect of the lag in our fuel surcharge program was favorable by $14 million. This reflects $8 million of positive in-quarter lag during the third quarter of 2014 versus $6 million of negative in-quarter lag for the same period in the prior year. Based on the current forward curve, we expect the year-over-year fuel lag impact to be slightly favorable in the fourth quarter. ","Turning to the next slide, let\u2019s review our expenses. Overall expenses increased 5% in the quarter. I will talk about the top three expense items in more detail on the next slide, but let me first briefly speak to the bottom two on this chart.","Depreciation was up 5% to $291 million, due to a higher net asset base. Going forward, we are reviewing an asset light study that we normally conduct at this point in the year. Absent any changes, we continue to expect depreciation to increase sequentially a few million dollars per quarter, reflecting the ongoing investment in our business. Equipment rent was 13% up to $106 million driven by higher freight car rate, incremental volume and longer car cycles. ","Now turning to the next slide, let\u2019s discuss our other expenses. Before I discuss the details of these expense categories, let me first highlight the shift between our labor and MS&O lines. During the third quarter, CSX fully in-sourced the management of its locomotive maintenance force. As a result of this change, labor and fringe expense increased by $15 million and MS&O expense decreased by the same amount. ","So overall the change was expense neutral in the quarter. Looking ahead, we expect this trend to continue given the long-term nature of this agreement and future quarter results should reflect this new baseline for labor, fringe and MS&O expense. Now let me discuss the main drivers for each of expense categories beginning on the left with labor and fringe.","Total labor and fringe increased 7% or $54 million versus last year. Excluding the in-sourcing impact labor and fringe increased $39 million year-over-year of which $25 million was related to incremental volume and $18 million was inflation. ","Looking at efficiency and other labor productivity from volume absorption was offset by incremental over time and relief crew expense, as we continue to incur some incremental costs related to network performance. However, these labor-related costs declined sequentially from the second quarter.","In terms of fourth quarter expectations we expected similar level of labor inflation in the $15 million to $20 million range as well as higher year-over-year expenses related to volume growth. Our ending third quarter headcount was up 1% versus the end of the second quarter as T&E employees increased to accommodate higher volume. Looking ahead, we expect overall headcount to increase an additional 1% or about 350 employees by the end of the year versus our September level.","Moving to the right on the slide, MS&O expense increased 6% or $34 million versus the last year, which includes $23 million of expense related to incremental volume and $10 million of inflation. In addition, there was a $16 million increase in casualty and other MS&O with the majority related to the resolution of claims from prior years. And of course, you can see the in-sourcing impact on MS&O that I mentioned earlier.","Looking ahead to the fourth quarter we continue to expect higher year-over-year MS&O expense related to inflation and volume growth. Finally, expense \u2013 fuel expense declined 3% or $14 million versus last year as the impact of higher volume was mostly offset by favorable price and efficiency. In addition, we cycled an adjustment to an interline fuel receivable from the prior year which drove most of the favorability in the other category.","That concludes the expense review. Turning to the next slide I\u2019d like to highlight our core earnings growth and incremental operating margin. Looking at the third quarter financial results and excluding the $34 million in lower liquidity damages that we recycling from the prior year. The company generated $217 million of revenue growth that was partially offset by $100 million of incremental expense. This netted to an increase in core operating income of $170 million versus the prior year or an incremental operating margin of 63%. ","As we highlighted last quarter, the core earnings strength of CSX\u2019s business is again more evident and this quarter\u2019s results again underscores our positive outlook for the future.","Now let me wrap up on the next slide. First, we continue to see broad-based strength across a diverse business portfolio and that strength is translating into more visible and more meaningful earnings improvement. As Oscar highlighted, to effectively serve this growth we are executing our resource plan and investing in infrastructure, locomotives and crews to return service to the superior levels that our customers expect.","Looking at the fourth quarter, we expect EPS will grow at a rate roughly similar to the reported EPS growth we saw here in the third quarter. Of course, this assumes operations remain stable and volume growth remain strong, albeit at a lower level than we saw in the third quarter recognizing that we\u2019re not cycling the strong harvest from last year. For the full year, we continue to expect modest earnings growth. As we look ahead, CSX still expects to achieve double-digit EPS growth in 2015 and an operating ratio in the mid-60s longer term.","With that, let me turn the presentation back to Michael for his closing remarks.","Michael J. Ward","","Well, thank you, Fredrik. Over the past few years, CSX has overcome the challenge of an energy transition in America, absorbing a loss of nearly $1 billion in coal revenue and leveraging new opportunities to sustain earnings growth. CSX has emerged from this transition as stronger company. That strength was evident again this morning as CSX delivered record third quarter earnings for its shareholders and stable service for its customers, while reaffirming the company\u2019s bright future.","That future is built on the continued execution of CSX\u2019s core strategy. That means enhancing our ability to grow faster than the economy, price above inflation, make strategic investments and produce ever more efficient operations to continue delivering superior shareholder value. That is what you saw drive our performance in the most recent quarter and we expect that strategy to drive our growth going forward.","In short, we remain confidence CSX will continue to deliver compelling customer value, which directly translates into superior value for you, our shareholders.","Now, we\u2019ll be glad to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","","Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse.","Michael J. Ward","","Good morning, Allison.","Allison Landry \u2013 Credit Suisse","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could talk about crude prices spiraling downward. And maybe how worried are you about this given that a lot of your recent growth has hinged on energy markets. So I was just wondering if you could maybe help us frame the risk here.","Clarence W. Gooden","Allison, this is Clarence Gooden. Obviously, we have our eye on it with the crude prices this morning approaching $80 on West Texas\u2019 Intermediate. But in the near-term we don\u2019t see any impact on our crude business at this point in time. We\u2019ll watch those prices as they test the ceilings of what the Bakken crude is, but we don\u2019t see any near-term impact on that at this time. We think it\u2019s sustainable.","Allison Landry \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. And is that view sort of similar for frac and NGLs that you are moving?","Clarence W. Gooden","Yes we see the same for that, yes.","Allison Landry \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank. ","Clarence W. Gooden","Good morning, Rob.","Robert Salmon \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hey, good morning guys. Clarence, as a follow-up to Allison\u2019s question, you\u2019ve done a really good job of kind of framing the export coal outlook predicated upon how the prices move. Are there certain price thresholds that we should be thinking about for the crude by rail where it comes more challenging based off of kind of what you see? And I realize there is more moving parts given there is net backs involved. But I would be curious to get your thoughts around that as well as any early comments you might have about the export coal outlook for 2015.","Clarence W. Gooden","Well, let me take your second question first. It\u2019s really too soon for us to give you any commentary on the export coal for 2015, but we\u2019ll certainly do that on our fourth quarter call. On your first question, I\u2019m certainly not an expert on crude spreads here. I did see a discussion this morning, however, by the former President and CEO of Shell Oil, in which he said he thought it was very interesting that the OPEC countries may in fact be \u2013 one of the reasons they\u2019re bringing down the price of oil is to test to see where American fracking companies would in fact start to shut down wells. Since nobody knew what that number was, it was a closely guarded secret. So your guess is as good as mine when those would start coming in, but there\u2019d obviously be some number, but it\u2019s, to my knowledge we\u2019re nowhere near close to what that number is.","Robert Salmon \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Fair enough. Appreciate the color.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs.","Clarence W. Gooden","Good morning, Thomas.","Thomas Kim \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Good morning. Thanks very much for taking the time here. I just wanted to ask on the intermodal side. First off, can you give us a little bit of color in terms of where your domestic intermodal rates are versus TL presently? ","Clarence W. Gooden","They\u2019re running in general on the contractual side about 10% to 15% below where the truck load rates are. The spot market, however, is much closer to what the truckload rates are. We\u2019ve been able to close that spot market in the \u2013 due to the tightening up of the truckload demand. So we\u2019re probably within 5% of those.","Thomas Kim \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, great. And then just with regard to the comment on the mix shift, can you help us understand what exactly it is? Because when we look at the mix between domestic and international, they are actually \u2013 the shift has been only about 1 point year-on-year. So I am wondering if there is more in mix and commodity or is there a mix between increase in long-term customer versus spot. Just if you could maybe give us a little bit more color with regard to that. And then just I guess also related, is there any reason why the domestic intermodal hasn\u2019t \u2013 the share hasn\u2019t grown more significantly just given that there has been more growth that we would have thought over the last year with regards to domestic over international?","Clarence W. Gooden","Well in our door-to-door service product, which has traditionally carried a higher RPU was roughly flat this quarter. And in addition, we saw pretty strong growth in what we\u2019re traditionally backhaul lane markets and that has had a negative impact. For example, our UMAX product, which moves from the East to points beyond Chicago, which are traditionally back haul flows, has had a healthy volume growth even though it has had an RPU growth of around 3.5% that volume has still had a negative impact on the mix. And the rest of the intermodal businesses as you know is managed on long-term contracts, it has and has price escalators built in. So it is difficult for us to in the short term to get some of those rates up.","Thomas Kim \u2013 Goldman Sachs","All right, thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley.","Michael J. Ward","Hi, Bill.","William J. Greene \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hi, good morning. Fredrik, I wanted to ask you for a little bit more color on the 2015 commentary. I think we\u2019ve all been surprised at the volume growth so far in 2014. And so can you talk a little bit about the confidence on that double-digit growth rate? Does it suggest that the pricing outlook is superior and therefore incrementals should look better? Is that kind of the key to getting to double digit? Because I would assume volume growth would slow just given the comps. But maybe you can offer some views there.","Fredrik J. Eliasson","Well I mean as I think we said in our prepared remarks, in the fourth quarter we already expect volumes to come down slightly from what we seen here over the last few quarters, but we still expect a pretty robust macro environment next year and that coupled with some of these more secular things that we\u2019re seeing in the energy environment and our intermodal trends continue to point towards a pretty healthy volume environment for 2015 as well. Clearly, as Clarence has mentioned a little early right now to talk about what export coal is going to do, but that is the wild card.","We\u2019ve said that repeatedly and there is probably more downside than upside. But we continue to produce pretty good results, we continue to bring a fair amount to the bottom line even though we\u2019re not operating as efficiently as we can. So the fact that we are going to cycle some pretty significant headwinds we had here this year in the first quarter and even in the second quarter coupled with a good, healthy top line environment gives us the confidence that we should be able to produce double-digit earnings growth next year.","Oscar X. Munoz","And Bill, this is Oscar. The cost structure part, that is mine, we got that one. That\u2019s going to be a key focus for us next year, and I think that will be a contributor factor.","William J. Greene \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Yeah, that makes sense. Oscar, in the third quarter \u2013 I think in the first half we talked about a little over $120 million of weather and inefficiencies due to the network challenges. Was there an impact that you can give us for the third quarter how much that might have cost?","Oscar X. Munoz","Sure. So you\u2019re right. It was about $32 million in the second quarter we estimated about $16 million here in the third quarter, the difference was predominantly that we had less reliance on foreign horsepower here in the third quarter than we had in the second quarter as we\u2019ve been able to ramp up additional leases and other repairs that we\u2019ve been doing on our equipment. Over time it\u2019s still running relatively high. But the big delta between the second and third quarter was just that, it was the locomotive costs.","William J. Greene \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","And you said, one, six.","","Oscar X. Munoz","16, yes.","William J. Greene \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Yeah. Okay. Thank you for the time.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch.","Michael Ward","","Good morning Ken.","","Ken Hoexter \u2013 Bank Of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning. Great bottom-line performance, great to see. Can you maybe, Oscar, address \u2013 the on-time origination and arrivals continue to remain so low and we can see the velocity improving. But why are those measures and metrics stuck at kind of really reduced levels compared to the 85%, 90% we\u2019ve seen in the past. And what needs to turn? Is that just the employees and locos coming online or what else needs to happen to get the actual rails running on time?","","Oscar X. Munoz","Yeah, Ken, great question. Yeah, I think the public measures have always been and will continue to be sort of trailing indicators. I think getting back up to the pre-service recovery levels is going to take locomotives primarily. I think we\u2019ve got a lot of the crews, but we need 100 or 200 more locomotives here over the next few months that would take us back to those 85%, 90% level, that\u2019s the biggest factor. That\u2019s why on that service framework again \u2013 it takes all of those things being interrelated, but for us the red icon is power at this time.","","Ken Hoexter \u2013 Bank Of America Merrill Lynch","And then we can presume there is no issues with one manufacturer making them or with the new Tier 4 or anything else in terms of getting those locos?","","Oscar X. Munoz","Well, getting them is difficult, right, everybody is sold out. There is not a single piece of power you can acquire. We have gotten, we have ordered 300, we\u2019ll be getting our share of them. With your question regarding Tier 4 that\u2019s being tested, the Western roads in particular are doing that and the one model that\u2019s going to be coming out of one of the suppliers has actually fared well under heavy service. So we\u2019re confident that those new locomotives will do well. Now, half of our order is new and half of our orders are the new versus old.","Ken Hoexter \u2013 Bank Of America Merrill Lynch","All right. And just a follow-up on the peer pricing. Is there, Clarence, any thoughts on the decelerating peer pricing? Given demand is so strong why we continue to see the peer pricing metric fall. It\u2019s half a point, but just why we see that downtick?","Clarence W. Gooden","Ken, that was mainly in one of our market areas. I think you\u2019re going to see very robust pricing going forward. We are concentrated and focused on our pricing. So in regards to the question that Bill Greene asked earlier, pricing, you\u2019ll see going forward being very strong and very robust for us.","Ken Hoexter \u2013 Bank Of America Merrill Lynch","All right, I appreciate the time. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Chris Wetherbee with Citi.","Clarence W. Gooden","Good morning, Chris.","Chris Wetherbee \u2013 Citi Investment Research","Hey, good morning. Thanks. Maybe a question on the utility coal side; just curious sort of how that restocking is playing out. Just wanted to get a rough sense of sort of how your utilities that you serve are, in terms of historical inventories or inventories relative to historical levels. Are we getting closer? How much longer do you think this plays out?","Clarence W. Gooden","","The North, Chris, is almost at their target levels. In fact, you could say they\u2019re at target levels. The South is still building and by the fourth quarter should be at target levels.","Chris Wetherbee \u2013 Citi Investment Research","Okay. So it feels like there is about one more quarter or so to get prepped, and then we\u2018ll see what the winter brings us.","Clarence W. Gooden","","That\u2019s right.","Chris Wetherbee \u2013 Citi Investment Research","Okay. And then my second question, just a little bit of a bigger picture stepping back and thinking about the 65% OR target. As you stand with it now and the market as it stands today, could you give us some sense of sort of what you need to see happen to get toward that target, move towards that target? You made great strides on OR in the third quarter. Just want to get a rough sense of sort of how to think about sort of the puts and takes towards getting to that 65%, and maybe a little bit of color sort of when that could potentially happen.","Fredrik Eliasson","","Sure. So obviously this is \u2013 we\u2019ve put together two quarters now in a row below 70%. And we have said we want to move to the 65% is kind of the target that we have out there. And clearly the foundation for that is service excellence. We need to restore service to the level that we expect from ourselves and the customers expect from us. And as we do that, we think three good things will happen and we\u2019ve seen that in the past, which is that we continue to price above inflation, and we see that the market is tightening up and we see opportunities to accelerate our pricing.","Two, we continue to see a robust economic environment and we see now the positives of the new energy environment that should allow us to grow faster than the economy as a whole. And then as we get our network velocity up to the level we expect, we should also see cost coming out of the system again. Between those three, which are really the levers we\u2019ve been pulling for an extended period of time, we see the math is pretty compelling. It gets you there over time. But over the last two years, as you\u2019ve seen, with $800 million from coal coming out in terms of our top line, we have stood still for a period of time, as we now transition out of that period. We feel the momentum is coming back again, as we feel pretty good about where we\u2019re heading now. ","Chris Wetherbee \u2013 Citi Investment Research","So natural progression over the next couple years, I guess?","Michael J. Ward","Yes.","Chris Wetherbee \u2013 Citi Investment Research","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Tom Wadewitz with UBS.","Michael J. Ward","Good morning, Tom. ","Thomas Wadewitz \u2013 UBS Investment Research","Hi, good morning. Wanted to ask Clarence a little bit about how much visibility you have to pricing at this point. I would think that with some of the multiyear contracts that would be expiring next year, you probably would have been in negotiations at this point. Maybe you have some of those deals signed already. So can you give us a flavor of what you are seeing for pricing for 2015, just in terms of either the multiyear contracts or other business? And perhaps also what \u2013 how much has already been repriced for 2015?","Clarence W. Gooden","","We are well along in our pricing for 2015. I would tell you that in excess of 50% of our contracts that we have to renew for 2015 have been repriced. It\u2019s looking very good. That is why I made the statement earlier that prices were going up for 2015. I felt very positive about what 2015\u2019s pricing is looking like, it will be much more robust than you\u2019ve seen probably in the last three to four years for CSX.","Thomas Wadewitz \u2013 UBS Investment Research","So when we think about that \u2013 what more robust means, does that mean a percentage point higher? Does that mean more than that? Could it be 2 or 3 percentage points higher than the pricing you have seen in the last couple years?","Clarence W. Gooden","It means significantly improved. ","Thomas Wadewitz \u2013 UBS Investment Research","Okay.","Michael J. Ward","Welcome back Tom.","Thomas Wadewitz \u2013 UBS Investment Research","I don\u2019t know if that counts as my second or not. I will try to \u2013 Oscar, do you have a quick thought on the timing of the locomotives coming up? You said 300 I think is for multiple years. You need 100 to 200 more, but when do you get 100 to 200 more? Is that first half next year or?","Oscar X. Munoz","Yeah, thanks. So yes, the early part of next year, we\u2019ll get 100 new. ","Thomas Wadewitz \u2013 UBS Investment Research","Okay.","Oscar X. Munoz","And then, we are hoping for early delivery of a couple hundred of a \u2013 of the second hundred later in the year. But we also have our internal what we call heavy repair process that should deliver roughly between 100 and 150 over that same between now and the middle part of next year. So we\u2019ve another outlet just other than the purchases. It is just timing. ","Thomas Wadewitz \u2013 UBS Investment Research","Okay. That\u2019s great. I appreciate the time. Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. The next question is from Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities.","Michael J. Ward","Good morning, Cherilyn. ","Cherilyn Radbourne \u2013 TD Securities. ","Thanks very much. Good morning. My question relates to Chicago. It is my understanding the rails have agreed to a series of protocols that will be triggered automatically if certain thresholds are tripped this winter. And I was just wondering if you could give us a bit of color on how that will work and how you think it will improve the industry\u2019s recoverability?","Oscar X. Munoz","Yes, Cherilyn, this is Oscar. Yes, certainly there is a broader set of issues and a very complex environment, right, kind of a spider network, six Class I\u2019s, heavy commuter and passenger rail on the plays, so those require a lot of coordination. What is called the CTCO, which is in essence the terminal operating team that is represented by most of the railroads, it has been a coordinating factor there and has done a pretty good job. Remember we forget that Chicago just got slammed with a huge amount of volume which has created a little bit attention.","So knowing that, knowing that another winter is coming and that heavy volumes continue, we have been working across most of the industry to sort of get CTCO to act more like a single terminal. We\u2019re going to 24\/7 operations during the period. A lot more engagement between all levels and most of the railroads again and then importantly to your question, improve the informational planning tools because for a while there was kind of word of mouth. I called you and said I was in trouble and then you tried to fix it. Or you didn\u2019t see that problem. And so rather than taking the human aspect of that, let\u2019s put it in a system, put it in a scorecard, if you will, and then that will drive what we call an alert status that will increase the level of interaction and coordination.","So it\u2019s a combination of people, communicating more, using tools to get facts and data so that we are not guessing. And then really there is kind of a great level of trust, desire, and capability for everyone to work together there. So it is a broad, complex environment and we are focused on getting that done for the next few months.","Cherilyn Radbourne \u2013 TD Securities. ","That\u2019s great and that\u2019s all from me. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from David Vernon with Bernstein.","Michael J. Ward","Good morning, David.","David S. Vernon \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So, Fredrik, as you think about the incremental margin performance going forward, what do you think is the right sort of range we should be looking at into 2015? It seems like the volume driven leverage is having a good effect, and if Clarence is right you\u2019re going to get more pricing. Should we be actually expecting the incremental margin performance to step up next year?","Fredrick J. Eliasson","We\u2019ve said that in order to get to our mid-60s target, that we need to have incremental margins above 50% this quarter depending on how you look at it, somewhere between 50% to 60%. And I think that is a good place to be as. . As you think about 15% specifically, you\u2019re right, we\u2019re going to have I think an improved pricing environment, but you\u2019re also going to have a period of time, where we are going to have to essentially over resource slightly in order to get the velocity of our network up and running. So there are some puts and takes there, but you clearly have to be in the 50% to 60% range long-term in order to get to the place where we need to get to.","David S. Vernon \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC","And then maybe just as a follow-up, Michael, we are talking a lot about the tightness of the rail infrastructure. And I would love to get your perspective on an industry issue which would be not specific to any type of specific deal. But do you think that consolidation across the larger Class I\u2019s could actually improve the capacity in the network in a way that would not be achievable without further consolidation, or do think that that it is less of a reality going forward?","Michael J. Ward","I think what we see out there, David, is that all the railroads are increasing their capacity similar to what we are doing. And I think those will produce the capacity needed to move America\u2019s freight.","David S. Vernon \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC","So you don\u2019t \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t see an extra step up in efficiency through consolidation across some of the Class I\u2019s?","Michael J. Ward","You might actually see a step back. As you know, in the past mergers there have been severe service disruptions after one of those transactions.","David S. Vernon \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC","","Great. Thanks very much for the commentary.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the John Larkin with Stifel, Nicolaus.","John G. Larkin \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc","Hi good morning gentlemen, thanks for taking my question. ","Clarence W. Gooden","Good morning John.","John G. Larkin \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc","Just wanted to bore in a little bit more deeply on the $16 million that was the cited cost of the congestion in the third quarter for the Company, quite a bit down from where it was in the second quarter. But that strikes me as being a relatively low number given the extent and far-reaching nature of the congestion. So as you resource up by adding more people, add all these locomotives and so forth, presumably that\u2019s going to cost more on the other hand than the cost of congestion is costing you presently. Is that going to provide a little bit of a margin headwind over the next say two to four quarters as you go forward?","Fredrik Eliasson","I think you are pulling on one of the reasons why we are not putting that explicit number into our earnings report at this point because the calculation itself becomes more complicated as you start to ramp up additional hiring and so forth. But if you look at where were again in the third quarter while we\u2019ve had some additional people in training the big driver really was the difference in terms of how we\u2019ve sourced our locomotives for the quarter. And so it has come down because it is a lot cheaper to get our leases, the use leased locomotives versus the foreign horsepower.","And as you think about the next couple of quarters, to your point, there will be incremental cost that will come in as we bring on additional locomotives, as we bring on additional maintenance for those and additional hiring that we are doing. So I think that\u2019s a fair point.","Michael J. Ward","But then again, all those resources, again remember, investment equals better service and service equals better volume and margins. And that is the reason why we do all this. And I think other than just bringing on equipment our process, we are spending a little bit better. Again, the indicators you see out there are trailing and you will be to see more of the financial, better financial impact here over the next couple of quarters.","John G. Larkin \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc","","Thank you for the answer. Just maybe as a follow-on. A while ago you shifted to the fixed and variable cost pricing approach for utility coal contracts, volume has spiked as utilities have scrambled to sort of replenish their inventories and stockpiles. Has the fixed and variable pricing model worked the way you thought it would? And was one of the reasons why you\u2019re able to pick up a little competitive market share that you touched on just briefly during your formal comments?","Clarence W. Gooden","John, this is Clarence. One, it has worked the way we expected it to work. And two, it is not the reason we made a competitive pick up.","John G. Larkin \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research.","Michael J. Ward","","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey Kauffman \u2013 Buckingham Research","Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question, and congratulations. Two questions, one financial and then one a follow-up to the system fluidity question. Fredrik, how have these changes in investments affected your capital budget thoughts for 2014 and 2015? And can you address the drag on operating cash flow from the reversal of bonus depreciation? How much is that weighing on operating cash flow and will that change as we get into 2015?","Fredrik Eliasson","","Sure. In terms of capital, I think we have a better idea in the fourth quarter, but clearly because of the locomotives we\u2019re going to be purchasing next year. We\u2019re probably looking at the higher end of the 16% to 17%, probably around 17% realistically. In terms of the cash flow, just ask me that question again?","Jeffrey Kauffman \u2013 Buckingham Research","Well, a bonus depreciation reversed and that\u2019s been a drag, I thought, of about $200 million to $300 million on operating cash flow. And I was just wondering if we\u2019re going to start to mitigate that in the next year or two and what that drag is likely to be.","Fredrik Eliasson","Sure. So next year I think will be the height of that drag. We\u2019ve started seeing a little bit here in this year, but next year essentially our cash taxes will be almost at the statutory rate, so 36%, 37%. There won\u2019t be many opportunities to defer taxes next year because of the fact that we\u2019ve enjoyed that bonus depreciation for so many years. But as you move into 2016, you will start building up some of that depreciable base again. Now all of this assumes that bonus depreciation will not be extended, which there is still some talk about. But right now it looks like about $250 million or so, $250 million of impact on our cash flow year-over-year just from the fact that bonus depreciation is going away in 2015.","Michael J. Ward","","This is Michael. I\u2019d just add. When I go to DC, I think the general sentiment is they probably will do the tax extenders before the end of the year.","Jeffrey Kauffman \u2013 Buckingham Research","Okay. And then, Mike, a thought question. A lot of people that invest in the stock today weren\u2019t around in the 1990s when we had the service issues and that led to the STB\u2019s merger moratorium and then the new rules. I heard your answer to the earlier question that consolidation would probably muck up the system. But in terms of the concept of consolidation there was a reason the STB made it tougher. Do you think in this environment when service across the industry is struggling that the argument can be made that service would be better as a result of consolidation? Or that any large consolidation could even be likely in this environment? ","Michael J Ward","","Well, I think all this is very speculative, but as you know, the STB is very concerned about the service levels being produced by the industry with this surge of business. And it even asked for new reports on a weekly basis to monitor that. So I might speculate they would be very cautious about this because in the past they have created disruptions and the industry is already somewhat slowdown by this tremendous growth in the volumes. ","Jeffrey Kauffman \u2013 Buckingham Research","","So you would argue that the regulators would be very skeptical in this environment anyway?","Michael J Ward","","That would be my speculation, but you\u2019d probably be better to ask them. ","Jeffrey Kauffman \u2013 Buckingham Research","","Okay, very good. Mike, thanks for your view.  ","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.","Michael J Ward","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Group \u2013 Wolfe Research","Hey, good morning, guys. Fredrik, if we take out the liquidated damages this quarter and a year ago, you still saw a pretty big increase in other railway revenue. Can you give us some color on what that was and if that is sustainable or not, how we should model that going forward?","Fredrik J. Eliasson","Yes. If you look at where we are on other revenue, I think there is couple other drivers if you look at a year-over-year clearly, we are seeing a little bit of higher incidental revenue predominantly in intermodal, because of the tight capacity environment that we find ourselves in we see some of the subsidiary railroads have done a little bit better, than they did a year-ago. And then last year was a little bit depressed because of some of the revenue adjustments that we had, so, that kind of explain it. So I would say that this quarter was a pretty good run rate. I think historically I have said $80 million to $90 million is probably a good place to be, we were slightly above that here this quarter. But somewhere around $80 million to $90 million is probably a good place to be in other revenue, excluding any liquidated damages.","Scott Group \u2013 Wolfe Research","That is great. And then the guidance for next year, if I remember when you first laid it out for us there was this assumption that coal would stabilize. And now you don\u2019t add that caveat as much about coal stabilizing. So do you think you need coal to be flat next year? Or is there enough going on in pricing and merchandise growth where you can still get to the double-digit earnings growth next year even if coal gets worse next year?","Fredrik J. Eliasson","I think we\u2019re trying to stay away from any specific market and try to predict what it will do, because as we try to do that in the past, we found ourselves that we usually are wrong, either good or bad for that matter. And so, we try to stay at a high level. As we look at next year, we still feel that double-digit is the right place to be. But clearly there are lots of pluses and minuses. We got the fact that the macro environment, as I said earlier, is positive. We\u2019ve got a tightening capacity environment that should be helpful in the pricing side.","But then you do have export coal and you do have the fact that we need to see the cost coming out of the system as short-term over resource but then see the cost coming out. And then the thing that you don\u2019t know what is going to happen is obviously weather. We just don\u2019t know the impact on weather both in terms of utility coal stockpiles and we don\u2019t know whether in terms of the impact of our network performance. So take all that together and when we add that and we\u2019ll look at it and we still say that double-digit is the right place to be.","Scott Group \u2013 Wolfe Research","Okay. Thank you guys.","Operator","","Thank you. The next question is from Jason Seidl with Cowen.","Michael J. Ward","","Good morning Jason.","Matt Elkott \u2013 Cowen and Company","","Good morning, this is actually Matt Elkott for Jason. Thank you for taking our question. I want to go back to the locomotive topic. My question is assuming current freight demand levels, when you guys start receiving the new locomotives is the focus going to be on moving more freight or is it moving similar freight levels more efficiently?","Michael J. Ward","Yes and yes I think. It\u2019s an interesting question, but, no, absolutely. I mean, I think there is \u2013 whatever pent-up demand in customers that we have some areas where we can easily use more power will generate more business. But also importantly, to sort of turbocharge our system to spin more rapidly. So it will be useful for both of those areas.","Matt Elkott \u2013 Cowen and Company","","Okay. And just a quick follow-up on the export coal topic, have you guys had to do more on the rate front in order to keep producers competitive with your fixed variable structure?","Clarence W. Gooden","Matt, this is Clarence Gooden. First, we don\u2019t have fixed variable rates in the export coal. But to answer your question I think you were driving at, we said earlier on last quarter\u2019s call and to reiterate on this one, we are at the bottom on the export rates. So we\u2019re doing nothing, we are as low as we can go everything from here forward is up.","Matt Elkott \u2013 Cowen and Company","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","","Thank you. The next question is from Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird.","Michael J. Ward","","Good morning, Ben.","Benjamin Hartford \u2013 Robert W. Baird & CO.","Good morning guys. I guess this is for Oscar. I just want to get a little bit more specific in terms of service expectations. You had talked about gradual improvement and I think Fredrik had talked about returning to service levels that you and your customers expect. I\u2019m just wondering more quantitatively what does that mean. Do you think that \u2013 if we use the high watermark of train velocity for let\u2019s say it was 2013, is it reasonable to expect that you can get back to those levels, the cycle, and we can define a cycle for as long as we need to? I mean, 2015, can train speed velocity get back to 2013 levels? Is that a realistic target? Do you think that \u2013 have you seen enough to think that surpassing those levels is unreasonable as well? I\u2019m just trying to get a perspective on how quickly and how fully we should expect service to be restored.","Oscar Munoz","","I think to reiterate what was said before it is a gradual and not linear as we go into really the first half of 2015. I think after that fact I think \u2013 again, these things being trailing indicators, you\u2019ll begin to see them markedly increase and, yes, to previous levels and not necessarily static of that. I think as we spend more \u2013 we had two record years before this particular issue. I think it\u2019s easy to forget that. But I think once we get past this, really this power resource and again our volume sort of begins to stabilize as opposed to the surges that we\u2019ve had. I think it\u2019s important.","I\u2019ll tell you, the confidence that I have from seeing all this just in this quarter alone, July we had about 14% GTM growth and that\u2019s a month where everyone takes off for vacation in our employee workforce in the union. And we struggled with that. I mean that was a power and crew issue. In our business the ability to recover is critical. And the fact that in this quarter you\u2019re seeing the results that we have, given the fact that a good four to six weeks was really a struggle period, I think sort of gives me the confidence that our recoverability process is there. Even with limited resources. So as we get more I think we\u2019ll improve again gradually, but not necessarily linear.","Benjamin J. Hartford \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.","","Okay. And then, I guess, just a follow-on on that point, in terms of the employee count, it did, growth on a year-over-year basis did accelerate modestly through the quarter. Is there an idea when that growth rate will peak and then begin to decelerate?","Clarence W. Gooden","I think we expect by the end of this year to be up about 2% and I think you\u2019ll see a slight increase in the first quarter as well. But it is nothing significant. The predominance of our hiring right now is in the T&E ranks and some on the support side and the mechanical side. But it is not a significant increase.","Benjamin J. Hartford \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar.","","Clarence W. Gooden","Good morning.","","Keith Schoonmaker \u2013 Morningstar Inc.","","Yes, kind of a question also related to crewing and labor. Longer-term question. What portion of TD labor works on hourly contracts now and do you see moving to hourly based compensation as beneficial for productivity and quality of life?","Fredrik Eliasson","I don\u2019t think in terms of our T&E folks we have any hourly workforce. I think that obviously that could be a benefit. The question is ultimately what you have to do in order to make that work economically with the unions as you do go through those negotiations.","","Keith Schoonmaker \u2013 Morningstar Inc.","","Maybe, Fredrik, I could switch to a CapEx question in light of the locomotive orders in your remarks that around 17% will be invested next year in CapEx. There\u2019s been a big slug of CapEx with PTC and maybe can you give us a quick update on where the spending is this year and next? And do you expect that CapEx would remain still in the 16% or 17% range even after PTC is fully invested at least for the heavy capital portion?","Fredrik Eliasson","","Yes. So, PTC is above our core capital guidance, so that\u2019s 16% to 17% \u2013 around 17% next year excludes PTC. If you look at PTC in itself, we are spending about $300 million this year and by the end of this year we will spend about $1.2 billion. We\u2019ve said that cost is approximately $1.7 billion in total at least. And we will probably spend somewhere in the neighborhood of the same amount we\u2019re spending this year next year, and then it will start coming down after that.","Keith Schoonmaker \u2013 Morningstar Inc.","","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Walter Spracklin with RBC. ","Michael J. Ward","","Good morning, Walter.","Walter Spracklin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Thanks very much. Good morning everyone. So two questions here, one for, I guess Clarence, one for Oscar. And, Clarence, just really a clarification on your fourth quarter outlook in particular for domestic coal and ag. Given the change in compares going into the fourth quarter 2013 they\u2019re quite substantial. I mean you did 15.5 million tons in fourth quarter of 2013, but you are running at a 20 million run rate this year. To say that it\u2019s favorable, I mean it would have to be up 25% to 30% to maintain the 20 million run rate. So are you indicating that we should look at some kind of seasonal drop in the fourth quarter, or do we run it at that kind of 20 million clips that you\u2019ve been experiencing this year even though it means up 25%, 30% year over year?","Clarence W. Gooden ","You\u2019re talking about coal?","Walter Spracklin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","","Utility coal, domestic utility, yes.","Clarence W. Gooden ","","Oh, domestic utility coal.","Walter Spracklin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","I mean, you\u2019re 15.5 million fourth quarter 2013, but 20 million last quarter. So, I mean, if we are favorable, yes, up year-over-year you\u2019d have to be really up 25% to 30% to maintain 20 million tons. Just curious if that\u2019s what you are guiding. Are you guiding kind of continued 20 million or are we looking at a rather substantial downtick given the seasonal nature of the fourth quarter if seasonal at all?","Clarence W. Gooden ","Well, I\u2019m not looking at it on my sheet here in terms of tons. I was looking at it in terms of percentages, but I\u2019m guiding you to strong, a very strong fourth quarter in coal on a year-over-year basis.","Walter Spracklin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Right, okay. ","Clarence W. Gooden ","Utility coal.","Walter Spracklin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Utility coal, okay. And I guess the same question kind of is for ag, right, except the flipside, you had a very strong fourth quarter last year, 113,000 carloads. This year you\u2019re \u2013 I mean this quarter you\u2019re 98,000. So flat would mean a significant downturn in the ag. Just curious if you are guiding us here relative to third quarter or relative to last year\u2019s fourth quarter?","Michael J. Ward","Relative to the last year\u2019s fourth quarter.","Walter Spracklin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay, all right. Oscar, just a follow-up on the congestion side. You indicated that there are lots of opportunities that you have internally, all the railroads have internally to increasing capacity through your own strategies. At what point does that get exhausted? In other words, when you\u2019ve exhausted a good degree of your own capacity expansion issues or initiatives, where does the next pinch point come up?","Oscar X. Munoz","Michael, let me tackle that. I think what we find is we have a fair amount of ability to continue to expand, a fair amount of our network is single track. We can add a second track to that, in fact a long passing siding and making it double track. So we have the ability on our line of road to incrementally add capacity and we are in the areas that are growing. So I think the horizon with which railroads can continue to increase their capacity on their own, I think is fairly long-term.","Walter Spracklin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. So you are saying the next pinch point, several pinch points are all kind of inter \u2013 or intracompany, not necessarily between interchange points of Chicago or with your supply chain partners, anything like that?","Michael J Ward","Well as Oscar said earlier, Chicago is complex and it is always going to be complex and we\u2019re working cooperatively to increase the throughput there. But I think your categorization and most of the needs to create capacity are internal to the existing individual railroads.","Walter Spracklin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Justin Long with Stephens.","Michael J. Ward","","Good morning, Justin.","","Justin Long \u2013 Stephens, Inc.","","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First one I wanted to ask was on intermodal margins. You\u2019ve talked over the last few quarters or so about how they\u2019ve caught up to other commodity groups with the exception of coal and chemicals. But as you look out over the next several years and think about the opportunity to get price and also build density, do you think that intermodal margins can be significantly better than the non-coal, non-chemicals businesses?","Michael J. Ward","","Well. Certainly, intermodal margins are going up. They\u2019re going up for a couple of reasons. The trains are getting longer. The double stack clearances are obviously helping getting more density on the trains. The efficiencies that we have in the newer and more modern terminals with the automation that made the margins better. And frankly the price increases that we are getting in the marketplace now both in our international business and in our domestic business has got a long way towards improving those margins. So I think you\u2019ll see margin improvement in the intermodal marketplace as we move forward.","Justin Long \u2013 Stephens, Inc.","Okay. And second question I wanted to ask \u2013 I know there is several intermodal terminal projects on the network you mentioned Montreal, the expansion at Northwest Ohio in the prepared comments. But is there any way you could quantify how much capacity the current intermodal terminal projects that are underway will add your network.","Michael J. Ward","","Well. I don\u2019t have those numbers right in front of me, but we can make them available to you.","Justin Long \u2013 Stephens, Inc.","Okay, great. I will just follow-up on that. I appreciate the time.","Michael J. Ward","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question today is from Cleo Zagrean with Macquarie Capital.","Michael J. Ward","","Good morning, Cleo.","Cleo Zagrean \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Thank you very much for taking my question. Good morning. My first question is about the outlook for rates on coal. You have already stated that you see the export rates only going up from here in terms of your stance. What do you \u2013 where do think we should see coal rates all add up to when we also consider the impact of fixed variable contracts on the domestic front and any mix issues? ","Michael J. Ward","","Well, I think Clarence \u2013 this is Michael, I think Clarence actually said that the export rates will not go down anymore. I think they won\u2019t go up unless we see a change in the world marketplace. So he was not saying they\u2019re going to go up, he was saying they would not go down anymore. On the domestic side, Clarence, maybe you could address what you are seeing there.","Clarence W. Gooden","On the fixed variable, obviously as the tonnage goes up on that part of the fixed variable, and about a third of our contracts are under fixed variable, the average RPU will go down as the volume goes up. If the volume stays flat next year then you will see the rates will stay the same. If the volume goes down then the RPU will go up next year. ","Michael J. Ward","But your base pricing is going up.","Clarence W. Gooden","But the base pricing itself is going up.","Cleo Zagrean \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Thank you. And my second question was with regards to EPS guidance. Prior to today, I think as of last quarter or even the most recent conference, you were saying that you expect to return to double-digit EPS growth beginning in 2015. And I would have taken that to mean that\u2019s the beginning of a series of years. Now you are saying you expect double-digit growth in 2015. Should we take this to mean any kind of change in long-term guidance for EPS beyond 2015? And any other comment you would like to make for beyond 2015 I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you.","Fredrik J. Eliasson","","No, I think that overall our guidance has been 2015, I think we tried to stay away from longer-term guidance than that because of the fact that it\u2019s hard to predict. But our overall arching goal is to getting our operating margins is down to the mid-60s and that\u2019s the longer-term guidance that we have, but so there\u2019s no change in guidance from that perspective.","Cleo Zagrean \u2013 Macquarie Capital","","Thank you very much.","Michael J. Ward","Thank you. Thank you everyone. We\u2019ll see you again next quarter.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call.

As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. During this call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode.","For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. David Baggs, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations Officer for CSX Corporation.","David Baggs","Thank you, Prima, and good morning, everyone and again welcome to CSX Corporation\u2019s second quarter 2016 earnings presentation. The presentation material that we\u2019ll be reviewing this morning along with our expanded quarterly financial report and our safety and service measurements, are available on our website at CSX.com under the Investor section. In addition, following the presentation, the webcast replay will be available on that same website.","This morning, our presentation will be led by Michael Ward, the Company\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Frank Lonegro, our Chief Financial Officer. In addition, Cindy Sanborn, our Chief Operating Officer; and Fredrik Eliasson, our Chief Sales and Marketing Officer will be available during the question-and-answer session.","Now, before I turn the presentation over to Michael, let me remind everyone that the presentation and other statements made by the company contain forward-looking statements. You are encouraged to review the company\u2019s disclosure and the accompanying presentation on Slide Two. The disclosure identifies forward-looking statements, as well as the uncertainties and risks that could cause actual performance to differ materially from the results anticipated by these statements. In addition, at the end of the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session with the research analysts.","With nearly 30 analysts covering CSX and out of respect for everyone\u2019s time, including our investors, I would ask as a courtesy for you to please limit your inquiries to one question and if necessary, a clarifying question on the same topic.","And with that, let me turn the presentation over to CSX Corporation\u2019s Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Michael Ward. Michael?","Michael Ward","Well thank you David. Good morning everyone. Yesterday CSX reported second quarter earnings per share of $0.47, compared to $0.56 per share in the same period last year. Revenue declined 12% in the quarter; a strong pricing across nearly all markets, was more than offset by the impact of a 9% volume decline, which included a 34% decline in coal, as well as negative mix and lower fuel recovery.","Regarding operating performance CSX continued to deliver strong safety performance and service continued to meet and exceed customer expectations and drive further efficiency.","In the quarter CSX continued to aggressively and successfully reduce its cost structure throughout the network, recognizing that this company's long term future is built on a fluid and efficient network, serving primarily intermodal and merchandized markets.","Despite these cost saving actions, operating income declined a $177 million to $840 million. At the same time, the operating ratio increased 210 basis points year-over-year to 68.9%.","Now I\u2019ll turn the presentation over to Frank, who will take us through the second quarter results and third quarter outlook in more detail. Frank?","Frank Lonegro","Thank you, Michael and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by providing more detail on our second quarter results.","As Michael mentioned, revenue was down 12% or $360 million versus the prior year, driven primarily by lower volumes. Total volume decreased 9%, which impacted revenue by about $260 million.","In addition, fuel recoveries declined $98 million. We continue to see strong coal pricing from an improving service product, which for the second quarter was up 2.9% overall and 4.0% excluding coal. However this was partially offset by negative business mix in the quarter.","Other revenue decreased $29 million, driven mainly by lower incidental charges and coal related revenue from affiliate railroads. Expenses decreased 9% versus the prior year, driven mainly by $96 million in efficiency gains, $86 million in lower volume related cost and $56 million in lower fuel prices. Operating income was $840 million in the second quarter, down 17% versus the prior year.","Looking below the line, interest expense was up slightly from last year with higher debt levels partially offset by lower rates, while other income was relatively flat to the prior year. And finally income taxes were $262 million in the quarter with an effective tax rate of about 37%. Overall, net earnings were $445 million, down 20% versus the prior year, and EPS was $0.47 per share down 16% versus last year.","Now let me turn to the market outlook for the third quarter. Looking forward we expect year-over-year volumes to decline in the third quarter, in the mid to high single digit range. Despite some markets growing, the majority of our markets will be down with the most significant declines continuing to be concentrated in coal and crude oil.","Automotive is again expected to grow, as light vehicle production remains higher on a year-over-year basis. Minerals volume will be higher with a continued ramp up of the new fly ash remediation business and ongoing strength in construction, which drives demand for aggregates.","Agricultural products are expected to decline as the strong dollar and low commodity prices continue to pressure, both domestic and export shipments. Chemicals will be down due to the continued declines in share related products resulting from low crude oil and natural gas prices. We expect crude oil volume to be moderately lower on a sequential basis.","Domestic coal will continue to be unfavorably impacted by an excess supply of natural gas at a price point that favors gas burn over coal in the East. In addition coal inventories remain high and year-over-year volume declines will continue to be significant although less severe than the second quarter due to softer comps in the back half of 2015.","Export coal should be moderately lower in the second half of the year from the first half tonnage run rate, consistent with the seasonality we have seen in recent years. Despite modest improvements in the met and thermal benchmarks, the export market will remain pressured by the strong U.S. dollar and global over supply.","That said, we saw more spot moves than anticipated in the second quarter. As such, we now expect full year export coal tonnage of around 20 million tons. For the total coal market, we continue to expect full year tonnage declines of around 25% with third quarter coal tonnage roughly stable sequentially to what we've seen in the first half of this year or approximately 22 million to 23 million tons in the quarter.","Intermodal is expected to be down, as we continue to cycle prior competitive losses in international through the remainder of 2016. Domestic intermodal is anticipated to be roughly flat in light of difficult comps that reflected new business shifting to CSX in the third quarter of last year.","Overall our business continues to reflect a market environment driven by low crude oil, natural gas and broader commodity prices as well as continued strength in the U.S. dollar.","Turning to the next slide, let me talk about our expectations for expenses in the third quarter. Since last quarter, we've taken aggressive cost action which includes reducing headcount by about 4,500 versus the prior year. As a result, we have achieved about $230 million of efficiency gains in the first half of 2016 and now expect full year productivity savings to approach $350 million.","We expect third quarter expense to benefit on a year-over-year basis from our ongoing focus on driving efficiency gains and rightsizing resources. Looking first at labor and fringe, we expect third quarter average headcount to be down slightly on a sequential basis. In addition we expect labor inflation to be around $30 million in the third quarter.","Finally we expect a headwind in the third quarter of $25 million to $30 million versus the prior year driven by higher incentive compensation. As a reminder, in 2015 we saw incentive compensation decrease in the second half of the year as market conditions drove CSXs financial results below our initial plan.","Looking in MS&O expense, we expect efficiency gains and volume related savings to more than offset inflation. As a result MS&O costs are expected to be down moderately versus the prior year. Fuel expense in the third quarter will be driven by lower cost per gallon year-over-year reflecting the current price environment; volume related savings and continued focus on fuel efficiency.","We expect deprecation in the third quarter to increase around $20 million versus the prior year, reflecting the ongoing investment in the business. Finally, equipment and other rents in the third quarter are expected to be relatively flat to the prior year with a benefit of improved car cycle times offsetting higher freight car rates and the increase in volume related cost associated with automotive growth.","Now let me wrap up on the next slide. CSXs second quarter results reflect success in a challenging freight environment with macroeconomic and coal headwinds impacting most markets resulting in a 9% volume decline this quarter.","This success is driven by pricing for the relative value of rail service, driving efficiency gains and aligning resources to the softer demand environment, which partially offset those substantial volume headwinds.","Looking ahead, let me first provide an update on our 2016 capital investment. Project capital investment has increased $300 million from our initial plan as CSX now anticipates accelerating payments for locomotives delivered throughout 2016 under a long term commitment.","We originally intended to pay for these locomotives in 2017. As such 2016 capital investment is now expected to be $2.7 billion. By completing our locomotive purchase commitment this year we simultaneously clear the path in 2017, for CSX to begin returning to our long-term core capital investment guidance of around 16% to 17% of revenue.","As we think about market conditions for the remainder of the year, we expect macroeconomic and coal headwinds to continue, low commodity prices and strength in the U.S. dollar will continue to impact many of CSXs merchandised markets, while natural gas prices below $3.50 and elevated stock piles are driving significant headwinds in coal. As a result, we continue to expect total coal tonnage to decline around 25% for the full year.","Looking at our expectations for the third quarter and full year, we remain intensively focused on achieving strong pricing that reflects the value of CSXs service product, right sizing resources with lower demand and pursuing structural cost opportunities across the network. As a result of these initiatives we now expect efficiency gains to approach $350 million in 2016.","That said the impact of current market conditions on CSX's volume particularly in coal is expected to outweigh our positive momentum. As a result, we continue to expect third quarter and full year 2016 earnings per share to be down from last year. Furthermore as a reminder, third quarter EPS is typically down sequentially from second quarter results reflecting the seasonality of our business.","With that, let me turn the presentation back to Michael for his closing remarks.","Michael Ward","Thank you. As Frank discussed, it's clear this continues to be a challenging freight environment with plenty of macroeconomic headwinds. Thanks to the extraordinary work of our employees, CSX is delivering record levels of efficiency and rightsizing resources to the business demand of today.","Looking longer term, the company has a bright future as the men and women of CSX are simultaneously positioning the company for growth, where we have the resource flexibility to serve future demand. This will position CSX to maximize long-term opportunities in both our merchandize and intermodal markets.","As a result, we continue to be enthusiastic about the core earning power of the company as the market headwinds subside. As we work to transform this company into the CSX of tomorrow, we must grow and make more profitable the merchandize and intermodal markets, which represent our future.","At the same time we will continue to preserve the business value of coal, recognizing that it will become a smaller but still important part of our company.","Our future evolves leveraging a premier highly efficient network that reaches diverse merchandize and intermodal markets and nearly two thirds of the American consumers. It requires consistent excellent service for customers, which in turn supports efficiency, profitable growth and pricing that allows us to continue investing for the future and includes technology solutions to drive an ever more safe, reliable and efficient railroad.","As we manage today's business environment to deliver on the future potential, we continue to focus on achieving a mid 60s operating ratio longer term to deliver compelling value for you, our shareholders.","And now, we\u2019re pleased to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Rob Salmon of Deutsche Bank. Sir your line is now open.","Frank Lonegro","Good morning, Rob.","Rob Salmon","Hey good morning and thanks for taking the question. Frank, I think on the last call you had indicated that with regard to the earnings cadence, you thought the decline in Q2 would be the largest for the year.","As I think out to the back half of the year, with the puts and takes of holding a little bit stronger than what you had anticipated in Q2 cost actions being a little bit more, how should I think about that earnings cadence as I look out?","Frank Lonegro","Yes, I think as we look at Q3 earnings on a year-over-year basis, we had mentioned that they will be down. We haven\u2019t sized that as you know. We've got a challenging market environment that I know Fredrik will get into later in the call impacting the top line.","There are comps that begin to ease as we get into the back half of the year. Although as we mentioned, volumes in the third quarter will be down mid-to-high single digits, with crude down international intermodal losses in the coal as we mentioned on a year-over-year basis down as well.","So we got some negative mix and as moderating productivity as we get throughout the year, obviously we've delivered about 230 million in productivity in the first half and that implies a certainly moderating productivity level as you get into the Q3 and Q4 and then we try to give you some clarity in the third quarter remarks about where incentive comp might be and certainly with fuel prices where they're going and cycling some of the fuel positives that we had in the third quarter of last year, we're going to have a net fuel headwind as well.","So we've got some challenges looking ahead of us in the third quarter, but as I\u2019m sure Cindy will mention later in the call, everything is on the table on the productivity side and pricing continues to be favorable given the environment.","Rob Salmon","When I think about the mix that feels like it will be little bit less in the third quarter. Fuel is probably going to be little bit tougher. Do those two net out or does fuel overwhelm the mix?","Frank Lonegro","Well, let me hit the fuel and then particularly hit the mix one. So when you look at fuel, we had about a $7 million in-quarter challenge in the second quarter. You would anticipate given where the forward curves are, that the in-quarter challenge will likely be a little bit more difficult sequentially and then given the fact that we\u2019re cycling about a $20 million favorable in the third quarter of last year, you're looking at a pretty big obstacle there.","Rob Salmon","Got it.","Michael Ward","In terms of the mix, I will say that obviously we're going to continue to have the overarching exchange between coal gone away and we're growing intermodal. We have indicated that we do think things will moderate in terms of overall volume decline as we move throughout the year.","However, third quarter is still going to be a challenging quarter and frankly, so will fourth quarter, but we do expect things to improve from a volume perspective as we move throughout the second half of the year.","Rob Salmon","Appreciate your time guys and I\u2019m sure someone also hit on the efficiencies, but congrats on a good quarter.","Michael Ward","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is now open.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Ravi.","Ravi Shanker","Thanks. Good morning everyone. So I will hit on the efficiency, so obviously a pretty impressive phase so far this year. I am not surprised that you raised that target of $350 million. This then raised the natural correction as to what innings we're in with the productivity gains here. So just how deep is that well that you can grow from?","Cindy Sanborn","Good morning. This is Cindy. I'll respond to that one. I'll tell you when we think about productivity, we\u2019ve generated some in our network performance as you\u2019ve seen our service measurements improve. We think about it structurally and streamlining and process within incentives. So those are the main categories that we look at.","When we look at what we\u2019ve done so far, clearly we're lapping some of the big initiatives that we took late in 2015 and earlier this year, but we see -- we have a very long initiative base. We pulled some of those forward, but I think when we look out to the future, I think we\u2019ll continue to drive results both in the back half of the year as Fredrick has -- as Frank has talked about. It will be a little bit less in terms of quarterly numbers, but it's going to be better than what we traditionally do on a quarterly basis.","And as I look into 2017, I think we will able to overcome inflation and I think a big part of what is going to help us to do that is our CSX of Tomorrow initiatives around the network as well as automation and technology is going to allow us to continue to drive productivity and I would also want to mention that the actions that we're taking are not reactions.","They are actual actions that are driving our decision making relative to our coal portfolio getting much smaller and the importance of providing a safe and reliable service product in the merchandize and intermodal portions of our business.","And that is part of our core CSX of Tomorrow strategy and we're executing on that and it well help us to be both service sensitive, more service sensitive company as well as a more efficient company.","Ravi Shanker","Got it. So just to clarify, the run rate that you expect to see for the second half of this year, is that a run rate to think of going into '17?","Frank Lonegro","Hey, Ravi its, Frank. I think what the numbers would imply in the second half would be about $60 million a quarter. It never works out perfectly as you know, but that\u2019s a general run rate in the second half of the year.","As we get closure to the end of the year, we'll be able to give you a little bit more guidance on 2017, but like Cindy mentioned and I'll reiterate, our goal is always to offset inflation with productivity and depending on how those numbers play out as you get into forecasting next year\u2019s inflation numbers, you should see us have confidence in our ability to continue to do that in 2017.","Ravi Shanker","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch. Sir, your line is now open.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Hoexter","Hey, good morning. Just wanted to follow up on Frank\u2019s comment on the increasing CapEx and accelerating locomotives purchasing, just wondering why you're accelerating the CapEx? Did you get better pricing on equipment and does that change your thoughts on cash flow buybacks and use of capital as we move forward?","Michael Ward","Hey Ken, honestly it was the avoidance of seller financing charges that we would have incurred if we had stuck with the original deal to pay off the engines next year. So, it\u2019s just a timing over a couple of months. No impact on cash flow. It\u2019s kind of a one-time thing switch between 2017 and 2016.","Ken Hoexter","So it\u2019s not a commentary on what you thought on pace of volumes or anything else, just financing to accelerate in a declining volume environment.","Michael Ward","Well, we either pay the financing charges or avoid them by pulling it forward and as Cindy is mentioning, every dollar is on the table and that seems like a good way to save a little bit of money as we look forward into 2017.","Ken Hoexter","All right. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Brandon.","Brandon Oglenski","Good morning, everyone. So I want to follow-up on Ken\u2019s question on CapEx. So you talked about the ability in 2017 to get back towards a core investment around 16% to 17% of revenue, but I\u2019m assuming that excludes spending on things like PTCs.","So, you might not be willing to tell us right now what you think the non-core items might be in '17, but may be if you could give us some context on what non-core investment has been for the past couple of years?","Michael Ward","Sure. So the only thing that we exclude from core investment is positive train control. If you look at what we're doing this year, our all-in number of 2.7 has the $300 million increase for the engines that I just mentioned.","It has $300 million for positive train control, which gets you down to the $2.1 billion of core capital that we had started the year talking about and as you might remember, that was a decline of over $100 million in core capital from 2015.","You will continue to see us focus hard on core capital and making sure that we\u2019re making the right decisions in terms of infrastructure, equipment and return seeking investments. As you think about PTC going into 2017, that number should decline some from the levels that you see here in 2016 and should step down a little bit and then again between '17 and '18 as we set our sights toward being compliant with the FRAs and Congress\u2019s mandate that would be hardware complete by the end of 2018.","And then it should let down even further between '17, excuse me, '18 and '19 and then hopefully all of that will go away as we get to full implementation in 2020 and then you won\u2019t see us carry a positive train control CapEx line after that. It will just become embedded within the broader capital plan.","Brandon Oglenski","Okay. I appreciate that.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Brian Ossenbeck of JPMorgan Chase. Your line is now open.","Frank Lonegro","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Ossenbeck","Hey good morning, thanks for taking my question. So if you can just give us an update on the CCX projects. Can you talk about CapEx, what type of CapEx you\u2019re expecting there? Is that something we can do public-private partnership and how close are you to stripping out and finding a site for that investment?","Michael Ward","Yes this is Michael, we're really excited about the CCX opportunity. We're finding that we\u2019re getting great cooperation from the state and local officials. We're very encouraged that we will be able to work cooperatively with them.","As you mentioned it's a public-private partnership with the State providing back half of the funds. Us providing other half of the funds and we think it's going to be a tremendous economic development opportunity for the State of North Carolina and we're very excited about the progress we're making on it. The exact location hasn\u2019t been finally determined at this point, but we're continuing to make good progress.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay. Could you just remind me of the timing and the size of the extent it's going to be chasing?","Michael Ward","It's going to be roughly $150 million or ours, which is part of the long-term capital plan that Frank evaluated and the State is putting up close to a similar amount for the facility.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay. Thanks for the time.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Allison.","Allison Landry","Good morning, thanks. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the mix during the quarter, in particular it looks like maybe there was some positive mix within the coal segment. So just wanted to see if you could help us understand if that was on the domestic side or export, what drove that and is that something we should expect to persist in the third quarter?","Michael Ward","Yes, so Allison on the coal RPU specifically, we did have some positive mix. Obviously we also had the help of fixed variable contract and continued pricing on the domestic side. Offsetting that is of course fuel surcharge revenue coming down and then the actions that we've taken on the export coal market.","I do think that it changes quarter-by-quarter, but it is a sustainable level and there will be quarters when it will be up and there will be quarters when it will down. The focus on our part is to make sure that we continue to do core pricing appropriately and then let fuel and mix fall where it was going to fall.","Allison Landry","Okay. And were there any contracts on the domestic side that came up for renewal in the second quarter that maybe boosted that a little bit?","Michael Ward","Nothing specific that we have about a quarter, 20% to 25% of our contract coming up here by the end of the year, but nothing specifically here in the second quarter that would have changed RPU number.","Allison Landry","Okay. Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Your line is now open.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Chris.","Chris Wetherbee","Good morning, guys. Wanted to follow-up on the CapEx side and just kind of talk a little bit about locomotive spend. So you pulled some forward into 2016, how should we think about the change in locomotive spend as we go into 2017 and 2018?","Michael Ward","Sure. So if you take just a year or two view of that and you look at where we are from a locomotive storage perspective, we got about 350 engines in storage and then as you look towards the back half of the year as Cindy gets the deliveries of about 60, 65 of the remaining engines from the purchase commitment that we had started in 2014, I think you should expect in the volume environment that will continue to store engines through that period.","As you look forward in the '17 and '18 assuming volumes stay essentially where they are, I doubt you would see us in the market for new locomotives. At the same time we do believe that continuing to reinvest in our four axle, so our yard and switcher engines, is the long-term right thing to do.","So you might see a little bit of capital going toward rebuilding the four actual engines, but again no -- probably no big purchases in that time period. Cindy, anything you want to do add to that?","Cindy Sanborn","No I would say, as we as we look ahead in the engines that we have stored, the 350 that Frank mentioned are readily able to brought back to service if we need them. In addition to that, we have as we take locomotives out this year, some have gone into recommended retire status, which would not be in our store count. So when you look at GTM is down about 10%, our active fleet is also down about 10% and going forward, I would echo Frank's comments.","Chris Wetherbee","So is that the right way to think about it on a GTM basis? I guess it's a tough question because of mix, but when you think about potential volume growth, how much weight and capacity you have on the locomotive side for the next year or two? Is it roughly 10% when you think about it in GTM terms?","Cindy Sanborn","When I think about it, GTMs is how we think about our workload demands, but we're obviously cycling a very different type of commodity mix with coal being reduced in lesser GTM intensive business growing hopefully.","So we will look at GTMs in terms of workload, but when I think about what's available to bring back it's really and what's in our store status not in the total that we have taken out this year, we're going to recommend to retire some of the locomotives that are -- that we've taken out this year and there's also leases that we've returned to I might add.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay. So probably a little less than that number, I guess ultimately is what you're saying.","Cindy Sanborn","Less than 10% is what's available to bring back.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much for the time.","Operator","Thank you. Then next question comes from Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Your line is now open.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Tom.","Tom Wadewitz","Hey, good morning. Wanted to ask a question I think it's for Frederick it\u2019s on the domestic intermodal side, you guys have done a good job of realizing volume growth despite a difficult market, difficult backdrop in truck.","I think you were up 5% in second quarter domestic intermodal, but then you\u2019re saying flat in third. Is that just the kind of impact from that one contract or is there some slowing that you're seeing in the market. I just wondered if you could talk on that domestic intermodal a bit, thanks.","Michael Ward","Sure Tom. Really is impact from the fact that last year in the third quarter we had a significant ramp-up in our domestic intermodal business and as we move in here to the third quarter, we're going to start laughing that which is going to make the volume compares a lot more difficult than it's been in the first part of the year and that's really the key driver.","The market out there is obviously continues to be challenged with a fair amount of excess capacity. From our perspective though, the intermodal store is broader than that and we continue to have good success in converting traffic off from the highway and partnership with the trucking industry. And we also continue to get some pricing even in this tough environment, which is bodes well for the long term.","Tom Wadewitz","Do you have any thought on inventories and whether high inventories are coming down somewhat or is that still an issue this year from shippers?","Fredrik Eliasson","Inventory is still at the high level, has been a sequential decline just a little bit, but it's still high versus historical basis. So that\u2019s certainly impacting the international part of our intermodal business more perhaps than it does on the domestic side, which is also why you're seeing the steamship line continuing to struggle quite significant than demand on that side is very week at the moment.","Tom Wadewitz","Right. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Jeff Kauffman of Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff Kauffman","Hey good morning Mike. Congratulations. ","Michael Ward","Thank you.","Jeff Kauffman","Question for Frank. Frank there's been a lot asked about the CapEx and I understand what you're doing locomotive CapEx, but that is going to create a little bit more of a cash shortfall since it's just really borrowing from '17, do we fund that shortfall with debt and continue repurchasing shares at these levels or do we focus on maintaining cash and maybe slow the repurchase until the cash flow gets a little bigger next year?","Frank Lonegro","Hey thanks, Jeff. In terms of the buybacks, you know we're in the midst of the two year $2 billion program that we announced in April of last year you've seen us essentially ratably buy throughout the period about a $1.2 that we\u2019ve repurchased so far throughout that program, about $800 million or so left.","I think absent a recession you should see us continue to do that ratably from now through the end of the first quarter of next year and then revaluate where we are from a cash and a ratings perspective as well as with a forward view of earnings might be at that time.","Jeff Kauffman","Okay. Thank you. And one detail follow-up, you never mentioned, what are coal inventory days in your northern and southern service regions?","Michael Ward","Sure. So right now where we are, we are in the south and we use an external source for this. We're at about 98 days on forward burn in the south and about 71 in the north and just to give you kind of the average benchmark, I think we\u2019ve in the past in the south we expect average to be about 70 and in the north 55. So whether you look at days burn or tons, we're up about 5% year-over-year using that same source.","So we\u2019re still at a pretty elevated level as we sit here today. Clearly the warm weather is helping, but it's highly unlikely that by the end of the year we\u2019ll get to normalized level is our best prediction at this point.","Jeff Kauffman","Okay. Thank you everyone.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Group","Hey thanks. Good morning, guys. So wanted to ask one more on the CapEx. If we are not buying locomotives for a few years and PTP spending is starting to come down, it sounds like given volumes that maybe growth CapEx in general should be coming down.","I would think that there is an opportunity to cut the CapEx below that historical 16% to 17% of revenue and then you guys can really get a good free cash flow story going which I think would probably help the multiple here. How do you think about that and is that a realistic opportunity?","Frank Lonegro","Hey, Scott its Frank. Certainly we\u2019re in our planning process for 2017. It's really too early for us comment on what we think next year's core CapEx is going to be. I think what\u2019s you\u2019re hearing us say is that we're committed to returning to that about 16% to 17% of revenue from a CapEx perspective within that and any given year there is going to be differences between how much is in infrastructure, how much is an equipment, how much is an return seeking investments.","And as I think I've mentioned in the conferences back in June, we\u2019re also committed to making sure that the CSXs tomorrow initiatives are part of that capital guidance. So, it\u2019s not something that you\u2019re going to see as take that guidance.","Because of the CSXs tomorrow initiative, we're going to take all the right tradeoffs within that framework in order to be able to deliver on the CSX of tomorrow, which is a very important part of our future as Michael mentioned in his remarks.","Scott Group","Yeah, I guess I\u2019m just saying if historical that 16% to 17% of revenue historically has included locomotive, so if we\u2019re not buying as many locomotives, I would think that there is an opportunity to get close at historical level or is that realistic or are using not?","Michael Ward","I\u2019m not commenting one way or another to be honest Scott. I\u2019m telling that we'll give you some guidance on 2017 as we get closer to the end of the year and then as we begin to talk about the CSXs of tomorrow and the associated financial parameters of that, we'll give you some guidance longer term.","Scott Group","Okay. And then if I can just ask one more just kind of detailed question. Just on coal, can you give us the mix of your coal by basin App coal, Illinois and PRB and where do you see the switching points?","Fredrik Eliasson","Sure so, here in the second quarter, we saw an increase in our basin coal off to about 37% of our overall utility portfolio and really that\u2019s what's relevant I think just looking at the utility portfolio. So 37% thereabout for Illinois, PRB about 20%.","So we had about 57% of our coal was at Illinois basin or part of the basin and the rest was Appalachia and that is up little bit from what we saw in the first quarter and frankly we expect Illinois Basin to continue to do well longer term as part of our utility mix.","Michael Ward","Thank you, Scott.","Scott Group","Thank you guys.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Jason Seidl of Cowen. Your line is now open.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Jason.","Jason Seidl","Good morning, Michael. Good morning, team. I wanted to focus a little bit on the mineral line, obviously the new fly ash contract is ramping up and that\u2019s distorting the yields a little bit here. How should we look at yields going forward for the remainder of the year as the contract ramps up.","Michael Ward","Are you talking about yields overall or specifically in minerals?","Jason Seidl","Specifically in minerals.","Michael Ward","I think overall it\u2019s -- I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see a much different picture in terms of the yields. Clearly the fly ash is a big initiative on our side. We're also seeing strength in other parts of our minerals business, but I don\u2019t think you -- that that RPU is significantly different than any other part of our minerals business. So I think those drivers are similar within the other parts of that portfolio as well.","Jason Seidl","Okay. And just a follow-up question on coal, you guys talked about being 98 days in the South, 71 days in the North, how should we think about earning that through? If we get a normalized summer and a normal winter, at what point are we going to get back to those levels you talked about 70 in the South and 55 in the North?","Michael Ward","Well most of the external sources we use and all the discussions with utilities would indicate on average that we'll get there sometime in 2017 hopefully in the first half of 2017.","Clearly as I said earlier, this summer is helping. Clearly there are utilities that are below where they want to be and frankly we have seen additional calls here over the last month or so and that\u2019s a pretty low bar because the phone certainly wasn\u2019t ringing and for several months.","But it is helping, but you have some of our utilities that we serve have an awful lot of coal on the ground at this point and it\u2019s going to take more than just really hot summer to get it back to where it needs on average.","Jason Seidl","And so as we think about coal for next year, I\u2019m assuming we should think at least the first half should be still continued to be pressured?","Fredrik Eliasson","I think that there is a high likelihood of that. As I said, we will have a much better feel for that as we get through here the summer to see where we end up usually not just in coal, but in all of our markets we go out and really work closely with our customers to get a sense of what the plan for '17 should look like.","And at that point as we get into third quarter definitely the fourth quarter is initially is we have a much better sense of what we are, but overall I think it\u2019s important to say two things. One what is happening here right now in coal in terms of the hot weather and the fact that natural gas prices have recovered a little bit, is really more of an impact for '17 than it is short term in '16.","And then I think it\u2019s also important and we\u2019re probably the most vocal on this, from our perspective right now, we're planning for a secular decline in our coal business, we would love to be wrong about that, but in terms of how we approached our business and how we approach our planning, we continue to see a secular decline. Doesn\u2019t mean that you can have a year or so where it goes up, but overall we think that the trend is pretty clear where it's heading.","Jason Seidl","Fredrik that\u2019s fantastic color. Listen Fredrik, Michael, team I appreciate the time as always.","Michael Ward","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Ben Hartford of Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Ben.","Ben Hartford","Hey, good morning, guys. Cindy just some perspective on current service levels, pick your measure whether it's real time or velocity, are those measures have somewhat stagnated over the past few quarters still above 2013's peak level.","Any thought or hope of being able to return those measures back to 2013 levels or should we for the time being kind of ignore what you\u2019re able to do in '13 and look for improvement, but the likelihood of returning those levels, I would be interested in any perspective there?","Cindy Sanborn","Great, well Ben we've improved our service levels both sequentially and year-over-year as you can see from the charts. We were actually a little ahead of where we have planned to be for this year and obviously improved network performance does provide some efficiency gains for us and we are committed to provide a service product that meets or exceeds our customer's expectations, helps for price for the value of the service that we provide.","We have to balance that always with some efficiency initiatives and I think we\u2019re doing that. I think we're pretty happy with where we are, where there is always opportunity to improve and we will do that.","I think I have also highlighted before and you've probably heard Frank talk about it before where we have installed our train link initiatives that is more problematic for us in terms of the velocity let's say is on the southern part of our network, which is mostly single track.","So we think that's the right mix. We've made the right decision there. We're seeing over time down, re-cruise down and other measures that give us confidence that we're improving, but it's I think we're pleased with where we are and we will work to improve and Frank\u2026","Frank Lonegro","Yeah, let me just speak from a sales and marketing perspective. I would say that the efforts here this year has been to really focus on the most service sensitive part of our business specifically intermodal businesses to drive that service up and that's where we made those gains and it is markedly different and it's really helping our pricing efforts.","Also one of the key things for us is to reduce the spend around the mean and that is also improving significantly because there's also as we look at a broader portfolio it is about being able to be there each and every day at a reliable way. Our local service has improved significantly as well and really as we look at the customer facing measurements, not so much the measurements that you're seeing in terms of what we disclosed certainly has improved significant as well.","So from our perspective, I think we're making the right tradeoffs between productivity and service and as Cindy said on the productivity side, we\u2019ve never done and the same thing holds true on the service side. We always want to do better for our customers and I think we're seeing that cooperation from operations and we feel very good about where we are.","Ben Hartford","Okay. That makes sense. So from the metrics that we can see, that 2013 high watermark, are those targets that are credible, do you feel like that you can get back those levels over time and potentially exceed them?","Cindy Sanborn","I think everything is on the table, in terms of the pace and cadence at which we may get there, it's probably a longer term type of aspiration. But again there's nothing that we're satisfied with. I'm not satisfied with the service measurements nor the efficiencies and we will continue to work on both, but I think that's a longer term initiative.","Ben Hartford","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Cherilyn Radbourne of TD Securities. Your line is now open. ","Michael Ward","Good morning, Cherilyn.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Thanks very much and good morning. I wanted to ask a question on productivity, which I think was a highlight again this quarter and you always do a very good job of disclosing productivity versus the volume related cost reduction. I just wondered if you could talk about the rigor with which you track that internally and make sure that you're holding people accountable.","Frank Lonegro","Hi Cherilyn it\u2019s Frank and absolutely we have a lot of rigor within finance organization, which in some respects is the score keeper here. What we do in terms of tracking productivity, we make sure that we normalize for volume first.","So to the extent that there are volume variable expenses then those don't count for productivity and what you've seen this year is that in the first half for about $150 million of what we call right sizing or volume variable cost reductions and then $230 million of structural cost efficiencies, there is a lot of accountability around productivity and again that is the way that we take costs out long term.","Let me give you just a simplistic example that may help illustrate it so that coal, just because coal volume have come down, so if a coal train ran last year, but doesn't run this year then the cost associated with locomotives and crews and fuel and car costs would come out of volume variable expenses and so you would hear us talk about those in terms of right sizing.","Yes, for example and we have instances of this where you have two coal trains than ran last year and this year through the train length initiative and network routing we've actually put those two trains together and run in 200 car trains to 100 car trains, the efficiencies associated with less locomotive intensity crew intensity, fuel intensity etcetera would be allocated toward productivity.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Great, that's helpful. Thank you. That\u2019s all for me.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from David Vernon of Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Michael Ward","Good morning, David.","David Vernon","Great, thanks for taking the question. Frank, this is kind of a great set up to what I wanted to ask you in terms of the size of the absolute productivity number. As we've gone through the year, it does seem like that number is growing at the same time that our expectations for forward volume are getting worse.","Is it right to believe that you guys are finding more opportunities to drive that productivity because there's less traffic on the network and then that productivity pool is kind of expanding in relation to the volume decline, that\u2019s kind of the first question I wanted to ask you.","Michael Ward","I think what you'll see us do in a environmental like this where we realized that the revenue portfolio is in transition and the volume especially on the coal sides coming down as we turn over every rock, and you heard Cindy talk a lot about all the things that she is doing on the operating side, and not to the exclusion of the G&A side.","The G&A side every department is also looking for ways, the challenge every cost dollar. So, I think what you are seeing is really an across the board focus in our company to be disciplined on cost.","We've always been disciplined on cost. We\u2019ve always tried to offset inflation with productivity but just given where we know the business is going we\u2019re really looking at the structural things in a way to reduce the overall cost intensity of the business.","And when volumes inflect positively obviously, we will be able to grow with that both on the earnings and the margin side and to the extent the growth comes in, you know the batch merchandized business or the intermodal business or the automotive business, you should see us grow with - of the incremental margin.","So, I think what you are seeing is the company focused on cost given the environment.","David Vernon","I guess the second part of the question is as you are taking that in your example the two 100 car trains and making a 200 car train, I guess when volume does inflect how do you think the cost structure will react? Do you think that the variable cost might go up and you should probably just shouldn't care because the contribution is so high? Or do you think you can actually sustain this lower level of variable unit cost that you've been able to engineer given the extra space on the network?","Michael Ward","Sure, it depends in large part on how the volumes come back and where the volumes come back. We have engineered a lot of flexibility into the network through the train life in variable scheduling initiatives that you heard us talk about. Again as I mentioned, if volumes come back in class traffic and part of the scheduled network, you should see us be able to grow volumes without adding back variable costs.","If the volumes come back in both traffic, where you're adding a new train start for a new bulk train, then you should see us bring that back but again that - the resource is back but again that would be a nice margin so, you would want us to do that.","David Vernon","That's kind of what it seems like. Well, those are my two. Thanks very much for the time.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from John Larkin of Stifel. Your line is now open.","John Larkin","Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to see how much granularity on the accelerated productivity targets you are willing to share with us. There are a lot of initiatives obviously underway, coal network rationalization, longer trains, closing down some excess facilities, eliminating duplicate overhead, all of those are very admirable initiatives.","Are there any two or three of those that have really been the primary reason why you've almost achieved your entire former productivity target in the first six months that had originally been established for the entire year?","Cindy Sanborn","John, I think some of the \u2013 what we've been able to do is put a serious of initiatives together mostly structural with the closure of facilities like late year in the coal network and moving forward into this year where we also closed Russell Yard, and also consolidated our Huntington division headquarters.","But it's not just in the coal space. We\u2019ve also announced publically and probably right it where we\u2019ve consolidated facilities and set in Central Florida with Winston Yard in Tampa, a consolidation actually in Tampa and also streamlining on mechanical facilities and shops that are aligned more with our outer triangle in the core network that we have.","Our job is to really become less resource intensive so between train length and so the density of the train, as well as the density of the - the route that we route the train has also allowed us significant savings across the board.","So I think there is really no one thing, I think that we\u2019ve accelerated that \u2013 we\u2019ve really answered your question but we are able - as we\u2019re able to put initiatives in places we are doing so and continuously looking for more. We have great momentum here, everyone is over delivering and I think, technologies are big help for us and also some of are working with the labor organization is also a big help for us.","John Larkin","Thank you for that very detailed answer. And then maybe has a follow-on, I understand there's a fairly big initiative internally given that intermodal is going to be a bigger part of the puzzle going forward to make intermodal more consistently profitable going forward.","And it occurs to me that some of the initiatives to achieve that goal come from the marketing side. And I was wondering if Fredrik could talk about some of the initiatives that perhaps sales and marketing has underway within intermodal to normalize the volume so that you are running full trains every day of the week every week of the year. That's an obviously very difficult mountain to climb, but can you talk a little bit about what you are doing there perhaps in working with third parties to fill all the trains up every day to really leverage that productivity?","Fredrik Eliasson","Yes, there is a variety of things there that we all working on there, that's absolutely right John and some of them are - I think at this point ready for public consumption, some of them are not but overall you're absolutely right, in an environment where the RPU is so much lower, one of the key things that you can do to drive up margins is to make sure that you have a much more leveled workload and the team is certainly working on that and thinking through how we can do that longer term that is a pretty significant structural change.","In the meantime what we are doing do is work on terminal productivity. We have a variety of initiatives in place there that has deal that are lot of results here. We continue to work on train lengths in our intermodal space to make sure just as we do elsewhere in our business to allow for the leverage that occurs there. Of course double stack clearance is important and you know we already - we didn't have any tunnel by the end of this year, we should be able to be double stack clear there as well.","And then the hub and spoke strategy that we have lined out for all of you for a long time has allowed for a significant amount of efficiency being able to penetrate some of these smaller markets with the lot more density that we otherwise could and of course overall speed of the network itself which I alluded to before which has been a priority as we think about the service improvement there in 2016 because the turn time on the equipment is critical.","And then to your point and then there is little more longer-term, how do you structurally ensure that the day or the weak balancing as a little bit better than what it is today but that is I think a little bit longer term initiative from our perspective.","John Larkin","Got it. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Bascome Majors of Susquehanna. Your line is now open.","Bascome Majors","Good morning. We talk a lot about rising competition and its impact on intermodal but I wanted to focus on how it's hit your carload merchandise business. Do you have a sense of how much share loss to truck has been a drag on overall volumes and I guess, more importantly, when you begin to cycle the worse of that drug on what's called a year-over-year basis?","Michael Ward","You know one of the key things that we are focused on right now within our sales and marketing team is to sell through this cycle of excess capacity and there is excess capacity in the truck market and that is probably impacting our volume to some degree but one of the key things for us is to continue to be able to reinvest in our business and not necessarily chase that down too much, when we see these temporary changes because we do have to be able to be there for our customers day-in and day-out and that is one of the things that we sell with our customers that we got to work through the downturn that we\u2019re seeing right now and we want to be able to be there for you not just today but also tomorrow when capacity is tighter.","So we are seeing in certain other markets beyond intermodal where there has been probably some share loss to truck. We look at that each and every deal as the marketplace and we always try to estimate what the second best alternative is and try to match that. And in certain places where that is below what we think is long-term re-investible for us at that point we probably don't participate because we don\u2019t want to do anything unofficially.","The pricing level is critical with the service improvements that we have gotten here we have been able to sustain and allow customers to see the long-term value that access to our network provides but in certain places if we have seen some traffic or way back to truck.","Bascome Majors","Understood. And I just had a quick housekeeping one on one of your expense guidance items. On MS&O, it implies what you guided that it could be up as much as 10% sequentially from the second quarter in 3Q. Looking back it's been eight or nine years since we've seen a magnitude of that rise from Q2 to 3Q. Can you just give us a little color on what's driving that expectation, that big increase?","Frank Lonegro","Yes Bascome, it's Frank. I\u2019m not commenting on the numbers that you threw out there. As you know MS&O is awfully difficult to predict in any given year and in any given quarter I think what we said was it will be down moderately versus the prior year which does has some implications sequentially. I think what you\u2019re going to see is we had the timing item on the $10 million casualty reserves, so that's generally what we do in the second quarter, in the fourth quarter of each year we relook at the probability and severity of casualty.","And we had a favorable one time item you shouldn't think about that on a sequential basis in the third quarter and then in any given quarter again you have timing items and small onetime items that are going to impact the sequential comparisons. So I think you're directionally accurate although again not commenting on your numbers specifically.","Bascome Majors","Thank you for the time this morning.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Justin Long of Stephens. Your line is now open.","Q \u2013 Justin Long","Thanks, good morning. So I wanted to start by asking about the point to point pricing initiative in coal. Could you provide an update on how far along you are in that process, and do you think this will be a tailwind or a headwind to the core price numbers you're putting out today?","Fredrik Eliasson","So we have implemented the point to point pricing across our coal network. And overall I would say that process has gone very well. The reason for doing that is to make sure we better match to true cost of service some of the locations that are further away from so called our core routes to reflect a maintenance cost and operating cost that is associated with moving that.","I don't think that that will be material in any way shape perform to our same store sales measure. That is really is more about ensuring that as we try to rationalize the infrastructure in the coalfields, that we from the sales and marketing perspective help operations to do that by truly reflecting what it cost to move some coal from sort of the mines that are further away from some of our core routes. That's really all it's about is not, so much about the same store sales changing because of it. Even though I think overall I would say probably it's slightly helpful. ","Michael Ward","So Fred did you put in place on the tariffs that will take some time to go through all the contracts.","Fredrik Eliasson","That is correct as well. We've put it in place in terms of the tariffs, we adjusted one or two contracts, but it will probably take one or two or three years frankly to get it completely implemented across our whole book of business. ","Q \u2013 Justin Long","Got it. That's helpful and maybe as a quick follow-up, so the 4% increase in core price excluding coal is a pretty strong number in this environment. It's also above what we've seen from some of the other rails here to date. Do you think this level of price increases is sustainable as we get into the back half of the year or is there risk we see some moderation given truckload capacity is pretty loose right now?","Fredrik Eliasson","Well. So first of all a great testament to both what our sales and marketing team has done in this tough environment to your point about the strong results and also clearly a critical part of this has been the service improvements that we have seen. We don't really forecast what pricing will do over time. We will obviously disclose it each and every quarter in terms of our quarterly flash, but I think you know from my statements before on hand we know value accretion for CSX pricing is a critical component of that.","But I've also alluded to the fact that I think short term meaning for the next 12 months or so we see a period of excess capacity out there that certainly is impacting things but overall you have a chance to see it where it comes each and every quarter.","Justin Long","Okay. I'll leave it at that. Thanks so much for the time.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Donald Broughton of Avondale Partners. Your line is now open.","Donald Broughton","Good morning. Thank you for taking this call or the questions gentlemen. Help me think about this strategically or help me understand how you think. I understand how the strength of the U.S. dollar is affecting, negatively affecting ag exports and exports of other commodities. I understand why crude being under 70 is affecting negatively chemical volume and everything related to fracking and nat gas obviously under 4 is going to continue to be a headwind for coal.","So what's your crystal ball? Not that your crystal ball is any better than anyone else's but you have to have a plan, what do you plan? Do you expect the dollar to stay strong, crude to stay above under 70 and nat gas to stay under 4 for the foreseeable future? Is that your expectation or are you planning for the dollar to get weaker, for crude to go back up and nat gas to go back up?","Frank Lonegro","That's where the flexibility I think in our resource planning is critical because to your point earlier, there is a lot of crystal balls out there but I\u2019m not sure which crystal ball is better than the other, what we do as I said earlier, we do go out to our customers in the fall to tried to get a sense of what they're seeing in the different markets that we serve and then from there, we take their best input and triangulate with other things to put together our perspective on 2017.","And it is a very volatile marketplace right now where it's very hard to predict. We have laid out that overall from a coal perspective. We do think that there is a secular decline that we're heading towards and certainly we\u2019ve seen the vast majority of that already.","The U.S dollar it is impossible for me to sit here and predict with U.S dollar is probably much better than look at forward curve than me speculating on that but the key thing for us is that we continue to have flexibility in our resource planning and right now the best predictor of tomorrow's today, the dollar is strong and the locomotive prices are there so that\u2019s kind of how we approach there.","Michael Ward","Donald, what does your crystal ball say?","Donald Broughton","My crystal ball says is that crude is going to stay under 70 and nat gas is going to stay under 4 for the foreseeable future and that there's nothing to indicate that the dollar is going to get weaker anytime soon. But, again, whose crystal ball is better than the other? I just wondered what you are planning against. What is your best guess? Because obviously I understand you're triangulating your expectations to your customers but you have to have your own internal gauge as to where you are going, as well.","Fredrik Eliasson","And I think that goes back to the point of flexibility. It is so hard to plan these days but I think Cindy and team has done a fabulous job of really variablizing in our cost structure. We talked about that for a long time and then we do whatever we can to forecast even on a monthly basis and try to flow their around the network so we can make very timely changes to a network based on the best information we had but it's hard to see much beyond a month or three month at this point.","Donald Broughton","Very good, very fair. Thank you, gentlemen.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from John Barnes of RBC Capital. Your line is now open.","John Barnes","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Two things. One, you indicated that you saw more spot-load activity on coal volumes in the quarter. Fredrik, I think you alluded to a few more phone calls. Do you have a sense for how much volume moved in the quarter, was it on a spot basis versus on a normal contractual basis?","Fredrik Eliasson","On the export side?","John Barnes","Overall\u2026","Fredrik Eliasson","Overall, and as you well know in export side pretty much everything is spot these days. So also that to the great example of the previous question around the - things change very fast in terms of how much we move and then we did see a pick up on the export side in the second quarter beyond what we had originally anticipated which is why we increased the guidance on the export side to about $20 million tons for the year.","On a domestic side really the cost that we received is really come in here over the last - I would say three to four weeks and really we haven\u2019t had a chance to move a lot of that yet but we do expect a little bit of a sequential uptick on a domestic coal which is embedded in the guidance as we expect, export coal to be weaker in the second half, we expect the domestic coal to be slightly stronger within that $22 million to $23 million to 22 to 23 million tons for the quarter.","John Barnes","Okay, all right. And then my second question, and this is a little bit longer term more strategic in nature. I recognize both of these things have only occurred since July 1, but you have got be expanded Panama Canal is now open, the bookings are pretty solid thus far and then you had the SOLAS rules go into effect on July 1, as well. Have you seen any impact of either and what do you think are the longer-term impacts? What do you think it means? Is there a stairstep in volume as a result of one or both or is this just moving, this is just changing where the freight, how the freight gets to you but no real stairstep?","Fredrik Eliasson","On the SOLAS, first of all we really haven\u2019t seen any impact at all. We\u2019ve spoken to our international customers and it seems likes the capabilities have been there either by the port or some of the other type orders or somebody else providing that information as required. So we have not heard anything or and we don\u2019t anticipate any impact on our international volumes because of SOLAS.","In terms of Panama Canal obviously it is very recent, as little too early to tell, we have said this for a while that there is so many different drivers that comes into play here, that is very difficult to predict exactly what\u2019s going to happen. The good news is that we have a flexible network. We will be able to handle additional volume coming into the East Coast.","If that happens and we\u2019re working very closely both with international customers and with the ports to make sure we have the capability that we need if it is a bigger shift that we\u2019re currently anticipating.","John Barnes","Very good. On the ports, how far behind are the ports of being prepared for this?","Michael Ward","I don\u2019t think that is my place to comment John. I think overall we work very well with the ports. Certain of the ports have better infrastructures than others of course, but overall it\u2019s a great relationship and I think the East Coast ports are certainly seeing this as an opportunity and have spent a fair amount of capital the last decade to prepare for this so.","John Barnes","Okay. All right, thanks for the time. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar. Your line is now open.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Keith.","Keith Schoonmaker","Good morning, Michael and this is probably a question for Fredrik related to your last answer, could you comment on the possibility that significant potential Panama Canal diversions from the historical land bridge road could be simply truckable when they arrive by ship?","Fredrik Eliasson","Yes, so our view of this has been is that as you -- if you do see a major shift over to the East Coast ports, we might lose some traffic that goes into the coastal regions that will be trucked to those markets.","However, we also see then the opportunity to pick up some traffic into the Ohio Valley into more kind of the Southeast that is further away from the ports including potentially also going all the way back up to Chicago and we\u2019ve seen a fair amount of shift already as the Suez Canal has taken up a bigger shift. We have seen as production in Asia has moved to more to the Southeast that we've seen additional volume coming into the ports.","So we have the capability, but and it could be a little bit of a mixed change but overall we feel that we\u2019re very well positioned to capture whatever happens.","Keith Schoonmaker","Okay. Thanks. Maybe just one more on truck competition. In the commentary I think that was issued last night, if I am remembering correctly, there was a remark about forest products experiencing some competition from trucking and yet you managed to grow domestic intermodal an impressive 5%. It's sort of a contrast there, losing in one area. Is this just pretty route specific with the forestry?","Fredrik Eliasson","Well and the reason why the intermodal domestic has been as strong as it's been has been the fact that we on-boarded significant amount of new traffic from one specific customer last fall and we\u2019re starting to lap the peers as we get to the third quarter, hence the guidance for not the same sort of growth and probably close to flat on the domestic side as we get to the third quarter.","And obviously long-term we think we can grow the domestic intermodal business kind of about 5% to 10%, but we are in a period here on the domestic side and on some of the merchandize side where we see some temporary weakness because of excess capacity, but we fully expect that to be worked out over time and allow us to get back to more normalized growth rate as we move into hopefully the second half of '17 or so.","Keith Schoonmaker","Okay. Great. Thank you, Fredrik.","Operator","Thank you. The last question comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Sir your line is now open.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Schneeberger","Hey good morning. Thanks. I was going to ask on a couple smaller segments since we are at the end here. But with regard to metals, could you give us an update on what you are seeing there, in particular the steel? And is there a chance that it could swim to positive volume growth within a matter of quarters?","Michael Ward","I think steel production year-to-date is relatively flat year-over-year and part of what has helped that has been that the countervailing peers and so forth has been very helpful to stem the flow of imports into the United States.","Our volumes are down a little bit more than that and the reason for that is on one hand no closures that has affected us specifically. We have one mill that we both have inbound and outbound too that has closed down. That is really a big driver for our volume decline and we also are seeing the impact in the metal side from little bit more truck competition that we\u2019ve seen before.","And so as we think about the second half, I think it's little too early. I think we're going to have some of these specific -- specific CSX related issues that is going to hurt us as we get into the second half of the year.","So I think the second half will be pretty challenging still, but the key thing for us is to continue to work with our customers on the deal side, provide a better service product and continue to make sure we can reinvest in the business and that's what we're focusing on.","Scott Schneeberger","Great, thanks. And just as a follow-up, and again a small segment, but waste and equipment, a nice lift from revenue per unit in the quarter. Is that something that's going to persist or was that a one-time event?","Frank Lonegro","There's a lot of changes depending on what you move in that, because a lot of that equipment are some high winds that have very high revenue per unit, because it's a very specific service, specific unit train and so that varies quite a lot from quarter-to-quarter, but overall positive pricing continues but we\u2019ll probably see more volatility in that line item than any of the other line items.","Scott Schneeberger","Okay. Thanks again and congratulations.","Michael Ward","Thank you. And thank everyone for joining us and we will talk to you again next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call.

As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. During this call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode.","For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. David Baggs, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations Officer for CSX Corporation.","David Baggs","Thank you, Nicole, and good morning, everyone. And welcome again to CSX Corporation\u2019s first quarter 2016 earnings presentation. The presentation material that we\u2019ll be reviewing this morning along with our expanded quarterly financial report and our safety and service measurements, are available on our website at CSX.com under the Investors section. In addition, following the presentation this morning, a webcast replay will be available on that same website.","This morning, our presentation will be led by Michael Ward, the Company\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Frank Lonegro, our Chief Financial Officer. In addition, Cindy Sanborn, our Chief Operating Officer; and Fredrik Eliasson, our Chief Sales and Marketing Officer along with Clarence Gooden, our President, will be available during the question-and-answer session.","Now, before I turn the presentation over to Michael, let me remind everyone that the presentation and other statements made by the company contain forward-looking statements. You are encouraged to review the company\u2019s disclosure and the accompanying presentation on slide two. This disclosure identifies forward-looking statements, as well as the uncertainties and risks that could cause actual performance to differ materially from the results anticipated by these statements. In addition, at the end of the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session with the research analysts.","With nearly 30 analysts covering CSX and out of respect for everyone\u2019s time, including our investors, I would ask as a courtesy for you to please limit your inquiries to one question and if necessary, a clarifying question on that same topic.","And with that, let me turn the presentation over to CSX Corporation\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Michael Ward. Michael?","Michael Ward","Well thank you David. Good morning everyone. Yesterday CSX reported first quarter earnings per share of $0.37 compared to $0.45 per share in the same period last year. Revenue declined 14% in the quarter; a strong pricing across nearly all markets reflecting an improving service product was more than offset by the impact of lower fuel recovery, market conditions that drove a 5% volume decline, including a 31% decline in coal, and a $95 million year-over-year decline in liquidated damages.","Turning to operations, CSX remained an industry leader in safety and service measurements continue to advance in the quarter, consistent with our service excellence initiative to meet and exceed customer expectations. Expenses improved 12%, driven by lower fuel prices as well as efficiency gains and lower volume related costs, reflecting CSX\u2019s ongoing drive to aggressively reduce its cost structure, as we continue to reshape the company in face of this challenging market environment.","Including the impact of these cost saving actions finding liquidated damages, operating income decreased $139 million to $704 million for the quarter. At the same time, the operating ratio increased 90 basis points year-over-year to 73.1. Now I\u2019ll turn the presentation over to Frank, who will take us through the results and second quarter outlook in more detail.","Frank Lonegro","Thank you Michael and good morning everyone. Let me begin by providing more detail on our first quarter results. As Michael mentioned revenue was down 14% or $409 million versus the prior year. With coal declining 31%, total volume decreased 5% from last year which impacted revenue by about $140 million. In addition, fuel surcharge recoveries declined $139 million. We continue to see strong coal pricing from an improving service product which for the first quarter was up 3.1% overall and 4.0% excluding coal. However these gains were more than offset by the impact of negative business mix in the quarter.","Other revenue decreased $85 million, driven mainly by cycling higher liquidated damages from last year, which totaled $105 million versus $10 million in this year\u2019s first quarter. Expenses decreased 12% versus the prior year, driven mainly by $133 million in efficiency gains, $78 million in lower fuel prices and $64 million in lower volume related costs. Operating income was $704 million in the first quarter, down 16% versus the prior year.","Looking below the line, interest expense was up slightly from last year with higher debt levels partially offset by lower rates, while other income was relatively flat to the prior year. And finally income taxes were $212 million in the quarter with an effective tax rate of about 37%. Overall, net earnings were $356 million down 19% versus the prior year, and EPS was $0.37 per share down 18% versus last year.","Now let me turn to the market outlook for the second quarter. Looking forward we again expect volumes to decline in the second quarter, the challenging freight environment will continue as headwinds in coal, energy and metals volume are expected to more than offset the markets that will show growth. Automotive is expected to grow, as light vehicle production continues to be a bright spot in the economy. Minerals will benefit from the continued ramp up of the new fly ash remediation project and continued highway construction, driving aggregate movement.","Intermodal is expected to be neutral, as we continue to cycle competitive international losses. This will be offset by secular domestic growth, driven by strategic investments and supporting highway to rail conversion. Chemicals volume is expected to decline, as energy markets continue to be marked by low crude oil prices and reduced drilling activity, which will impact our share related products more significantly in the second quarter. At the same time, the core chemical markets remain healthy.","Domestic coal will continue to be unfavorably impacted by low natural gas prices currently around $2 and high levels of coal inventory at the utilities. As a result, we expect second quarter tonnage to be around 18 million tons. In addition, we anticipate a similar quarterly run rate for the second half, recognizing domestic coal volume will be largely dependent on weather.","Export coal remains pressured by the strong US dollar and global oversupply, as a result we believe second quarter tonnage will be around 4 million to 5 million tons and expect a similar run rate for the remainder of the year. For the full year, we now expect around 18 million tons to 20 million tons of export coal in 2016.","Despite a slowly recovering domestic steel production environment, metals is expected to be unfavorable year-over-year as the market works off excess supply from the strong US dollar and imported product. Overall we are still facing significant coal headwinds and a freight environment that continues to experience pronounced challenges associated with historically low crude oil, natural and other commodity prices and a strong US dollar.","As a result, we expect second quarter volume to decline in the mid-to-high single digit range year-over-year. Turning to the next slide, let me talk about our expectations for expenses in the second quarter. We expect second quarter expense to benefit from the low fuel price environment and our ongoing focus on driving efficiency gains and right sizing resources as we continue to reshape the company. Over the course of the last 12 months, we have taken aggressive cost actions with headcount down nearly 4500 versus the prior year.","These actions include our train length initiative, closing facilities in the coal network, consolidating a division headquarters and streamlining mechanical and operations support functions. These actions along with cycling the impact of winter weather last year through high efficiency gains in excess of $130 million seen here in the first quarter. And for the full year, we now expect to deliver efficiency gains of around $250 million.","Looking at labor and fringe, we expect second quarter average headcount to stay relatively flat sequentially. We expect labor inflation to be around $25 million in the second quarter in line with the level seen here in the first quarter. Looking at MS&O expense, we expect inflation and the cycling of an operating property gain from last year to more than offset efficiency gains and volume related savings.","Fuel expense in the second quarter will be driven by lower cost per gallon, reflecting the current price environment; volume related savings and continued focus on fuel efficiency. We expect depreciation in the second quarter to increase around $15 million versus the prior year, reflecting the ongoing investment in the business.","Finally, equipment and other rents in the second quarter is expected to increase moderately from last year, with higher freight car rates and the increase in volume related costs associated with automotive growth, more than offsetting improved car cycle times.","Now let me wrap up on the next slide. CSX first quarter reflect challenging freight conditions with low commodity prices and a strong US dollar continuing to impact most markets, resulting in a 5% volume decline this quarter. However, as we continue to reshape the company, our focus on pricing for the relative value of rail service, driving efficiency gains and aligning resources to the softer demand environment help to offset those volume headwinds.","Looking ahead, we expect macroeconomic and coal headwinds to continue this year. Low commodity prices and the strength of the US dollar are expected to continue impacting many of CSX\u2019s market; in particular we now expect total coal volume to decline around 25% for the full year.","Looking at our expectations for the second quarter and full year, the impact of current market conditions on CSX volume, particularly in coal is expected to outweigh the positive momentum we are seeing in service which drives pricing efficiency and right sizing initiatives. In the second quarter, we expect mid-to-high single digit volume declines with efficiency gain moderating from the level seen here in the first quarter.","For the full year, in addition to liquidated damages we cycled during the first quarter, as we previously discussed we will also be cycling a significant property transaction in the fourth quarter. As a result, we continue to expect second quarter and full year 2016 earnings per share to be down from last year. That\u2019s said, we remain intensely focused on achieving strong pricing that reflects the value of CSX service product, right sizing resources with lower demand and pursing structural cost opportunities across the network.","In particular, the aggressive cost actions we have taken over the last 12 months has helped to mitigate the challenging freight environment and weaker volumes. As a result of these initiatives, we now expect to deliver efficiency savings of around $250 million in 2016. With that let me turn the presentation back to Michael for his closing remarks.","Michael Ward","Thank you Frank. As I think about CSX first quarter performance, it\u2019s clear that the company\u2019s core earning power remained strong, even in an environment in which macroeconomic forces are putting significant pressure on most of our markets. We know 2016 will be a challenging year, and we are focused on delivering the highest level of performance and results possible.","In this environment, CSX continues to reshape its business and network for the economy of tomorrow, maximizing growth opportunities in merchandize and intermodal, while also improving the profitability of these markets to help offset the loss of coal. As we look forward, this team is resolute in its commitment to further transform today\u2019s company.","The CSX of tomorrow is built on the strength of premiere network reaching diverse, merchandise and intermodal markets. It is focused on delivering service excellence for our customers to support pricing that allows us to continue investing for the next generation and drive ever more efficient operations. And we will leverage technology to further improve safety, service and efficiency, as we continue to evolve our business for the realities of tomorrow economy.","As we make decisions today to make that vision of tomorrow a reality, we remain focused on achieving a mid-60s operating ratio longer term and delivering compelling value for you our shareholders. Now I would be glad to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] our first question comes from Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley. Sir your line is open.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley","A question on the productivity savings, clearly your first quarter performance was pretty amazing with the 133 compared to the full year run rate. You did bump up the full year by less than you kind of exceeded your prior guidance for 1Q. Can you just talk about the cadence for the rest of the year and why that appears to step down so much versus the fourth quarter number?","Cindy Sanborn","Sure. This is Cindy. I think we\u2019re off to a great start which reflects a lot of hard work by all of our teams to bring the $130 million of productivity in the first quarter. And as I think about how 2015 progressed, we had a lot of initiatives that we started in the beginning of the second quarter and on in to the third quarter around right sizing of our coal facility as well as our train length initiatives. So we\u2019ll be bumping up against those comps going forward, and I also would say there were some benefit to milder ones for this year than what we had on 2015 in the first quarter.","That said, we are never done in working on our productivity initiatives and with the pace of change here has intensified, accelerated and we will continue to bring everything to the bottom line that we can, keeping in mind that we have to balance that we\u2019re serving customers and we won\u2019t compromise safety in that effort. And as we go forward and you think about the run rate going forward of $40 million or $50 million in the next three quarters, that is higher than our historical run rate with the exception of 2015 in terms of productivity that we\u2019ll be able to deliver. So if there\u2019s more to get, we will absolutely get it and we\u2019ll be able to update you on that if we see that in the future conversations either on the quarterly or on Frank\u2019s roadshows.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley","If I can just ask one question on coal, what\u2019s your outlook for the rest of the year? Obviously you\u2019ve given us your guidance, but going in to 70 and 80, just any new thoughts on the outlook coal in the medium term.","Fredrik Eliasson","Sure, this is Fredrik. We guided to about 25% down for the full year. We did on the domestic side here in the first quarter, did about 17 million tons and our view as we think about the next couple of quarters, we like to think that we\u2019re going to be definitely 17-18 million ton range on the domestic side. And then on export side, we did almost 6 million tons in the first quarter.","Traditionally the first quarter is a little bit stronger than the other quarters; at least it\u2019s been like that for the last couple of years. We also enjoyed some spot moves here in the first quarter that we don\u2019t necessarily see in the remaining three quarters, so maybe 4 million to 5 million tons a quarter on the export side. So that gives us 22 million to 23 million range for coal guidance per quarter as we move through the year versus the 23 million tons we did in the first quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch. You may now ask your question.","Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch","Just wanted to follow-up on the employees. Great job on the larger than expected reduction down 14%, but maybe if you can walk us through, why was the average cost per employee up? Last few quarters I guess we\u2019ve seen it down 5% to 9%, this quarter it was up. May be you can talk a little bit about what\u2019s in that number in terms of comp or anything else that drives and what should we look forward for that going forward. Thanks.","Frank Lonegro","Ken its Frank. You\u2019re right; headcount was down about 13%-14%, while the labor and fringe line was down about 9% or 10%. So your comp per employee is about 4% or 5% higher. There\u2019s a couple of driver, some of those are industry related and some of those are CSX specific. Clearly you have general wage inflation of 4% a year or so, and then with probably as the biggest driver for us health and welfare inflation. As the industry is reducing resources, you\u2019ve got fewer employees to spread the health and welfare cost over. So both of those are industry in nature.","In terms of maybe some CSX specific dynamics, as you furlough employee, generally those are going to be your less tenured employees with lower all-in wages and then may be as a last point Ken, when you at a year-over-year number of employees in training, there were significantly more employees in training in the year ago quarter than there are currently, just given sort of where we are on the resource side and training pays less than marked-up pays. So you got three or four moving parts in there that hopefully answers your question.","Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch","So just on the coal market, Michael can you look forward and tell us. I know you\u2019ve talked in the past about mass gas-fired plant closing that were mandated in \u201915 and \u201916. Is there something that now is done and we should see that pace decelerate as you look forward. I just wanted to say, there was a great answer by Fredrik on what we\u2019re seeing now. But I just want to understand it, there\u2019s something else that is connected. Can you drive this, is this just market dynamics as far as closings or are there more that\u2019s going to structurally change the market and continue the pace we\u2019ve seen on the decline.","Fredrik Eliasson","Sure Ken, this is Fredrik. Frankly, based on this very low demand levels we\u2019re seeing as we go through plant by plant and look at their closures that we expect at \u201916, \u201917 and \u201918 which really covers all the announced closures that we have on our network. Based on the outlook that we have for the rest of the year now which is consistent with the guidance, there\u2019s only less than 1 million tons that we have in for those plants that have announced to close, which means that the closure side of things is really behind us to a very large degree as we move forward because of the fact that the demand levels are so low.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital","Can you guys help us on the top line? I know you\u2019re talking about mid-to-high volume declines for 2Q, but how do we think about the contribution from price within the headwinds from mix. Does that get easier or more challenging as we progress through the year?","Fredrik Eliasson","This is Fredrik again. Yes, the second quarter and probably even third quarter are going to be challenging quarters from the volume perspective. It\u2019s not really until we get to the fourth quarter we will have a little bit easier comparisons year-over-year both on the coal side and on the general merchandize side as well. We\u2019re going to have a negative mix with us as long as our coal business is declining as fast as it is and our intermodal business is growing as fast as it is. Clearly, we are very transparent about what we\u2019re doing from a pricing perspective, and that\u2019s going to continue to be helpful as we move through the year.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital","I guess what I was getting to as more from the top line perspective, should we be thinking a similar outcome then what makes us - I think you\u2019ve referred this in our prepared remarks that mix might offset the favorable impact on pricing looking forward. So topline could be down a little bit more than volume.","Fredrik Eliasson","Well I think as you try to model out what we\u2019re doing, we\u2019re kind of giving you the individual components. And the one piece we haven\u2019t talked about is of course fuel as well. So you got to put those pieces yourself, we\u2019re very explicit in terms of what we\u2019re seeing in each individual market, we certainly expect continued strong pricing as we move forward and then of course we have the variance of fuel or whatever that is going to do.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck of JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Brian Ossenbeck - JP Morgan","A quick question on the impact of the dollar, the trade weighted index was about 5% off from the peak. Are you still calling out some pretty negative headwinds when [you turn] on commodity prices both on the exports and on disruptive imports. Do you think if it stays at this level Fredrik that we\u2019ll start to see some relief towards the end of the year or do you think you need another 5% down move to really get some relief from some of these commodity markets.","Fredrik Eliasson","Well the dollar\u2019s still well above its 10 year average of so forth, but it is clear that it\u2019s been helpful in certain areas the fact that it has taken a step back to last two months or so. One area where we had seen that is in the export coal side on the metallurgical side with a benchmark actually has stepped up a little bit from I think the low [$0.81] in Queensland index trading forward and I think the bench where some of the spot moves are actually even higher than that at this point.","And we\u2019re also seeing, well it\u2019s not directly dollar related, some of the potential tariff and counter (inaudible) that we\u2019re seeing in the metals business, we\u2019re starting to see drive down some of the in-portions of the country which is starting slowly but surely to I think to heal our metals business as well. But it is fair to say that even with that sort of a relief over the last two months on the dollar; you\u2019re looking in to the fourth quarter I think until you\u2019re going to start seeing meaningful improvements in the volume performance.","Brian Ossenbeck - JP Morgan","And then on the productivity side, you mentioned that the train length initiative is basically approaching a one-year anniversary, so comps are going to get a little bit tougher, but maybe if you can just recap the last year, some of the accomplishments and what you think is reasonable for in that context for some of the goals looking out through the rest of this year and in to 2017.","Fredrik Eliasson","Sure Brian. We over the year of 2015 saw 16% gains in our train length and we\u2019re up to about 6400 feet in total. We saw probably smallest incremental change in the fourth quarter as we had really largely put in place all that we felt comfortably we could in maintaining service to our customers, and we are bumping up against challenges in the single track territory where our siding length is a bit of limited for us.","Going forward and in this year we are planning to increase siding length in our core door from Nashville to Cincinnati. That is presently limited to 6500 feet, so we\u2019re making some structural adjustments to help us continue it, and we should see those investments being in place and available to us in the back half of this year.","So I would also say that one of the benefits of the initiative that we\u2019ve seen in the ability to flex as seasonality impacts volumes. So in summer months we feel that with a little bit less volume that\u2019s typically out there that we\u2019ll be able to continue to utilize train length and in terms of reducing our cost gives us the ability to (inaudible) where we haven\u2019t before and certainly if anything changes either up or down we\u2019ll be able to adjust accordingly to maintain train length. So we feel really good about the initiative and our team in the field has done a fantastic job putting it in place.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Your line is now open.","Chris Wetherbee - Citi Investment Research","Maybe a question for Cindy just following up on the productivity, when you think about the increase from the 200 to the 250, if you could maybe breakdown sort of those specific components a little bit to sort of looking at the puts and takes on some of the expenses. I\u2019m just kind of curious kind of where that comes from, maybe how much weather and maybe how much is headcount, wanted to get a sense there.","Cindy Sanborn","As far as going forward, let me try and understand your question, going forward or --.","Chris Wetherbee - Citi Investment Research","The incremental between 200 million and 250 million for the target for the full year.","Cindy Sanborn","Well I think a lot of it is the initiative that we already have in place. I think the benefit that potentially you\u2019ll hire is to be able to continue to right size and streamline which is also been a big part of our initiative. So we\u2019ve got technology and Michael mentioned in his prepared remarks utilizing that in automation. So it will be some additional benefits to headcount I believe.","Chris Wetherbee - Citi Investment Research","And then Fredrik may be a question for you on the market outlook I guess, putting coal aside for a moment it seems like we\u2019re still sort of maybe a bit weaker than seasonally expected at least as far as the outlook for the second quarter. Just want to get a sense the last couple of weeks we\u2019ve seen some challenges intermodal or sort of slip back again. I just want to get a sense of kind of how you feel about where we stand with volumes, the economy just generally outside of some of the specific pressure points like coal.","Fredrik Eliasson","Sure. If taken to the highest level from what we see the economy, I think we still see the overall economy progressing in that 2%-2.5% range, kind of uninspiring growth. Clearly we\u2019re still dealing with the aftermath that we saw last year both on the energy side and also the strength of the dollar and the low commodity prices. And as I said earlier that\u2019s going to be with us for at least another two quarters and it is also why we guided to volumes to be down a little bit more year-over-year sequentially in the second quarter. Specifically the last couple of weeks to your question, we look at our four key markets merchandize, intermodal, coal and auto.","Our merchandize business has stayed probably some of the two strongest weeks in fact in the last two weeks, but then we have seen some weakness in our coal markets which is consistent with our guidance. We also had some operational issues with some of the terminals we serve in the export side that impacted our volumes.","Our auto business was very strong early on in March. We probably had 65% of our cars under load and that\u2019s kind of cycling through that right now. But we continue to see good strength there for the rest of the year, and yes we have seen a little bit of weakness in the intermodal space over the last few weeks, but I don\u2019t think anything that has structurally changed there. So it\u2019s going to be a tough second quarter, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a reflection of where the economy is heading or anything like that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS. You may now ask your question.","Tom Wadewitz - UBS","Wanted to ask either Michael or Fredrik on pricing. You continue to get very good pricing in merchandize and intermodal, and then the totals a bit less. How do you think that changes? Is that something that you kind of sustain through the full year, and is there a point where if you say rail traffic does - I mean you\u2019re saying it\u2019s going to be weak for a couple of quarters, does the same store price are getting decelerate through the year and its somewhat of a timing impact or would you say, hey look we can just keep doing this and we are kind of immune to softness in track, we\u2019re immune excess rail capacity. So just wondered if you could kind of talk about that, because the numbers are pretty good, they are very good in intermodal and merchandize, but it just seems like there\u2019s a lot of excess capacity out there.","Fredrik Eliasson","We\u2019re certainly not immune to what\u2019s going on in the market place and I think you\u2019ve seen a reflection of that here in the quarter versus the fourth quarter as you\u2019ve seen a sequential downtick in our pricing. There obviously are specific drivers of that, we work with our customers on a deal-by-deal basis to understand their needs and what opportunity to drive price is. A critical component of supporting our price right now is of course the fact that our service product has improved significantly. And I think our customers value a long term access to our network and the markets that we provide.","Clearly the market is softer now, than it was a year ago, but yet our pricing is frankly up year-over-year as well. So we\u2019re going to work with our customers, our prices are going to reflect what the market allows us to do. At the same time, it\u2019s critical for us to be able to price, so we can reinvest in our business. And there\u2019s been a strategic imperative of ours for a long time, but underlying all that pricing is a service excellent for our customers.","Tom Wadewitz - UBS","So that having being said, do you think it\u2019s more likely that you see stability through the year in your same store price or do you think there\u2019s some risk that you see deceleration in that as we look forward.","Fredrik Eliasson","We really don\u2019t forecast price. You\u2019ll have an opportunity to see price as we disclose our earnings each and every quarter. But strong pricing is important to what we\u2019re trying to do strategically, and we\u2019re going to work with our customers to make sure that they get service that they need to be successful in their market place and at the same time we need to be able to continue to invest in our business.","Tom Wadewitz - UBS","Do you just have a quick thought on where domestic coal inventories are?","Fredrik Eliasson","Our domestic inventories are at very high levels, if you look at annuals its well above 100-112 days. I think it\u2019s the latest data that we have and in the south it\u2019s even higher than that about 170 days or so versus kind of the normal range of 55 to 70 days of burn. And so we got plenty of inventory at our customers which will take a fairly significant time I think to get down to more normalized levels. It\u2019s going to depend both and of course where the natural gas prices are, but also dependent on where we see the summer here in terms of how much burn we get as we move towards kind of a peaker and kind of that incremental demand levels. We are more weather dependent than we\u2019ve been in the past to try to work some of these stockpiles down.","Operator","Our next question comes from Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse","Following up on Ken\u2019s question earlier, lot of puts and takes on the labor line. But as I think about total labor and fringe expense in the second quarter, typically we see a decline on a sequential basis. Not sure we think about it being roughly flat versus the first quarter or would you expect it to be a little bit higher.","Frank Lonegro","Allison if you look at where we are on an absolute headcount basis what we\u2019ve guided to is sequentially flat which his down about the same percentage on a year-over-year basis that you saw in the first quarter. Clearly the inflation will continue to impact as will the health and welfare peace there. So I\u2019d say flat to up slightly would probably be the right thing to look at.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse","And then thinking about the service metrics and in particular train speed, it seems that CSX is lagging the other rails in terms of returning to level seen in 2013. So anything specific driving this, and then when would you expect to get back to peak productivity levels.","Fredrik Eliasson","Well Allison, when it comes to services we\u2019re constantly working with Fredrik and his team and making sure we\u2019re providing that service product that our customers need, and we\u2019re really never satisfied with where we are. So the balancing act here is how to trade that off with productivity and inefficiency and make sure they are back to - what Fredrik\u2019s talking about we are earning the ability to reinvest in our business.","So I think when I look at it as to where we are? I alluded to you a little bit earlier, we have some opportunities, we\u2019re seeing great performance in our double track territories, it is a little bit more challenging in the single track territory and we are making some investments to improve that and one of the core lots that we have between Nashville and Cincinnati, and we will continue to work on making adjustments as necessary to serve our customers well.","Frank Lonegro","And the train length initiative has some impact as well, right. That\u2019s what\u2019s driving the single track challenge.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Salmon of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank","Following up with Tom\u2019s question, we\u2019re certainly seeing some really strong pricing across the overall network. If I look last quarter, the delta between the same store sales pricing which obviously includes coal and merchandize and intermodal which kind of strips it out, it expanded last quarter. Can you help us better understand what drove that? Was this kind of unique to the quarter or was there adjustments that were made across the network that are going to impact the duration of the year as well.","Fredrik Eliasson","Make sure I understand your question a little bit better Rob.","Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank","If I\u2019m looking at kind of the delta between same store sales at 3.1 and the core merchandize intermodal pricing at 4.0, it\u2019s about 90 basis points. If I look back to the fourth quarter, the split was about 40 basis points. Should I think about, what drove that kind of step up in that split last quarter? Was it something you need because of some closures or just how the volumes were coming on within your coal network or are there underlying adjustments that we should be thinking about having an impact for the duration of the year as well?","Fredrik Eliasson","The delta there is pretty much exclusively driven by the fact that we have taken some pretty significant action in our export coal business. That is a reflection of what the market place allows us to do or enforces us to do right now to optimize our bottom line. So that\u2019s really driven export coal more than anything else the fact that that spread has increased.","Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank","Got it. And so inherent in the guidance is export coal volumes coming down. So we should see less of a headwind as I look forward.","Fredrik Eliasson","Yes, that\u2019s one way of looking at it. That\u2019s probably one way of looking at it.","Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank","That helps. And also to get a little bit more color in terms of the intermodal RPU, the sequential decline obviously fuel had an impact there. But I would imagine the bigger impact in terms of the first quarter was just the declines, the mix of the business with international being under so much pressure and the uptick in domestic.","Was there any impact in terms of [loose] or truck load market impacting intermodal RPU as well or were those two factors the entire explanation of the sequential decline here.","Fredrik Eliasson","Most of the impact were because of fuel. We also did see some mix impact in the quarter in both international and in our domestic shorter length of [hall] that impacted as well. But most of our business intermodal space is under long term contract. So while the spot market does effect a portion of the business, most of it is really impacted by longer term trends not these shorter term issues that we\u2019re facing. So while there were some challenges in the quarter, our pricing in intermodal space is still positive.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","I\u2019m not sure if you can help us kind of frame the earnings guidance a little bit better. I don\u2019t if year-over-year is the right way to look at it, but supported earnings were down 18% in the first quarter, are you expecting kind of similar declines in second quarter maybe that\u2019s negative, more negative, and I know that you have some comps on your liquidated (inaudible) so maybe potentially it\u2019s the right way to think about it. I don\u2019t know but if you could help kind of frame that guidance a little bit closer.","Frank Lonegro","Scott its Frank. You\u2019re right, we did guide that the second quarter would be down on a year-over-year basis. You\u2019re also right that when you look at the second quarter of last year, it was an all-time record for us in terms of operating income, EPS and operating ratio. So we have a significant comp that we have to work through in the second quarter. We tried to give you as much granular guidance as we could, as we look out over the next three months, certainly we gave you some very specific tonnage guidance around coal and then overall volumes in the mid-to-high single digit range just given the softness in the economy and certainly the coal headwinds play in to that.","And we\u2019re going to continue to focus on the things that we have the most impact on certainly safety and service, productivity Cindy mentioned, a run rate of 40 million to 50 million in the second quarter and improving service product as well as continued strong value pricing. So you add all of that up and we come to the conclusion that earnings are going to be down, and if you want to talk sequentially, generally speaking second quarter earnings are better than first quarter earnings, if you look historically at that.","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","That\u2019s much tricky if you look at the past couple of years you\u2019ve seen kind of significant increases in earnings first quarter to second quarter. You go back further it\u2019s more smaller increases in earnings and I\u2019m just struggling with the right way to think about the seasonality.","Frank Lonegro","Like I said, I think you\u2019ll see a sequential improvement. We had not sized that, but I think you will see a typically seasonal pattern unless of course coal disappoints even further.","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","Just one quick follow-up, I think in one of the earlier questions you said that total labor cost should be kind of flattish 1Q to 2Q. So that implies like a 10% increase in comp per employee in the second quarter year-over-year. I just want to make sure that that\u2019s right.","Frank Lonegro","I think what I was trying to do is to help Allison see that on a flat headcount number with the inflation that\u2019s fairly typically and a moderating productivity environment that it would be essentially flat to up a little bit.","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","In terms of total labor and fringe?","Frank Lonegro","Total labor and fringe, that\u2019s right, comp per employee.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Seidl from Cowen and Company. You may now ask your question.","Jason Seidl - Cowen and Company","I want to think a little bit longer term here. Could you talk about right sizing the network beyond just furlough and repurposing may be some locomotives. Where are you at in that stage and what really can be done in some of the network that might be just loosing too much traffic for you.","Cindy Sanborn","If you\u2019ll indulge me here Jason, I think the changes that we\u2019re making in our company are not short term reactions to temporary economic conditions. So everything is on the table in terms of how we look at our network. I think what you\u2019ve seen us do is rightsizing the coal fields with some specific facility reductions that we\u2019ve made starting in the third quarter last year, which would be Erwin, Tennessee, Corbin, we announced a consolidation of a division from Huntington\u2019s other divisions and also reducing our yard operation and car operation in Russell, Kentucky.","On the rest of our network, and we\u2019ll continue to work on the coal network and in the coal fields on making the right decisions, while still serving the customers that we have there. When you look at the rest of the network, we\u2019re focusing very hard on density which is part of our train length initiatives really kind of the underlying component of train length initiative. So as we look at our main arteries, how can we continue to drive density there, which then also allows us to streamline some facilities around that, so you\u2019ve seen us do that with some of the mechanical reductions that we announced that we were going to make in some of our car facility?","And then going forward too beyond just simply network type of actions, our technology implementation that allows us to do automate. So we are looking at this as the ability from my perspective to create the plan and execute a plan that helps CSX strive in a rail industry that is fundamentally changing. And so we will continue to drive all of these initiatives and look for ways to tweak them to get even better efficiency while still and I have to say, it\u2019s very important to us that we serve our customers and have a service product that needs or exceeds our expectations.","Jason Seidl - Cowen and Company","So what you can do in the coal network down right now or is there more to come in terms of rightsizing that particular PC or network.","Cindy Sanborn","I would say we\u2019re never done in any of this, and we\u2019ve taken some really large steps, will continue to look as the demand for our services changes and it will change. We will take the appropriate steps to take out the cost that need to come out. You have also seen us publicly put in to the STB some discontinuance of service on routes where the mines are shut down and we will continue to do those types, take those types of actions that will be aggressive with it. But keeping in mind that it\u2019s a very profitable business for us and we want to serve the customers that need our service.","Michael Ward","You may want to mention the change in some of our pricing on the origin side.","Fredrik Eliasson","Sure. I mean obviously we work hand-on-hand with Cindy and his team here to help her drive productivity. Not just in the coal fields but elsewhere in terms of train length initiative and so forth. But specifically to Michaels point, we have changed the way we price our coal in the coal field to drive efficiency.","So we\u2019ve gone away from pricing zone so to speak rate district towards specific point-to-point pricing that better reflects the reality of operating in to certain brands lines and so forth and the maintenance that has to occur there and we will price more efficient loading points differently going forward which is tough discussions to have with our customers, but at the same time I think this is our understanding that this sort of a transformational change, you need to do something different.","So there are a lot of things that we\u2019re doing cooperatively with Cindy to try to help drive out cost, but still protect our service going forward.","Jason Seidl - Cowen and Company","My follow-up is on the intermodal side, clearly there is slight capacity in the truckload market place and in fact you could argue it probably got a little more slack here in 1Q. When you talk to your intermodal customers, how are they viewing that? Are they viewing that slack capacity in the trucking market as just a temporary blip where they\u2019re maybe taking manage of it or are they viewing this as longer term they want to play the stock market maybe a little bit more than they have in the past.","Fredrik Eliasson","As I said before that we have - a significant portion of our domestic business is under long term contracts. And I think those customers that participate there in those products do value the long term access to our network and the capabilities that we provide. There is certainly right now excess capacity which is reflected in the spot pricing.","I would say though that as we look at some of the underlying drivers there especially new orders for trucks which is coming down pretty rapidly, you still have the challenges in terms of driver retention and escalating cost there, and we have the biggest impact that I think all of you followed and we certainly follow as well is the ELDs next year and the impact that that will have definitely as we get in to the second half of 2017. So while this is a soft environment right now that will be with us for a couple of quarters, I think the fundamentals that we talked about for a long time is very much intact.","And we\u2019re seeing that in the partnership with the truckers that we continue to build on to allow us to do the long haul and then do the pickup and the delivery which solves some of their strategic challenges. So it is softer, but we do think that\u2019s a temporary issue and that the basic thesis of our intermodal investments and our bullishness of intermodal long term to 9 million loads etcetera is very much intact and frankly the fact that we\u2019re getting still very much positive pricing in intermodal space even in this environment right now, I think bodes well for the long term prospect for an intermodal business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ben Hartford of Baird. Your line is now open.","Ben Hartford - Robert W. Baird","Fredrik may be just taking the other side of the intermodal equation. On the international side obviously there\u2019s a lot of discussion with the implementation of SOLAS in a container weight rules. But any thoughts about how that\u2019s going to look on the other side of 2016 and longer term if and when those rules are implemented.","Fredrik Eliasson","We are trying to understand that ourselves frankly, and I think we are learning from our customers. It could be opportunities for people to ship earlier potentially. But at this point, I think it\u2019s a little unclear exactly what the impact will be.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Kauffman of Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.","Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research","My question on efficiency\u2019s been asked, but let me Cindy come back to you in a different way. Gross ton miles are down about 9% to 10%, where are you right now in terms of locomotive capacity, say locomotives online, locomotive on storage. And I\u2019m surprised I\u2019m not seeing more of a reduction in cars online, kind of flat to down 1% over the last year. Can you help explain to me some of these dynamics and what you can and can\u2019t do there?","Cindy Sanborn","Sure. I\u2019ll talk about locomotives first. If you compare first quarter \u201915 to this quarter, we actually have about 400 less locomotives active, which is about 10% in line with the volume reductions that you\u2019ve talked about. Within that, embedded in that is the fact that we\u2019ve got 275 store but there\u2019s also another 96 that are lease returns that will be returned in the second and third quarter of this year that we\u2019ve already pulled out.","So we feel like we\u2019re fairly, decently in line with the GTM reduction and our workload reduction in our resource take-down as a result of that, and it also allows us if we can surprise on the upside we have the ability to pull more locomotives out. And I would also add that we are receiving locomotives. In our long term purchase plan we have received 26 locomotives of that 100 total in the first quarter. So that\u2019s kind of a puts and takes around locomotives and we are very obviously focused on right-sizing our resources around both locomotives, employees and cars, and I\u2019ll talk about cars here as well.","In terms of what you\u2019re seeing with cars online, we have about 1300 cars stores right now, versus - our 13,000 stored right now versus 5500 this time last year. When you look at cars online, the cars that are actually stored don\u2019t come out of the count for a fairly long period of time, about 36 months, it\u2019s a standard that we all have. So if you include those additional cars that were pulled out in the first quarter, we\u2019re down about 4% in terms of cars online. If you take those out with cars online number; so again, we feel like we\u2019re fairly well resourced appropriately for the demand that we have.","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Long of Stephens Inc. Your line is now open.","Justin Long - Stephens Inc. ","I know you aren\u2019t giving specific EPS guidance beyond expectations for a year-over-year decline. But there have been several puts and takes since the January call, and I just wanted to get a sense if your expectation on the magnitude of that EPS decline has changed. When you put it altogether has your overall earnings outlook for this year gotten better, worse or is it about the same as it was three months ago.","Frank Lonegro","Hey it\u2019s Frank. I think when you look at the full year, clearly we knew this was going to be a down year, I think in terms of the puts and takes coal has gotten worse on a relative basis versus what we had walked into the year with. We knew we were going to have soft volumes in the merchandize side especially with the dollar and the commodity prices, intermodal is hanging in there especially on the domestic side, and then we\u2019re over delivering on productivity versus how we set out the year, and so if you add all of those up and I\u2019d say we\u2019re pretty much in line with what we had originally thought.","Justin Long - Stephens Inc.","Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. And then just one quick modeling question, I wanted to ask what you\u2019re expecting on the change and incentive comp this year just based on your current plan for 2016. Do you expect a major year-over-year change in incentive comp in the next quarter too?","Frank Lonegro","Well obviously that depends on how we do against our internal plans and clearly those are designed to align with the interest of the shareholders. We reset it every year as of January 01, if you remember in 2015 we began to roll-off incentive comp in the third and the fourth quarter. So I wouldn\u2019t suggest any meaningful change in the first and the second quarter and then we\u2019ll update depending on how we\u2019re doing as they year goes on in terms of incentive comp year-over-year as we get out in to the back half of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tyler Brown of Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Tyler Brown - Raymond James","Frank, I believe in your 10-K you guys mentioned that on 2016 you guys are expecting to have a 53 week this year. Can you just talk a little bit about what the expected impact in Q4 would be? I mean is it basically adding that extra week of operations and extra week of earnings and then in a similar vein, how would it impact the optics of Q4 traffic?","Frank Lonegro","So let us get a little deeper into the year and that\u2019s a good Q3-Q4 question for us. We hit this about six or seven years and its really normalize the number of days in every quarter, the number of weekend days in every quarter, the number of holidays in every quarter and it gives us a better comparable. But one of the things we have historically done and you can expect us to do going forward, we will give you the very specific revenue and expense and operating income and operating ratio of numbers for the 53 week on the fourth quarter call.","Tyler Brown - Raymond James","And then Fredrik, I am curious about this new flash move that you\u2019ve noted in minerals. Is this a result of the Coal Ash regulations from last year and do you think this is kind of the tip of the iceberg or do you think this is more of a one-off project. It just seems to me that minerals has been one of the few areas of strength.","Frank Lonegro","Now fly ash is a byproduct of burning coal which must be remediated by the utility plants, and obviously it can also be used in the production of concrete. And we do have a significant uptick in interest in looking at opportunities to move this to a variety of land fields business. The first move that we\u2019ve been able to secure and that we do think there are more opportunities as we move forward to capitalize on that input products to get it for our customers to make sense.","Operator","Our next question comes from Donald Broughton of Avondale Partners. Your line is now open.","Donald Broughton - Avondale Partners","Just real quick, you at least objectively appear to become more and more aggressive in share repurchase in the recent quarters. Refresh on how you think about that? Is it a fixed dollar mark you\u2019re putting towards your purchase and so as stock price falls are you going to buy more or is it some of the metric that\u2019s returning the level through which you\u2019re being aggressive to share re-pricing.","Frank Lonegro","No, we\u2019re being very ratable about it as a matter of fact. I mean we have guided previously that it would be about $250 million to $260 million a quarter, so I think all you are seeing is us being the beneficiary of deploying that in a lower stock price environment and so that ratable approach will value more share obviously in a lower price environment and less shares in a higher price environment. So we\u2019re not trying to pick the stock, we are trying to run a good rail road, and so as the price goes down we\u2019ll buy more as the price goes up we\u2019ll buy fewer.","Operator","Our last question comes from John Barnes of RBC Capital. Your line is now open.","John Barnes - RBC Capital","Going back on Donald\u2019s question, from a share repurchase perspective and it were like due to maybe CapEx that 1Q is a little bit lower. You talked about some of the rationalization of infrastructure and that kind of thing, could you talk about may be the CapEx outlook not just for this year, but going forward should we see it continue to turn lower as whatever the metric is, I guess percentage of revenue is probably not the right measure anymore. But should we expect it to trend lower and if so how do you reallocate may be that free cash flow.","Frank Lonegro","Sure. As you know we entered this year and put a plan together on the capital investment side that took out over a $100 million on a year-over-year basis, and that was just reflective of the environment that we\u2019re in. As you\u2019ll look forward I think we have some significant things that will be rolling off, positive trend control would clearly be one of those. And as we look at the asset intensity of our business, there may be some opportunities on the infrastructure on the equipment side.","At the same time, as you heard Cindy mention making sure that we can keep pace with the train length opportunities that we have and investing in sidings going forward is going to be important for us, technology investments will also be important for us and making sure we have a good safe and reliable rail road is going to be important for us. So I do you\u2019ll see some moderation overtime as we continue to target 16% to 17% of revenue as our long term goal, and I think we have line of sight to that over the next few years.","So, I do think you will continue to see us deploy capital in a balanced view with capital investment being the first priority, second priority being dividends and then the third priority being buyback. So I think you will continue to see us take that balanced approach.","John Barnes - RBC Capital","And then Fredrik on the coal outlook, and longer term you got a huge shift in the portfolio makeup of eastern utilities. I guess Southern company just announced another plant site for a nuclear reactor in South Georgia to go along with the two to build a plant (inaudible). I mean you\u2019ve got this incredible amount electricity production coming on line from nuclear. I know you\u2019ve talked a little bit about the plants that are targeted to shut down from \u201916 to \u201918, but is there any concern that as you go out further on that curve that you start to see additional coal facility shut down as a result of maybe some of this nuclear beginning to come online.","Fredrik Eliasson","I think we have seen a lot of change over the last couple of years. Who would have thought that in four years we would lose $1.4 billion of coal revenue and we\u2019re pretty much on target here in 2016 to lose at least $500 million of coal revenue. And so clearly based on what natural gas prices are right now, there\u2019s an economic interest in diverting a lot of the utility plants away from coal towards natural gas and in some instance like you pointed out to also to nuclear.","We do think though that where we are at these very depressed levels both because of natural gas prices being so low and most likely an unsustainable low place, and the fact that stockpiles are also very, very high that there are opportunities to see some pickup at some point. But there is no doubt that the trend on the utility side is downward going forward. But I don\u2019t think its anywhere close to the pace that we\u2019ve seen here over the last four to five years.","So we\u2019re monitoring that very closely, we\u2019re of course also looking at the direct impact of the regulation that is going to kick in here potentially, as we get in to 20-20 and beyond. But I think as we look at the next couple of years, we have seen a significant portion of the pain behind us and right now it\u2019s about seeing where natural gas prices will stabilize and when do we get through this overhang in the stockpiles to get back to more normalized level. When that happens, we\u2019ll see where it is. But the general term is obviously, it\u2019s a downward path.","Michael Ward","Bye everyone. Thank you for joining us and we will see you again next quarter.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call.

Baird","Operator","Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the CSX Corporation Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]","For opening remarks and introduction, I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Boone, Chief Investor Relations Officer for CSX Corporation.","Kevin Boone","Thank you, Shirley, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me on today's call is Jim Foote, President and Chief Executive Officer; Frank Lonegro, Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Wallace, Executive Vice President for Sales and Marketing. On Slide 2 is our forward-looking disclosure followed by non-GAAP disclosure on Slide 3.","With that, it is my pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Foote.","Jim Foote","Great. Thank you so much, Kevin, and thank you everyone who is on the call.","We are very excited about the strong performance of the railroad. Incredible things can be done by incredible people. The CSX workforce is proving every day that they are not going to back a backseat to anyone when it comes to running a safe, customer focused, and efficient railroad.","I want to give a special shout out to the operating team that positioned our effort out of harm\u2019s way in advance of the recent hurricanes. And to Ricky Johnson and all the engineering folks that did an amazing job in getting us back up and running with minimal delay in the aftermath of both storms.","Before moving to third quarter results, I\u2019d like to comment on a few initiatives we worked on in the third quarter. First, we made changes to the organizational structure on our operating apartment, which pushed more real time, decision-making to the field. Our management team has embraced the change and I am encouraged by the early positive results and momentum it has delivered.","Second, we announced new major initiatives at our Northwest Ohio Intermodal terminal. This facility functions has a sorting facility under the previous hub and spoke strategy. We will now leverage this app tech and its important strategic location as a traditional Intermodal terminal to drive new revenue opportunities.","As part of our plan, we are working with NorthPoint Development to establish a logistics park adjacent to the terminal. This logistic center will require no capital from CSX. We also announced the new haulage agreement with BNSF. That enhances western access to the facility. And we are working on expanding access from these coast ports. I believe these initiatives will drive long-term growth opportunities to CSX.","Now, let\u2019s get to the results. I said it last quarter, and I\u2019ll say it again today. Two words sum up everything, great performance. Nothing unusual, again, these numbers are straightforward. EPS increased 106% to $1.5 versus $0.51 last year. Operating income growth of nearly 50%, combined with the lower tax rate and 6% fewer outstanding shares contributed to the significant year-over-year increase.","Our operating ratio improved 970 basis points to 58.7, a substantial improvement and a record third quarter for CSX. The operating results are highlighted by 14% complex growth including 4% volume growth, combined with lower expenses despite much higher fuel costs.","Let's turn to Slide 6. Revenue increased 14% at volume, price, fuel surcharge and supplemental revenues all contributed to positive growth this quarter. Looking at the business segment, each was impacted by positive price and fuel recovery. Merchandise revenues grew 12% this quarter, helped somewhat by lapping some of the service issues last year. Nearly every end market saw a double digit increase with the exception of Fertilizers, which was impacted by a previously-disclosed customer shutdown.","I am encouraged by the broad-based growth across this portfolio. Coal revenues increased 14%, with strength in our export business offsetting domestic utility weakness. We also saw good growth in our steel and industrial business. In Intermodal, we saw a growth from both price and volume. Finally in other revenues, similar to previous quarters, we saw an increase in supplemental fees including demurrage.","On the next slide, Slide 7, let's take a look at our safety performance. The safety of our employees is my number one priority. As you can see on these charts, we made some good progress this quarter, and we need to sustain this momentum. The personal injury rate this quarter is encouraging but we must improve by training accident rates.","As I had mentioned, we have an initiative way to drive further improvement. We have a strong turn-up by employee in our recent safety survey, which is a good sign of employees' involvement. I will continue to prioritize safety above everything else and expect us to make further progress.","On the next slide, Slide 8, on the efficiency and service slide. Train velocity and dwell both saw improvement - significant improvement over last year. And they're also much better than last quarter, velocity improved 28% and dwell improved 26% both on a year-over-year basis.","Cars online continues to trend lower, down almost 14% year-over-year despite volume increasing 4%. This really shows the improved asset utilization we are achieving. And you can see our trip plan compliance. This is a very important measure as it reflects not only the railroad's operating performance but most importantly, how we are performing from a reliability standpoint for our customers. We have seen an improvement of 26% from the first quarter to the third quarter this year. And we just started measuring this in 2018. While we have made good progress, there is plenty of room to improve.","Now, let me hand it off to Frank who will take you through the financials and operating improvements in greater detail.","Frank Lonegro","Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Before walking through the financials, we've got a number of questions on hurricane impacts. So let me give you a quick summary.","The most significant impact from hurricane Florence was the loss of over 5 miles of track due to numerous washouts from flooding. As a result, the majority of the financial impact was capital in nature which I\u2019ll discuss in a few moments.","In terms of the P&L, we estimate the EPS impact to be about $0.02 in the quarter similar to Hurricane Irma in last year's third quarter with most of the impact contributed to lost or hurt revenue. With respect to last week's Hurricane Michael, given the location of the landfall and the speed of the storm, we do not expect the impact to be significant in the fourth quarter.","Turning to Slide 10, I'll walk you through the summary income statement. Reported revenue was up 14% in the third quarter, driven by 4% lower volume and revenue per unit gains of 9% from higher fuel recoveries, favorable mix and core pricing gains, as well as higher other revenue. The overall pricing environment remained strong in the quarter with healthy demand levels, tight trucking capacity, higher fuel prices and support of export coal benchmarks combined with an improved CSX service product.","As in the first and second quarters, pricing for merchandise and Intermodal contracts that renewed in the third quarter was particularly strong. Other revenue increased year-over-year,' reflecting the benefit of higher emerge and storage charges. We still expect other revenue to be in the $130 million to $140 million range for the fourth quarter, but likely toward the higher end of that range.","Moving to expenses, total operating expenses were 2% lower in the third quarter reflecting the benefits of scheduled railroading, as expenses were favorable year-over-year even with higher volumes, higher fuel prices, and the impacts of inflation. Labor and fringe expense decreased $30 million or 4% year-over-year as average headcount was down 8% despite 4% more volume, the smaller footprint spend with operating and G&A departments.","On the operating side significant year-over-year improvements in velocity, on time originations and arrivals and trip plan compliance led to significantly fewer active trains and crew stops during a 20% improvement in train crew efficiency as measured by GTM's for active training and employee.","Now productive recrews an indicator of net validity also improved by 58%. Shifting to mechanical support labor, the active locomotive count was down 12% year-over-year including an active fleet reduction of over 300 engines since the end of Q2. We now have over 800 locomotives in storage in addition to the hundreds of engines we've sold, scrapped, or returned since the beginning of last year.","The smaller fleet along with freight car repair efficiencies helped drive 11% year-over-year decrease in our mechanical craft workforce. Our G&A headcount also continues to decline as we look for every opportunity to absorb attrition.","With these operational and G&A labor efficiencies plus the contracted workforce reductions I\u2019ll discuss in a moment, we have nearly achieved our full-year 2000 total resource reduction goal we set out on our January call.","MS&L expense was lower by 9% versus the prior year. From an operational perspective, improved service levels combined with resource and asset efficiencies also yielded MS&O savings.","Material savings attributed to the smaller locomotive fleet are complemented by our decision to store units that are less reliable. The decisions we\u2019ve made around storage, combined with additional fleet-for-liability efforts drove a 34% year-over-year improvement in our locomotive out-of-service measure and further reduced costs related to materials and contracted locomotive maintenance services.","Looking at non-labor costs associated with our train crews, the reduction in both road crews starts and recrews yielded lower hotel and taxi costs. Additionally, MS&L continues to benefit from our efforts to streamline contractors and consultants, particularly in our technology department.","Similar to recent quarters, results benefited from line sale and real estate gains that were $52 million higher than the prior year. We are continuing to monetize our surplus assets and are making good progress toward our $300 million target of cumulative real estate sales through 2020, along with the potential for upside from line sale proceeds.","We continue to have a strong pipeline of real estate and line sale opportunities, though the impact of these transactions will continue to be uneven from quarter-to-quarter, and year-to-year.","Looking at the other expense items, depreciation increased slightly due to impact of larger net asset base. Fuel expense was up 31%, primarily due to a 27% increase in the per-gallon price and increased volumes that we were pleased to achieve record fuel efficiency in the quarter. We will drive further fuel savings through continued improvement in network solidity and the increased utilization of fuel optimization processes and technologies.","The equipment rents expense declined 18%, driven by significantly improved car cycle times as we continue to see strong year-over-year and sequential service improvements. Equity earnings were favorable, primarily due to the impact of the lower tax rate than our affiliates. We still expect equity earnings of affiliates of $20 million to $25 million in Q4.","Looking below the line, interest expense increased, primarily due to the additional debt we issued earlier this year, partially offset by a lower weighted-average coupon rate. Tax expense was lower in the quarter, even with significantly better pre-tax earnings, reflecting the continued benefit of tax reform.","Our effective tax rate was 22.3% in the quarter, slightly lower than prior guidance, mainly due to the settling of state tax matters. Absent unique items, we expect our effective rate to be in line with prior guidance of around 24.5% for the fourth quarter.","Closing out the P&L, as Jim mentioned in his opening remarks, CSX delivered operating income of nearly $1.3 billion, third quarter record operating ratio of 58.7%, and earnings per share of $1.05.","Turning to the cash side of the equation on Slide 11, year-to-date capital investments are lower by 15%. While we remain on track for the three-year $4.8 billion capital target, we now expect 2018 capital investments of about $1.7 billion, up from the prior target of $1.6 billion. The incremental capital spending is being used to accelerate positive train control from additional investments in positive return projects and pay for repairs related to Hurricane Florence.","The reduced capital intensity of the scheduled railroading model, the substantial core earnings progress detailed on the prior slide and the benefits of tax reform helped drive a 55% increase in year-to-date adjusted free cash flow resulting in nearly 100% free cash-flow conversion of net income.","This significant improvement in free cash flow generation helped drive a nearly 50% increase in shareholder returns. We executed $1 billion of share repurchases in the third quarter and have now completed over $3 billion of the current $5 billion buyback authority and remain on pace to complete the program by the end of Q1 2019. And as we have stated throughout the year, the CSX board will continue to evaluate cash deployment and shareholder returns on an annual basis. ","With that, let me turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks.","Jim Foote","All right, thanks, Frank.","Turning to Slide 13 and wrapping it up on a kind of a forward-looking basis, on last quarter's call I said we were expecting revenue growth for this year to be in the mid-single digit range. We are now looking for full-year growth to be 6% to 8%. Clearly, we are doing better than we expected coming into the year. A lot of this is due to the continued strength of export coal, but all of our business groups are doing well.","On the Intermodal side, we have made significant slides in reengineering our franchise to give what I believe we need to be to drive sustainable profitable growth. Our customers understand what we are trying to accomplish and are engaged with us to make our Intermodal product better.","As I sit here today, only eight months since our investor conference. By almost any measure, we are ahead of where I thought we would be. This team has delivered significant value to our customers and our shareholders by running the railroad better and better every day. I am proud of what has been accomplished and encouraged about all the opportunities in front of us. Our goal of making CSX the best run railroad in North America is clearly obtainable. ","Throw it back to Kevin.","Kevin Boone","Thank you, Jim.","In interest of trying to get to everyone, I will ask that panelists limit themselves to one question and one follow-up as needed. Shirley, we'll now take questions. Thank you. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question. ","Allison Landry","I wanted to ask about the revenue per RTM trends this quarter. It looks like it was up a little more than 3% for the first time you've seen since 2Q of 2017. So just wanted to understand what's driving that, if it's mix, price, a combination thereof and if there's an impact that we should be thinking about or if this helps us to understand the success of PSR so far?","Frank Lonegro","I\u2019ll just comment last one. The RTM growth that we saw in Q3 is a combination of everything. So, strong pricing environment, mix, and volume. So, yes I missed the last part of your question. ","Allison Landry","I was asking about if this tells us something about where you are with the success or progress of precision railroading so far?","Mark Wallace","I would say, yes. Clearly, we are doing very well. And service is excellent. The pricing environment is very, very good. Customers are moving more freight back to the railroad. And that is a trend that will continue.","Allison Landry","Okay. Thank you for your time.","Jim Foote","Allison, it's Jim. Clearly, part of our strategy here is to price appropriately for the service that we're providing and to the extent that CSX gives you a better product to sell, you\u2019re going to recognize higher prices as we go forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citi. You may ask your question.","Chris Wetherbee","Wanted to talk a little bit about OR expectations as we move forward. Obviously, the operating ratio is performed extremely well over the course of the last couple of quarters. I guess Jim, as you're sitting here thinking about sort of what you're doing on the Intermodal side, can you put that into context with your 60 OR target that is out there? Maybe how you think about the timing of getting towards that and maybe the sustainability of these very good margins that we're seeing? I guess I'm trying to get a sense of how far along on the progress you already mentioned you were ahead that you expected to be several months ago. I don't know if there's certainly a new way to think about the opportunities going forward?","Jim Foote","Well, I guess as I said, as I was trying to get to without being too specific because we're not going to be too specific, today anyway. Eight months ago, we put out a target to have 60 operating ratio in three years, and I think at that point in time everybody thought we were crazy and that couldn't be done.","And now we've come in with two consecutive quarters in a row of - not industry-leading right there with anybody else in the industry. So, and as I have said on the last few quarters, I have a little more confidence that we can hit a 60 operating ratio in three years when we\u2019re kind of there today.","So, but in no way, shape, or form is that indicative of the fact that we've run out of opportunities. We're just, as I said, I'm comfortable with the reengineering steps that we've taken to date on our Intermodal business, but we're holding back because we made a commitment to our customers we wouldn't make any kind of dramatic changes until after peak season.","We're holding back and we\u2019re going to be doing some more work, that we've already discussed with our customers in terms of some line rationalizations, internal consolidations, and what we're talking with Northwest Ohio, we committed to growing that business. But we're going to grow that business in a logical process that is sustainable and profitable for us, all of which gets us opportunities to further reduce our operating ratio as we go forward. So, a ton of opportunity ahead of us, and so hang in there and see what we can do for you next quarter. ","Chris Wetherbee","And then just a quick follow-up on the pricing side. I know you don\u2019t give a core pricing metric anymore, but, Jim, you've been helpful in terms of characterizing the price environment over the last couple of quarters, just wanted to get your thoughts on 3Q maybe as it stands relative to the last couple of quarters. ","Frank Lonegro","Yes, what we said, Chris, in our prepared remarks was that the renewals continued to be strong and certainly in comparison to a same-store sales type of a measure that continue to be elevated against that benchmark. We restructure contracts from time to time, we did have one that was a little less than we would like, but other than that one, you would have seen a sequential - continued sequential increase in same-store sales.","So, yes, the environment is really good, the backdrop macro is really good, the service product is really good. As Jim mentioned, Mark's got his team is fully engaged in driving forward and really thinking about what we're going to do in the next couple of quarters getting into 2019. The normal escalators like ALEF and RCAF and things of that nature all look pretty strong quarter-over-quarter, so those are also helpful as we think about contracts that are longer term in nature. So, nothing's really changed from what we told you last quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.","Brian Ossenbeck","Jim, can you give us a little bit more context about just in general. You\u2019re not going to give too many details today on the Intermodal side, but just what are some of the challenges and the opportunities of making these adjustments, given that CSX was a kind of stand-alone entity in Intermodal, maybe compared to when you were at CN? And where do you think the margin profile can actually go over time? Can it get to the corporate average at CSX?","Jim Foote","I'll take that second part of your question first. I think so. My history at CN was that that's what we did. We took it from the slowest dog to the middle of the pack. And I firmly believe that if you believe in your franchise and you believe in the quality of your product, if you can sell that as a value-add service to your customers and not just as a commodity that's going to trade the marketplace based on price.","And I think, based upon capacity and everything else that's an issue with our channel partners, we bring to the trucking industry and those people that use Intermodal a tremendous product with a tremendous value. And we still have a long ways to go to get that franchise right. Part of the process is disassembling the old independent structure of the company because it's not an independent company. It's part parcel of the railroad.","Those trains run on the railroad. They don't run on an Intermodal railroad, they run on the key railroad. So, all of that goes towards us building a much more efficient, highly effective, and better-quality product for the customers and that's what's going to drive the growth and that's what's going to increase the - improve the profitability of the business segment.","Brian Ossenbeck","And then, Frank, can you just give us an update us on export goal for 4Q? Seems like it's running at the run rate you'd mentioned last time. If you can't give us the mix of thermal and met or at least some characteristics of that would be helpful?","Mark Wallace","So, it\u2019s Mark speaking. Export coal, we believe heading into the back half of the year, the back Q4 of the year, it's going to remain very strong. Demand is still very strong. Benchmarks are still very strong. And so, we think we are going to see continued strength in our export coal business here, heading into the end of the year.","Operator","Next question comes from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.","Amit Mehrotra","Congrats on the very strong results. I feel like I've been saying that a lot to you guys this year. Jim, export coal has obviously - just following up on the last question - obviously been highly accommodative which has helped this year's performance as well.","So as we think about walking the operating ratio from 2018 to 2019, how much of the improvement we could see will be predicated on what export coal volumes do next year? Just given how much growth we've seen this year in the business? I'm just trying to calibrate our expectations, my expectations for what the improvement could be in '19 given maybe some of the idiosyncratic events for this year related to export coal. Thanks.","Frank Lonegro","I would say it's more of the, what if something happens to coal and what would the impact be on our performance going forward, as opposed to - I mean it's not like we're going to add another 40% more export coal products while lot of are getting either mid-50 operating ratio. So, we're assuming and have assumed during the planning process and we'll probably - based upon where we stand right now, things on a forward-looking basis for export coal into 2019 look pretty good. And that will be what we'll base our plan on and then we'll continue to look for ways to become more efficient.","As I said, it's much more of an issue of what would be a fit and how effectively can we pivot and react in the event something happened to the coal business. And that's something that is of right now that we are obviously speculating. We need to maintain a healthy coal business going forward because it has a meaningful impact on it. But if something happens to the export Coal markets, where they soften up a little bit, we'll pivot and we'll adjust just like all good railroads - all good precision scheduled railroads do.","Amit Mehrotra","I guess you're just going be a 60 OR this year. I wonder if you're looking at the business -- I'm sure you're looking at the business many ways, but one way you\u2019re looking at is what the underlying margins of the business you're doing, the growth we see in export coal volumes and maybe that's the reason the 2020 target should actually be 60% given the fluid nature of those cargos or that freight? ","Jim Foote","We're not commenting on your 60 number there, either this year or in 2020. When we look at the underlying business, the margins on the business segments are all improving independently, not just because export coal is having a good run. ","Amit Mehrotra","If I could just ask one quick follow-up. One of the big pieces of the cost structure that you guys have been able to leverage is obviously the number of employees and employee headcount was down another I guess almost 8% in the quarter. As your volume guidance is going up - sorry, your revenue guidance is going up, should we expect a flatter kind of employee headcount into 2019 and 2020 because - or will you still be able to kind of leverage that and see higher revenue and lower number of employees?","Jim Foote","Well, we will continue to become more and more efficient, how are we going to measure it, on a GTM basis, on an RTM basis, on a Carload basis. And our plan will be to continue to see a reduction in the headcount. Like I said, we're not in a position right now. Again, January we said we're going to take 2,000 employees out of the Company this year. We already got 2,000 employees out of the Company this year. Will we have a target for employee reductions, employee efficiency next year? Yes. And what that number is, at the right time we'll articulate it to you. And we will continue to become on a per unit basis, more and more efficient all the time.","However, when we get to the point, and again, a lot of that has to do with our - the attrition rate and how we manage the expectations of our employees through this process. But when we get to the point where we need to handle the volume, we're not going to run ourselves out of a couple break done here and there to screw up the railroad. So, we'll -- we'll adjust. There are certain points on the railroad today where you need employees in one location and you have excess in another, so you're always managing your workforce appropriately and we'll do that on a go-forward basis. ","Frank Lonegro","You should expect, obviously, when the business comes in - merchandise and Intermodal, we've got ample capacity on those trains to be able to add it with very high incremental margins. If it comes in unit train commodities, certainly the margins there are good and you would want us to add any additional resources we need to be able to handle that. But I think, to Jim's point, you should expect us to continue to leverage resource efficiencies over time and our business is going to continue to grow. That was part and parcel of the framework that we laid out for you at the investor conference in March.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Dexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.","Ken Dexter","Hey, great job, but if we can just touch on the efficiency there, Frank or Jim. You talked about more room. Hey, is there more room on the equipment reductions as well? Or now that you\u2019ve put all the locomotives aside and the cars, is that kind of the end of the equipment side of your efficiency gain? ","Frank Lonegro","Never. We took out three - again, we took out 300 vista this quarter. We're always - again, we're at, in the quarter, I don't know what the velocity, 17.8, 17.9, something like that. That's way behind the industry leader. Way behind the industry leader. Since then, now we're up around 19, still way behind the industry leader. As we improve velocity, as we improve throughput, as we improve all aspects of the railroad, what does it do? Creates capacity, i.e. takes out locomotives. So, we\u2019ll continue to take out Locomotives. We'll continue to take out railcars. We'll continue to free up capacity across the railroad and into terminals, just as we -- because we will drive more and more efficiency and fluidity in the network.","And so, therefore -- again, that's how -- that's why the employee count goal is down. Employee headcount goes down because we need fewer load, as an example, we need 32 locomotives for every mile an hour we can improve on velocity. So, every 30 locomotives means you need fewer people to maintain the locomotives, which means you need fewer facilities to maintain the locomotive. And on and on and on and on. Fewer cars online, get them offline, get them moving, fewer people to maintain the cars, fewer pieces of inventory. So, that's the nature of the game here, is continuing to drive throughput. And as I said, in terms of dwell, we're not the leader in dwell, we're not the leader in terms of velocity, but we will be. And as we do that, we'll free up and ship more and more assets. ","Ken Dexter","That's really great detail and insight. I truly appreciate that. Frank, maybe another one. I just want to clarify something you said earlier. You said there was a contract that you didn't get what you wanted. Excluding that, I think you said rates would have been up sequentially. Maybe if you can just kind of clarify or detail what you were saying there in terms of what was going on with rates excluding - I don't know if that was including a bad contract or something?","Frank Lonegro","Well, Ken, you summarized it perfectly. That's -- that one restructuring deal that we did last year, same store sales would have been up sequentially Q2 to Q3.","Ken Dexter","So, that was last year? That wasn't one that just happened that is you're seeing rates deteriorate or anything? ","Frank Lonegro","That's correct. That\u2019s before foot and before walls.","Ken Dexter","Very important clarification. Thank you. ","Jim Foote","Obviously we're talking merchant Intermodal right there. ","Ken Dexter","Okay. And then just a follow-up on -- maybe Jim, if you can detail kind of what you're doing on Intermodal. I mean, you talked about holding off until after peak, but can you walk through changes? I know you mentioned reopening or accelerating some stuff in northwest Ohio, working on the tunnel in Virginia. What is the goal on Intermodal? I don't if there's a simple way to kind of highlight what you're doing there.","Jim Foote","Yes, I guess the goal is- I think we were pretty clear about last year unwinding the hub and spoke system in northwest Ohio, where you had multiple handlings of the same container on the network, which is a very expensive way to do that when you're - very expensive way to operate especially when you have short length of pull associated with that. Last year we unwound that to a large degree and we talked about the fact that we took 7% of the volume, Intermodal volumes, off the Company in the third quarter of last year. ","And to be honest with you, at that point in time, we thought we had fixed the Intermodal network to a large degree. What we uncovered as we went through 2018 then and began to try and build and make our terminals more effective and our trains more efficient, that we were doing similar things to the hub and spoke in north west Ohio, we were doing that same kind of double or triple handling of containers in many other locations on the railroad.","So, we are unwinding those. We got rid of, I would say, about a third of that earlier this year, before the peak. And we have another piece of business that we will unwind, rationalize the lanes, get out of doing some of this double and triple handling of containers. And that will happen at the beginning of the year, after peak season. And we'll clearly assess before we start to look into that kind of stuff, what the weather situation looks like and everything like that.","Our goal here is to work with our customers. Our customers clearly understand what we're doing. And in a lot of cases it\u2019s been published not only in the media but in various analyst reports saying that what they're doing makes total sense. You can't be everything to everyone. And we\u2019re not here to win a blue ribbon for volume. We're here to win an award for being safe, customer-focused and efficient in making money.","Operator","Next question comes from Thomas Wadewitz with UBS. You may ask your question. ","Thomas Wadewitz","Congratulations on the strong results. Wanted to ask a question about - you've talked about this Intermodal changes in service. You've previously, or just now, you said kind of 7-point impact of volume with what you did last year. Can you give kind of a framework of the changes you made in August this year, what you might do in first quarter next year? Is that a bigger impact? What might be the total volume impact from those changes? ","Frank Lonegro","So, Tom, the two announcements that we made, one, late-August and went into effect in mid-September had 2% impact on our volumes. And then the one that we announced early October, that won't take effect until early January, is about 5%. So combined, it would be about the same volume impact that we announced in, I guess, this time last year. ","Thomas Wadewitz","And then wanted to see if you could offer some thoughts on kind of where you're at with the sales force in getting them kind of, I guess the sales force energized and the right people in place and engagement with the customers in terms of selling for the Carload customers to leverage the service and maybe convert some truck freight? And then also if you had a little more color on the BN agreement kind of what the nature is of what you're doing with BN in northwest Ohio? Thank you.","Jim Foote","It's a crafty way of asking a follow-up.","Thomas Wadewitz","Yes, I know, sorry about that.","Jim Foote","That's okay. So clearly, what I\u2019ve been focused on here the last two-and-half months has been putting together an organization that I believe will be required going forward. So, what we believe is a truly exceptional service product. We at CSX have a lot of people in sales and marketing, over the last year and half some of those people have left the organization, some people are wearing dwell hats [ph], some people are doing some other things.","So, one of my first priorities was to truly understand what I have. We just completed a couple weeks ago, a sales meeting for every sales and marketing person in the organization where we invited the entire senior management team with a lot of the senior operating folks to come together and explain to them what we're trying to achieve and what we're trying to do. Sell service, not price. Explain to them our service product that we actually have a product now to go in and sell to the customer. And we don\u2019t just throw in a plate from the head and hopefully have lowest price. So, we\u2019re doing a lot and we're focusing on creating a winning culture in our sales department. And they are incentivized as we just started a sales lieutenant program to incent them on doing what they're supposed to do and get out and sale. So, the last question?","Frank Lonegro","BN.","Jim Foote","BN. That\u2019s a haulage agreement beginning at the end of the month. And we're excited for that. It's -- we're going to grow into this agreement with BN. And we'll -- I think, clearly, the volumes that we will see through the end of the year will offset some of the later actualizations this year that I talked about. So, we should see some growth in Intermodal business in Q4.","Thomas Wadewitz","Why would you do a haulage instead of some other way of getting the traffic there? ","Frank Lonegro","Again, let's say -- we're up --we took 7% off and we're up 3%. So again, we're going to take off some of this business and we're going to grow the business. Haulage is an effective way for us to work together into this northwest Ohio market. Plus, we have a long-standing relationship with the BNSF because this is exactly what we do today into the Atlanta market, the Fairburn terminal there. They have haulage from the West Coast all the way into Atlanta. So, it's consistent with the way we've done business with them for years.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Vernon with Bernstein. You may ask your question.","David Vernon","Frank, I'm trying to reconcile the acceleration in some of the demurrage fees and the incidentals with what sounds like a railroad that's running a lot faster. How should we be thinking about the point in time when those incidental fees may start to come down as customers begin to comply and what's really driving the above trend kind of result here in the third quarter on that fee line?","Frank Lonegro","Yes, specifically to the quarter, it had more to do with the change in the in-transit reserve. If you think about the year-over-year change in the transit times, we\u2019re much better this quarter than we were a year ago. So, the beat against the guidance that we gave you was the revenue reserve adjustment. In terms of your broader comment, I think we're a little surprised that behaviors haven't changed as much as we had expected them to earlier in the year.","I think it has less to do with our service product and more to do with the fact that trucking capacity remains tight and we've done some changes in the policies and the rates and things we thought would incent the customers to spend the assets a little bit more quickly. So, I think if trucking capacity loosens up at some point in time in the future, you could probably see that come down a little bit. But for the next quarter we've guided you to that 130 to 140 range. ","David Vernon","And then maybe just kind of in a related note, the $20 million step-down, is this a new normal on the equipment and other rents line or is there something also associated with the way you're setting up that haulage agreement or the in transit reserves that would affect that number as well? Should we just be thinking about this as the right run rate on equipment and other rents?","Frank Lonegro","So, neither the haulage deal nor the revenue reserve adjustments have anything to do with rents. What is helping us on the rent is that the days per load for both merchandise and automotive and a little bit even on the Intermodal side have gotten so much better that we're having to pay less car hires, that's really how it translates. I'm not -- we\u2019re not going to give run rates in terms of any of the various expense line items but as our velocity continues to improve, as our dwell continues to improve, as the customers do their part of the bargain in loading and unloading, you\u2019ll continue to see days per load improve and you\u2019ll continue to see us provide efficiencies on product.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. You may ask your question.","Brandon Oglenski","So, Mark, I just want to get your perspective, now heading the marketing organization sales efforts, we talked a lot last summer about CSX service, I guess, \u201cfailing\u201d or at least that's what a lot of the industry pundits wanted to say. But how are customers engaging you today and what's the competitive outlook looking like on some of the multi-year contracts into 2019 and into 2020? Because you guys clearly have taken some costs out of the equation. From our perspective velocity is up, but how do we really measure that from a customer-service perspective?","Mark Wallace","I've been spending a lot of time recently with customers. As Jim talked about, I think last quarter my number one priority was to go out there and sort of re-establish some relationships with some of these customers. And I've been doing that. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been home very much. But clearly, they have -- they are witnessing the service product that we told them that was coming. They were not too happy with us last fall, but we told them to -- we were going to improve, and we have improved, and they are witnessing that every day.","Clearly, they want to keep doing business with CSX. They don't want to -- they want to move more freight to rail and to CSX rather than truck and they\u2019re doing that. We see evidence of that, especially in like our forest products business and our metals business. You'll see those double-digit growth in volumes in Q3. That is us bringing back share that those customers had to move to truck last year or early in the year because our surge levels weren't where they should have been. I\u2019ve been visiting a lot of those customers and they want to use us. And as we continue to get better and continue to improve, more and more of that freight is coming back to CSX and you'll continue to see that more in Q4 and going forward.","Brandon Oglenski","I mean I guess in that context then can you just remind us the long-term volume outlook you guys provided back in February? I think it was across merchandise and Intermodal and whether maybe that could prove ultimately conservative?","Jim Foote","Yes. We did not give you volume guidance. We gave you revenue guidance.","Brandon Oglenski","Yes, sorry. revenue.","Frank Lonegro","We\u2019re putting together our plans for 2019, as Jim mentioned, we\u2019ll provide some more color on that when we get on the January call. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question.","Scott Group","So, Frank, can you give us maybe a little bit of guidance on real estate gains and headcount for the fourth quarter? And then big picture, I think at the analyst day over the three year plan you talked about a 6,000 reduction in headcount. Is that still the right long-term number to use?","Frank Lonegro","So, in terms of year, what Jim talked about in terms of guidance is we put up the 2,000 total workforce number and we\u2019re essentially there. I think we'll continue to look for opportunities in Q4 to reduce that further. We - we'll certainly have a number internally for 2019 and beyond. Whether or not we share that, we'll certainly - we\u2019ll talk about that as we prepare for the January call. But we're going to continue even with the volume increases that we believe will come on, we're going to continue to look for labor efficiencies. You should expect that to be part of how we continue to drive operating leverage going forward.","In terms of your real estate and line sell questions, we gave the $300 million three-year sales proceeds for real estate with upside in line sales. In the quarter, when you think about the split there, the gains were $43 million on line sales and $10 million on real estate. The line sales there are probably a little bit heavier on the gain side than they will be in the future, and part of the reason for that is one of the things that we characterized as a line sale was a lease conversion, so you see more gain on that one than you would in a normal line sale.","So, we\u2019re off to a strong start. We've got a big pipeline. Q4 will depend on whether or not we see the things closing at the end of the year. There's always nuisances around whether something closes in December or in January. If it closes in December, we'll have a good fourth quarter.","Scott Group","I guess that's helpful. And then, Mark, for you. As truckload spot pricing has softened a little bit, is that having any impact in terms of your pricing discussions as you look out to 2019 pricing?","Mark Wallace","While marketing against 2019 pricing, that's having zero impact on where we are today.","Operator","Your next question comes from Justin Long with Stephens. You may ask your question.","Justin Long","So, Jim, maybe to start with, one for you. I know you've made some changes in your coal team. I believe you've said that you're thinking big as it relates to changes, that you're contemplating for that business. Could you expand on where you stand as it relates to any structural changes you're assessing for the coal franchise and what some of those options could look like?","Jim Foote","I guess the correct answer is we are always looking at what's the best way for us to be structured, and are there more efficient arrangements, structures, enterprise structures, or whatever it is, in order to maximize value. But we certainly don't have anything like that on the - in the horizon or near term. I'll let Mark follow up on the other parts of your question.","Mark Wallace","Yes, as I think about - you may have seen recently we just hired a new Vice President for Coal, Shawn Yates. Shawn was a former energy trainer, former coal customer, brilliant guy. And he's coming into this role. He's been here about 30 days and he's got a lot of ideas. And so, as we think about our domestic coal business and the future of export, Shawn's bringing a lot of innovative ways and we look forward to him helping us go forward with our coal business.","Justin Long","And secondly, this one's probably for Frank, on CapEx you mentioned that you pulled forward some of your spending on PTC. I just wanted to ask what drove that decision, and going forward, any change to your expectation on total CapEx for PTC or operating expense for PTC in the future?","Frank Lonegro","So, no change in the overall guidance for the full PTC project. We've been saying $2.4 billion completed project for a number of years now. We're still on that trajectory with about $2.2 billion now. The decision that Jim made was if it's going be a safer railroad, let's go ahead and do everything we can to get it done more quickly.","The team is fully engaged in doing that. We'll still need the extension and plan to submit our request for the extension in the next couple of months. But we're making progress there. No change in the PTC OpEx outlook. It's very consistent with what we told you in prior quarters. And yes, the overall 4.8 billion CapEx over three years is still fully intact.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Russell with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question. ","Matt Russell","Yes, just following up on CapEx. You also referenced there was a piece of the increase this year associated with hurricane relief. So, should we just assume that the very small piece of it of the overall budget of $4.8 billion is still intact for the next three years?","Jim Foote","Yes. It's going be somewhere for Hurricane Florence in the 20ish million-dollar range and PTC, obviously, we\u2019re pulling some of that forward. And then we\u2019ve got some other high return projects that we have approved in the last couple of months. Obviously, with Ed, Mark, and Jim, they've got some ideas of things that can help us be more effective and more efficient and we\u2019re implementing those with some additional capital.","Matt Russell","And then back to the other revenue line, is there a normalized run rate that you think about, whether we get there in 2019 or not, when you eventually do start to see those demurrage fees and customer behavior change? And what is that? And do you think that you can offset a big portion of that with improved efficiency on the network?","Jim Foote","Yes. We really haven't gotten to the point where we're willing to give a long-term guide on that particular line. Just to give you some color, if you look at it on a year-over-year basis, about three quarters of the year-over-year increase is demurrage, incidentals, storage fees, et cetera, on both the carload and the Intermodal lines and about a quarter of it is that in-transit reserve that I mentioned earlier. Certainly, if we are spinning the railroad faster and faster you're going to see an offsetting decrease in your rent line because car hire is going be low.","Operator","Next question comes from Walter Spracklin with RBC. You may ask your question.","Walter Spracklin","Just starting on the volume or the revenue guidance, when we were asking you last quarter about the kind of trend there, you were a little reluctant to give any change to your formal guidance based on some of the uncertainty in coal. Just wondering if, with this change, is it that you've gotten some more visibility on coal? Or is it that the rest of the non-coal business is just ramping up that you've - with your current outlook on coal you felt the position to be able to increase your guidance?","Frank Lonegro","I think that from the very beginning, each quarter I've said we were going to be I think in January, we were going be a titch better, than - slightly up. And here in the next quarter I said we were going the be a titch better than slightly up which kind of got us to, like I said, the 5% range.","We've said many, many times - and now we're going up 6 to 8 - let's call it 7. 5 to 7 or 5.5 to 7. Clearly at the beginning of the year, I think everybody expected that export coal was going to tail up at the midpoint of the year. And it has stayed strong and it continues to stay strong. So yes, I mean when we had that big of a piece of our business, that has each has not declined but has steadily grown - not necessarily growing more than we expected, just everybody said it dropped off and it hasn\u2019t.","So that's had a big part in the change in our outlook. Plus, as I said in my - at the very beginning, all of our business units are growing. The economy is very, very strong. All of our customers are very optimistic about the outlook. The forest products, the pulp, paper, lumber, metals, you name it, plastics, market probably you talked more customer to [indiscernible].","Jim Foote","And I think we can talk about export coal and strength of export coal all day long but what's really pleasing me these days is just the strength of our service product. Our customers are taking notice, and we're gaining market share and growing this volume on the merchandise side. We\u2019ll probably segue that. We're doing really, really well on merchandise. We're doing good in Intermodal. We announced 7% of lane rationalizations at the end of last year and we're growing Intermodal.","And so, things are healthy out there. People want to do business with CSX. And somebody said north of the border last quarter it's a good time to be in the rail business. But I think it's even better time to be at CSX right now.","Walter Spracklin","And similar vein here, Jim, on your operating ratio target of 60, two years ahead of schedule. You said it came in better than you expected. What area would you say really blew out the lights in terms of what you were expecting at the beginning of the year and what actually happened here three quarters through?","Jim Foote","Across the board I think we're just doing - it\u2019s not just one thing that suddenly was like, oh wow, look at this. It\u2019s across the board. It was a massive reengineering at CSX. And the question was not in my mind as I said at the beginning, about a year ago, or a little less than a year ago, it was not that this company couldn't get to 60 operating ratio, it was a question of when.","And so, yes, it's been from the launch talked about major, major changes on the revenue side of the business, restructuring that side of the business, getting rid of part of the Intermodal standalone business. It's a whole, whole new management team, really bright, energetic people. And then you go down to the operating side of the business.","In every facet, and just every measurement that we have out there in terms of velocity, flow, train delays, crew utilization, we get down into the - I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard us talk about our [indiscernible] we've got people around these that are probably counting how many Dixie cups we\u2019re using because we are constantly focusing on improving the way we run the business and in every area we are doing better but faster than I think all of us thought we could do. ","Walter Spracklin","And I just want to clarify what we heard from Mark there in September. It's not that you're - you\u2019ve hit 60, now you're done. My impression from Mark was you\u2019re still early days of implementing precision railroad. So, if you hit 60, there's still plenty more to go. Is that a fair assessment? ","Frank Lonegro","Mark's a Canadian, so he's thinks in hockey terms. And so, Mark - Mark's still in the first period, I think in baseball terms, and we're in the early innings. We have a lot of - there\u2019s a lot of improvement to do, a lot of things to get done. And yes, there's no - I don't know where this whole idea came, but all of the sudden you hear numbers, and everybody says, oh, pivot.","I\u2019ve been working really, really hard to grow this business since the day I walked in this door. And how do you grow the business, by running a better railroad. Simple as that. It's not like, oh, forget the customer, to hell with the customer and just focus on ripping our costs. That\u2019s not what precision schedule is about and that's not the way we run the business since the day I walked in here.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Ravi Shanker","Just a couple left here. Your service levels have improved significantly, obviously, since this time last year. Can you just remind us kind of what level of SCB supervision still exists and kind of when that will lift, kind of given that you guys have proven that last year's issues no longer exist?","Mark Wallace","Well, I think we weren\u2019t the only ones. When we last - like we said in March, I believe, said that we no longer had to make weekly calls with the STB. And in my - using my words, took us off the watch list. They put everybody else on the watch list. And I know that a few other railroads are still on it today. So, we're by far not - if not the best, one of the best run railroads. And so, there's no reason whatsoever that we would be under any kind of added supervision.","Ravi Shanker","I guess speaking of other railroads, can you give us a little more color on this lawsuit that you filed versus your regional peer about access to the Port of Virginia?","Mark Wallace","What it is, is that it's kind of a corporate governance issue where CSX and NS jointly own this third-party entity that provides switching access to the Port of Virginia. And over time, over - all things on the railroad business evolves over time into a situation where we have a representation on this company, which used to be 50\/50 and we don't feel we are being provided the appropriate access to the terminals in Virginia. And we believe that that\u2019s as a result of the guys disproportionate ownership. So, we\u2019re going to defend ourselves in court. Simple as that.","Ravi Shanker","If you guys do see a favorable resolution there, does that result in more kind of coal volumes or better pricing? How do we see that in the numbers? ","Mark Wallace","More access to the Intermodal terminals in Virginia.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Majors with Susquehanna Financial Group. You may ask your question.","Matthew Majors","It's very clear that the network is running really well right now. Can you give us an update on where you are in the process of perhaps naming a permanent COO? And sort of what you guys and the board want to see before you're comfortable making that decision? ","Jim Foote","Chief Operating Officer? COO?","Matthew Majors","Yes. Chief Operating Officer.","Jim Foote","It\u2019s not on my radar at all. I\u2019ve got an extremely solid team right now that - Mark, in just one quarter, has done - I think he\u2019s doing an extremely good job and probably even better than I expected. And Mr. Harris is overseeing the operating function where we have a great talent. And so, I'm very, very comfortable with the way the company's structured today. And now that is not to say that we are not always cognitive. In fact, myself as a member of the board of directors needs to make sure that we're doing the appropriate due diligence on a succession plan.","And so, that's all part of this process that we're going through in putting in. Again, Ed is working really hard and we have an extremely talented group of individuals on the operating side of the business. And on Mark's leadership, we have really a stellar group of people in the sales side of the business. So, along with Frank and the finance people, Deanna and Nathan, they\u2019re the executive leadership team, we are rock solid.","People go like, hey, you're going to hire somebody? No, we\u2019re not going to hire anybody. There\u2019s nobody out there that\u2019s better than we are. Now, are we going to find who can be the future leader of the company? Yes, and hopefully we can - hopefully that comes from inside. And so, that's what we're working on to develop.","Matthew Majors","Thank you for the detailed response there. Just one more really high level then I'll pass it on. If you look back for the last two quarters, CSX earned more than the prior regime did in its best full year. And it looks like you\u2019re going to end this year pretty close to the margin target you laid out the spring for 2020. You said you were exceeding your own expectations, not just ours here. I mean, all good news. But clearly, the pace that you're on this year can't continue forever.","How do you think about and what do you consider when managing sort of investor expectations going forward? You keep talking to January, kind of more on January\u2019s, are we going to hear a comprehensive revisit of the long-term plan there, given the progress you've made? Or is it going be more about here's how we're looking for 2019?","Jim Foote","Again, we're not planning on doing another Investor Day to reboot sort of the thing that is - there\u2019s no need to. We've got - we are nowhere near the finish line here. We've got a lot of opportunity ahead of us and we're kind of trying to - we will try to give you as much visibility towards that as we're comfortable doing at the end of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cherilyn Radbourne from TD Securities. You may ask your question.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Wanted to ask about trip plan compliance because that strikes me as more of a customer-facing operating metric. And I think you indicated last quarter that trip plan compliance was around 60%. So, I was just wondering if you could update us on that metric this quarter and talk about what the upper limit is? In other words, I assume that 100% is impractical, but what's best-in-class on trip compliance?","Frank Lonegro","Trip compliance, yes, I mean it's a critical component. It does two things. It measures how well the railroad is running, it measures reliability because when we fail, the truck is not going to get there when we said it was going to get there. It\u2019s simple as that. So, we say we're at 65% - 60%, 65% of the cars met their trip plans that means that 30% to 35% of them didn't. And 30% to 35% of them, we said they were going be there by Thursday at 11:00 weren\u2019t. So that number, it's huge.","And then when we miss, not only do we disappoint the customer, and not have a delivery when we said we were going to do, we then have to go back and we have to handle that car again. That means we had to - if we missed it, we have to handle it again. And therefore, the dual costs come in.","So that's why this measure is so significant because it shows that hey, you didn't need to do it two or three times to get it there on time and you got it there on time. So, the customer said we did it in the most efficient manner and that's why trip plan compliance is so critical.","If we're at 60% - if we were at 60%, 65%, we're in the end of the first quarter, we're up 28% or whatever the number it was I said, 26% improved from there. So, somebody do the math, high 70s kind of range right now. And we need to get that number - obviously we need to get that number to 100. What's reasonable in this kind of a business where you've got all kinds of things that go bump in the night and you have a problem occasionally.","But it\u2019s not 75. It's closer to be 95. And we'll get there and we'll get there as quickly as we possibly can and if we continue to see these 10 sequentially every quarter, 10% improvement in that metric, then that\u2019s going to show how well we're doing.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Very quickly just wondered if you could update us on domestic coal stockpile post the end of the summer? ","Jim Foote","They\u2019re a little in the center. And so, the predominance of our coal, domestic coal, utility coal is for the self, and the stockpiles are low heading into the winter here. So that's a good story for Q4, for us. And I think it\u2019s probably one of the quarter's that I've seen in a long time that I think our domestic utility goal is actually going be up in the quarter, so...","Operator","Our final question comes from Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. You may ask your question.","Ben Hartford","Jim, just come back to beginning on the call. When you made a comment about train accident rates needing to improve. Just looking for some perspective. Your experience here relative to PSR implementation at your prior rails. Is the issue now just constructive dissatisfaction as it relates to safety and train accident specifically? Has it been weather? Or is it something else that you see kind of specific to this experience that perhaps is causing that to operate on a lag if it sort of characterize it as that metric operating on a bit of a lag? Some perspective there would be helpful. Thanks.","Jim Foote","In terms of the implementation scheduled railroading on safety, if you look at the past railroads that have implemented the PSR, they\u2019ve always been the safest. It\u2019s Canadian National and then Canadian Pacific, so it is - and so it's not related to what that we've changed some kind of operating practice as a result in an issue.","The vast majority of those incidents are extremely small, isolated incidents that take place in one of our yards. And they normally involve an engineering defect where something happens to the track structure, whether it's a delay - and they're all basically derailments. I think there's a few thing, one car was banging into another. But train accidents, it's mostly a derailment caused by an engineering situation or a human mistake.","And so, obviously we can work on the engineering end of that, which we are aggressively, to make sure that our infrastructure and everything is up to speed in our yards with that. And then secondarily, work with our employees to make sure they understand what the rules are and make sure that they don't - don\u2019t do something with the - that causes the car to go on the ground. Simple as that.","Kevin Boone","All right, that wraps up our call tonight. Jim, do you have any comments?","Jim Foote","No. Thank you so much for your interest, as always, and we'll be back to talk to you at the end of the year and try to give you a little flavor for what the future looks like. Thank you so much.","Kevin Boone","All right. Thanks, everyone. ","Operator","That concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation in today's call.

As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. During this call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode.","For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call to Mr. David Baggs, Vice President of Capital Markets and Investor Relations for CSX Corporation. You may begin, sir.","David Baggs","Thank you and good morning everyone. And welcome again to CSX Corporation\u2019s first quarter 2014 earnings presentation. Presentation material that we\u2019ll be reviewing this morning along with our quarterly financial report and our safety and service measurements, are available on our website at csx.com under the Investors section. In addition, following the presentation, a webcast and podcast replay will be available on that same website.","Here representing CSX this morning are Michael Ward, the company\u2019s Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; Clarence Gooden, Chief Sales and Marketing Officer; Oscar Munoz, Chief Operating Officer; and Fredrik Eliasson, Chief Financial Officer.","Now, before we begin the formal part of our program, let me remind everyone that the presentation and other statements made by the company contain forward-looking statements. You are encouraged to review the company\u2019s disclosure in the accompanying presentation on slide 2. This disclosure identifies forward-looking statements as well as the uncertainties and risks that could cause actual performance to differ materially from the results anticipated by these statements.","In addition, let me also remind everyone that at the end of the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session with the research analysts. That said, with nearly 30 analysts covering CSX today, I would ask, as a courtesy for everyone, to please limit your inquiries to one primary and one follow-up question.","And with that, let me turn the presentation over to CSX Corporation\u2019s Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, Michael Ward. Michael?","Michael Ward","Thank you, David and good morning everyone. Last evening, CSX reported first quarter earnings per share of $0.40, down from $0.45 in the same period last year. These results reflect the challenging winter conditions faced by CSX and the broader transportation industry this quarter. In that regard, I would like to offer my sincere thanks to the talented and dedicated men and women of CSX who worked tirelessly to one of the worst winters on record to keep the network running as fluently as possible. I would also like to thank our customers for their patience and support as we work through the service impacts to meet their needs.","Looking at the quarterly results, revenue increased 2% to $3 billion on a 3% volume increase. The underlying economy remained strong supports continued gain in CSX\u2019s intermodal and merchandise markets, which more than offset the decline in coal business. At the same time, as Oscar will discuss in more detail later, we took many steps during the quarter to keep service levels as high as possible in a challenging environment. Dealing with these challenges also had the effect of increasing costs. As a result, operating income decreased 16% to $739 million and the operating ratio increased 520 basis points to 75.5%.","As we look forward, we have the resources in place to support a gradual service recovery while also capitalizing on the market opportunities created by broad economic strength. We see the first quarter headwinds transitioning to longer-term positive momentum in the back half of the year as the economy drives additional growth in our merchandise and intermodal business coupled with an improving environment for domestic coal this year based on increased electrical demand, higher natural gas prices and reduced stockpiles across much of CSX\u2019s service territory.","Given these opportunities, we will more than offset the challenges of this quarter. For that reason, our earnings fit to remain intact with modest growth expected for full year 2014.","Now I\u2019ll turn the presentation over to Clarence, who will take us through the topline results in more detail. Clarence?","Clarence Gooden","Thank you, Michael and good morning. This was a challenging quarter with the impact of the severe winter masking the underlying strength of the economy and the strong demand for our service. As you can see on the left side of the chart, total volume grew 3% and surpassed 1.6 million loads in the quarter with growth in merchandise and intermodal more than offsetting the decline in coal. As a result, merchandise and intermodal now combine for 82% of CSX\u2019s total volume.","Moving to the right, total revenue increased $49 million to over $3 billion in the quarter, reflecting overall volume growth and increased pricing across most markets. Here merchandise and intermodal now account for over three quarters of CSX\u2019s overall revenue.","Next the average, revenue per unit was down slightly, the impact of core pricing gains and liquidated damages was offset by the unfavorable mix impact related to growth in intermodal versus the decline in coal.","Finally, coal pricing on a same-store sale basis remains solid across nearly all markets. Recall that same-store sales are defined as shipments with the same customer, commodity, and car type, and the same origin and destination. These shipments represented 75% of CSX\u2019s traffic base for the quarter.","On this basis, all-in prices was 0.5% in the quarter, primarily reflecting continued rate pressure in the export coal market. Since we continued to have greater variability in both our export and domestic coal business reflecting global market conditions and our fixed variable contract structure and since our merchandise and intermodal markets are becoming a larger portion of our business, we have again provided you with the same-store sales pricing for these two markets on a combined basis.","At the bottom of this panel, you can see pricing for merchandise and intermodal averaged 2.6% for the quarter. This increase is less on a year-over-year basis, but still represents a solid spread over rail inflation. That said, we remain confident that the value created by our service product for our customers provides a solid foundation for growth and pricing above rail inflation over the long-term.","Now let\u2019s look at the individual markets in more detail, starting with merchandise. Overall, merchandise revenue increased 4% to nearly $1.8 billion in the quarter. Volume in the agricultural sector was up 4%. Feed grain shipments, both domestic and export, increased sharply due to a strong 2013 harvest. In addition, ethanol shipments grew as lower corn prices resulted in higher ethanol production levels.","The construction sector declined 2% overall as weather-related challenges more than offset the continued recovery of the residential housing market. Finally, the industrial sector was up 3%, strength in energy-related commodities including crude oil and liquefied petroleum gas more than offset lower shipments in the metals and automotive markets impacted by the severe winter weather.","Moving to the next slide, let\u2019s review the intermodal business. Intermodal revenue increased 4% to $421 million. Total intermodal volume grew 5%, setting a new first quarter record. Domestic volume was up 7% also setting a new first quarter record driven by continued highway to rail conversions.","International volume was up 3% year-over-year reflecting continued economic growth. Total intermodal revenue per unit declined 1% as continued core pricing gains and higher fuel recoveries were offset by unfavorable mix. Volume associated with our domestic door-to-door product, which has higher revenue per unit was more severely impacted by the weather.","Finally, we continued to focus on the intermodal product by adding new service offering and making strategic investments. These investments include the new terminal in Winter Haven, Florida, which opened early this month; the Montreal terminal, which will open later in the year and the ongoing expansion of the Northwest Ohio facility.","Moving to the next slide, let\u2019s review the coal business. Coal revenue declined 9% in the quarter to $662 million. Export coal tonnage declined 15% as global market conditions for both thermal and metallurgical coals continued to soften. The API2 benchmark for thermal coal recently fell to $75 per ton, a level where U.S. coals were more challenged to compete. The Queensland metallurgical coal benchmark has also fallen to low levels of $120 per ton. Domestic coal tonnage increased 8% driven by increased northern utility shipments including a competitive gain. Finally, total revenue per unit was down 8% with lower export pricing and unfavorable domestic mix negatively impacting RPU.","Moving on to the next slide, let\u2019s take a look at the macroeconomic environment. The underlying macro economy remains constructive for growth. The purchasing managers\u2019 index increased to 53.7% in March. Rating above 50 indicates the manufacturing economy is expanding. This is the 10th consecutive month that PMI index has signaled expansion. Meanwhile, the customer inventories index declined to 42 in March. Rating below 50 indicates customer\u2019s inventories are low. This is the lowest ratings since May of 2011 when the customers\u2019 inventory index registered 39.5.","On the right side of the page, both the GDP and IDP projections remain strong and show continued growth throughout 2014. This is consistent with what we see in the marketplace and what we hear from our diverse customer base.","Now let me wrap up with the outlook for the second quarter. Looking forward, we expect the overall volume outlook for the second quarter to be positive with favorable conditions for 83% of our markets and stable conditions for the remaining 17%.","Looking at some of the key markets, agriculture is favorable with higher year-over-year crop yields supporting continued growth in grain shipments. We expect growth in chemicals as we continue to capture opportunities created by the expanding domestic oil and gas industry. The continued expansion of the U.S. housing and construction markets will drive growth in the forest products and mineral markets. Strong intermodal growth will continue as our strategic network investments and service reliability support highway to rail conversions.","We expect domestic coal volume will grow in the second quarter as inventory levels have normalized and gas prices have increased to levels where most coals are more competitive fuel source. Export coal volume is expected to be neutral in the second quarter and our best estimate of 2014 volume remains in the mid 30 million ton range, reflecting soft global market conditions particularly in the thermal market. At the same time, rail pricing will likely continue to reflect the weak global market conditions. The automotive market is stable with North American light vehicle production expected to grow 1% in the second quarter.","The U.S. economic expansion is expected to continue in 2014 with projected GDP and IDP growth of 2.9% and 3.2% respectively, producing a macroeconomic environment that supports growth. The value of the service we provide supports not only growth, but also pricing above rail inflation over the long-term.","Thank you. And now I\u2019ll turn the presentation over to Oscar to review our operating results.","Oscar Munoz","Thank you, Clarence and good morning everyone. Well, as most of you know or heard by now, this past winter season was one of near historical portions in terms of the duration, the coal, the snow and ice and the corresponding impact on not only rail, but truck and airline transportation systems, their supply chain and frankly the overall economy was pretty significant.","We at CSX certainly felt the impact of the severe weather and despite the best efforts of our operating employees, lost and worked around the clock to ensure we were able to deliver freight even in the worst of conditions. CSX\u2019s operating performance this quarter was not at the high levels we\u2019ve all come to expect.","We assure you that the team is fully engaged to support both the gradual recovery and the strong demand that Clarence just discussed.","Now looking at the operating results in the first quarter and beginning with safety. While CSX still remains a leader amongst the class one railroads, we did experience an increase in both personal injuries and in train accidents. The personal injury rate was up to 0.6 and the train accident rate rose to 2.35, both up from near record low levels in the first quarter of last year. Adverse operating conditions were a factor of these results, but we remained focused on prevention with the specific emphasis on avoiding catastrophic injuries.","Let me now turn to the company\u2019s service performance on the next slide. Our operating measures echo the challenges of the North American transportations we faced in the first quarter; originations, arrivals, velocity and dwell are all well off the record levels over the last two years. But as you\u2019ll see later on in the presentation, service measures are stabilizing and beginning to improve.","Turning to slide 15, I will highlight some of the specific challenges we faced from the severe weather in the quarter. While the impact of CSX network was most keenly felt in the Midwest and Northeast, which is a network business and as you can see on the map on the left of the chart on-time originations were negatively impacted as far as South as the State of Georgia. Of course our Northern region clearly faced the worst of the storms, resulting an on-time performance for the quarter of just above 50%.","On the right side of the chart you can see heating degree day, an indicator of the severity of cold temperatures were up over 17% on a year-over-year basis. And snowfall was more than doubled prior year levels in most of our Northern service territory.","Now in a normal winter, when a storm approaches, we make adjustments to the operating plant, move development resources to the area to accommodate the disruption and then usually have a little time to return to normal operating plans after the weather has passed.","This year 25 storms came back to back over several months, which means the operating plant have to be constantly adjusted to serve customer needs. These adjustments require more resources and can also stress our line of road and [yard] capacity.","Now as the worse of the weather seems to be behind us and we are beginning to see fluidity recover, however given the duration of the storm season and the backlog of freight it created along with the increased demand we are seeing, our complete service recovery will be gradual.","Now let me turn to next slide and I will discuss the effects on the operating costs of business. Now while Fredric will provide more specifics on where these impacts were in the quarter and what to expect going forward, let me give you some details on key operational impact.","If you look at the chart and on the left, the number of relief starts doubled year-over-year and overtime across the entire operating department was up nearly 50%. Reposition maintenance of the way and signal employees around the clock along our critical routes to ensure traffic can move safely and efficiently through these effective areas.","Mechanical employees worked extra shifts to ensure locomotives and freight cars were available to help catch up and meet customer demand. In the transportation department labor to ensure terminals remain fluid and trains ran as close to schedule as possible.","Moving down the chart, average freight car cycle days were up 9% reflecting the additional time it took to move cars to and from customer facilities. We also placed additional locomotives into service; the result was a 7% increase in the average locomotive count. With this many additional locomotives and the harsh conditions, fuel efficiency was impacted. I am encouraged however that we only saw 2% set back in this measure as the underlying technology and processes we have in place to drive fuel savings are still yielding results.","Finally our active T&E Crew was flat on a year-over-year basis. Crews worked extra hard to run the network through this harsh winter and I am pleased to say that crew availability remains high and the team was able to support solid volume growth even through the operating challenges. To recapping maintaining network fluidity in these extreme conditions drove a significant short-term cost impact what was necessary to serve our customers.","Now let me turn to slide 17 and discuss our recent service trends. CSX is stabilized and is beginning to recover. A last of the significant storm systems came through about a month ago and as you see depicted on the chart on the left of the slide on-time originations is trending up and dwell is declining since that time, while with positive signs.","As Clarence reviewed, traffic levels are also increasing. In support of this growth, we expect our current high level of locomotives to remain in service for the foreseeable future and we have new crew members in training to meet this rising demand.","The recovery in Chicago specifically will likely take longer to meet the amount of interchange traffic with other railroads and the complexity of the rail network there. Nevertheless the rails are in close coordination and we\u2019re beginning to see some [headways].","As we look forward, we remain confident in our progress. So, it is clear the recovery and related additional costs will extend through the second quarter with more meaningful improvement in the second half of the year.","Now let me wrap up on the last slide. As I discussed the effects from the winter storms were wide and significant driving an increase in cost and impacting service levels. Nevertheless, CSX is confident in the ability of this operating team to steadily return service to the levels our customers have come to expect. We\u2019re adequately resourced recovery and our operating measures are headed in the right direction.","On a productivity perspective, while it\u2019s too early to give you an update, estimate for the full year, it\u2019s pretty clear we\u2019re not going to be able to deliver our normal $130 million savings, but we\u2019ll update you on that later on in the year.","So, at this point, let me echo Michael\u2019s comments and thank each of our employees for the skill and dedication and safely and efficiently serving our customers through this challenging winter.","With that let me now turn the presentation over to Fred to review the financial.","Fredrik Eliasson","","Thank you Oscar and good morning everyone. As Clarence mentioned earlier, revenue increased 2% in the first quarter as declines in coal revenue were more than offset by gains in merchandise, intermodal and other revenue.","In the quarter, other revenue included $55 million of liquidated damages, an increase of $22 million versus the prior year. Looking at the remainder of 2014, we expect liquidity damages to be about $10 million for each of the remaining quarters.","Expenses increased 9% versus last year driven primarily by the adverse impact of winter weather that Oscar mentioned and the cycling of real estate gains, both of which I will discuss in more detail in the coming slides.","Operating income was $739 million, down 16% or $141 million versus the prior year. Looking below the line, interest expense was down $7 million versus last year driven by favorable interest rates on debt that was refinanced in 2013 and modestly lower debt levels.","Other income was $7 million and income taxes were $208 million in the quarter for an effective tax rate of approximately 34%. This included the stated legislative tax change, which benefited earnings by $0.02 per share. Without this change, the effective tax rate would have been 37.6%.","Overall, net earnings were $398 million and EPS was $0.40 per share, down from $462 million and $0.45 respectively from the prior year period.","Now before we move on, let me take a moment to summarize the total impact that weather had on our first quarter financial results. We estimate that weather impact on the first quarter expense was around $90 million or $0.06 per share. Revenue impact is more challenging to quantify, but we estimate there was about $0.02 to $0.03 per share in revenue contribution that we were not able to recover in the first quarter due to weather disruptions.","With that let\u2019s turn to the next slide and briefly discuss how fuel lag impacted the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, the effect of the lag in our fuel surcharge program was $4 million unfavorable. This reflects $9 million of negative in-quarter lag during the first quarter of 2014 versus $5 million of negative in-quarter lag for the same period in the prior year. Based on the current forward curve, we expect the year-over-year fuel lag impact to be negative in the second quarter, similar to what we saw in the first quarter.","Turning to the next slide, let\u2019s review our expenses. Overall expenses increased 9% in the quarter. I will talk about the top three expense items in more detail on the next slide, but let me first briefly speak to the bottom two on this chart. Depreciation was up 5% to $283 million due to the increase in the net asset base. Going forward, we expect depreciation to increase sequentially a few million dollars per quarter, reflecting the ongoing investments in our business. Equipment rent was up 6% to $101 million due to the weather\u2019s impact on the network and higher locomotive lease expense as active fleet was increased to minimize service disruption.","Now turning to the next slide, let's discuss our other expenses. First, let me highlight the impacts that we have attributed to weather disruption across each of these expense categories. As I previously mentioned, we estimated first quarter weather impact on expense was $90 million. Of that, $35 million is attributable to labor and fringe driven primarily by overtime and relief crew starts. $35 million in MS&O due to an increase in active locomotives and higher utility expense, $15 million is in fuel driven by loss of efficiency and an increase in non-locomotive heating fuel. And finally, there was $5 million of weather impact in equipment and rent expense, which I covered on the previous slide.","Looking ahead at the second quarter, we expect to incur additional cost associated with recovering from the weather disruptions, although not to the same degree as seen in the first quarter.","That summarizes the weather impact on our first quarter expenses. Now let me discuss the other drivers for each of expense categories, beginning on the left with labor and fringe. Total labor and fringe increased 6% to $47 million versus last year and included $14 million of inflation. Going forward, we expect labor inflation to be around $15 million on a year-over-year basis for the remaining quarters in 2014.","At the same time, we expect headcount to remain roughly flat to our first quarter level, although as we have consistently demonstrated we will continue to adjust resources to reflect current volume levels and drive efficiency.","Moving to the right on the slide, MS&O expense increased 24% or $122 million versus last year. This included a cycling of $49 million of real estate gain, a $12 million increase in expenses related to train accidents and $9 million of inflation. In addition, there was $17 million increase in other MS&O, [setting] multiple items none of which were significantly by themselves.","Looking ahead, MS&O expense will continue to be impacted by this cycling of real estate gains, which as a reminder totaled $36 million in the second quarter of 2013. However, there are no further gains to be cycled in the second half. In addition, we continue to expect high year-over-year expenses in the remaining quarters related to inflation and volume growth.","Finally, fuel expense was essentially flat to last year as favorable price driven by a 5% decline in our fuel cost per gallon was offset by volume and weather headwinds.","That concludes the expense review for the first quarter. Turning to the next slide, I am pleased to announce that we\u2019ll be increasing our dividend. CSX will pay a dividend of $0.16 per share starting in the second quarter, which reflects the 7% increase versus the prior year. While this results in a dividend payout ratio slightly above our target range of 30% to 35%, it is important to note that weather-related headwinds we experienced in the first quarter are not indicative of the core earnings power of the business. We expect our full year EPS to better reflect the [true] earnings power and to support a 30% to 35% dividend payout range in 2014.","Our second quarter dividend increased builds on the 11 increases we have made over the last 8 years representing a 20% CAGR in a dividend over that period.","Now let me wrap it up on the next slide. First, the core earnings power of our business remains strong. Despite the very challenging operating conditions that we faced, we delivered top-line revenue growth of 2% and grew volume by 3% in this first quarter. Across the portfolio, we generally have a positive outlook on the growth trajectory for our merchandise and intermodal market. In addition, we expect 2013 was the low point for domestic coal and that volume will grow this year, whereas the export coal market continues to be volatile.","Our near-term focus is to restore superior service levels across the network as quickly as possible. We experienced significant incremental operating expense in the first quarter from weather disruptions and expect some of these costs to continue into the second quarter. While we plan to recover a portion of this loss productivity during the remainder of the year, our first priority is to restore higher service levels.","For the full year 2014, we expect to see modest earnings growth despite first half headwinds from weather and the cycling of real estate gains.","We have visibility to 7 million new tons of utility coal as a result of the cold winter and higher natural gas prices, which will more than offset the incremental cost incurred in the first quarter.","Looking at 2015, it is still not clear whether projected 2015 growth rate will be strong enough to deliver 2 year EPS CAGR of 10% to 50% across 2014 and 2015 given the modest growth expectations we have for this year.","That said we feel confident that CSX can sustain double-digit EPS growth as we get through this year. That earnings growth which will be more balanced between volume, price and efficiency will also contribute to an improving operating ratio which we expect to be in the mid 60s longer term.","With that let me turn the presentation back to Michael for his closing remarks.","Michael Ward","","Thank you, Fredrik. As you\u2019ve heard this morning this first quarter was certainly more challenging than most. And again I thank our employees and customers for their perseverance and patience over these past few months.","As I look ahead, we have the right people and resources in place. And we\u2019re working hard to return our network to the high levels of service and reliability that we have consistently produced for our customers while remaining a leader in one of the nation\u2019s safest industries.","With that as a foundation, I\u2019m confident in the company\u2019s ability to deliver modest growth for the full year 2014 and become more effective serving broad markets that will put the company in a position to sustain positive earnings momentum over the long haul.","In that regard, we are particularly optimistic about the opportunities and plans to support increases in the intermodal and merchandise markets. Put another way, the underlying strength of our network and team coupled with a more stable domestic coal environment and a growing economy gives us confidence that in 2015 and beyond, CSX should again sustain margin expansion and double-digits earning growth.","With that, we\u2019re pleased to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley. Your may ask your questions.","Michael Ward","Good morning Bill.","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley","Yes. Hi, good morning. Fredrik, can I ask you for a little bit of clarification on your guidance commentary, particularly as it relates to \u201815, because I think most of us recognize there are some extraordinary events so far this year. And so there is not -- we don\u2019t have the same kind of expectations for this year. But in \u201815, when you think about that double-digit growth rate, what kind of gives you confidence in it? Can you kind of maybe walk us through a little bit of the assumptions behind it maybe, because obviously there are still concerns about how long export coal could be weak and these sorts of things. So I think it would be helpful to know kind of what goes into that comment?","Fredrik Eliasson","Sure. So, just take a different year, so first of all, we said modest earnings growth for 2014. And while we feel strong and have good confidence in what we see for 2015 as the year by itself, we\u2019re pretty bullish about the macro factors that we\u2019re seeing, we\u2019re pretty bullish about the fact as we get the network running better again, but 2015 by itself will be very strong year.","The question is, will it be strong enough to make up for the fact that we\u2019re only making modest gains this year. And that\u2019s left to be seen. Clearly the domestic market on the coal side has gone stronger over the last few months. But at the same time, we continue to see the export coal market deteriorate. So it\u2019s a little hard at this point to be too bullish about that part of the market.","And so, instead of getting into individual component, what I have said throughout the quarter has been, so I am overseeing things right now for 2015, we are going to need some help as we think about this thing from a bottoms up perspective. And that help in coming different forms are going to come in terms of export market firming up, a little bit more domestic coal, little bit better pricing, more productivity, we just don\u2019t know. But overall 2015 by itself would be very strong year and it\u2019s just not sure it\u2019s going to be as strong enough to make up for the modest earnings growth we are seeing here in 2014.","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley","Yes. One point of clarification there, another comment you have made in the past I think on \u201815 has been sub-70 OR so a high 60s OR in 2015, are you walking away from that?","Fredrik Eliasson","","I think the same thing holds true there in order to get to that sub 70 offering ratio, we are going to also need some help from where we are seeing things today. It doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t get there, we certainly going to -- we certainly target it, we are trying to get there but we are going to need some help from where we are seeing things today.","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley","Does the change to fix variable cost do anything to pricing there, if the domestic coal comes back, does this make pricing sort of weaker and does that effect of you?","Fredrik Eliasson","","It doesn\u2019t really impact the overall trajectory.","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley","Okay, alright. Thank you for the time.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch","","Good morning. Michael, you mentioned a couple of times that you are prepared for a gradual recovery, Oscar mentioned a little bit about maybe not hitting the $130 million recovery this year because some costs are coming in. What if we -- I mean we have seen volumes already up 11% quarter-to-date, what if we get a little bit of a sharper recovery in terms of volumes, what does that do in order to flex the network and stress test, what your infrastructure is?","Oscar Munoz","","Ken, so that was a couple of questions, specifically your -- restate your question a little bit if you could?","Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch","","I am just wondering because you mentioned, Michael mentioned a couple of times and I think as did you in terms of a gradual recovery you are prepared for that. What if we see, I mean you have already seen volumes up 11% starting off second quarter pretty robust, what -- how are you prepared if the recovery is a little bit stronger than that? Does that mean you\u2019re fearful that if we get too much volume, it\u2019s going to stress the network too much and you would be prepared just because you mentioned the word gradual recovery so many times?","Oscar Munoz","Yes. Thank you, Ken. I appreciate that. So, the gradual recovery is based upon exactly the volume that we are seeing, so both backlog as well as the increased demand and again, our balance between productivity and ensuring superior service levels. And so we\u2019re making sure that everyone understands that we -- our balance is geared towards our customer. And the volume that we\u2019re seeing today is if you think of our sort of annual peak periods weeks 9 through week 23 is kind of at the peak of it. So right now we\u2019re probably in the highest point of workload we\u2019re going to have in the course of the year and we\u2019re slightly improving. So we feel pretty confident around that.","Now given that fact we\u2019re bringing on some more locomotives, we continue to bring crews out of training and of course doing the hiring if required. But now the volume is a very welcome event for us after a couple of years of being in relatively dry.","Michael Ward","Ken, it is Michael. The other thing I\u2019d add to that is obviously with that demand which I think we\u2019re doing a reasonable job of handling, it does slow your ability to recover. And I think the other thing I would point out, the Chicago as you know is a key interchange. And I think all the major carriers have issues around Chicago and those will take time to work through. And it does have a cascading impact on the rest of the network. So, we will continue to improve.","I think the reason we used gradual several times, because we don\u2019t think this is going to snap back immediately and that\u2019s [to] try to make people understand that.","Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch","But I guess if we see a little bit stronger, is that something that you need to then reengage that, the one plan from years ago, is it evolutionary? I am just trying to understand is that something that could make this look even a worse if you get a little bit faster growth?","Michael Ward","","Well, we used our reengaging one plan, we still use the one plan to run our railroad, but I\u2019m not overly concerned. I think the demand levels we\u2019re seeing out there we can handle, we will work through. So I don\u2019t see that as a major risk. I think it really adds more like as Oscar said, it\u2019s an opportunity for us to help regain some of that lost earnings in the first quarter.","Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch","","Wonderful and then just a follow-up on kind of Bill\u2019s question there on the coal RPU. If you exclude the liquidated damages, how should we think about coal yields for the rest of the year? Fred, is that something we\u2019re going to see accelerate on the declines given the change in contract structures or maybe you could just walk us through your thoughts a little bit on that?","Clarence Gooden","Ken this is Clarence. I think you will see the coal RPUs will be very similar to what you saw in the first quarter. Our utility north business was up about 22% in the first quarter and that tends to carry a lower RPU; our southern utility was down about 6% in the first quarter and our rates on our export coal as we mentioned were slightly down. So that mix that particular mix will tend to carry through here in the second quarter, so you will see something very similar on the RPU going forward.","Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch","","Great, I appreciate the insight and time. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","","Good morning Brandon.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays","Yes, good morning everyone. And it\u2019s still snowing in New Jersey by the way, so it\u2019s a pretty tough spring as well.","Michael Ward","","Never ending.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays","I just want to ask a longer term question, Michael. I mean coal revenue used to be 30 plus percent of your mix, it\u2019s down to close to 23%, 22% this quarter. We\u2019ve seen your non-coal volume expand 3% to 4% for the last few years. What are some of the impediments that keeps that non-coal growth from driving better operational margins and I know you\u2019ve been talking about the quarter, but just thinking longer term, how do you get that base of revenue to drive better margins and better earnings growth looking forward?","Michael Ward","Well, as Fred alluded to one, obviously the coal is a high margin business and our portfolio has changed. But we\u2019re very optimistic, if we look at our intermodal and merchandise growth, it is good margin business. And we think as we go forward, if you look at our value creation we drove in the decade prior to this, it was about two-thirds price and one-third productivity. As we look at the company going forward, we still see strong value creation opportunities that are being more balanced, not exactly a third; a third; a third, but it\u2019s going to be continued productivity, continued pricing above rail inflation and adding the element of growth.","The intermodal margins are very nice now that we have basically double stack economics and the density of lanes and the other business we\u2019re growing the crude by rail, the growth in our other merchandise businesses are all good margin businesses that will help drive us to that mid 60s operating ratio long-term.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays","Okay. I mean at what point though, do you need still coal revenue stabilization in order to just overall expand margins for the business; is that what we\u2019re hearing today?","Michael Ward","Well, we do need the coal to stabilize and we think we\u2019re getting fairly close to that point now. This cold winter, the early blessing of this cold winter is a big drawdown to the stockpiles. Actually as Clarence alluded to, the demand in the north is very strong and actually the stockpiles are below where they ideally would like to have them. And the overhang we\u2019ve been living within the south for the last couple of years, about three quarters of that was eliminated here. So, we really do see that domestic is very strong\u2026","Oscar Munoz","Yes. Just to add to that that Brandon also, in terms of the underlying core earnings power of our company over the last two years, it\u2019s been pretty strong. I mean we\u2019re still thinking of double-digit earnings range. The issue has been $800 million of coal revenue that has gone away. And in this year we are still seeing some headwinds in coal, which is why we only feel that we are going to have modest earnings growth. But we are pretty confident as I said once we get through this transition that we are going to return to the more normalized earnings growth going forward.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays","Okay, appreciate it guys. Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citi. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","","Good morning, Chris.","Chris Wetherbee - Citi","","Hey, good morning, guys. Clarence, could I just ask for a little bit of clarification on your comments around the export coal market? I think you included it in the neutral category in the outlook. And I just want to get a rough sense of how you think about that relative to the sort of full year target. I think you still said in the mid 30 million ton range. Should we expect a bit of an absolute tonnage step up in the second quarter which I guess would be a little bit more neutral or is that still going to be a little bit under pressure on a year-over-year basis?","Clarence Gooden","","Well, it\u2019s a little too soon Chris to sort of see what this export coal business going to do. Frankly it\u2019s a lot stronger this first quarter than I anticipated that it would be. So, we are sticking with sort of mid 30s throughout the year. We have got in the second quarter right now about 80% of what we project for the quarter is tied up under contracts. And that\u2019s obviously subject to market conditions.","We think we have hit pretty much the bottom of where the global price of coal is going to be. The thermal is very low right now in Europe; the metallurgical prices are very low over in Queensland right now. So, as we move towards the middle of the year, we expect to see a more firming in the rate structure, and we can tell you a little bit more towards the middle of the year what it looks like. But right now, we are sticking pretty much to the mid 30 ton, mid 30s in the export market.","Chris Wetherbee - Citi","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I appreciate that. And then Fred, I think three months ago, you sort of mentioned that the first half of the year when we thought about 2014 was going to be the where you were lapping some of the real-estate gains and other stuff yet in 2013. When you look at the second quarter with the volumes bouncing back with still some cost lingering, is that still the right way to think about the first half is going to sort of be a bit, sort of flat to downish on a year-over-year basis and then maybe you get a little bit of upside, is that sort of how your plan is building as you think about 2014 showing modest growth?","Fredrik Eliasson","Yes. I would say that probably flattish is a good way to think about the second quarter. I think we feel very good about the top-line. I think that you have still those things to cycle that you talked about real estate gains based on that what I said earlier liquidated damage probably down a little bit in the second quarter as well.","And then we will have some lingering cost there for a period of time because of the fact that our network is not running as well, but offsetting that is a more vibrant top-line especially in the coal side and we expect it. So I think flattish is probably good place in the second quarter and then from there, we have to produce earnings growth for the rest of the year to get into that modest earnings growth for the year.","Chris Wetherbee - Citi","Do you think you mostly cut up on volume by the end of the second quarter, is that how the plan would sort of trend?","Fredrik Eliasson","I would think that based on what you\u2019ve seen here in the last few weeks where volumes are up double-digit that that would be a good assumption.","Chris Wetherbee - Citi","Okay. Thanks very much for the time. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning Allison.","","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse","Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. So, I wanted to ask the question about core operating margins. And if I am adjusting both this quarter and the prior year for all the unusual items including weather or liquidated damages, real estate gains, the fuel lag et cetera, it doesn\u2019t appear that there was very much operating leverage on the 3% volume growth during the quarter. So, I wanted to ask how we should think about contribution margins for the balance of the year, considering both the rate cuts on the export coal side and the fact that you plan to bring on additional locomotive and people.","Fredrik Eliasson","","Yes. So obviously it was a noisy quarter in terms of the ins and outs. But I think you are right, if you do adjust for the real estate gains in both the years, you adjust for the fact that you did have weather impact here, and you will see that you had modest earnings growth year-over-year. And now that\u2019s an even factor in also the fact that we had taken our export rate down quite significantly. So once you adjust for all these things, we as I said in my previous answers, the core earnings growth of our company and margin expansion is still very healthy, we\u2019re just dealing with a lot of factors right now that we have to cycle through. And as we get through this, real estate gains will be behind us here as we get through the second quarter where the tail end I think of what we reasonably can do on the export side; and the rest of the business is doing good; coal on the domestic side is coming back. We feel we\u2019re going to return back to normal incremental margins going forward. But it\u2019s just a lot of noise right now that prevents us from coming down to the bottom line.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse","","Okay. And a follow-up question on the tax rate benefit during the quarter. I did notice that there was a comment in the earnings review that the future corporate tax rate would be reduced. I mean should we expect sort of a similar tax rate as we saw in 1Q or is there any sort of prior period catch up?","Fredrik Eliasson","","No, we had a -- this is a state legislative tax change that impacted our earnings by $0.02 here in this quarter that made effective tax rate 34%. If you just ask for that, we were right at 37.6%. So, our guidance has always been somewhere around 38%, that\u2019s very conservative place to be and then we think that we should be the place going forward as well.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse","Okay. So, I guess in terms of the comment that said that this will reduce the future corporate income tax rate, is that\u2026","Fredrik Eliasson","I don\u2019t know about that comment.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse","Okay.","Fredrik Eliasson","So maybe David will talk about it later, but there is -- nothing has changed in terms of our overall tax and we would like to of course have a lower tax rate. But nothing is imminent around that.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse","Perfect. Okay. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning Rob.","Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank","Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. Fred you had called out about 7 million incremental utility coal counts you guys are going to be taking on that you have got now line of sight into the back half of the year. How should we think about this as we look out to 2015 as well? Does this give you guys conviction that we\u2019re going to see utility coal point that we stabilize to growth as we look out even in spite of some of the, I think the 4 million tons that you\u2019re expecting to go in \u201814 and \u201815 from some plant closures?","Fredrik Eliasson","Well, a couple of things there in your question just to clarify. So first of all, we do see several million tons of incremental demand here this year, because of the cold winter. Then I think your question was around 2015 and beyond the impact of map. And what we have said is that as we look at the movement of coal for 2013 into plants that we expect to be close, because of map, we have identified 7 million tons that we think is going to come out between \u201814 through \u201818 essentially. 4 million of those tons we think is going to come out in \u201814 and \u201815 and the remaining 3 million in the years beyond that between \u201816, \u201817 and \u201918. Does that answer your question?","Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank","That answers that question with regard to the several million tons that are coming out in the back half of the year. Will we have continued -- are you expecting that, do you have line of sight in terms of that traffic looking out \u201815 as well where you have got a lot of conviction that utility coal volumes, how that be stabilized and are growing as we look out over the next several years?","Clarence Gooden","","Well Rob, this is Clarence. We expect that our growth in coal continues in through 2015. In fact the growth for the rest of this year in utility coal will be in the mid to the high single digits as a lot of those plants that Fredrik has talked about is that will be closed in those years in terms of tons, the other plants that will remain open will simply run harder to absorb those tonnage.","Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank","Thanks, appreciate the color.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","","Good morning.","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna","Good morning, guys. One for Clarence here, we\u2019ve talked pretty extensively about export coal pricing pressure over the last couple of years. And you said again today that you kind of [have been] to what you can do to help incentivize your customer\u2019s competitiveness in that market. If my math is right, it looks like that yields have come down a bit on domestic side of business over the last few quarters as well. I know you called out mix earlier but can you directionally kind of walk us through what\u2019s driving that drop in domestic yields between mix and any pricing or fuel that\u2019s in there as well?","Clarence Gooden","","Well as I said earlier on the mix side, the [plus point] preponderantly in the mix, the utility coal which carries a much lower rate than those, the northern utility coal which carries a much lower rate than the southern utility coal is up about 22% this year. The southern utility coal which carries a considerably higher rate due to the much longer length of haul was down about 6% then when you put it in the export coal which we said has been slightly down in terms of rates. Those three combinations that put down have led to the lower RPU, very little of that has been driven at all by the fixed variable charges in our coal rates. So, that\u2019s the principle preponderant drive.","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna","Okay. And a bit more broadly on the similar theme, you talked about competitive gains helping your domestic coal volumes this quarter. What\u2019s the competitive dynamic like in that business today and has the volatility we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years given you more opportunities to go after your competitors\u2019 business and vice versa than after yours?","Clarence Gooden","Not really, it was a single account in the north that the customers put up more competitive bid and involved the one-time issue. So, we really haven\u2019t had many opportunities in that area at all.","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna","Is there any way to quantify how much of that is driving your domestic gain which you talked about in the previous question?","Clarence Gooden","Very little is driving our domestic gain in that area, most of it has been a result of a burn in the northern utilities and their stockpile depletion.","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna","All right. Thanks for the time this morning.","Operator","Thanks. Your next question comes from Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Jeff","Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham","Hey, good morning everybody. Thank you very much. I think the point on the weather has been well made. But I have a question concerning some of the noise we\u2019ve been hearing on the regulatory side. And I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re prepared to comment, but there recently were hearings on the competitive switching, they\u2019ve put out some requests for recommendations on the revenue adequacy questions. How do you view the regulatory environment right now? And what are your thoughts out there on some of the discussions?","Michael Ward","Yes Jeff, this is Michael. So, on the export of 7\/11 which is the [met leave] proposal as you\u2019re well aware, we did testify at the March 26th hearing opposing that proposal, because it basically provides no public benefit at all.","The early possible beneficiaries -- and you may recall there is a study commissioned by the STB a number of years ago by the Christensen Group is that very few shippers would benefit to the detriment of everyone else and we think that\u2019s still true. It would degrade service, it would introduce uncertainty in the marketplace, disrupt our plans for growth and capital investments, strain prior investments.","And if you think about it, our witness Cressey Brown that day at the hearing did say that you could introduce a perpetual winter like we\u2019ve just seen because you\u2019ve been putting unnatural moves in there. So, we\u2019re hopeful that the STB in its wisdom will not do anything to disrupt what is working quite well today for our customers.","On the side of the revenue adequacy piece, we actually welcome that examination. As you know, that\u2019s an issue that\u2019s I think right for examination in that, no time of the past [leveraging] but anywhere close to revenue adequacy. Some of us are approaching that, but those issues around what is sustained revenue adequacy, how many years do you have to be doing it through a business cycle, what is the appropriate criteria. And we really welcomed that examination to try to bring better clarity to what will happen as the railroads continue to grow in their financial health.","And you\u2019d like to bring a question of replacement cost into that equation, because we do have to replace old assets with new dower. So, we think that\u2019s really right one and we\u2019re glad that they call for it.","Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham","Okay. Well, thank you very much and congratulations.","Michael Ward","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Your may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning Scott.","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","Hey, thanks. Good morning guys. Just want to clarify one think Clarence, did you guys have to take the export rates down further in 2Q as the new benchmark kicked in?","Clarence Gooden","Scott we did in a couple of lines with a couple of customers to make them competitive, yes.","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","Okay. On the intermodal side so nice volume growth, but still some pressure on the yields and wondering if that's a pricing thing, is that mix. I wouldn\u2019t think it's mix just with domestic growing faster than international, but maybe it's mix. And then with the truckload pricing that's really starting to get better, should we start to think about your intermodal pricing getting better going forward?","Clarence Gooden","Two answers, it was definitely and specifically weather related, it was definitely a mix, it was in our door-to-door product, it had almost 2.5% impact, it was in the spot market where we couldn't price because of the weather-related issues this quarter. The other pricing, the other areas was positive. Yes, we are seeing a firming in the spot market with truck capacity tightening up in the U.S. in just about every regional area that we serve. So, you are seeing a more firming in the truck pricing.","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","Okay, great. And then just last thing maybe for Oscar or Michael, you guys have done such a great job taking resources out of the network following \u201808, \u201809 after a winter like this and maybe with volumes getting better. Are there longer term implications or do you need to spend more capital or bring back on a more sustainable basis more people or equipment?","Oscar Munoz","Yes. Hi Scott, it's Oscar. Seeing the operations no longer the financial guy can always use a little more capital here and there. But generally we had adequate level of resources; it\u2019s just that the winter conditions were harsher than in a long, long period of time, which created a little bit of a log jam. I think there is a high level of learnings we\u2019ve had operationally that we\u2019ll obviously include, but we went into the year, into the start of the year with low locomotives, we\u2019ve done a lot of the work on the plan of road over the course of time.","And so from a long-term perspective, there are places that we will strategically sort of review with the coming thing, but nothing immediately evident that would have been that helpful. Chicago land terminal, which as you know is the interchange between all of the different railroads that\u2019s where the [create] project is really making a lot of that investment. And I think continuing that is probably the biggest investment the industry can make to make that fluidity in that location better.","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","","So, any implications on capital, it sounds like not really?","Oscar Munoz","","Not now.","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","","From CSX\u2019s perspective. Okay. All right, thanks for the time guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Seidl with Cowen & Company. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","","Good morning, Jason.","Jason Seidl - Cowen & Company","","Good morning, guys. Two quick questions here. One for Oscar, I\u2019m sorry one for Clarence. Clarence you mentioned you guys had to bring down some of the export rates due to the benchmark weakening a bit. If the benchmark starts recovering, how quickly can you bring those rates back up?","Clarence Gooden","","Within a quarter.","Jason Seidl - Cowen & Company","","Within a quarter. Okay. And the last question is for Michael. Michael I have done this a while and Chicago has always been a major interchange issue for the rail industry. It should have improved I guess over the last 10 years with (inaudible) [EJ and E&N] and taking some pressure off of sort of that downtown area? What\u2019s the need in going forward in terms of capital investments by the railroads maybe as jointly or with some help from the government because it\u2019s pretty much still sort of playing after all these years?","Michael Ward","Two things; one, you\u2019re certainly correct that we need to put some better infrastructure and that is the create project which we\u2019re in the process of working and there is money from the railroads, from the state of Illinois and federal money to improve the fluidity in Chicago. But I will remind you though, friendly we looked at the statistics in Chicago going back to I think it was 1871, they kept records from then. Normally you can have a cold winter or you can a snowy winter, you\u2019d rarely have both. This was the third snowiest winter in Chicago, the third coldest winter in Chicago. I think they had 32 snow days, they closed schools in Chicago, which is really rare. So, this is an extraordinarily tough winter that exacerbated some of the natural challenges in Chicago.","So yes, as an industry we are putting more capital in there, but I think we do need to put the context of how severe this winter was when we think of what happened this year.","Jason Seidl - Cowen & Company","And what happened this year, maybe accelerate some of the industry\u2019s plans to pick Chicago?","Michael Ward","Well, quite frankly the railroad piece, the money for the railroad elements of it because create not only helps the rail freight infrastructure; it also helps the commuters, it also helps the interface at [gray] crossings and those sorts of things. The money related to the rail freight infrastructure is being provided by the rails today. The federal and state money for the other aspects, the commuter and the interface, crossings et cetera is coming a little bit slower just because of some of the budget challenges in those states comparatively. So, that\u2019s moving at a slower pace, but the freight piece is moving forward faster.","Jason Seidl - Cowen & Company","","Okay. Gentlemen thank you for the time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning Ben.","Ben Hartford - Robert W. Baird","Hey, good morning guys. Just want to circle back Fredrik, we addressed this earlier in the Q&A but in terms of abandoning that sub-70 OR target for 2015. I want to understand the reasons I believe it\u2019s on the export coal side, specifically on the pricing side, but Clarence I think you as well have made a comment about volumes frankly in the first quarter being slightly stronger than you guys had anticipated and we know that the settlement prices are lower here on the margin in the second quarter. So Fredrik maybe if you could provide just some context into really what is driving the lack of confidence there for 2015, in terms of that line of sight to the sub-70 OR and when you say that you will need some help, is it simply on the export coal pricing front or are there other opportunities even at current pricing levels in the export market that would allow you that would provide for that help to get back into that sub-70 OR for 2015?","Fredrik Eliasson","","Sure. And I won\u2019t say we have abandoned it, what we said is that we need some help from where we see things today. As we do a bottoms up view of thing, we are going to need some help and that help can come from different places, it doesn\u2019t have to be from export coal, but particular to that while Clarence up, you are right, our export coal market has done better than we\u2019ve thought from a volume perspective, as you also heard, we will continue to make adjustments on the right side to make sure we optimize our bottom line and of course try to do what we can to keep the U.S. producers in the business.","At these low levels in terms of underlying commodity prices, it is unknown to us or it\u2019s difficult for us to predict, how long this would be able to sustain, how long will the producers be able to be competitive in marketplace. So until we see some sort of an uptick there, it\u2019s hard to be too bullish on 2015 in terms of what our overall volumes will do. But it's not defined to that, if we can as I said earlier get help from other places as well in terms of more price, more productivity, the economy is doing well. And so we continue to target, we continue to think that that's where we want to be. At the same time, one of the things that we try to do as a company is to be very transparent about how we see things and that's really I think pretty consistent with the two public appearance I had in the quarter in terms of saying what we need in order to be able to get there.","We certainly haven't given up volume, we certainly haven't abandoned it.","Ben Hartford - Robert W. Baird","Of course, okay. And then if I can ask a follow-on in terms of the mid 60s OR target longer term. Do you have comfort that at current global segment prices on the export coal market that you can -- that this mid 30 million tons run rate is an appropriate run rate going forward. And that with the component of productivity gains and volume growth and coal price growth, you have visibility overtime to be able to get to that mid 60s OR that how we should look at that longer term target?","Fredrik Eliasson","Yes, we think about pulling the three levers that we have, price, volume, productivity, so we do a long-term modeling. We still feel comfortable that we will be able to get that mid 60s level, obviously it\u2019s taken longer than we expected for that, because of the fact that we have lost $800 million from coal revenue in two years alone here and we still have some headwinds, we're facing this year. But even at the current levels as we model things out, we will get there overtime, it\u2019s just look at longer than we had anticipated originally.","Ben Hartford - Robert W. Baird","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thanks. Our next question comes from Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Your may ask your questions.","Michael Ward","Good morning Cherilyn.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities","Thanks very much and good morning. In your testimony before the STB last week I think I heard Cressey Brown indicate that you had recently acquired a new route through Chicago. And just given all of the focus on Chicago currently, I just wondered if you could give a bit of color on that and how it might be strategic to you going forward?","Michael Ward","","Yes Cherilyn, this is Michael. We acquired the Elliston sub of this Canadian National in our swap ratio. When they acquired the EJ&E, they didn\u2019t need that route any more. So, we acquired that from them and we are currently once this weather is broken we are making improvements to that route to allow additional fluidity in the Chicago area.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities","And how long would you expect those investments to take before you start seeing some benefits?","Oscar Munoz","","Those are -- Cherilyn, this is Oscar. By mid-year, let\u2019s say July we should be fully operational.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities","Okay. And then just one last quick question; in terms of the double-digit volume growth that we\u2019ve seen over the last couple weeks in your carloads, do you have any feel for how much of that is pent-up demand versus real organic traffic growth?","Oscar Munoz","","I think a lot of that is pent-up demand, but at the same time though we still feel that the economy, as I said in prepared remarks, continues to be very vibrant and we are also seeing our coal business now finally is picking up. So the underlying volume trend is also very positive, but there is no doubt that there is a fair amount of that double-digit volume growth that is related to just catching up of things we didn\u2019t move in the first quarter.","Michael Ward","","But I would add to that, the economy is forecast to grow let\u2019s call roughly 3%. We think our merchandise and intermodal business we can grow faster than that rate as we did last year, we will do this year as well. So we will be some amount above what that economy is doing with the great service product we\u2019ve been providing. So, we do need to temper down a little bit, because it is pent-up demand, but it\u2019s also a strong demand in the base business.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities","Great, thank you. That\u2019s all from me.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Vernon with Bernstein. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Hi David.","David Vernon - Bernstein","It\u2019s David Vernon with Bernstein.","Michael Ward","Hi David.","David Vernon - Bernstein","Hey good morning. Just maybe a higher level of question, if you think about the slower rate of operating margin development and keeping CapEx is higher, is there a point where you need to start thinking about the capital budget a little bit differently just to ensure overall returns are kind of getting to an upward trajectory?","Michael Ward","David, this is Michael. One, I think what I think is the slower operating margin growth; I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d necessary agree to that base premise. I mean if we look at our business and strip out the effect of the loss of that coal business over the last couple of years, we are in the high single to low double-digits growth on the other businesses, and once we get through this transition, we will produce that kind of growth.","Now to do that we have to make the investments necessary to support it, so that 16% to 17% of revenues that we\u2019ve held with the last few years, we still think that is the appropriate level. We do need to make strategic investments in our intermodal as we\u2019re going to capture that growth opportunity, we think there are 9 million truckloads out there that we can go after and we have to make the investments necessary to do so. So we still think the 16 to 17 is the appropriate level and it will produce value for our shareholders as we grow the business and the margins.","David Vernon - Bernstein","You don\u2019t get concerned at all about the asset turns created by the mix headwind towards lower revenue intermodal?","Michael Ward","No, because of lots of lower revenue doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a lower margin. So if we look at the margins on the intermodal business it\u2019s as good as our other margins for our merchandise businesses. So, as good margin business it\u2019s lower RPU, but what we get paid for doing is producing margin not necessarily revenue per unit. So we think it\u2019s good business and we\u2019ll lower the overall RPU, but we\u2019ll increase our profitability, which is what we really need to do.","David Vernon - Bernstein","All right, I appreciate the time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Walter Spracklin with RBC. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning Walter","Walter Spracklin - RBC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my call here. I just have two follow-up questions really, one is for Clarence on the export coal side and the guidance that you provided with regards to the neutral on the second quarter, I know Chris kind of asked this. But just to clarify, if we reflect in -- you did 11.5 million tons last year, you did 10.5 last quarter even though we do say 10.5 this quarter it would imply a step down of over 20% in the back half of the year to get to about 36 million tons. So I just -- is that what you are guiding or are we just giving a little bit more room for upside in the case that\u2019s the back half turns out to be better than we are expecting?","Clarence Gooden","Walter I guess someone was to hint me up (inaudible) what are you really guiding? I\u2019m guiding that this market is very volatile that has a $120 a ton in Queensland, you will get there, your guess is as good as mine, it is extremely volatile. With thermal coal sale in Europe between $75 and $79 a ton, some of the things we\u2019ve seen in the first quarter really defy what has been historical norm. It\u2019s highly speculative, we\u2019ve worked with our producers to try to stay in the marketplace right now and it\u2019s just too soon for us to bid on. So we\u2019ve got a fairly clear line of sight of what the next two, three months look like, but to tell you what the third and fourth quarter looks like is just going way out in the [lamp].","Walter Spracklin - RBC","Okay, all right. That makes a lot of sense. Okay. I appreciate that color. Staying with you Clarence here on intermodal pricing, again a clarification question, lot of moving parts in the last few quarters with regards to fuel recapture or quite the opposite of lower fuel surcharge, firming truckload market or trucking market. If we strip all that out now on a base level going forward, we do see average RPU in intermodal flat or up going forward?","Clarence Gooden","Up.","Walter Spracklin - RBC","Okay. That's all my questions. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Justin Long with Stephens. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning.","Justin Long - Stephens","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions, first one I had was on core pricing. You talked about overall core pricing being up about 50 basis points year-over-year, but could you talk about the headwind this number saw from the lower level of rail inflation. I'm just trying to understand the overall core pricing environment absent any changes in inflationary mechanisms. Would you describe it as stable or are you seeing some type of moderation?","Clarence Gooden","Well, you saw core inflation was around 1.4% from global insight. When you took coal out of the mix, we were about 2.6% that was down from what it was a year ago, which was around 3.3% in the merchandise and the intermodal markets.","So, we are pricing above rail inflation in our basic markets. The coal markets are being mainly impacted and influenced what's happening in the global coal market. So I would tell you that we are seeing stability in our general freight, in our general merchandise markets. As we are seeing capacity demands as just witnessed by the previous questions, we think that will firm up through the year as we go forward from where we are today. Depending on what happens to these coal markets, we think we have seen the near bottom start to approach in global markets in coal. So, the trend should be upward in the future in there.","Justin Long - Stephens","Okay, thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And as a follow up, I was wondering if you could talk about the industrial development opportunity and your current pipeline of projects seems to be pretty robust, is there any possible way to quantify how much this could contribute to volume growth in 2014.","Michael Ward","","I don\u2019t have that number right off the top of my head. I am sorry.","Justin Long - Stephens","Okay, that\u2019s fine. Maybe you could just provide some color on some of the opportunities as far as industrial development and what you are seeing and just kind of how that pipeline looks in general?","Michael Ward","","Well one of the things that we are seeing as a result of the expansion in the oil and the gas industry is a lot of the development is happening in the Marcellus area with fractionators either located on CSX or on the short lines that be into CSX. We have 5 new fractionating facilities located on. So each one of those are producing between 15 and 20 cars a day of byproducts of the gas industry that are coming on to CSX. That\u2019s positive for us. We have 2 new ethylene crackers that have been announced on CSX as a result of that. So those tend to be for lack better phrase, [annuities] going forward for us on CSX. So you are seeing a lot of developments in those areas.","In the last I guess 18 months we have seen a lot of activity in general in industrial development as economies begin to expand with new industries on CSX. I think last year we announced almost $1.5 billion, $2 billion worth of new industries that are locating on CSX. So you are seeing a lot of economic activity now as economy is getting to expand.","Justin Long - Stephens","Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll leave it at that. I appreciate the time.","Michael Ward","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar. You may ask your question.","Michael Ward","Good morning Keith.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar","Yes, thanks. I am in Chicago and actually calling you from an igloo this morning. I\u2019d appreciate those comments on uncertainty of export coal demand and wanted turn to domestic with a couple of quick questions. Fredrik mentioned expectations of 2015 was probably the midyear and domestic coal volumes. I know there is no crystal ball, but I just want to clarify for your thinking that based on current information you expect domestic coal will be flat or up from here on say indefinitely next 3 to 5 years?","Fredrik Eliasson","No, no, we expect growth in the mid to high single-digits for the rest of this year in 2014 in domestic coal.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar","And then beyond the current year?","Fredrik Eliasson","Well I expect 2015 also be -- I don\u2019t see much beyond 2015 right now at this point.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar","Okay. And then if I recall correctly, Illinois and Powder River Basins constitute about half of your recent utility carloads. And I\u2019d like to ask about your expectations for next same time period 2 to 3 years from now?","Fredrik Eliasson","2 to 3 years, right now you\u2019re right; it\u2019s running just slightly above 50% in both of those markets. So, we expect to see growth continuing in both, particularly in the Illinois Basin coals.","Michael Ward","We\u2019re actually making capital investments on that line near Illinois Basin to allow us to muster those unit trains more efficiently. When is that expected to be done, Oscar?","Oscar Munoz","Again probably third quarter of this year.","Michael Ward","So we\u2019re putting infrastructure in because we do think that Illinois Basin is going to be a continual growing market for us.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar","You did that infrastructure\u2019s track?","Michael Ward","It\u2019s (inaudible) to be able to assemble unit trains and move them more efficiently.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from (inaudible) Macquarie Capital. You may ask your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. And thank you for your patience. My first question relates to again the outlook for the export coal market. Could you help us understand your leverage to recovery in met-coal across your book of business contracted and spot and also what your assumptions are with regards to this market in your guidance or double-digit EPS growth for next year?","Michael Ward","The leverage in met-coal, is that your question?","Clarence Gooden","The rebound, what kind of leverage\u2026","Unidentified Analyst","Yes, how fast can you benefit from recovery in pricing? And then on volumes given that you have mix of contracted and spot business and if you could also clarify how much of your contracted business is up for renewal this year, that will also help?","Michael Ward","Okay. Our export coal business is priced on quarterly basis. So our ability to leverage and to response to the marketplace, we would be able to do so on a quarterly basis.","Clarence Gooden","So bid upticks, we can move\u2026","Michael Ward","And this fall within the quarter.","Unidentified Analyst","All right. And with regards to your guidance for \u201815, what kind of outlook do you have embedded for export coal?","Oscar Munoz","I think what we have said is that, that is one market that we are concerned about in terms of how long we can see the sort of positive volume despite having the underlying commodity markets as weak as they are, but we haven\u2019t given a specific number in terms of what we are assuming for 2015.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you. And my follow-up is really regards to the past to your mid 60s operating ratio long term, can you help or shed some light on to, into what you mean by long term and the main drivers especially from the hurdle put by this hard winter?","Oscar Munoz","Well, in terms of the mid 60s, we\u2019ve talked about earlier on the call today. And we -- because of the fact that we\u2019ve lost so much momentum in the $800 million of coal revenue that\u2019s gone away, it has been pushed out longer than we have originally anticipated, we are going to have to get there little differently than our original plans, but we are still confident and as we look at our long-term modeling, as we look at our pricing, productivity and volume opportunities that we will get there, we are not going to put a timeframe on it today, but clearly that we need to be long term in order to be able to reinvest in the business the way we wanted to be able to do.","Unidentified Analyst","So, it could be [3 or 5] I guess?","Oscar Munoz","We have not put a timeframe on that.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you very much.","Michael Ward","Well, everyone thank you for your attendance, interest in the company. And we\u2019ll talk to you again next quarter.","Operator","Thank you. And this concludes today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call.

","For opening remarks and introduction I would like to turn the call over to Mr. David Baggs, Vice President of Capital Markets and Investor Relations for CSX Corporation.","David Baggs","Thank you, Wendy and good morning everyone. And again welcome to CSX Corporation\u2019s fourth quarter 2014 earnings presentation. The presentation material that we will review this morning, along with our expanded financial quarterly report and our safety and service measurements, are available on our website at csx.com under the Investor section. In addition, following the presentation this morning, a webcast and podcast replay will be available on the same website.","This morning, our presentation will be led by Michael Ward, the Company\u2019s Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; and Fredrik Eliasson, our Chief Financial Officer. In addition Clarence Gooden, our Chief Sales and Marketing Officer and Oscar Munoz, our Chief Operating Officer will be available during the question-and-answer session. ","Let me remind everyone that the presentation and other statements made by the company contain forward-looking statements. You are encouraged to review the company\u2019s disclosure in the accompanying presentation on slide two. This disclosure identifies forward-looking statements as well as the uncertainties and risks that could cause actual performance to differ materially from the results anticipated by these statements. ","In addition at the end of the presentation we will conduct a question-and-answer session with the research analysts. With about 30 analysts now covering CSX I would ask, as a courtesy for everyone, to please limit your inquiries to one primary and one follow-up question. And with that let me turn the presentation over to CSX Corporation's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Michael Ward. Michael?","Michael J. Ward","Well, thank you David and good morning everyone. Yesterday, CSX reported fourth quarter earnings per share of $0.49, up 17% from $0.42 in the same period last year. This represents a new fourth quarter record for the company. Revenue grew 5% in the quarter to $3.2 billion, also a fourth quarter record with broad based growth across nearly all of our markets, reflecting continued economic momentum. Furthermore, the timely addition of operating resources enhanced through the peak and supported strong volume growth. As a result operating income increased 11% to a new fourth quarter record of $901 million and the operating ratio improved 140 basis points to 71.8%. This quarter's performance is further evidence of CSX's ability to capitalize on economic growth thus helping to drive strength across the company's diverse markets.","Turning to the next slide I'll discuss our full year performance. The past four years have been transformative for CSX and we have emerged a stronger company for our customers and shareholders. That strength drove new full year records in 2014 for revenue at $12.7 billion, operating income at $3.6 billion and earnings per share of a $1.92 and the operating ratio remained essentially stable at 71.5%. That's an extraordinary testament to the work of the CSX employees because it follows a period during which we lost nearly $900 million of coal revenue as the country transitioned through changes in the energy sector. At the same time the diversity of CSX's business mix generated revenue more than offsetting these coal losses. That growth combined with inflation plus pricing, efficiency gains, and cash deployment for share buybacks generated modest earnings growth for the shareholders during this transition period. ","These financial results are continued evidence that the company's employees, core strategy and diverse business mix can create sustainable value for shareholders even in an evolving and challenging business environment. With strategic infrastructure investments, locomotives and operating employees coming online, we expect service levels to gradually improve throughout 2015 to superior levels. ","With that I'll turn the presentation over to Fredrik, who will take us through the top and bottom line results in more detail. Fredrik?","Fredrik Eliasson","Thank you, Michael and good morning everyone. Let me begin by providing a summary of our fourth quarter results. As Michael mentioned, revenue increased 5% versus the prior year on 6% higher volume, driven by broad based strength across merchandise, intermodal and coal. Expenses increased 3% versus last year, driven primarily by higher volume and included a $39 million G&A workforce reduction charge. ","Operating income was $901 million, up 11% or $88 million versus the prior year. Looking below the line, interest expense and other income were slightly favorable versus the prior year period and income taxes were $284 million in the quarter, reflecting higher pretax earnings for an effective tax rate of approximately 37%. Overall, net earnings were $491 million and EPS was $0.49 per share, up 15% and 17% respectively versus the prior year period. ","Now let me turn to the market outlook for the first quarter. Looking forward, we expect a positive demand environment in the first quarter with stable to favorable conditions for 96% of our markets and unfavorable conditions for the remaining 4%. Looking at some of the key markets chemicals is favorable as we continue to capture opportunities in the domestic oil and gas industry. Housing starts are expected to rise considerably in 2015, which should drive a favorable outlook across our construction markets, forest products, minerals and waste and equipment. Automotive is favorable, driven by growth in North American light vehicle production and the recovery of volume lost to trucking last year. ","Strong intermodal growth will continue as our strategic network investment supports highway-to-rail conversions. We expect domestic coal volume growth will be strong in the first quarter attributable to cycling weaker first quarter 2014 volume and a new iron ore facility. Export coal volume is expected to be significantly lower in the first quarter, reflecting continued soft global market conditions. For the full year our best estimate at this time is around 30 million tons. Overall we anticipate high demand levels for our service will continue in the first quarter. ","Turning to the next slide, let me talk about our expectations for expenses in the first quarter. Beginning with labor and fringe, despite G&A workforce reductions we expect first quarter average headcount to increase sequentially by 1% as we continue to ramp up operating employees to accommodate higher volume. This represents a 4% increase versus the prior year. We expect 2015 labor inflation to be around $35 million per quarter in the first half and then moderate to around $25 million per quarter in the second half. This represents an increase from the $29 [ph] per quarter level seen in 2014, driven by union wage inflation and payroll taxes. The union component is consistent with what you should expect to see across the industry as a result of national bargaining and reflects both the carryover of the July 1, 2014 wage increase as well as the January 1, 2015 increase. In addition you will recall that we amended a locomotive maintenance agreement in June of 2014, which resulted in a $15 million shift between labor and MS&O expense lines in both the third and the fourth quarters. This trend will continue in 2015 and we will be cycling the expense shift during the first half of the year.","Looking at MS&O expense we expect the first quarter to be driven by inflation and volume growth in line with the trend seen during 2014. Fuel expense in the first quarter will be driven by lower cost per gallon, reflecting the current price environment, higher volume and continued fuel efficiency through technology and process initiatives. We expect depreciation to increase around $10 million versus the prior year in each quarter in 2015. This reflects the ongoing investment in our business partially offset by an asset life study conducted in the fourth quarter. Finally equipment and other rents in the first quarter is expected to increase year-over-year driven by higher freight car rates and incremental volume.","Now let me talk about our capital investment plan for 2015. In 2015 CSX plans to invest $2.5 billion in our business. This represents a moderate increase from the 2014 level and core investment is expected to be about 17% of revenue. In the chart on the left you can see that about half the capital investment will be used to maintain core infrastructure to help ensure a safe and fluid network. Equipment investment in locomotives and freight cars ensure CSX has an appropriate level of rolling stock to support commercial demand and improve on time performance levels. In addition we will continue to focus on strategic investment to support long-term profitable growth and productivity initiatives. In 2015 we are prioritizing infrastructure projects that will increase line of road capacity on the northern tier to improve fluidity and system velocity. ","Finally looking at our investment in Positive Train Control, we have invested $1.2 billion through the end of 2014 and plan to invest an additional $300 million in 2015. As the implementation of PTC extends over a longer period of time we anticipate spending at least $400 million beyond 2015. As a result our current estimate for the total cost of PTC is at least $1.9 billion.","Now let me wrap up on the next slide. Overall CSX delivered solid financial performance in 2014, with robust volume growth offsetting the impact of last year\u2019s weather, network performance and a weak coal pricing environment. We continue to see broad-based strength across our diverse business portfolio and the strength is translating into more visible and more meaningful earnings improvements. CSX achieved double-digit earnings growth in both the third and the fourth quarters and incremental operating margins expanded throughout the year. For the full year 2015 CSX still expects to achieve double digit EPS growth. Even as we cycle strong 2014 volume growth we expect merchandise and intermodal to again grow at a faster pace than the broader economy.","We continue to target pricing above inflation as capacity remains tight across all modes of transportation and we expect to deliver productivity savings approaching $200 million in 2015. Domestic coal volume should remain relatively stable in 2015 while the export coal market remains challenged. That said we will be keeping a close watch on natural gas prices and heating and cooling degree days as we move through the year. ","Finally we expect margin expansion to resume in 2015 which reflects improving service levels, a strong pricing environment and continued economic expansion. Over the longer term we continue to target an operating ratio in the mid-60s. ","With that let me turn the presentation back to Michael for his closing remarks.","Michael J. Ward","Thank you, Fredrik. The strong 2014 demand reinforced the importance of freight rail industry and CSX in supporting the global supply chain and American competitiveness, the economic and environmental benefits of freight rail network increasingly serve a country with a growing population and a critical need for transportation infrastructure. To continue delivering these benefits and creating value for its shareholders CSX has transformed itself by forging new capabilities aligned with opportunities in energy, manufacturing, agriculture and global commerce. We are generating record results by leveraging the most diverse business risk -- business mix in the company's history with new opportunities across nearly all of the markets we serve. ","We remain focused on executing our core strategy of delivering service excellence for our customers, which drives our ability to grow merchandize and intermodal businesses faster than the economy, twice above the inflation and continue to drive improvements in asset utilization. The company is poised for a bright future of strong financial returns and expansion and we thank you for your ownership of and interest in CSX. ","Now we'll be glad to take your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conduction a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. The first question is from Tom Wadewitz with UBS.","Michael J. Ward ","Good morning Tom. ","Thomas Wadewitz ","Good morning, Michael, Fredrik, David. Wanted to see if you could talk a bit about utility coal and I guess your visibility to stockpiles. And also how much risk you see if natural gas prices stay at current levels or go below in terms of switching from coal to gas and how that might effect?","Clarence W. Gooden","Good morning, Tom. This is Clarence. ","Thomas Wadewitz","Yeah, hi Clarence. ","Clarence W. Gooden","We see the stockpiles, both in the north and the south are pretty much where we expected them to be. They're at normal levels, in both the north and the south. We think the comps in the first quarter will be very favorable for us, when you look at the -- what the weather was last year versus what the weather is this year. Yes, these gas prices stay where they are now, which are around $3 or sub $3 there could be some downside risk out in the quarters two and three from what we have planned. But for right now it looks to us like the rest of the year should be around flat going forward. ","Thomas Wadewitz","Okay, great. And then the, I guess the follow-up question we had such a dramatic move in oil prices. I think it's hard to get your arms around where, what the impact could be across your book. Obviously there could be some risk accrued by rail or frac sand and pipe and so forth. But I guess given what you see right now, if you look to the second half of the year would you expect that to come through and drive weakness in those areas or how would you look at, maybe not just first quarter but out a little bit more in terms of effective lower oil prices on your book of business. ","Michael J. Ward ","Right now, as we look out through 2015 we don't see any significant impact at all in our crude oil by rail into the eastern markets and certainly in our frac sand markets where we're moving into the Utica and the Marcellus area, where the natural gas and the natural gas liquids are we don't think it will impact the frac sands that we're moving into those areas at all. ","Thomas Wadewitz","Okay, great, thanks for the time. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse.","Michael J. Ward ","Good morning Allison.","Allison Landry","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Following up on Tom's question, how are you thinking about the sort of broader economic tailwinds that result from lower oil prices and if we think about as an area where, let\u2019s just say for arguments say that we have crude and anything shale related evaporates. How we think about where you could see upside in intermodal or some of your other lines of business? ","Michael J. Ward ","Allison, we feel very positive about it. There has been some studies that come out that essentially only ten states have employment that\u2019s directly impacted by the oil boom, is less than 2% of the U.S. population. For us the crude by rail is less than 2% of our business. It -- for the average U.S. tax -- U.S. person it\u2019s like a tax break of almost $2000 a year. So puts a lot of dollars into the economy. From any indication that we see it\u2019s a positive experience for the American tax payer, for the American economy. So I think lower crude oil prices is a very positive for our economy and very positive for CSX. ","Allison Landry","Okay, great. And then as my follow-up question, the $200 million of productivity gains, that's quite a bit higher than what you\u2019ve generated in the last few years, which has averaged, I think $130 million to $140 million. Is this inclusive of the incremental or unusual weather expense that you saw last year or is that sort of on top of the $200 million? ","Oscar Munoz ","Allison, this is Oscar Munoz. I think a portion of that number is weather, although not as significant as you might think, probably 15% of that number roughly. ","Allison Landry","Okay.","Fredrik Eliasson","So to clarify on the $200 million, so what we have is the operation\u2019s normal target of about $130 million to $150 million plus we have about $50 million that is linked to the G&A workforce reduction program, that we outlined, the severance charge in our fourth quarter. ","Allison Landry","Okay. And then the rest could be weather?","Fredrik Eliasson","Part of the operations, productivity savings is to cycle what we cycle last year.","Allison Landry","Okay.","Fredrik Eliasson","As Oscar outlined. ","Allison Landry","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank.","Michael J. Ward ","Good morning Rob.","Robert Salmon","Hey, good morning guys. As a follow-up to Allison's question, could you give us a sense in terms of what sort of network, how you're expecting the network to return to normal, and what sort of key velocity and what metrics we should be looking for as you're thinking about that $200 million? ","Michael J. Ward ","Thanks Rob. So the productivity initiatives are broad and across a lot of different aspects, volume absorption, specific initiatives from the weather, winter, sort of overlap. But I think if you think of the incremental resources that are coming on line it's going to just re-establish the discipline that we've had over the past three or four years around the internal operations of both scheduled and the unscheduled networks. And specifically while velocity would be a bit of a lagging indicator as we dwell on the public measures you see, I think dwell in particular will be a key metric to watch. Internally we have intermediate and home terminal dwell that we're monitoring, but I think the dwell, I think will be an area that you can focus on and that when it stops dwelling there it increases cost in a big way and that'll be the first focus and benefit from the incremental resources. ","Robert Salmon","That's helpful and did you guys quantify the savings expectations for the employee management, workforce reduction program and was any realized in the fourth quarter?","Michael J. Ward ","So the estimate is about $50 million for the overall program which labor is the largest part of that but there is also some other MS&O savings and to the question around if anything was realized on the fourth quarter, no none was realized really in the fourth quarter. ","Robert Salmon","Perfect. Thanks for your time guys.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs. ","Michael J. Ward ","Good morning, Thomas. ","Thomas Kim ","Good morning. I just wanted to ask about the fuel surcharges. If we go back through history, the last time oil prices collapsed the way they did, your recovery was quite effective in capturing the fuel cost savings. And as we look forward to this year with obviously the precipitous drop, do you think that your fuel surcharges are well placed to ensure that you're able to fully sort of neutralize the impact of lower surcharges with the drop in fuel?","Fredrik Eliasson","This is Fredrik. Yes we do think we have a fuel surcharge mechanism that is effective. It's not a profit driver but it makes us neutral to fuel price volatility. There are periods such as when the prices decline that we get the lag benefit which we saw here in the fourth quarter and likewise when fuel rises our fuel surcharge mechanism lags a little bit. So we have a little bit of detriment there. But overall the fuel surcharge is working well and we think that we are neutral to any sort of price volatility with the exception of the lag effect. ","Thomas Kim ","That's great, and that's very helpful. And I guess just in terms of this decrease, obviously certainly beneficial for customers. How do you think this helps you in terms of your ability to push through higher GRIs during the course of the year versus some general pricing?","Clarence W. Gooden","Well, Thomas, this is Clarence. I think it's positive for us. It's less cost obviously overall in the package to the customer. So as we push for our price increases it makes it more powerful as we go to the customer and the overall package.","Thomas Kim ","Great. Thanks very much. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley.","Michael J. Ward ","Good morning, Bill.","William Greene","Hi. Good morning. Clarence, can I ask you to follow-up a little bit on that pricing comment. So I would guess that we are going to start lapping some of the big export coal price declines, so that's going to make our comps, I would think a bit easier in '15 and of course the overall market is a lot stronger, particularly on the truck side. So I think that would be helpful to your pricing dynamic. So is there any flaw in the logic to think that pricing for CSX in \u201815 should be stronger than it was in \u201814. ","Clarence W. Gooden","No, I think you're absolutely correct. I think you'll see much stronger pricing in \u201915 than you did in '14, absolutely. ","William Greene","Okay so and then maybe for Fredrik or for Oscar, as we think about the cost structure in so far as volumes disappoint us this year, so they're unexpectedly weak, how much of your cost structure is variable, how much can you sort of tweak that $200 million higher if you had to and how much is more fixed such that as you dedicate these resources, locomotives, employees to move the current volume, we run the risk that we create a higher fixed cost structure in the second half, let's say. ","Fredrik Eliasson","Well, and I think if you go back to 2008-2009 timeframe, you can see what we did there, which was pretty remarkable in terms of variabalizing the cost structure. And in this scenario that we don't think that you're going to be -- you're correctly predicting or forecasting but if volume will be softer than we are currently anticipating we do have the opportunity to take cost out more than what we have in the current plan. And we have proven that in the past that our cost structure is more variable than perhaps might some people might think. ","William Greene","Yeah, I think helpful to note that volume is not [inaudible].","Fredrik Eliasson","Correct.","Oscar Munoz ","And we're answering a hypothetical question, Bill. I know specifically when you think of crews and locomotives, our most expensive aspect of that, I've got roughly a 1000 people in the pipeline and I've got roughly a 1000 people potential attrition. So that I think offset in itself and then on the locomotive side we've got least returns that we can work through. So I think citing back to the old days of '08, '09 when we sort of did the math and proved the variability that has come into this industry. So we monitor that very closely. ","William Greene","Yeah, no, things look stronger obviously. It's more just folks worried if, is the oil price indicative of some weakening that\u2019s bound down to come. So just trying to think through what your flexibility is. Thanks for the time. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch.","Michael J. Ward ","Good morning, Ken. ","Ken Hoexter","Good morning. Just a quick question on export coal, can you, guys can you talk about what is left on contract within the export side and what is still variable, just looking at the market rate it just seems like stuff that export coal side just shouldn't moving at these prices. So maybe just some thoughts on the export side. ","Michael J. Ward ","Well, we have about 40% of the export contracts are currently -- export coal movements are currently under contract. The rest of it is up for negotiation. That answer your question?","Ken Hoexter","Yeah, is that kind of typical at the 40% or is that obviously increasing amounts coming on too?","Michael J. Ward ","I would say that's fairly typical this early in the cycle. Most of those are metallurgical contracts, as you're aware tend to go more on quarterly basis, but still tend to follow traditional line of thinking, which pretty much settles in March April. ","Ken Hoexter","Okay and then just a follow up on the service metrics issue. You hit on the dwell and velocity. Oscar can you talk about the on-time performance, just seems like it continues to remain at that 50% level. What needs to happen to get that back, is that decreasing congestion, is it just fixing something, getting more locomotives and crew. Can you walk us through that a little bit?","Oscar Munoz ","Yeah, we really are down to that point, Ken and locomotives are the biggest, last sort of aspect of this and we've got 200 over the course of 2014 and roughly 100 here in the first quarter, another 150 or so in the second quarter and our service measures and lot of things will be almost pretty significantly correlated to the arrivals of those locomotives. Crews have been trickling in over the course of the year. So we're in pretty decent shape there. It is a power issue up against this great volume that we're getting. It's important to know we are in essence open for business. Our fluidity has gotten a little bit better across the network. Our cost structure is improving. I mean the span around our misses is a little bit narrower. We got crews and locomotives coming online, and the infrastructure that we've been building has improved fluidity. So we're feeling good about where we are starting the year. ","Ken Hoexter","Wonderful, appreciate the time.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. ","Michael J. Ward ","Good morning Brandon. ","Keith Mori","Hi good morning. This is Keith Mori on for Brandon. Could you give us an idea of the cost associated with improving service levels this quarter tied to the recovery? And kind of when should we think these costs start to go away? Oscar you mentioned that service levels are starting to improve, the cost structure starting to improve, should we start to think that\u2019s a first half event?","Fredrik Eliasson","Yeah, so this is Fredrik. I think if you go back to the third quarter we were somewhere around $15 million to $20 million, so what we call service-related cost, the network wasn\u2019t -- the performance level we wanted, the fluidity wasn't there, so extra overtime and equipment rent and so forth. Here in the fourth quarter probably pretty similar to that and as Oscar outlined as we get the additional locomotives we should see the fluidity improve and therefore see reduction in overtime and improvement in our equipment rents et cetera and that\u2019s going to come gradually. I think it\u2019s unrealistic to think that it\u2019s going to be meaningful here in the first quarter because while the weather has cooperated so far we are not through it yet and generally that slows things down but as you get to the second quarter and we get the brunt of the equipment specific to the locomotives that we are expecting, I think at that point and late in the second quarter I think you should start seeing some significant improvements.","Keith Mori","Okay. And I guess the follow-up, what kind of inspired kind of the recent workforce reduction program? When you look across the operations are there any other strategic initiatives that you can kind of point to or talk about that are similar type cost impacts?","Fredrik Eliasson","Well, I think in terms of the G&A workforce reduction, it simply was an opportunity for us to streamline some functions, stop doing some of the things that we has been doing and just process changes allowed us to be little bit more aggressive there. We\u2019ve had a program in place for six, seven years now to try to offset inflation. We have been able to do that but this was just a way to be a little bit more aggressive on that side. We, through the pipeline of productivity initiatives that we have as a company not just for \u201815 and \u201816 and \u201917, where we try to get that $130 million, $150 million a year. We continue to work very hard. That\u2019s a big part of the value equation for CSX and has been over the last decade. It\u2019s going to continue to be over the next decade.","Keith Mori","All right. Thank you for the time.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Chris Wetherbee with Citi Research.","Michael J. Ward","Good morning, Chris.","Chris Wetherbee ","Hey, good morning guys, thanks. When you think about the double-digit earnings growth for 2015 and you look at sort of the various buckets of the opportunities that are presented, where do you think sort of the potential risk could come from? Clarence you talked about the domestic coal side sort of up in the first quarter and I guess implies sort of down in 2Q, 3Q and 4Q based on flat for the full year. Does it come from there if natural gas prices stay at these levels or dip down? I guess I just wanted to get a rough sensitivity of the variability of the model. I know you talked about costs too. So just some color there would be great.","Clarence W. Gooden","Sure, I mean with any plan that you put together there are challenges and there are opportunities and I would say that the challenges that we are seeing is on the coal side and on the crude side right now. We feel that on the domestic side that while we think flat is the right place to be, there is probably more down side then upside to that. Export we outlined that we expect export volumes to drop close to 25% for the year and crude, while we are not hearing from our customers that there are any change in the shipping patterns, clearly we are monitoring that closely as well. But if you look at the opportunity side, I think you have heard about our productivity initiatives close to $200 million. We expect to grow our non-coal business faster than the economy as a whole and the pricing environment continues to be -- to get stronger and stronger frankly. ","So when you add all that up we feel that double digit is the right place to be, it\u2019s -- nothing is ever slam dunk because it wouldn\u2019t be meaningful guidance if it was, but it is something that we think we can achieve.","Chris Wetherbee ","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And just a follow-up, just thinking about the pricing dynamic that you just mentioned certainly it seems like it\u2019s firming up into \u201915. When you think about intermodal and the relationship to truck with declining fuel surcharges, it would still seem that there is the ability to price that business up at a reasonable pace given what\u2019s going on in the truck market but just wanted to get some rough sense do you feel it\u2019s tapped to some extent if we see diesel prices continue to fall from where they are currently?","Clarence W. Gooden","Chris, this is Clarence. I think there is a very positive trend in the intermodal pricing. We see that the truck issue still remain there even with the 34 hour rule that\u2019s been turned back. There is capacity issues, there is driver issues. Even with class A truck orders being up there is still the issues of being able to get the drivers to move the business. So we think there is a lot of pricing opportunities in intermodal itself.","Chris Wetherbee ","Okay, perfect. Thanks for the time guys. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Ben Hartford with Baird.","Michael J. Ward ","Good morning, Ben.","Benjamin Hartford ","Hey, good morning, guys. Just turning the attention to longer term margin outlook in the reiteration there, a lot of focus on \u201815 but if we can put \u201815 aside, what is contemplated in terms of, I guess maybe what\u2019s required to get to the mid-60s, target long term, if you could speak in kind of broad strokes as it relates to coal and crude, and then base pricing and productivity gains and service normalizing and those types of items. I mean how are you thinking about the calculus to get to that mid-60s target. ","Fredrik Eliasson","Yeah, this is Fredrik. Clearly we expect to start moving towards that mid-60s here in 2015, after having absorbed that close to $900 million of coal loss over the last couple of years. And we are going to make some meaningful improvements towards there. Now if we think about the three components it\u2019s ultimately price, volume and productivity, the last decade it was more probably price and productivity and as we think about the next decade, I think it's going to be more evenly split between the three, as we continue to see good volume opportunities for us. We continue to have a strong healthy pipeline of productivity initiatives, not just for 2015 but in the years beyond that as well. And then pricing environment after having been a little bit slower over the last couple of years I think it's becoming more vibrant as well. So the three of those components together we have continued good cash deployment, of the free cash flow is the way we get there. It's continuously the sort of blocking and tackling that we done over the last couple of decades that got us from the kind of the high 80s down to the low 70s. We're going to continue to push that going forward. ","Benjamin Hartford ","There\u2019s a couple of specific questions, does it require a strengthening of the pricing environment from current levels, one? And two from a coal standpoint does it require any improvement in the coal markets relative to whatever the base line is for '15. I guess those are the two key concerns in terms of the sensitivities that we have. ","Fredrik Eliasson","Yeah, I think we're going to try to stay away from too much of the detail around specific pieces, because generally I said before, whenever we put a plan together, I think it will be obsolete as soon as you put the plan together. But in terms of pricing specifically, inflation plus pricing is critical to everything that we do. We are not necessarily banking on coal, on the domestic side coming back significantly from where it is today. It would be nice to see but that's not necessarily anything we're banking on. Export coal we're in a down cycle at the moment and two years from now who knows what it's going to be. But we think there is enough other factors within our business to drive that earnings growth without just focusing too much on the coal business itself. ","Benjamin Hartford ","Okay, that's helpful. And then real quick, if you can, just a clarification on the tax side, what are you assuming for a tax rate for 2015?","Fredrik Eliasson","Yeah, generally we see a tax rate that\u2019s right around 37.5%, was a little bit lower this quarter because there is some tax credits that we got, but generally about 37.5%. ","Benjamin Hartford ","Okay, thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities.","Michael J. Ward ","Good morning, Cherilyn. ","Cherilyn Radbourne","Thanks very much and good morning. It was fairly nice to see your pricing improve sequentially. And I just wonder, given the nature of the contracts you have in place, how long should we expect it to take before that tightness in transportation capacity which really emerged in Q2 '14 is more fully reflected in your same store pricing?","Michael J. Ward ","Well, our pricing is -- thank you for noticing by the way they improved sequentially. It's like sometimes watching paint dry to watch those numbers go up. I think you're going to see it improve sequentially each quarter going forward. We have momentum in it. We are constantly watching what happens in that pricing. About 20% of our contracts will renew in the first quarter. We expect to get very strong pricing in the first quarter as the year progresses. I think you will see it improve sequentially in each of those quarters, particularly in our non-coal business. ","Cherilyn Radbourne","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And just a quick follow-up, your quarterly materials mentioned that resource constraints impacted your ag shipments in Q4. Just curious whether there were other areas where you missed out on the full volume opportunity because of resources. ","Michael J. Ward ","Mainly in our ag business and in our aggregates, our stone business. We were constrained in both of those areas in the fourth quarter. That has improved significantly here in the first quarter. Our aggregate business in the first quarter, except in some of our northern areas where it's been weather impacted has significantly improved as well as in our ag business. ","Cherilyn Radbourne","Great, thank you. That's it from me. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from David Vernon with Bernstein. ","Michael J. Ward ","Good morning, David. ","David S. Vernon ","Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my question. Hey, Fredrik, as we -- given what we know right now about fuel prices and obviously given the outlook for kind of flat domestic and down export coal, would you expect full year revenue in '15 to be up or down relative to '14. ","Fredrik Eliasson","I would expect it to be up but and clearly that depends on ultimately what you think about the fuel itself. But we do expect, as we said, our overall merchandise and intermodal business to grow faster than economy as a whole and domestic to be flat and the export coming down. But I still think we have an opportunity to grow the revenue. The key part here is that fuel surcharges really pass through for us. So even if the overall revenue number comes down because of fuel surcharge, really it doesn't impact the bottom line except for the lag as I said earlier. ","David S. Vernon ","Okay and then maybe just as a quick follow-on, how does the service metrics and stuff like that play out in the pricing environment. Obviously Clarence you've sort of made the point here that you\u2019re expecting pricing to accelerate next year. Is that in line with the service recovery or you're expecting to be able to kind of take that rate up, kind of independent trucks maybe getting modally competitive and the service level still being weak. ","Clarence W. Gooden","I think the answer is yes to both questions. I think just the overall capacity issues in all of the modes of transportation, whether it\u2019s barge, truck or rail has given us a positive pricing environment and certainly as our services improve, and I'd like to point out that we had a point of inflation last summer. Our service has been continually improving since last summer. In fact this fall, in our fall peak we had an excellent fall peak with UPS for example being one of our prime premium service partners. Our service has been continually improving and that makes it much easier for our sales force to go out and get the rate. ","David S. Vernon ","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from John Larkin with Stifel Nicolaus.","Michael J. Ward ","Good morning John. ","John G. Larkin","Hey, good morning gentlemen. Thanks for taking the question. Just with the service levels having remained stable but maybe not where you\u2019d like to see them or your customers would like to see them, what was the decision thinking behind keeping your CapEx just a little bit greater than last year. There was one railroad in the west that dramatically increased their CapEx. Why didn't you decide to do that to try and accelerate the service recovery?","Michael J. Ward ","Well, I think we took it up slightly and that's really a reflection of the fact that we do need to get the power and that's where the biggest area is now for opportunities to make an impact on the service recovery. So maybe we could have got more locomotives but the reality is that we can't get more locomotives right now and but even with the locomotives we're getting and our internal repair opportunity, because we do have a fair amount of locomotives internally that we're bringing back in revenue service that perhaps other railroads might not have that opportunity and that's a cheaper form of capacity than buying new ones. ","John G. Larkin","Got it. Thanks. And then as a follow-on to the service related issues, some of the service problems I guess are caused by issues beyond our control, i.e. all the connecting traffic over Chicago. Can you talk a little bit about how Chicago is operating now and how the railroads have worked together to try and increase the fluidity over that critical hub?","Oscar Munoz ","Hey, John, it's Oscar. We've had knock on wood, a good almost 11 plus weeks where Chicago has been on what we call a normal alert level and so that's the good news. The communication and coordination that you referred to and we've always known it's been critical, it's been ramped up, both at the most senior levels of the industry but also at the local level, with that Chicago terminal coordinating office and the efforts around that. And so everybody is working closely around that. We've been -- we've had a couple of fits and starts. Chicago was incredibly cold last week, we mustered through that. We all take our turns in the barrel, been a little struggling through various interchange points, by and large the entire industry is working very closely and very well so far with that. ","Now next few weeks will test us again and of course when volume returns here in the spring peak, week nine or so, we're focusing on that, but so far so good John. ","John G. Larkin","Appreciate it. Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna Financial.","Michael J. Ward ","Good morning. ","Bascome Majors","Good morning. You've talked before about the intermodal margins in your portfolio rising to a level fairly in line with the rest of your business with the exception of coal and chemicals. Can you just give us a little update on where intermodal margins are tracking directionally versus your other businesses today and whether or not the big drop in diesel price is going to impact the profitability of intermodal going forward? ","Fredrik Eliasson","This is Fredrik. Yes, so if you look at the margins, when you exclude chemicals and coal it's pretty much in line with the rest of our merchandize business. Because of the fuel surcharge that we have in place in the intermodal business that essentially mirrors the trucking industry, when you see price volatility, when prices come down as they have done here on the fuel side, what happens is not so much that this is a volume play for the industry, it\u2019s really the fact that our margins in intermodal gets a little squeezed, because we are more fuel efficient, so more of the dollar from fuel surcharge in intermodal goes to the bottom line; net-net for CSX that's not the case, but just on intermodal business itself. So there is some margins squeeze when fuel comes down but it's not significant and if the statement that it\u2019s in line with the rest of our business is still a true statement. ","Bascome Majors","Okay Thank you for that color and just one question on export coal and other pricing comps get much easier year-over-year as we go forward. What do you expect sequentially in 1Q as we think about your business?","Michael J. Ward ","What do we expect sequentially in\u2026?","Bascome Majors","In export coal pricing?","Michael J. Ward ","As far as the pricing goes we think it's going to be flat. ","Bascome Majors","All right. Thanks for the time guys. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research.","Michael J. Ward ","Good morning Jeff. ","Jeffrey Kauffman","Good morning, everybody. Thank you for taking my question. Mike, I have a question about a comment you made on your CNBC interview yesterday, where you had mentioned that the suppliers that you were working with out of Bakken to ship the crude by rail to the East Coast, you had thought that at $35 oil that they could be competitive. You obviously understand a little more about this than we do. Could you help us understand, because you mention the frac sand volumes were just fine, the crude by rails moving fine, what gives you confidence that you would continue to see these types of volumes at $35 crude? ","Michael J. Ward ","Well, we don\u2019t want [ph] start at $35 but we think they could continue at the existing facilities to be competitive. As you know once you made that investment you can get back in their refractors and get additional -- without additional huge capital outlays. So we think that this short intermediate term which certainly includes all of '15, we think that these shipments we've been seen roughly 3.5 trains per day continues and maybe even rose a little bit. Longer term, if the prices stay at those levels there is questions whether the capital will go back in for new facilities, Jeff. ","Jeffrey Kauffman","Okay, no, I just wanted some clarity on that. Mike thanks so much and congratulations. ","Michael J. Ward ","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.","Michael J. Ward ","Good morning Scott. ","Scott Group ","Hey, good morning guys. Wanted to just clarify couple of things on coal, does the -- how much is the iron ore, the new iron ore business and is that inclusive in your commentary on flat domestic? And then when you think about those moving parts of iron ore less export coal, fixed variables on the domestic side, how should we think about yields in 2015 coal, positive or negative? ","Michael J. Ward ","Well, the iron ore is a large move. It's both the prior and subsequent move, meaning that it's -- the raw material comes in, is processed and then it goes out as a finished product of iron ore. And the yields you should consider going forward to be very positive. It\u2019s included in your domestic -- that is included in the domestic coal, yes. ","Scott Group ","Okay, that's helpful. And then just one for you Fredrik, the past few quarters you've given us kind of some rough parameters or guidelines for how you think about earnings in the current quarter, and this is -- the first quarter is kind of a tougher one just because of the comps and weather last year. Any color or comments you want to give us on first quarter earnings, I'm guessing because given the comps, that's going to be good if not better than just couple of digit earnings growth but any additional color you have would be helpful. ","Fredrik Eliasson","Yeah, I think that's what we tried to lay out, the kind of key assumptions by expense item in the presentation itself. So you know how we're thinking about, I gave you some of the components there. Clearly you're right that the first quarter, I think will be a strong quarter and supportive of our double digit earnings growth for the year. ","Scott Group ","Okay, thank you guys. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. ","Michael J. Ward ","Good morning, Jason. ","Jason Seidl ","Hey, good morning everyone. How are you guys today?","Michael J. Ward ","Great. ","Jason Seidl ","Just want to focus a little bit on some of the non-coal export side. Obviously we've seen sort of Russia sort of in and now of the wheat market and then this morning I think Shell received some favorable product classification ruling for condensate export. Could you talk about things that could provide upside to the numbers on the exports side for you guys?","Michael J. Ward ","You want export in terms of condensate or export in terms of coal?","Jason Seidl ","Export in terms of anything.","Michael J. Ward","Non-coal. Most of the condensate that I am aware of, that\u2019s being exported out of this country is mostly being exported over to Gulf. So for example Mexico and the United States couple of days ago have a major exchange of condensates in heavy petroleum products that are being exported and exchanged mainly through the Texas refinery. So that\u2019s where you will see most of it. The East Coast has some condensates that will be exported through York Town but they are very small numbers that impact us. So we are not seeing a lot of that activity that you are describing in the condensate.","Jason Seidl ","Okay. And anything on the export ag side?","Michael J. Ward","The soybean market is pretty heavy, mainly out of Norfolk and out of Mobil and we are seeing quite a bit of activity in those areas. ","Jason Seidl ","Okay, and as a follow-up, guys getting back to pricing, we saw in our survey that we do to the shipping community that we published yesterday, when you are talking about an acceleration throughout the year, I am assuming this is obviously going to be ex-coal but where are you going to get the most bang for your buck, is this primarily in your truck competitive business?","Michael J. Ward","On the pricing side?","Jason Seidl ","Yes.","Michael J. Ward","I think we are getting it across all segments of our market place. If you look margins are tight right now. So we are able to get pricing in those areas in our bulk commodities. We are able to get pricing, particularly in the truck side of the businesses coming up. So pricing right now is very much in favor of the carriers.","Jason Seidl ","Okay, gentlemen. Thank you for your time as always.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Matt Troy with Nomura.","Michael J. Ward ","Good morning, Matt.","Matthew Troy","Hey, good morning, guys. Question, a lot of people out there talking about the decline in fuel prices, lowering the absolute per mile cost for trucking. Obviously intermodal rates are going to go down as well as the surcharges decline there but just curious academically or in practice are you hearing from any of your customers about a desire to switch from intermodal back to trucking. Some folks are speculating that. I would think now they just can\u2019t switch a whole bunch of business into an industry that doesn\u2019t have capacity but given that prices have come in I figured I would ask the question, are you seeing it, do you see it as a risk to intermodal in 2015?","Michael J. Ward","We absolutely do not. The big issue that has been in trucking remains the big issue in trucking and that is driver availability. Most people that I am aware of don\u2019t want their sons to grow up to be truck drivers. And so truck drivers become an issue. People don\u2019t want to be away from home five, six, seven days. There is issues in passing the drug test to get a commercial CDL. There are barriers to entry and becoming a truck driver and getting new class A trucks purchased and the cost of getting into the business is much higher. So it\u2019s more than just having the capacity itself. It\u2019s all the issues that surround it. So we see intermodal in fact growing. Our intermodal business grew faster last year than the GDP the country did. If you look at the AAR data intermodal in general grew faster than the economy did last year. So I think what you are reading in the period articles is people writing that don\u2019t have anything to write about.","Matthew Troy","Right, but that is more an academic observation, lower fuel surcharges don\u2019t create drivers. I guess my second follow-up question would be natural gas if you look at the futures curve it\u2019s implying pretty much $3-ish for the rest of the year, or well into the year. Just wondering, I know that Appalachian coal and from a switching perspective has been out of the money for some time, should we just think about the vulnerability in your domestic coal business being Illinois Basin at current levels of $3 and have you kind of triangulated in your guidance in that gas price assumption in your earlier comments about 1Q flat for the year. Just wondering what might be at risk, because last time we saw gas down here stockpiles were north of 200 million tons, we\u2019re at a six year low at 130 million tons. So that variable obviously won\u2019t hurt, just trying to triangulate what might be vulnerable if we stay at $3. Thanks. ","Michael J. Ward ","Well, about 47%, 48% of our coal business today comes out of Northern App or the Illinois Basin. So we try to look around $3, $3.50 natural gas as a number that if you get much under that, we start to hurt a little bit in our barn. So those are the numbers that we try and [inaudible]. ","Matthew Troy","Okay and Illinois Basin is that -- you're not hearing anything about switching from those customers you have? ","Michael J. Ward ","Well, I'm not sure exactly what you're asking about but what we're seeing is a lot of our customers are moving to the Illinois Basin coal, which is good for us because it gives us a longer length of haul, gives us higher RPU and it's a good thing for us. ","Matthew Troy","Well, I was just more talking about the switching sensitivities in the various sourcing basins, but I got it. Okay, thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Cleo Zagrean with Macquarie Capital.","Michael J. Ward ","Good morning Cleo.","Cleo Zagrean","Good morning and thank you, and happy new year. My first question is also with regards to the domestic coal business. Can you help us think just more specifically around the sensitivity of EPS for '15 to plus or minus 5% or whichever you think is good for a band in domestic coal volume, around that base case of flat for this year? What would plus or minus 5% domestic coal do to EPS for '15 given the profitability and the new profits are up in your mix, and also given the fixed variable structure that we've seen effect earnings so far. Thank you. ","Fredrik Eliasson","This is Fredrik. I think that there is a fixed variable that is less of an issue. I think in terms of the sensitivity it's clear that our sensitivity if coal comes down and is not flat, that's going to be sensitivities to our EPS guidance. But at the same time as we said there are opportunities to offset that. So there is a lot of different pieces that goes into our guidance. So I think it's a little bit dangerous to isolate specific pieces. But we add all the things up at this earlier and we think about the business as a whole and some of the vibrancy we're seeing in certain markets and some of the productivity opportunities, the pricing, we feel that we can absorb some of those sensitivities on the coal side, but it's -- we\u2019ll have to wait and see, we're going to have to get couple of quarter under the belt, until we get full visibility into what is doable and what's not doable for the year. ","Cleo Zagrean","Thank you. And my second question is with regards to operating ratio excluding fuel. You've highlighted deservedly that fuel is a pass through. So I would appreciate any help you can give us to think about the performance of the business ex this noise in the revenue and expense line. Are you looking at pass through for ex-fuel, any kind of progression that you have in mind if you can share with us so we can track performance on that basis. Thank you. ","Fredrik Eliasson","Well, the positive lag in the quarter itself here for the fourth quarter was about $23 million and I think $16 million year-over-year. So that was a favorable coming from fuel. We also saw a little bit of favorability because the wholesale prices I think came down faster than the retail prices and it\u2019s the retail prices at our fuel surcharge is tied to. So what we pay to the pump probably declines faster than the fuel surcharge revenue itself. So that\u2019s another benefit that we saw here this quarter. But overall frankly if you look at our margin expansion our operating ratio, this is not a profit element if fuel prices come down, it\u2019s actually generally slightly positive to our path towards the 65% operating ratio longer term. But as I said overall not a profit element. There is some lag effects and here we saw an additional lag perhaps even in the fourth quarter or the fact that wholesale prices went down faster than retail prices. And that\u2026","Cleo Zagrean","So when that -- so I'm sorry, so in a lower fuel price environment, should we expect that you are finding it easier to reach that mid-60 target sooner? ","Fredrik Eliasson","Yes, in the material scheme of things, but if we just think about the fact that you're adding for example $100 million at the revenue line and you're adding a $100 million to the expense line, this is not a profit driver. The operating ratio of that is 100% because you're not getting a margin on that. So as fuel price comes down and your fuel expense goes down a corresponding amount you actually get a little bit of benefit from that. ","Cleo Zagrean","Thank you very much. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar.","Michael J. Ward ","Good morning, Keith. ","Keith Schoonmaker","Good morning. I'd like to ask about the 2% decline in chemicals revenue per unit, is this simply a mix issued where growth in crude where the shipper provides the tank car is a having a mixed effect on this or is this something else at work?","Michael J. Ward ","Absolutely, you are correct. ","Keith Schoonmaker","There is no re-through to lower margins on this business that I could derive just from that?","Michael J. Ward ","Right, that's correct. ","Keith Schoonmaker","And then a follow-up question on intermodal shift, I think the commentary in the quarterly report indicated automotive growth was constrained by customer transportation modal changes. Could you elaborate on that please?","Michael J. Ward ","In the early part of last year and the heavy freezes that were occurring some of the automakers pulled business off the rail and went to the haul away carriers, the haul away carriers would not take the business without contracts duration of around six months for obvious reasons and that's what you're seeing there. ","Keith Schoonmaker","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Justin Long with Stephens.","Michael J. Ward ","Good morning, Justin.","Justin Long","Good morning and thanks. First question I had was on the service. With the locomotives coming on in the next couple of quarters and the service improvement being correlated to this additional power, as you mentioned Oscar, is the expectation that you can get back to normal service levels that we saw in 2013 by the end of the 2nd quarter absent any major weather event?","Oscar Munoz","I think normal service levels, those were record service levels back then. I think we will gradually steam up to that area as the locomotives arrive and then it'll be gradual over the course of the year. Not quite ready to commit to those higher levels that quickly. Again we have a spring peak that goes from week nine to week 23, that's the end of June. So I think there will be some lagging effect but again I think you're going to see the efficiency, the productivity and of course the growth that we've seen altogether start to come together certainly by the second half of the year. ","Justin Long","Okay great. And second question I had was on pricing. I just want to get a better sense of how the pricing environment has improved and I was wondering if you can provide any more color on how recent renewals have been trending. Generally speaking I mean are you seeing something closer to the mid-single digits on renewals versus the 2.5% to 3% overall core pricing that you posted recently? ","Michael J. Ward ","Justin my friend, David Baggs tells me numbers are not my friends. So I can't give you a specific number, but I would tell you that I am very pleased with the pricing that we're getting. It has been very positive and you will be very pleased when we report our numbers for the first quarter this year. ","Justin Long","Fair enough. I appreciate the time. I know it's been a long call. Thanks. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Donald Broughton with Avondale Partners.","Michael J. Ward ","Good morning, Donald.","Donald Broughton ","Good morning. Clarence, it turns out mommas aren't supposed to let their babies grow to be truck drivers, I always thought it was cowboys but I am glad to learn that this morning. That said, a year ago on highway diesel and obviously that's not the price you all pay but average to $3.96 a gallon, looks like we're on course for it to average $3.10 a gallon or less in the first quarter this year. I know you're getting base yield and you're doing a great job there but just the fuel surcharge overall can you kindly give us some parameters, is the those absence of a fuel surcharge and a drop from what is essentially $4 a gallon to $3 a gallon or almost, is it 1% yield headwind, 2% yield headwind, 5% yield headwind, what does it represent for your overall book of business?","Clarence W. Gooden","I don't think we have the math in front of us to do that. You do have the total fuel surcharge revenue that reported STB, that I also think is actually in our quarter flash. You can look at the total revenue from fuel and then you can model that out, I think you get a sense depending on different highway diesel prices what the impact would be.","Donald Broughton ","All right. I'll just back into it that way then. Thank you gentlemen. ","Clarence W. Gooden","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today is from John Mims with FBR Capital Markets. ","Michael J. Ward ","Good morning, John.","John Mims","Hey, good morning. Thanks for slipping me in here. So a question on the chemical book. If you exclude crude oil and oil and gas comments for a minute and just look at some more traditional volumes, can you provide some color or just outlook on demand and pricing and contracting for your activities down in the Gulf and just your non-oil related volumes? ","Michael J. Ward ","Yes. The other line of chemical business is growing about 2% to 3%. That's pretty much in line with what the chemical industry has been growing. Actually it\u2019s a little high on the plastics and growing at about 2% to 3% over what it\u2019s been for the last six or seven years. Pricing has been very good in the chemical side of the business, particularly in the renewals that have occurred in the fourth quarter and are in fact occurring in the first quarter. So we are very pleased with what we are getting in the pricing in those areas. Does that answer your question?","John Mims","Yes, no, that\u2019s helpful. And what\u2019s the split between your traditional chemicals versus your oil and gas right now within that segment?","Michael J. Ward","It\u2019s -- oil and gas is major part growing at that portfolio but the plastics part of the business is still the largest by far.","John Mims","Is there a percentage you can give you mean I know you have put out numbers as far as what gas is for the total book, but just within chemicals?","Michael J. Ward","I don\u2019t have it off the top of my head.","John Mims","Okay, all right. I will just back to you some time. All right thanks a lot. The other questions have been answered.","Michael J. Ward","Thank you everyone for your attention and we appreciate. See you next quarter.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call.

As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. During this call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode.","For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. David Baggs, Vice President of Capital Markets and Investor Relations for CSX Corporation.","David Baggs","Thank you and good morning everyone. And again welcome to CSX Corporation's second quarter 2014 earnings presentation. The presentation material that we\u2019ll review this morning along with our quarterly financial report and our safety and service measurements, are available on our website at csx.com under the Investor section. In addition, following the presentation, a webcast and podcast replay will be available on that same website.","Here representing CSX this morning are Michael Ward, the company\u2019s Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; Clarence Gooden, Chief Sales and Marketing Officer; Oscar Munoz, Chief Operating Officer; and Fredrik Eliasson, Chief Financial Officer.","Now, before we begin the formal part of our program, let me remind everyone that the presentation and other statements made by the company contain forward-looking statements. You are encouraged to review the company\u2019s disclosure in the accompanying presentation on Slide two. This disclosure identifies forward-looking statements as well as the uncertainties and risks that could cause performance to materially differ from the results anticipated by these statements.","In addition, let me also remind everyone that at the end of the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session with the research analysts. That said, with nearly 30 analysts covering CSX, I would ask, as a courtesy to everyone, to please limit your inquiries to one primary and one follow-up question.","And with that, let me turn the presentation over to CSX Corporation's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Michael Ward. Michael?","Michael Ward","Well thank you, David and good morning everyone. Last evening, CSX reported record second quarter earnings per share of $0.53, up from $0.51 in the same period last year. CSX also generated record revenues of $3.2 billion for the quarter, up 7% on an 8% volume increase.","These results are evidence of the broad-based economic momentum across most markets and a transition in the energy markets that is largely behind us. We handled volume levels this quarter that exceeded our expectations, while maintaining stable operations and we're taking additional steps to return service to the high levels that our customers have come to expect from CSX over the last few years.","We're excited about the growth we are seeing and what it means for the future of this company and our shareholders. That's why we've added people and capacity including locomotives, freight cars and infrastructure. Oscar will discuss these initiatives in more detail later in the presentation.","Thanks for the efforts of CSX's 31,000 employees, the company produced record operating income of nearly $1 billion and delivered an operating ratio of 69.3%. As we look to the back half of the year, CSX is focused on improving service levels, leveraging the growth opportunities before us and generating modest earnings growth for the full year 2014.","Now I'll turn the presentation over to Clarence, who will take us through the topline results in more detail, Clarence?","Clarence Gooden","Thank you, Michael and good morning. The underlying macro-economy remains strong and our experience and the data suggest a positive outlook for growth. The Purchasing Managers Index held firm at 55.3 in June. A rating above 50 indicates that the manufacturing economy is expanding. This is the 13th consecutive month that PMI index has signaled expansion.","At the same time, the Customer's Inventories Index remained at 46.5. A rating below 50 indicates customer's inventories are low and suggests continued strength and demand for manufacturing output.","As a result, many of the customer's reserve grew at a robust pace and most of the key indicators we track including vehicle production, housing starts and agricultural output, point to continued expansion. Overall demand for rail service was very strong in the second quarter.","Now let's look at the results on the next slide. As you can see on the left side of the chart, total volume grew over 8% to nearly 1.8 million loads in the quarter with strong growth in merchandise, intermodal and coal.","Moving to the right, total revenue increased $198 million to over $3.2 billion in the quarter, reflecting overall volume growth and increased pricing across most markets. Merchandise and intermodal now account for over three quarters of CSX\u2019s overall revenue.","Total revenue includes $11 million of liquidated damages related to contract shortfalls and coal shipment. We expect similar levels in the remaining quarters of this year. Looking forward, we'll be cycling $51 million of liquidated damages from the third quarter of 2013.","Next the average revenue per unit was down slightly. Here core pricing gains in our merchandize and intermodal markets were offset by the impact of mix and lower coal revenue per unit.","Finally, let's move to core pricing. Recall that same-store sales are defined as shipments with the same customer, commodity and car type, and the same margin and destination. These shipments represent 75% of CSX\u2019s traffic base for the quarter.","On this basis, all-in pricing was a negative 0.6% in the quarter, reflecting continued rate pressure in export coal markets and the impact of fixed variable contracts and the domestic utility market where volumes are now increasing.","Since we continue to have greater variability in both our export and domestic coal business, reflecting global market conditions and our fixed variable contract structure and since our merchandise and intermodal markets are becoming a larger portion of our business, we have again provided you with the same-store sales pricing for these two markets on a combined basis.","At the bottom of this panel, you can see pricing for merchandise and intermodal average 2.6% for the quarter. This pricing gain is smaller on a year-over-year basis, but is flat sequentially and represents a solid spread over rail inflation.","That said, we remain confident that the value we create for our customers compared with the increasing demand for our service product provides a solid foundation for growth and pricing above rail inflation over the long-term.","Now let\u2019s look at the individual markets in more detail, starting with merchandise. Overall, merchandise revenue increased 11% to nearly $2 billion in the quarter. Volume in the agricultural sector was up 5%.","Feed grain shipments, both domestic and export, increased sharply due to a strong 2013 harvest. In addition, ethanol shipments grew as lower corn prices resulted in higher ethanol production levels.","The construction sector grew 8% overall, reflecting a rebound in shipments after the winter weather subsided and the ongoing recovery of housing and construction activity. Finally the industrial sector grew 11% led by strength in the energy-related commodities including crude oil, liquefied petroleum gas and frac sand.","Moving to the next slide, let\u2019s review the intermodal business. Intermodal revenue increased 6% to nearly $450 million. Total volume grew 7%, setting a new quarterly record for intermodal. Domestic volume was up 8%, driven by continued highway to rail conversions.","International volume was up 6% year-over-year reflecting continued economic growth catch-up from the first quarter and advanced shipments due to potential port labor issues.","Total intermodal revenue per unit declined 2% as continued core pricing gains and higher fuel recoveries were offset by unfavorable mix. Here volume associated with our door-to-door domestic business, which has higher revenue per unit declined.","Finally, we continue to grow our intermodal business by adding new service offerings and making strategic investments. These investments include the new terminal in Winter Haven, Florida, which opened early this quarter; the Montreal terminal, which will open later in the year. These two terminals together will add 350,000 in annual lift capacity. In addition the ongoing expansion of the Northwest Ohio facility will increase its capacity by 50%.","Moving to the next slide, let\u2019s review the coal business. Coal volume increased 6% while revenue declined 3% in the quarter to $744 million. Domestic coal volume increased 15% with growth in both northern and southern utility shipments, reflecting higher gas prices, building of stock piles for the summer cooling season and a competitive gain.","Export coal tonnage declined 12% as global market conditions for both thermal and metallurgical coals remain solid. The API2 benchmark for thermal coal remained below $75 per ton, a level where the U.S. coals were challenged to compete.","The Queensland metallurgical coal benchmark has also remained at low levels with a rate of $120 per ton. Finally, total revenue per unit was down 9% with lower export pricing, fixed variable utility contracts and unfavorable domestic mix negatively impacting revenue per unit.","Now let me wrap up with the outlook for the third quarter. Looking forward, we expect a positive demand environment in the third quarter with stable to favorable conditions for 88% of our markets and unfavorable conditions for the remaining 12%.","Looking at some of the key markets, agriculture is favorable and will continue to benefit from last year's record harvest. We expect growth in chemicals as we continue to capture opportunities created by expanding domestic oil and gas industry. The automotive market will grow with North American light vehicle production expected to increase 9% in the quarter.","Strong intermodal growth will continue as our strategic network investments and improving service reliability support highway to rail conversions.","We expect domestic coal volume will grow in the third quarter at double-digit rates as utilities continue to rebuild inventories. Forest products is neutral as growth in buildings products due to the continued recovery of the housing markets will be offset by lower paper shipments.","Export coal volume is expected to be significantly lower in the third quarter and our best estimate of 2014 volume remains in the mid 30 million ton range, reflecting soft global market conditions, particularly in the thermal market. Overall, we expect high levels of demand for our service will continue into the third quarter.","Thank you. And now I\u2019ll turn the presentation over to Oscar to review our operating results.","Oscar Munoz","Thank you, Clarence. It\u2019s great news and good morning, everyone. As you know, we always start our operations review with a look at safety as it is our first and foremost priority. We are proud to report that CSX remains a leader in safety amongst the Class one railroads with the train accident and personal injury rates both improving year-over-year.","For the quarter, the train accident rate declined to 2.07 and the personal injury rate declined to 0.90, reflecting the company's and our employees continued commitment to community and employee safety.","Let let's turn to service performance on the next slide. System wide operating performance is still below the level customers have come to expect from CSX, especially across our Northern tier.","In the second quarter, the robust demand we experienced has led to a decline in on-time originations and arrivals as well as resource constraints in some areas of the network. In addition, line of road congestion has impacted train velocity and terminal dwell.","On Slide 15, I'll discuss service in a bit more detail. As you can see on the chart on the left, service levels began to decline at the beginning of the year due to the historic winter we experienced. For the end of the first quarter, we experienced a rapid surge in volume. Even with a significantly higher volume, service levels have stabilized albeit at a lower level.","If you look at the map on the right, much of that volume growth this year has been concentrated in the Northern part of our network. Traffic levels for the northern tier are up approximately 20% with certain areas experiencing even higher growth rates.","Turning to Slide 16, let's discuss some of the actions we are taking to support this continued growth in CSX's business. The map on the left shows four key areas where CSX has been marking strategic capacity additions.","You'll notice that many of these projects are along the northern tier and will help facilitate long term growth across this part of our network. In the Chicago area, the addition of the Elsdon Sub division provides CSX with additional double track miles. This allows us to operate a shorter, fast route for certain trains, diverting traffic away from other more congested routes in the area.","As Clarence mentioned, we're also extending the processing capabilities of the Northwest Ohio terminal, which we expect to be complete by the end of this year. Along the river line route in New York and New Jersey, we're adding more miles of double track to improve capacity along this growing and heavily travelled path from Chicago to New York.","Finally we are investing in a new coal unit train processing facility that will support the increased growth of coal coming out of the Illinois basin.","Now let's turn to the next slide and discuss crews and locomotive. The train and engine employee count is already up 200 since the beginning of the year and we expect it to be up approximately 400 by the end of the year. We also have some initiatives in place to enhance workforce levels in the near term including temporary transfers, vacation buyout and incentives to delay retirements.","On the chart on the right, you can see our available locomotive count has increased by 10% since September of last year as we pulled out units out of storage and taken on additional leases. Looking at the second half of the year, we expect our available count to further increase as we repair and reactivate approximately 100 more locomotives. These actions will help CSX gradually restore fluidity to the network and to support growth.","Turning to the next slide, let me discuss the cost base. Now Fredrik will provide more specifics about the cost impacts for this quarter and what to expect going forward, let me outline a few of the key drivers behind the $32 million of additional cost in the second quarter associated with our network performance.","On the chart on the left, the number of [released drivers] (ph) continues to be more than double of prior year levels. In addition, over time across the operating department also remains above prior year levels, although it has improved sequentially from the first quarter.","Now if I could, I would say a quick thank you to our employees for their continued hard work these past few months. I greatly appreciate your professionalism and dedication to serve customers.","I continue with the chart and moving down as I've discussed, our locomotive fleet has increased 10% since the beginning of the fourth quarter and 8% year-over-year in an effort to meet the growing demand.","With many of our additions coming from short term sources, lease expenses increased. In addition, maintenance expense is up due to the higher overall fleet count. Finally, average freight car cycle days were up 3%, reflecting the increase in transit time and leading to higher rental expense. Looking forward, these costs will subside as service levels improve.","Now let me wrap up on the next slide. Overall service has stabilized with this higher volume and are not at the levels our customers have come to expect from CSX. At a network level, the northern level, the northern tier has experienced strong double-digit growth and Chicago in particular has been challenged.","In response, we're working closely with our rail peers and taking near term actions to shift resources to these high growth areas. We have plans in place to further improve our infrastructure as well as add crews and locomotives to support ongoing growth initiatives.","Also an importantly, we've been in regular contact with our customers to provide them visibility and sincerely thank them for their patience as we work to increase their increased demand.","They, and you, should be confident that our dedicated operating employees remain fully committed to restoring service levels to what our customers have come to expect from CSX.","So with that, let me turn over the presentation to Fredrik to review the financials.","Fredrik Eliasson","Thank you, Oscar and good morning everyone. Let me begin by providing a summary of our second quarter results. Revenue increased 7% versus the prior year on 8% higher volume, driven by broad based strength across our merchandize, intermodal and domestic coal markets.","Expenses increased 7% versus last year, driven primarily by higher volume, the cycling of real estate gains and cost associated with network performance, which I'll discuss in more detail in the coming slides.","Operating income was $997 million, up 6% or $57 million versus the prior year. Looking below the line, interest expense was down $5 million versus last year driven by favorable interest rates on debt that was refinanced in 2013 and modestly lower debt levels.","Other income declined $21 million versus the prior year, primarily due to environmental charges for non-operating site and income taxes were $321 million in the quarter for an effective tax rate of 37.8%. Overall, net earnings were $529 million and EPS was $0.53 per share, up slightly from $521 and $0.51 respectively in the prior period.","With that, let\u2019s turn to the next slide and briefly discuss how fuel lag impacted the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, the effect of the lag in our fuel surcharge program was unfavorable by $9 million.","This reflects $4 million of positive in-quarter lag during the second quarter of this year versus $13 million of positive in-quarter lag for the same period in the prior year. Based on the current forward curve, we expect the year-over-year fuel lag impact to be slightly favorable in the third quarter.","Turning to the next slide, let\u2019s review our expenses. Overall expenses increased 7% in the quarter. I'll talk about the top three expense items in more detail on the next slide, but let me first briefly speak to the bottom two on this chart.","Depreciation was up 4% to $287 million due to a higher net asset base. Going forward, we continue to expect depreciation to increase sequentially a few million dollars per quarter, reflecting the ongoing investment in our business. Equipment rent was up 19% to $114 million driven by higher freight car rates, incremental volume and longer car cycles.","Now turning to the next slide, let's discuss our other expenses. Overall labor and labor and fringe, MS&O and fuel expense each increased versus the prior year, driven primarily by 8% high volume in the second quarter.","As Oscar mentioned earlier, we incurred $32 million of additional expense in the quarter, related to network performance. Of that amount, $14 million is attributable to labor and fringe, $9 is in MS&O and finally there was $9 million of impact in equipment rent expense.","This cost of network performance represents a significant improvement from the $90 million impact we experienced in the first quarter. Looking for to the second half, we expect these costs to remain relatively consistent with the second quarter levels, until we see meaningful improvement in network fluidity and service levels.","Now let me discuss the other drivers for each of expense categories beginning on the left with labor and fringe. Total labor and fringe increased 4% or $32 million versus last year. $25 million of this increase was related to incremental volume and $14 million related to inflation.","For the second half of 2014 we expect labor inflation to continue to be around $15 million on a year-over-year basis each quarter. The $21 million improvement in other labor and fringe is driven by lower incentive compensation and pension expense versus the prior year and is split about 50-50 between those two items.","Headcount was up about 1% versus our first quarter level as T&E employees increased to accommodate higher volume. Looking ahead, we expect overall headcount to gradually increase during the second half such that by year end our headcount will be up 1% to 2% versus the end of 2013.","Moving to the right on the slide, MS&O expense increased 11% or $61 million versus last year. This included the cycling of $36 million in real estate gains, $19 million of expenses related to incremental volume and $10 million of inflation.","In addition, there was $13 million of decrease in other MS&O spending multiple items none of which was individually significant.","Looking at the remaining quarters of 2014, we continue to expect higher year-over-year MS&O expense related to the inflation and volume growth and there are no further real estate gains to be cycled in the second half.","Finally, fuel expense increased 5% or $19 million versus last year as the impact of higher volume was partially offset by favorable price and efficiency.","Now that concludes the expense review, turning to the next slide, I\u2019d like to highlight our core earnings growth and operating margins in the second quarter.","Looking at the second quarter financial results and excluding the $36 million of real estate gains from last year, the company generated $198 million of revenue growth that was partially offset by a $105 million of incremental expense.","This netted to an increase in core operating income of $93 million versus the prior year or an incremental operating margin of 47%. As a reminder, these results included the $32 million of network performance cost that I discussed earlier.","With a positive outlook across most of the markets in our portfolio, the core earnings strength of CSX's business is now becoming more evident. We expect the core momentum experience in this quarter to carry over the second half and produce modest earnings growth for the full year and double-digit growth starting next year.","This expectation is the foundation for the increase in capital that we're now planning for 2014 which I\u2019ll discuss on the next slide.","Total investment is now expected to be $2.4 billion up from $2.3 billion we initially budgeted for the year. About $100 million of additional capital will be deployed for infrastructure and freight cars both of which will support long term growth.","As a result, our revised core capital budget is now $2.1 billion which is consistent with our guidance of 16% to 17% of revenue. In addition, we still expect to invest $300 million in positive train control this year","Now, let me wrap-up on the next slide. First, the core earnings improvement of CSX's business is becoming more apparent in our financial results. And we see broad base strength across our diverse business portfolio which will be key to drive sustainable long term earnings growth.","As a result, we are investing in infrastructure, crews and locomotives to effectively serve demand and gradually return service to the superior levels that our customer expects.","Looking forward, we expect third quarter earnings to be roughly flat versus the prior year as we cycle $51 million in liquidated damages and tax feasibility of $0.01 in EPS while continuing to incur network performance cost. We expect more meaningful earnings growth in the fourth quarter.","As I mentioned earlier we still expect modest earnings growth for the full year 2014 and we remain confident in CSX's ability to sustain double-digit EPS growth starting 2015 and operating ratio in the mid 60s longer term.","With that, let me turn the presentation back to Michael for his closing remarks.","Michael Ward","Thank you, Fredrik. As we discussed this morning CSX experienced substantial demand across nearly our entire portfolio and delivered record financial results for the quarter. Going forward, we see a strong economic environment that is expected to continue and operations that are stable and expected to gradually improve with the actions we are taking.","What's even more exciting is that in a reshaped energy environment and with intermodal and merchandise an ever growing part of our portfolio, the core earnings strength of this company is apparent and attractive. To those reasons we continue to expect double-digit earnings growth and margin expansion beginning in 2015.","Now we'll be glad to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","Thank you. We will now be conducting the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Rob Salmon from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Rob.","Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank","Hey, good morning guys. I guess to kind of follow-up with regard to the service discussion, could you give us a little bit of a sense in terms of the timeline of how the network fluidity should be improving with regard to some of the capital investments that you are making, particularly on the intermodal side where we basically have been seeing the velocity kind of come down since basically the May timeframe?","I am assuming this is related to the headwinds that you guys called out in the Northern region, any sort of incremental color and how we should be thinking about those costs coming out? It sounds like it's more of a probably 2015 story in terms of getting the velocity and the dwell down to the levels that you guys like.","","Oscar Munoz","Yes Rob, this is Oscar. I think all you say is generally correct. I just would re-highlight what we talked about before is we do have a lot of plans to add to resources and are in constant communication with our customers across all areas.","Now assuming our demand remains as strong as we expect, which we do, the recovery will be gradual as we work through the challenges especially across the north. I can't provide a specific timeframe at this point for a lot of different reasons, but the recovery will not be necessarily linear.","And so that said, as you\u2019ve seen in this quarter, even with this additional operating cost that we're seeing, our incremental margins are improving. So there is a lot of value and good things to look forward to.","Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank","Okay. And then I guess Fredrik, with regard to a follow-up on the guidance for the third quarter, what sort of volume growth are you assuming in that guidance?","Fredrik Eliasson","Well, I think overall I think right now what we are seeing here over the last month or so, is in that mid single digit range that we're seeing volume growth. So I think that's probably good place to start.","Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank","Okay. That's helpful. Appreciate the time guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Thomas Kim from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Thomas.","Tom Kim \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hi. Good morning. Could you provide a little bit more color on the incremental CapEx and where you are planning to be allocating it and your time as to when you anticipate revenue generation from that? Thank you.","Fredrik Eliasson","Sure. So about half of it is related to rolling stock that we think we will be able to put in revenue generation next year and about half of it is in infrastructure around the northern tier of our network and obviously as we put that into effect throughout the fall, that should generate incremental fluidity in that part of our network.","Tom Kim \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. That's very helpful and then just with regard to intermodal and the capital reinvestment there, to what extent can you elaborate on how much spillover traffic you see sort of given the strength of demand and your network?","How much of the -- how much revenue do you anticipate [indiscernible] actually or do you sort of estimate is actually being lost there because you don't have the capacity and if you could just try to give us a sense of the ramp on the utilization of the two new facilities by year end, that would be helpful as well. Thank you.","Clarence Gooden","This was -- Thomas, this is Clarence Gooden. I think it's going to be very difficult for us to say as how much basis we lost or gained during that period of time that you are asking. On the facilities coming online, are you referring to Valley Fair and to Winter Haven?","Tom Kim \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Yes, that's right.","Clarence Gooden","Winter Haven is progressing along as we expect it to be. Most of the volume in Winter Haven now has moved out of our Orlando facility, which is part of the SunRail deal we had done earlier several years ago with the State of Florida. So it will be several years before we reach capacity -- full capacity in Winter Haven.","Valley Fair which will open up in the early fourth quarter, late third quarter we are in the process right now seeing just how big that market total is going to be on day one when we open, we expect we will be running initially a train in and a train out a day.","Tom Kim \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. That helps a lot. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question coming is from Bill Greene from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Bill.","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Clarence, I wanted to take your pulse on something. So we are starting to see throughout transportation a lot of tightness and it's not just rails, but obviously you are seeing it in some of your markets as well.","When do we get to the point where capacity is tight enough that you\u2019ve got to start looking at ways to meter out the scarce capacity of your network? In other words kind of using price as a way to sort of encourage the customers to get in line for access to that network. How do you think about where we are in that tightness on capacity?","Clarence Gooden","Bill, I think we're a long way from where we should be on the tightness on capacity from just a sheer standpoint of how much we can handle.","Remember that today we are essentially at 2007 volume levels. The problem that we have when the surge came fast and quick and furious on us and that's what's dipped our hand here. So we have plenty of capacity to meet the demand of our customers and our common carrier obligation now.","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley","So when you look at your core pricing that you just reported, so all in down a little bit, is service and impediments to changing that direction even without coal, we've seen a deceleration. What sort of changes the direction in pricing in your mind?","Clarence Gooden","I think that the deceleration that you saw particularly on the merchandize side on a year-over-year basis was a result of a weakness in the economy that we had had in the previous years and some duration lingering effects of that contracts that were in place.","Going forward I think all modes of transportation have an opportunity to price up, price up significantly, particularly in this type of economic environment. When you couple that with what is happening in 2014 and you look at the projections for 2015, we are in a very robust pricing market in virtually all modes of transportation. So up is the way the direction looks to me.","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley","Okay. All right. Thanks for the time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Ken Hoexter from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Hoexter \u2013 Bank of America","Good morning. Clarence, just jumping back on to the -- looking at the revenue outlook there a bit for the quarter, domestic coal you mentioned double-digit growth for this upcoming quarter, but when you look at 2015, what are your thoughts in terms of volumes knowing that you still have that seven million tons that needs to be phased out or even move to others.","Is that why you are sourcing more to Illinois Basin? Does that make up for it? What are your thoughts as you're looking at 2015?","Clarence Gooden","Ken, I think 2015 for domestic utility coal is still going to be a robust year for multiple reasons. One, the stock piles now are way down. Two, as long as gas stays particularly for Illinois Basin above $3.50 for the Southeast, it makes coal competitive in the mix.","Three, is that we still don't know if we are going to have what will the winter of 2014's effect is going in. Four, I think the utilities are tended to lean more now to having sufficient stock piles rather than having insufficient stock piles to meet their customer's demand.","Ken Hoexter \u2013 Bank of America","That's good. So you are still seeing the outlook for growth as you move forward, not falling back to the continued annual declines.","Clarence Gooden","Absolutely, growth in coal in 2015.","Ken Hoexter \u2013 Bank of America","Wonderful and Oscar, just to follow-up with you on the service side, is there -- you mentioned the $32 million of internal cost and I know you were talking about velocity before, but with on-time originations down at 56%, what can you do to get back on track on those metrics? Is there anything that you need to do differently or kind of resell operations to get back to running fluidly?","Oscar Munoz","Yes Ken, as you might expect, we have pretty much pulled out every playbook and every plan in the playbook over the course of time. Service performance has such a large interrelated issues that we talk a lot about power and talk a lot about crews, but infrastructure is important in some of this growth in the Northern tier has caused a little bit of congestion.","We feel very confident in our process and we do have a really good playbook and feel really it is -- we are focusing on service and safety keeping in constant contact with our customers and getting this business moved. It's costing us a little bit and that cost will decline, but there is in a whole lot else to be done than what we've already outlined as doing.","Ken Hoexter \u2013 Bank of America","Appreciate the time, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Your line is open.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Brandon.","Keith Mori \u2013 Barclays","Good morning. This is Keith Mori on for Brandon. Congratulations on the strong quarter. Just one question here on service Oscar, we saw $32 million in the quarter, can you may be help us split out what was needed for may be just returning metrics to after winter and how much of the cost were actually geared towards an increase in volume that we could think about going. How should we think about I guess those costs going forward to meet that rising volume Clarence was speaking to?","Oscar Munoz","Yeah, I think we've already bifurcated the volume oriented cost in that $30 million unfortunately is all related to sort of service impacts. I break that out between crew, cost, leased horsepower hours and the car hire that we're having to work through in those categories and that's roughly ran us above $10 million a month kind of split between the three components.","Keith Mori \u2013 Barclays","Or should we think that it could accelerate into the third quarter given that you're going to pick up a little bit here on labor and some other items that we didn\u2019t speak to?","Oscar Munoz","Our plan is to decelerate. I am not sure how you are using that term. Our hope would be to reduce that cost as the additional crews and power come on.","Keith Mori \u2013 Barclays","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Chris Wetherbee from Citi. Your line is open.","Michael Ward","Hey Chris.","Chris Wetherbee \u2013 Citi","Thanks, just touching on the volume outlook for the second quarter, just wanted to get a rough sense, it looks like the last three weeks or so we've seen some pretty elevated numbers, is there just sort of a blip that we're working through when we think about the full quarter?","Is mid single digits Fredrik to your point the sort of right number to use. Just want to roughly understand sort of what's going on now and may be how we see the next month or so playing out?","Oscar Munoz","Now the numbers you\u2019ve been seeing in the last couple of weeks represent year-over-year comparison and July, which is normally a very down time of the year for us and fortunately has been a very positive time of the year for us. So that's a reason that you're seeing the numbers that you\u2019ve seen in the last two weeks, but I think Fredrik's number of 6% to 7% going forward for the back half of the year is pretty strong.","Chris Wetherbee \u2013 Citi","Okay. That's helpful. And then when you think about the pricing outlook as we roll into 2015, you have a better -- you have good domestic coal environment.","You have a couple of other things working in your favor, but if you have sort of these trends continue, can you grow earnings double-digit if core pricing is flattish or do you needed to pick up and is that sort of inherent in your thoughts about growing double-digit? Just want to get a rough sense of how we think pricing might translate into 2015 with a still good volume environment?","Fredrik Eliasson","Well, this is Fredrik. I think the key thing for us that we follow is the spread between our cash and our pricing and so as Clarence indicated, we think that the pricing environment is favorable, is getting more favorable we are going to push price, but it's a spread that is the most important part of this thing and it is assumed that we will get inflation plus pricing as we think about next year and double-digit earnings growth.","Chris Wetherbee \u2013 Citi","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Allison Landry from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Allison.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. In terms of the resource additions, how do we think about the incremental margins in the back half of the year? And I am particularly curious to see if there was any parallel that we could draw thinking back to the second half of 2011 when you guys also had to add some additional resources to meet demand.","Obviously, we are in a much different volume environment, but I wanted to see if there was any consistent way to think about that relative to a couple of years ago?","Fredrik Eliasson","Yeah, obviously you're right. Volume environments look different and the mix of business is different, but the outcome in 2011 was positive as we added the resource, we got the fluidity back in at work and we got to a better place and that's essentially what we're trying to do here as well.","In terms of the incremental margins, we said longer term, we need to be in that 50% and above range and we expect that that will continue. We'll see here in the second half especially in the third quarter as we're cycling the liquidated damages and continue to have network performance rated cost.","It might not get all the way there, but longer term, our view is we should clearly especially in this sort of a robust environment being over 50% in terms of incremental margins.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse","Okay. That actually was very helpful. And just sort of a housekeeping question, just given you\u2019ve made some restatements to the prior year numbers, could you confirm what these 3Q 2013 EPS number was? Was it $0.43?","Fredrik Eliasson","The 3Q 2013 number was let me just make sure I have it, it was $0.45 last year.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse","Okay $0.45. So the guidance for flat is relative to that. Okay. Thank you so much.","Fredrik Eliasson","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from David Vernon from Bernstein. Your line is open.","Michael Ward","Good morning, David.","David Vernon \u2013 Bernstein","Hey, good morning and thanks for taking the question. Just on the question on the intermodal yields and you're developing there, the door to door intermodal product, is that a conscious choice you guys are making to de-market that door to door service or is that just sort of what's shaking out given the difficulty finding drainage and the market condition.","Oscar Munoz","The main factor was that the Transcon part of that door-to-door business is what declined and it carries a very high RPU. The Eastern core part of that business remained reasonably robust just as it requires higher RPU, as does Transcon.","David Vernon \u2013 Bernstein","And would you expect that to continue throughout the year or is sort of like a temporary thing associated with maybe some of the service issues coming East West?","Oscar Munoz","I would expect right now for the third quarter at least for it to continue.","David Vernon \u2013 Bernstein","Okay. And then Fredrik maybe just a longer term question, as you think about the model you need to get to that mid 60s or the high 50s -- high 50s incremental margin, what kind of topline growth assumption do you kind of think about as a longer term sustainable level of growth for you guys?","Fredrik Eliasson","The guidance we've given is that going forward we think it's going to be a little bit more balanced between volume inflation plus pricing and productivity than perhaps it's been in the last decade.","We like to think that a large part of our business can grow faster in the economy as a whole because of opportunities and the secular trends that we are seeing, but more specific than that, I think it's really hard to beat because it really depends on individual years and what sectors are doing well, but clearly we feel that the volume environment is much more robust going forward than it's been in the last decade after having gone through obviously the housing collapse, the recession that we saw and now this energy transition that we've seen over the last few years.","So we think the volume environment is going to be much more constructive going forward than it's been in the past.","David Vernon \u2013 Bernstein","And then the pricing stuff will obviously be suffering a little bit on some of the fixed variable stuff with coal though, would that also kind of go forward in terms of yield price for the next year and in fact some for the topline growth rate that's reasonable.","Fredrik Eliasson","I mean that the fixed variable, we'll have to see. We obviously have cash in terms of how much the utilities can grow within this current rate structure.","So as we go through this year, we will see what the impact is next year, but clearly right now, it's a big negative, but as part of the way that we look at this and we think that's the right strategic move on our part to make sure that we incentivize additional volumes.","And as we go through next year, it might be a little bit different. That's where they cycle some of these large gains. So I don't think that's going to be as big of a drive next year as it was this year at least.","David Vernon \u2013 Bernstein","All right. Great. Thanks very much for the time guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from John Larkin from Stifel. Your line is open.","Michael Ward","Good morning, John.","John Larkin \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.","Hey. Good morning, gentlemen and thanks for taking my question. I had a question related to the surge in volume on the northern part of the network and how much of that was originating and terminating on CSX and how much of that is being delivered to you, or you are delivering to the Western railroads, where you\u2019ve had perhaps even more congestion promise, particularly the BNSF.","Clarence Gooden","John, this is Clarence. I would say that most of the surge that we had on the Northern part of the railroad was interline business that came, the biggest part of our surge in the north was driven by crude, by rail and by our coal business, our coal business particularly was much higher than what we had expected it to be, primarily as a result of the gas prices, as a result of the colder winter and as a result the great lakes themselves for the utility lake coal closing naturally or due to the weather and opening much later due to the weather.","John Larkin \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.","So is it safe to say that the recovery on service is at least partly a function of how soon Chicago cleans up its service act and how quickly some of the Western carriers return to normal service levels?","Oscar Munoz","John, its Oscar. No, I wouldn\u2019t describe it to anything. Remember there is a lot of component pieces and all of us are having difficulty across that interchange. I think the heavy degree of volume concentrated in one area is a problem for all of us.","So I think as we all collectively get our stuff together. I think that will all improve.","John Larkin \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.","Is there any possibility of a change in routing protocol to use perhaps other less congested hubs that could help us solve the problem?","Oscar Munoz","Absolutely and we are in active communication and conversations with almost every other carrier to do exactly that and we have some great options around that, that I think make sense both from a service perspective and also frankly economically as we see longer term growth coming through that same corridor.","John Larkin \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.","Got it. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Bascome Majors from Susquehanna. Your line is open.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Bascome.","Bascome Majors \u2013 Susquehanna","Good morning and thank for the time. We should see new draft safety regulations from Pensum moving inflammable liquids by rail in a few weeks here and they are talking about an operational restriction taking crude trains down to 30 miles per hour, can you talk a little bit about how that could impact your business how you are moving that commodity today and whether and how that could spill beyond crude oil if they do decide to go in that direction?","Michael Ward","Yeah, this is Michael. I think you are quite right. We've heard as well. We've not seen the proposals, nobody really has yet, but we have heard as you have that 30 miles an hour is one of the options are considering. We think that would be -- severely limit our ability to provide reliable freight service to our customers and to support the timely passengers add communal service.","So there is all kinds of corollary impacts of this and I would hope as we look at this with the federal government, we can show them the modeling of how disastrous that could be to the entire fluidity of the U.S. rail system as well as the adverse impact that will have as trucks deliver on to the highway system.","So our view is that it would be very bad, but our view is also that cooler heads will prevail when they see the facts behind it.","Bascome Majors \u2013 Susquehanna","All right, well thanks for that. And are there any other parts of this rule making that you are watching very closely that could potentially impact your business and whether operationally or from a risk management standpoint?","Michael Ward","Actually we are quite excited about the potential for the new car design as well as the retrofits to the existing cars and I know that is part of the proposed rule making.","As you know, as a router, we've done a number of things to improve our already very good safety records to make it even more safe and we think the next big movement to make it even better is for a stronger car or new builds as well as retrofit to existing cars.","Bascome Majors \u2013 Susquehanna","All right, well thanks for the time this morning.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Jeff Kauffman from Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff Kauffman \u2013 Buckingham","Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my question. Mike, it's really great to hear you talking about coal being up double-digits and it may continue for a while. I was just kind of curious if export coal didn\u2019t exist, give us a sense for kind of what's going on with the yield on the domestic product?","Clarence Gooden","Jeff, this is Clarence. If export coal didn\u2019t exist, what is going on with the yield on the domestic coal? Well, I don't think export coal has any direct impact at all on what the yield is on our domestic coal as it currently exists. Our yield is very positive on our domestic coal. It is -- actually it's improving in our domestic coal business that's coming along.","The fixed variable contracts and the nature of them have been proved very positive to us. They cover a good percentage of our contracts now, especially in our Southern utility markets. There is coal that we are now moving and hauling that we would not have moved in haul have we not had the fixed variable contracts with the caps and obviously to help control how much that moves if that's right that we are handling now that we would not have handled. I don't know if that helps or not.","Michael Ward","Let me try a little bit and so if we just look at our domestic portfolio Jeff, so if I had to say, in general are those rates heading up where the answer is yes. So on the two thirds it's not on its variable, those rates are moving up.","On the one third that is fixed variable, the base there is a minimum and a maximum, that base is moving up of where they are in that range can have a fairly significant impact on overall RPU and coal. So all that has an upper bias, but the fixed variable make it confusing where they are in that scale that's allowed in the contract.","Jeff Kauffman \u2013 Buckingham","That's exactly what I was looking for. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Group \u2013 Wolfe Research","Hey thanks. Good morning, guys. I had a couple few things on coal, one Clarence, do you have a view on coal yield sequentially from 2Q to 3Q they were pretty flat those quarters, a view there. Do you think that's one?","Next, do you think that the kind of that mid 30s export number for this year would you, you think that's a good bottom or do you think that can grow next year or do you see more risk to that and then just lastly, the seven million tons of coal that you guys have talked about that shutting next year? Is that number changing much this year meaning is that growing a lot with coal this year or is that not really seeing much movement?","Clarence Gooden","Well, it's going to reverse, its four million tons not seven and we don't see that number changing. It appears to be what it is and we think the other plants that remain open will burn at higher burn rates and it will be a non-event number essentially for us.","Number two was export rates for next year too early to tell. We'll revisit that in the fourth quarter\u2026","Michael Ward","As compared to volumes.","Clarence Gooden","Volumes, it's still too early to tell. We'll know more about that in the fourth quarter and your first question was what on the\u2026","Scott Group \u2013 Wolfe Research","Just clear yields sequentially from second quarter to third quarter. Should we think that they stay flat, I don't know if you made any additional pricing adjustments on the export side?","Clarence Gooden","Flat, you should expect them to be flat.","Scott Group \u2013 Wolfe Research","Okay. Great. And then just one other question Clarence, it wasn\u2019t so clear to me that some of the questions on pricing earlier, are you starting to or thinking about and during somewhat like a de-marketing phase to push pricing a little bit more aggressively even if it means giving up a little bit of volume?","Clarence Gooden","No, we're not de-marketing, but we are aggressively pricing our products.","Scott Group \u2013 Wolfe Research","Okay. Great. Thanks for the time guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Jason Seidl from Cowen. Your line is open.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Jason.","Jason Seidl \u2013 Cowen & Company","Good morning, guys. Real quickly, when you think about sort of the impacts of the service levels, obviously you talked about on the cost side, do you think you left any money on the table on the intermodal product in terms of your ability to take prices up, especially on the tighter curve market.","Michael Ward","Well, I tell our team that we are always leaving money on the table. So I mean I don't know what you want me to say, yes.","Jason Seidl \u2013 Cowen & Company","Okay. That's fair enough. And\u2026","Clarence Gooden","\u2026truck market changes, that we will respond to the marketplace.","Michael Ward","Absolutely.","Jason Seidl \u2013 Cowen & Company","Okay. That's what I want to hear. While I am thinking also about all the equipment that you are bringing on, obviously some of it's because service is down and some of it's because you are just getting more business. How much do you think you guys can start shedding in 2015 and assuming your service levels come back?","Michael Ward","In terms of really the locomotives, I think you are referring to predominantly?","Jason Seidl \u2013 Cowen & Company","Locomotives and even in terms of headcount, how should we start thinking about that because some of them seems like you're just trying to extend some people and put off their retirements a little bit.","Fredrik Eliasson","On the locomotive side for some reason if there is no need for those locomotives, the network fluidity comes back. We do have a fair amount of leases that we can turn back. So that's part of the safety levers so to speak. If the demand profile is not as strong as we currently think it is.","On the crews side, we're hiring, obviously for attrition, but also for growth and we always have the flexibility if we need to, to do for a little retention that something that we normally don't look at until unless that we think it's a longer more sustained more period of time that we don't need those crews because we do hire them and they are expensive too because you spend a fair amount of time and effort on them.","So you don't want to do that unnecessarily but we do have that ability if we are incorrect in our forecast that the growth will continue.","Jason Seidl \u2013 Cowen & Company","So Fredrik in terms of the total headcount for 2015, you would expect growth over 2014?","Fredrik Eliasson","I think that based on the current volume assumptions that we have, that continues to be robust. I think the answer is yes, I don't think it's going to be significant because I think the operating leverage is going to be especially as we get the network fluidity back, I think there is an opportunity to see great leverage there.","Jason Seidl \u2013 Cowen & Company","Well fantastic gentlemen, I appreciate the time as always.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Ben Hartford from Baird. Your line is open.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Ben.","Ben Hartford \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Hey, good morning, guys. Fred, I just wanted to clarify the comments that you have made about the third quarter 2013 EPS, you had said that the number that you were referring to was $0.45 from a year ago, correct?","Fredrik Eliasson","That's correct.","Ben Hartford \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Okay. Good, and not to beat this pricing discussion, but I understand that you guys look at the spread between RCAF and price, but you are entering a bit of a unprecedented period with regard to pricing and the truck load rate growth contractual rate growth is accelerating and faster than what you guys are realizing within the merchandize and the intermodal product first time in at least a cycle.","And is it incorrect to look at core contractual truck load rates as setting the tone for both the intermodal business and even some of the merchandize business when you do set and re-price and an annualized basis.","So to the extent the truck load pricing growth continues to be above what you are seeing within those core segments, certainly above that 2.5% number that you saw this quarter that there can be upside or that you can't price to market you are not beholding to some sort of fixed spread internally between RCAF and what you feel like that the market can digest, correct?","Fredrik Eliasson","That's correct Ben. I think it's absolutely the right way to look at.","Ben Hartford \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Okay. Good. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Cherilyn Radbourne from TD Securities. Your line is open.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Cherilyn.","Cherilyn Radbourne \u2013 TD Securities","Thanks very much and good morning. I am just going to ask one and that relates to international intermodal, which for me was probably the biggest surprise in terms of the volume performance for you and for the industry in the quarter because it's been pretty tepid for a while.","So I just wondered if you could give some color on how much of the growth you think was catch-up from Q1, how much was a pull forward related to the labor contract expiry on the West Coast and how much you think was organic?","Clarence Gooden","Cherilyn, this is Clarence. I think it's difficult to segment into those three areas, but I would tell you this. Our customers told us that they shipped earlier this year significantly earlier in anticipation of ILWU work stoppages on the West Coast.","So all the ships out of Asia were fully profiled coming to the West Coast and via the canal in order to avoid that. So that certainly had an impact. There were some impact due to winter weather and we expect to see that international traffic in the low single digits going forward.","Cherilyn Radbourne \u2013 TD Securities","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you, Clarence. That's it for me.","","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Walter Spracklin from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Walter.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. This is [indiscernible] for Walter. I was just hoping to get some more color on the expansion of crude capabilities across your network. You saw some fairly strong growth and I was wondering where you see that business going forward and the timing of that coming online.","Clarence Gooden","Where do we see crude expansions? Is that's your question?","Unidentified Analyst","Yes.","Clarence Gooden","Well obviously there is expansions going all along the East Coast as we speak. They are predominantly in the Philadelphia area. Some are in the New Jersey areas where we are seeing the current expansions. We have two customers that are looking at expanding in New Jersey area rather than for obvious reason, so I won't mention their names, but that's where you are seeing the expansions occur.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then this is all coming on your network at what sort of volume opportunity do you see from these engines?","Clarence Gooden","Well, right now we are averaging around for 2014 plus or minus 20 trains per week. We also could see some slight increase in that as we go forward. There is a finite capacity, number, both as you know from what the Bakken can produce and from what the refiners can consume.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thanks very much for your time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Justin Long from Stephens. Your line is open.","Michael Ward","Good morning, Justin.","Justin Long - Stephens","Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to clarify one thing quickly. Could you talk about the congestion related cost that you are assuming in your guidance for the back half of the year? Are you assuming it may stay pretty consistent with what we saw in the second quarter?","Fredrik Eliasson","Yes, well we said as a fair remark was that until we see meaningful improvement in the network fluidity and velocity, it is reasonable to assume that that run rate of about $10 million or so a period of $30 million a quarter is the right place to think about it.","Justin Long - Stephens","And you are not assuming that that fluidity improves until 2015?","Fredrik Eliasson","No, I am not saying that. I am just saying right now from what we're seeing, we're seeing if it doesn\u2019t improve, it's the right place to be in terms of thinking about what the incremental cost will be.","If we see meaningful improvement here during the summer months, which is a possibility that that demand is a little bit lower during the summer as we go through the period here until Labor Day, there is an opportunity that we can see meaningful improvement and the cost can come down, but that's yet to be seen.","Justin Long - Stephens","Okay. Fair enough. That's helpful and as a second question, I was wondering if you could talk about what you are seeing in the intermodal pricing environment? Would you say that core pricing in intermodal is pretty close to that 2.6% average between merchandizing intermodal or is it a little bit more competitive and tracking below that level?","Fredrik Eliasson","I think you'll see intermodal is a little bit more competitive and tracking a little lower than that level that's in there right now.","Justin Long - Stephens","Okay. Great. I know it's been a long call. I'll leave it at that. Thanks for the time.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question or comment comes from Cleo Zagrean from Macquarie Capital. Your line is open.","Michael Ward","Good morning.","Cleo Zagrean \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Good morning and thank you. I have to follow-up on the prior question and some before it in terms of intermodal pricing? Can you help us with a little more detail on the split between door to door and what you would call your main business and the transfer price there and where do you see that going forward?","Clarence Gooden","You were fading on me there. The intermodal pricing on the domestic door to door and where do we see that going?","Cleo Zagrean \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Why did the share of door to door within your -- with your entire intermodal business, how come that had a significant -- such a significant impact on price or if you break up what you would call core intermodal pricing trends versus door to door?","Clarence Gooden","It's relatively small percent of door to door is of our overall pricing if that's what your question is.","Cleo Zagrean \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Okay. So therefore we can infer that intermodal pricing across businesses was relatively weak? In other words, the decline was broad based.","Clarence Gooden","No, I wouldn\u2019t infer that at all. I would say that our intermodal pricing was somewhere in the range of around 2% little bit above that.","Cleo Zagrean \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Okay. The second question I had was in terms of the impact of business mix on margins as opposed to price, can you help us understand how mix you are playing to your aspiration to get continued strong incremental margins in that 50% range. Thank you.","Clarence Gooden","Well, the margin mix continues in terms of favoring more intermodal, but because of the work that we've done over the last few years to improve the profitability of that business segment, it is now at par with the rest of our merchandize business.","This quarter we saw an increase in some of our coal business, which is a welcome sign. So that's certainly helpful too and so as we think about the future and the guidance we have in place, I think we have the right mix thoughts there and I think we are in all our businesses profitable and we would like to grow all our business as much as we possibly can going forward.","So we are somewhat indifferent to the mix that we are seeing.","Cleo Zagrean \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Thank you very much. Really appreciate it.","Michael Ward","Well everyone, thank you for your attention. We'll see you next quarter.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect your line."]}}
